Daniel Jones, 29, poured petrol through the letterbox of a home and set it alight in an attempt to destroy CCTV footage of a burglary he had committed earlier at a nearby house. The blaze in Stanley, West Yorkshire, killed Andrew Broadhead, 42, and his daughter Kiera after they were unable to escape. Broadhead’s wife, Sara, and his 13-year-old daughter, Mia, were rescued by neighbours. At Leeds crown court Mr Justice Morris sentenced Jones to 20 years in prison for double manslaughter and told the killer he was guilty of “seriously reckless conduct” that had caused “enormous and enduring pain and suffering” to the family. Jones was found guilty of two counts of manslaughter and one of burglary. He consistently denied committing the offences and was said by the judge to have shown no remorse for his actions. There were emotional scenes in court on Thursday when Mia Broadhead, who was 12 when her father and sister died in the fire on 19 October last year, gave tearful testimony about the disaster. The teenager described her father as “the world’s greatest superhero” and her sister Kiera as “the world’s brightest star”. She wiped away tears as she told the packed courtroom: “My daddy was the world’s greatest superhero and he was my hero. I am thankful for his happiness, kindness and his love for everyone – the way he was positive and how he always lifted everybody’s spirits.” Mia said of Kiera: “My sissy was the world’s brightest star and nobody will dull her sparkle. I am thankful for the eight years we had with her – for her kindness, her funniness, her caring for one another and her humour. She didn’t deserve this, neither of them did.” After she had finished reading out her statement, Mia returned to the public gallery where she was hugged by her mother, Sara, who also read out a personal impact statement to the judge. Jones, who sat in the dock wearing a light grey suit and was surrounded by prison officers, stared straight forward as the statements were read. The judge had to give special permission for Mia to be in the courtroom, as the usual age limit is 14 in the crown court. The trial heard how Jones had a gambling addiction and owed substantial amounts of money to different people, and was being pressed for money to support his own children. He burgled his friend’s house, which was opposite the Broadhead’s home, and on the 15 October last year stole a safe containing £850 and an ounce of the Class B drug ketamine. The following day Jones’s friend discovered he had been burgled and told Jones that the culprit might have been caught on the Broadheads’ CCTV camera, which was on the front of their house. Jones decided to destroy that footage. He had been told that the Broadheads were away on holiday and would not be back for a few days. Tragically, that turned out to be wrong. The family had returned from holiday on 18 October and were asleep when Jones, carrying a can of petrol, approached their front door at 4.17am. The judge said there was a “burst of fire, which took hold immediately” as smoke and flames spread rapidly through the house. The court heard how the parents scrambled desperately to save their children. Sara and Mia escaped through Mia’s bedroom window with the help of neighbours, jurors were told, but Andrew and Kiera were overcome with smoke and pronounced dead at the scene. The court was told that Jones repeatedly denied setting fire to the house or committing the earlier burglary, and concocted a set of lies to try to throw detectives off the case. After the sentencing, Jonathan Sharp, from the Crown Prosecution Service, said: “This was an appalling crime, and the consequences have caused Mr Broadhead’s surviving family unimaginable suffering. “The police conducted a wide-ranging investigation. We were able to present CCTV to the court which showed Jones buying petrol far from his home address, then arriving at the Broadhead’s home and setting fire to it. Tracker evidence from his van was found to confirm his movements that night, and his lies to the police strengthened the case against him. “Having heard all the evidence, the jury convicted Jones. I hope the convictions are of some comfort to the Broadhead family and our thoughts remain with them.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2017/nov/09/two-of-holyroods-ruling-committee-resign-to-make-way-for-women","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-09T21:14:52Z","webTitle":"Two of Holyrood's ruling committee resign to make way for women","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/nov/09/two-of-holyroods-ruling-committee-resign-to-make-way-for-women","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2017/nov/09/two-of-holyroods-ruling-committee-resign-to-make-way-for-women","fields":{"headline":"Two of Holyrood's ruling committee resign to make way for women","bodyText":"Two members of the committee that runs the Scottish parliament have stepped down to make way for female representatives, after women from across the Holyrood chamber demanded action at a session to discuss how the parliament deals with sexual harassment. The SNP’s Gordon Macdonald resigned from the Scottish parliamentary corporate body, with the party confirming that his place would be filled be a woman, and the Scottish Greens MSP Andy Wightman announced he would step down as soon as Holyrood had agreed to a mechanism for more gender-balanced appointments. The moves followed an intense Holyrood session of questions to the all-male SPCB, the group of MSPs that oversees the running of Holyrood, that was entirely taken up by calls for action to tackle harassment. The interventions came predominantly from members elected last year, including the SNP’s Gillian Martin and Scottish Labour’s Monica Lennon, who revealed last weekend how senior party figures had joked about an incident where a powerful official assaulted her in front of colleagues. The informal cross-party coalition, which called for an independent audit of reporting procedures, a new code of conduct and even the resignations of all the men on the corporate body itself, was coordinated by Martin and former Scottish Labour leader Kezia Dugdale. The questioning reflected a simmering anger and a profound concern about how current investigations are being conducted, in particular among the new generation of female MSPs. As in Westminster, Holyrood has been hit by allegations of sexual harassment and unacceptable conduct. Scotland’s minister for childcare and early years, Mark McDonald, resigned on Saturday after apologising “unreservedly” for sending an unspecified number of “inappropriate” messages. On Thursday at first minister’s questions, Nicola Sturgeon was questioned about his departure. Scottish Labour’s Jackie Bailey asked why the Aberdeenshire politician had resigned as a minister but remained an MSP. Sturgeon said: “Let me be clear that that behaviour was about language not physical conduct. While I think it justified the step Mark McDonald took, let me also make it clear it was not language that came in any way close to something that required to be referred to the police.” She explained that she was in a difficult position, because offering any further detail in public would compromise the privacy of his accuser. “Women possibly will be discouraged from coming forward if they think that the moment they do every aspect of what they are raising as a concern will be all over the media,” she said. One of Scotland’s most prominent women’s organisations has raised concerns that the first minister was downplaying the accusations. Sturgeon suggested on Wednesday that McDonald had done the right thing but that “some others may well have thought [his behaviour] was not serious enough to resign”. Alys Mumford, from the feminist lobbying organisation Engender, said: “At a time when a spotlight is rightly being shone on harassment in politics, we were surprised that the first minister chose to comment in this way. While we don’t know details of the specific complaint, to suggest that some people may not have regarded his resignation as necessary downplays the accusations against him. Women who experience harassment already feel like their concerns may be disbelieved ... and so it is vital that a clear message is sent to women that they will be taken seriously should they make a complaint.” Dugdale said she believed that the culture around sexual harassment in Holyrood had worsened since the last Holyrood election in 2016. “I think it’s beyond doubt that in the 2016 intake, the men are older and the women younger, which has changed the dynamic because what is considered acceptable in language and conduct is very different between these generations.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2017/nov/09/henry-slade-opportunity-england-argentina-autumn-internationals","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-09T22:00:01Z","webTitle":"Henry Slade given opportunity to challenge for England No12 shirt","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/nov/09/henry-slade-opportunity-england-argentina-autumn-internationals","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/nov/09/henry-slade-opportunity-england-argentina-autumn-internationals","fields":{"headline":"Henry Slade given opportunity to challenge for England No12 shirt","bodyText":"As Eddie Jones explained his England midfield selection for the Argentina Test there were echoes of the Exeter director of rugby, Rob Baxter, from a few seasons ago. When someone looks, plays and behaves like a top player, even if he is not the established first choice, Baxter reckons international coaches should trust their own eyes. Jones, in naming Henry Slade at 12 against the Pumas on Saturday, has done precisely that. It is possible for even the most experienced head coaches to lose sight of what really matters in the blizzard of wellness stats, hydration readings and assorted other supposedly essential facts they are now buried beneath on a daily basis. Jones complained to his squad in their morning meeting that he is starting to feel like the team’s data analyst but he scarcely needed a spreadsheet to identify the most enticing replacement for the rested Owen Farrell. Slade is not the biggest, heaviest, quickest or the most prolific try-scorer to play centre for England but his work on the training field and domestic form for the Chiefs has ultimately trumped all else. As Jones acknowledged, the 24-year-old has “got everything there is … he’s got nice feet, good balance, a good head on him, some speed, courage.” Which begs the obvious question: why has he never started for England at inside-centre before? Jones, it turns out, has been pondering the same thing ever since Slade performed so well in England’s World Cup warmup Test against France at Twickenham in 2015 that he propelled Sam Burgess, his midfield partner that day, into Stuart Lancaster’s final squad. “I remember seeing this kid who had feet, nice balance and speed,” Jones said. “Then I didn’t see him again. I thought he’d been taken somewhere.” Admittedly Slade, by his own admission, took a while to shake off the mental and physical after-effects of the horrible lower leg fracture he suffered at Wasps in December 2015 but until this summer’s tour to Argentina he had not started a match for his country since the Uruguay pool game in Manchester that concluded Lancaster’s tenure. Despite the Chiefs’ walking off with last year’s Premiership title, Jones’s niggling doubt was the Devonian’s work rate off the ball, regardless of his priceless, rare gift of time on it. “Sometimes those really talented kids don’t understand how you have to work hard, to change that talent into consistent performance,” Jones said. “He’s really learned that.” All it took, in the end, was one specific measurement to back up Jones’s intensifying gut feeling. “One of the most important stats we collect is on high-speed running. Imagine we kick the ball and you have to sprint after that ball. Then the ball goes back over your head and you’ve got to sprint back. He was the lowest in our team 12 months ago. On Tuesday he was the highest. He’s learned he has to do the small things well and he’s done that brilliantly.” It did no harm that Slade started both wins against the Pumas. Coincidence or not, England have also won all seven of his Tests. The next task is to make it impossible for Jones to drop him, regardless of who may be available to face Australia, and his new midfield partner, Jonathan Joseph, certainly sounds excited. “I’m really looking forward to playing with him,” said the Bath centre. “Something special could work there. His distribution, his ability to see space … it’s what outside-backs thrive off.” If it does work, with George Ford pulling the strings and Elliot Daly and Anthony Watson creating havoc out wide, Jones will have some tricky calls to make. He is hardly going to omit Farrell but the Saracen feels happiest at 10, which would mean dropping Ford to the bench. And what about Ben Te’o, Manu Tuilagi, Alex Lozowski and Piers Francis, to mention just four other candidates for the No12 jersey? Even Slade would be unwise to assume anything yet. “This is Sladey’s opportunity to show he can be a third choice at 12 – or one of the choices at 12,” said Jones, reserving the right to keep his options open. What Jones describes as a “sparring match” in the buildup to the “heavyweight contests in the 2019 World Cup” will certainly be a significant one for south Devon with the Teignmouth-reared Sam Simmonds set to win his first cap off the bench after the unlucky Tom Curry damaged a wrist in training. Above all else, however, Jones wants his pack to come snorting out of the autumn blocks – “That’s where the game is won or lost … if you get good quality ball then the little guys can run with it” – and not to underestimate Argentina. “They know if they beat England at Twickenham then their whole season turns around. They’ll go back to Buenos Aires, sit on the beach as heroes and everyone will want to buy them a beer and a steak,” he said. England, having defeated the Pumas three times this year, want their visitors to return home empty-handed once again."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2017/nov/12/dirty-john-converging-cultures-review-podcasts","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-12T07:00:47Z","webTitle":"The week in radio and podcasts: Dirty John; Converging Cultures","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/nov/12/dirty-john-converging-cultures-review-podcasts","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2017/nov/12/dirty-john-converging-cultures-review-podcasts","fields":{"headline":"The week in radio and podcasts: Dirty John; Converging Cultures","bodyText":"Dirty John | wondery.com Converging Cultures | littleatoms.com Put down your surveillance equipment, true-crime fans, I have an interesting new podcast for you. Dirty John is a six-part series made by the Los Angeles Times and Wondery. Pulitzer-nominated investigative reporter Christopher Goffard talks us through the romance of Debra and John. In 2014, Debra Newell, an attractive fiftysomething divorcee, joins match.com in search of true love. She finds it in the form of John Meehan, a good-looking anaesthetist who is very keen, very soon. Still, so is Newell, and all is well. Until her children meet him… What follows is an intriguing, in-depth picture of the strangest of relationships. Several times during this podcast, I found myself shouting inwardly, so exasperated was I with I-still-love-him-though Newell. Do you know the phrase “feelings aren’t facts”? I kept thinking of it as I listened. Faced with an array of damning details (I’m not going to reveal them, but let’s say that Dirty John’s past didn’t make for relaxing bedtime reading), Newell thought: “Oh, but he’s so nice to me, and he has an explanation for everything, so it’s all going to be just dandy… ” Unsurprisingly, it wasn’t. One policeman recalls John as a “devil-tongued flim-flam artist”, an almost Raymond Chandler-like description. Dirty John unfolds slowly, but with an awful feeling of inevitability. Like the best novels, you sense where you’re going before you get there. But this isn’t a story. It’s real. We hear from Newell and her children; we hear from Meehan’s old friends; we even hear his voice, on phone recordings made by his ex-wife. The podcast was serialised in the LA Times, like a Dickens story; it’s also an online “project”, which means you get photographs, too. The project is very noir (the photos are in black and white, the lettering is like that used for LA Confidential), and it gives you that uneasy feeling of queasy exploitation that only true crime can engender. Having said all that, if you listen to the podcast, as I did, sans extras, you won’t be disappointed. To me, it’s less film noir and more cautionary tale. Feelings aren’t facts. Good looks don’t cancel out bad deeds. Another new series, Converging Cultures, started last week. From the makers of Little Atoms, the long-running ideas and culture podcast, Converging Cultures takes the notion that science and art operate as entirely separate entities and explodes it. Broadcast on online digital station NTS Radio, the first episode concerns electricity and Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein; the second, out next week, is about the unconscious and – oddly – also mentions anaesthetists. “The three As of modern medicine,” says one expert, “are antibiotics, anaesthesia and adhesive tape”. Interesting stuff."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"money/2017/nov/11/couple-scammed-57000-homesless-bank-transfer-fraud","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-11T07:00:19Z","webTitle":"Couple scammed out of £57,000 fear being homeless at Christmas","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2017/nov/11/couple-scammed-57000-homesless-bank-transfer-fraud","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2017/nov/11/couple-scammed-57000-homesless-bank-transfer-fraud","fields":{"headline":"Couple scammed out of £57,000 fear being homeless at Christmas","bodyText":"A couple in the process of buying a house fear they could be left homeless over Christmas after being tricked into transferring almost £60,000 to fraudsters posing as their conveyancing solicitor. James and Emily (not their real names) are the latest people to fall victim to a bank transfer scam – one of Britain’s fastest-growing crimes. Emily, who is six-months pregnant with the couple’s second child, says they are supposed to be completing on 21 December, but are now desperately worried this could be jeopardised if they don’t manage to recover the missing cash. “I don’t even want to think about the future – we are living a nightmare,” says Emily. She and her husband have a toddler and live and work in London. In what is now becoming a depressingly familiar scenario, fraudsters hacked into emails sent between the couple, their solicitor and their mortgage broker. As a result, their £137,500 deposit was sent to a bank account operated by a fraudster. A good chunk of this was later recovered, but the remaining £57,388 was withdrawn before the scam was detected and is still missing. Guardian Money has featured a number of these cases. They usually involve people who have employed a legitimate solicitor/builder/accountant etc, with whom they are in email correspondence. Typically, the victim receives a request for payment via email, which doesn’t arouse suspicion because they were expecting it. It usually looks authentic and is for the correct amount – but behind the scenes the email account of either the victim or the business has been hacked, and the bank account number and sort code are the crook’s. Ironically, this case coincided with the news that, in future, some people who are tricked into transferring money may be eligible for compensation. Banks typically refuse to reimburse victims of bank transfer scams, but the Payment Systems Regulator (PSR) is proposing a scheme which would see customers refunded “in certain circumstances”. It will depend on whether the relevant bank or company had met required standards, and the victim taken enough care in protecting themselves. However, any such scheme would be too late to help James and Emily. On 14 August, James visited a London Barclays branch in order to send a Chaps payment of £137,500 to their solicitor. He was assisted by branch staff. Emily says the process took some time because of security checks, and adds that Barclays didn’t flag up the fact that the bank account details did not match the solicitor’s account information used to make a previous payment. It wasn’t until 22 August when they contacted their solicitor for an update that they realised they had been scammed. They reported the fraud to Barclays. The following day, James visited the Royal Bank of Scotland branch in Levenshulme, Manchester, where the account that received their cash was held, but was told it had been frozen. Barclays eventually told the couple that it had “managed to recall £80,111.64” of their cash. As ever in these cases it is difficult, if not impossible, to establish whose email account was “the weak link in the chain”: the couple’s, the solicitor’s or the broker’s. James and Emily paid for a report from a forensic computer analyst, which stated that emails had been “hijacked” through the use of “reply-to” headers, which would cause an email to appear to come from a legitimate source, but when “reply” was hit it would be sent to a different address. It also said a number of email domains were used to perpetrate the fraud, including one designed to look very similar to that of the solicitor. The couple say it is now almost three months since the fraud, adding: “The criminals seem to get away with anything, and we have absolutely no support from the institutions technically supposed to help and protect us.” This week they finally heard that the case was being transferred to Manchester police, who would be investigating. The couple claim apparent errors and delays by their bank may have made their situation worse – the bank rejects this. While the couple reported the scam to Barclays on 22 August, an internal document, seen by Money, states that the following day an “indemnity request” to claim the remaining funds was sent to the wrong bank – Lloyds – instead of RBS. And a letter from RBS states that it did not receive the indemnity request until 4 September, and that when it arrived it was in the “incorrect format,” so a further request was made to Barclays. The bank responded on 13 September with the correct details, “so the remaining funds were sent directly to Barclays”. The latter told Money that on 17 August RBS got in touch saying there was “an issue with the name on their account”, and the remaining funds had been removed from the beneficiary account. On 23 August the indemnity was issued to claim this money. A spokesman adds: “While this was initially rejected by RBS, and a corrected version sent on 13 September, the delay in the indemnity being issued would not have led to RBS releasing any further funds. The remaining funds recovered of £80,111.64 was as captured by RBS on 17 August – five days prior to being alerted by the customers on 22 August.” He added: “The notes referring to an indemnity being issued to Lloyds is an incorrect statement. Both indemnities were correctly issued to RBS.” Barclays says it “is doing more than any other bank to inform people how to protect themselves from fraud”, adding: “In this instance some of the funds had been withdrawn over a number of days prior to the suspicious activity being detected by the receiving bank.” RBS says: “In this instance we were able to recover some, but unfortunately not all, of the funds lost by the time that we were informed of the payment. We encourage everyone to be extremely vigilant when managing payments and always check directly with the intended recipient.” This article was amended on 23 June 2020 to remove some personal information."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"music/2017/jun/15/gaby-hernandez-spirit-reflection-review-mr-bongo","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2017-06-15T17:30:46Z","webTitle":"Gaby Hernandez: Spirit Reflection review – weird and wonderful Brazilian grooves","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/jun/15/gaby-hernandez-spirit-reflection-review-mr-bongo","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2017/jun/15/gaby-hernandez-spirit-reflection-review-mr-bongo","fields":{"headline":"Gaby Hernandez: Spirit Reflection review – weird and wonderful Brazilian grooves","bodyText":"She’s a Chilean-American from Los Angeles who sings in English and Spanish, but Gaby Hernandez’s electro-acoustic creations are heavily informed by the weirdest and most wonderful areas of Brazilian music, from bossa nova to funk carioca.

Blue Pool Corner, Gower This cylindrical tub, beyond the north end of the Rhossili sands, is very deep and has mauve water. Set in honey-coloured rock, there are various levels from which you can jump. A long, wild beach stretches beyond, ending in a set of sea arches and ancient caves said to contain gold doubloons from a Portuguese wreck. Also, seek out the remains of the chapel on nearby Burry Holmes island. Seacombe, Purbeck, Dorset The remains of 18th-century quarries dominate the undercliffs of this area. The stone was used to build some of the most famous squares of Georgian London but now only the ammonite-encrusted sea ledges remain where cargo was once loaded onto waiting boats. At Seacombe, these create golden lagoons and perfect sunbathing platforms, with different tiers for jumping and diving, and areas of deep water for snorkelling among the sun beams.

The pub, restaurant and rooms have undergone a recent renovation and it’s all run on 100% renewable energy. There’s plenty of real ale on offer and the menu features lots of fish and seafood from the area. Overnight accommodation options include a nine-person bunkhouse. • glenuig.com Dyffryn Arms, Pembrokeshire The Gwaun valley in northern Pembrokeshire, formed by meltwaters from the last ice age, is an enchanting place of dense ancient woodland and water meadows, ripe with legend and age-old traditions (locals celebrate New Year on 13 January, following the old Julian calendar). One pub that has stood the test of time is the Dyffryn Arms in Pontfaen village. Better known as Bessie’s Pub, and essentially a front room with a few chairs and a dartboard, it’s been in the same family since 1840 – step inside and you could be back in the 1920s. Landlady Bessie has run the place for over 45 years and can still be found serving draft Bass from a jug through a hatch (with a bit of help from son Gwyn and granddaughter Nerys). No frills, just proper beer and good conversation. • 01348 881305, no website Lion Inn, North Yorkshire It made headlines in 2010 when seven people were snowed in for nine days, and the Lion, perched 1,325ft above sea level on Blakey Ridge (the highest point of the North York Moors national park), is certainly remote. The grouse moors offer great windswept romps, with beautiful views over Rosedale and Farndale. Find shelter in the welcoming pub, built by monks in the 16th century. Thick stone walls, low-beamed ceilings and open fires create a cosy atmosphere, and there are candlelit dining rooms as well as 13 bedrooms for those who want to linger. • lionblakey.co.uk Moorcock Inn, Cumbria With wild walks aplenty on the doorstep, this isolated tavern at the tip of Wensleydale is often alive with hikers refuelling after a hard day on the hills. It’s close to Garsdale station, but there’s nothing else for miles around – just views of some of England’s prettiest countryside. There are comfy sofas by the fire for chilly weather and a lovely beer garden if the sun’s out. Real ale tops the bill (though there are over 50 malt whiskies on offer) and there’s good traditional pub grub in the bar, as well as more refined fare in the restaurant, with a focus on local (meat from Brown’s in Kirkby Stephen, cheeses from Wensleydale Creamery) produce. The rooms are popular with walkers on multi-day trails across the Pennines. • moorcockinn.com Locks Inn, Norfolk Hidden away from the rest of the world on the Norfolk side of the river Waveney, it’s a bit of an adventure to get to the Locks Inn. Come by boat (there’s free overnight mooring) or via tiny roads and a footpath across the water. Dating from the 1560s, it was originally a mill-keeper’s cottage and first granted a public house licence in the 17th century. The vibe is laid-back, the local ale good and storytelling and live music regularly bring the place to life. Despite the remote location, it’s popular with walkers, birdwatchers and boaters, so it can get busy in summer. Good, reasonably priced food (curry every Friday night) adds to the appeal. • geldestonlocks.co.uk Poltimore Arms, Devon This lovely ivy-clad Exmoor pub, which dates in part from the 13th century, is surrounded by great wildnerness walks. It’s so remote there’s no mains electricity, but woodburners and low-beamed ceilings keep it cosy, the staff are friendly and the menu’s full of tasty homemade fare – they’ll even open for full breakfast on request – and there’s a focus on real ale. There’s a cute beer garden, a little shop for essentials and a tiny gallery showcasing local artists too. Landlord Steve is quite a character and impromptu music nights are common. Keep an eye out for the (friendly) ghost. • poltimorearms.co.uk Rachel Dixon ACCOMMODATION Kudhva, Cornwall Those who enjoy a few mod cons may appreciate this new wild campsite in an old quarry near Tintagel, a mile from the beach at Trebarwith Strand.

Laks, who was deported from Paris and made himself indispensable as conductor of the camp orchestra, may have survived thanks to his ability, but music itself was, he says, no help to him or anyone else in that place. This collection of his chamber music – all claimed as premiere recordings, and sparkily played by the ARC Ensemble – speaks of musical development thwarted by an experience that only the inward-looking Passacaille of 1945 hints at. The 1927 Sonatina for solo piano, combining Chopin-like expansiveness with a dark-tinged French soundworld, is intriguing, but for all their skill, piquancy and irresistibly jazzy rhythms, the pieces from the 1960s – the String Quartet No 4, the Concertino, Divertimento and Quintet – look resolutely backwards."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"stage/2017/jun/19/permanent-sunshine-a-new-play-by-al-kennedy-brexit-shorts","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2017-06-19T13:10:44Z","webTitle":"Permanent Sunshine, a new play by AL Kennedy – read the script","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/jun/19/permanent-sunshine-a-new-play-by-al-kennedy-brexit-shorts","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2017/jun/19/permanent-sunshine-a-new-play-by-al-kennedy-brexit-shorts","fields":{"headline":"Permanent Sunshine, a new play by AL Kennedy – read the script","bodyText":"Ext. night: a suitably grubby alley near George Square, Glasgow.

Summer brings E3 and its associated press conferences with the biggest names in publishing and development telling us what games and consoles to expect in the coming year. For the most part, audiences are shown cinematic trailer after cinematic trailer of grizzled white men brandishing guns on missions they’ve “just gotta take alone” introduced by white dudes in a blazer/T-shirt/jeans/trainers combo. Some shows manage to do better than others in offering audiences diverse games, and diverse speakers. Last year, we looked at how things stacked up in our diversity report. This year, we’re back to see if things have improved across EA, Microsoft, Bethesda, Ubisoft, and Sony. EA The event: EA kicked off its event with a Madden NFL themed marching band and ended it with marching Stormtroopers, which neatly sets the tone for the company behind several incredibly popular sports games and shooters. We had balls, guns, cars, and even a quick trip to (and then out of) prison. Oh, and mere seconds of BioWare’s new IP Anthem, which was given more time over on Microsoft’s stage. Player character diversity: Madden NFL 18 gets a story mode called The Longshot, like FIFA 17’s The Journey, and similarly stars a black man: Devin Wade. FIFA 17’s Alex Hunter is back for Fifa 18 too. The Battlefield 1 expansion, In the Name of the Tsar, features a Women’s Battalion of Death (apparently there were several). Need for Speed Payback lets women take the wheel, Phasma is heading to Star Wars Battlefront II, and BioWare’s Anthem will undoubtedly offer gender options for the protagonist. There are a good few female characters on show here, but no games that don’t also offer male options. Cooperative prison break game A Way Out, from the creators of Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons, looks interesting, but is also the story of two white guys; the woman of colour in the trailer appears to be an NPC. Speaker diversity: No Amy Hennig, no Jade Raymond. EA’s stage was dominated by white men. Women only really showed up in videos, often without speaking. Until the bulk of the conference was over, that is, and it was time to focus on Star Wars Battlefront II. On marched the Stormtroopers, led by Janina Gavankar – a woman of colour who plays Commander Iden Versio in the game – in an absolutely incredible custom made dress. And then she went to play the game, while YouTuber iJustine (and some men) commentated. Bechdel test: Not only did Janina Gavankar have the most incredible stage presence of the entirety of E3, she also got to introduce iJustine, which is almost like a conversation between two women. Other positives: EA did spare some time to highlight its Play to Give campaign, which donated $1 million to charities including HeForShe and two anti-bullying charities. Compared to last year: Two women on stage is at least an improvement on last year’s conference, and about half the games on show let you play as a woman, though that’s less impressive when you remember that every single one of them lets you play as a man. Diversity rating: 3/5 Microsoft The event: Microsoft’s conference was all about the Xbox One X and a whole bunch of numbers to convince you it’s worth $499. The constant repetition of the phrase “true 4K” and the word “exclusive” was at least softened by the charming notion of a 4K update and “Super Duper Graphics Pack” for Minecraft. Microsoft showed dozens of games: on the high end, at least one where you can only play as a woman; and on the low end, one from a former Gamergate sympathiser. Player character diversity: While a fair few of the games Microsoft showed off force you to play as a man, quite a few also offer the option to play as a woman: Forza Motorsport 7, PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds, State of Decay 2, Black Desert Online, Code Vein, Sea of Thieves, Crackdown 3, and maybe the stylistic Ashen. The extended Anthem demo starred a female character, though knowing BioWare, players will probably also be able to choose a man. However, Microsoft does fairly well this year by offering multiple (well, two) games with female-only leads: Tacoma and Life is Strange: Before the Storm. Speaker diversity: Microsoft’s stage was similarly dominated by white men, but at least their director of software engineering is Kareem Choudhry. Professional race car drivers Shannon McIntosh and Verena Mei joined them on stage, as did the charismatic Mojang brand director Lydia Winters in a fantastic shirt. Bechdel Test: Shannon McIntosh and Verena Mei spoke one after the other, which is also almost like a conversation! And the Life is Strange: Before the Storm trailer featured Chloe speaking (one word) to Rachel. Compared to last year: Female race car drivers win Microsoft some points here, and so does a game about teenage girls. It’s a slight improvement on last year. Diversity rating: 3.5/5 Bethesda The event: This year’s show from Bethesda was a bit lacklustre, featuring an animated trip to “Bethesdaland”, rather than a conference jam-packed with speakers and presenters. There was a hard push on the past year’s titles, like Doom, Dishonored 2 and Prey, as well as a quick shoutout to Fallout Shelter and Fallout 4. The standout announcements fall to a new chapter for “whalepunk” Dishonored 2, where players will hunt down the otherworldly antagonist known only as The Outsider, and a return to iD Software revivals in Wolfenstein 2. The Evil Within 2, a sequel to the 2014 game from Resident Evil creator Shinji Mikami looks interesting, if a bit bleak, sticking to this year’s fairly dystopian theme all around. Whether you’re shooting Nazis in an alternate 1950s America in Wolfenstein, or sneaking around for a low-chaos run in Dishonored’s DLC, Bethesda stuck to safe IP, violence, and VR reboots. Player character diversity: Death of the Outsider features Billie Lurk, the badass grizzled boat captain from Dishonored 2, pairing up with gruff and tough assassin Daud. It’s refreshing to see a woman of colour starring a title, though she has to share the spotlight with a white dude. Aside from Lurk, there don’t seem to be any diverse player characters coming out of Bethesda this year. Wolfenstein 2 has some interesting women around the table in the war room, but it doesn’t look like you’ll be able to play as any of them. Speaker diversity: Pete Hines was the only speaker Bethesda thought to bring, leaving most of the focus to the games. Bechdel test: Without even a single woman onstage, Bethesda’s conference failed the Bechdel test. Despite the trailer for Wolfenstein II showing us two women in the same frame, they don’t talk to each other at all. Compared to last year: When the only woman in sight last year was Emily Kaldwin, showing up to five women this year (two of them women of colour) is a step up for the publisher. In comparison to the other shows this year, Bethesda still leaves much to be desired. Diversity rating: 2/5 Ubisoft The event: Ubisoft’s conference was impacted by the lack of Aisha Tyler, who’s hosted the show for the past five years. But there was still some diversity both in the games and on the stage itself. Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle, the first game on show, seems to fall outside of this conversation, though it does look like we’ll be able to play as Princess Peach and Rabbid Peach alike. But Far Cry 5 is already triggering some interesting conversations, and race is an important part of that. Player character diversity: The Crew 2 featured a white guy, but he seems so generic that it seems likely we’ll be able to customise our avatars for this multi-vehicle motorsport game. The trailer for Skull &amp; Bones, a multiplayer pirate battle game from the team that put naval combat in Assassin’s Creed: Black Flag, focused on a female pirate captain fighting off male attackers. Speaking of Assassin’s Creed, AC Origins is set in ancient Egypt and thus features lots of people of colour, including the protagonist Bayek. Steep lets you play as a woman or man. And we know that Far Cry 5 lets you choose gender and race for your player character, as well as featuring a black woman teammate called Grace Armstrong. And a dog called Boomer. But the delight of the night was the long-awaited reveal of Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2, which stars a black woman, a white woman, and multiple talking animals, though it’s unclear if any one character in this cooperative multiplayer game is the main protagonist. Speaker diversity: It was great to see Ashraf Ismail introduce Assassin’s Creed Origins, a game he seems genuinely excited about. And on the gender side of things, Ubisoft did pretty well by having a total of three women speak on stage: singer Bebe Rexha during the Just Dance 2018 demo, studio director Rebecka Coutaz to talk about Steep, and narrative director Gabrielle Shrager to join a teary Michel Ancel in talking about Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2. Bechdel test: None of the women on stage got to talk to each other, but Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2 featured a conversation between Shani and Dakini. Compared to last year: Aisha Tyler was sorely missed, but there were at least some interesting games on show, particularly Assassin’s Creed Origins and Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2. All in all, about the same as 2016. Diversity rating: 3/5 Sony The event: Sony kicked off an exciting couple of hours with the next instalment in in the Uncharted 4 universe. Uncharted: The Lost Legacy brings back two favourites from the franchise, Chloe Frazer and Nadine Ross, adventuring across India in search of ancient artefacts. The trailer for The Lost Legacy was followed by an announcement for Horizon: Zero Dawn DLC, putting protagonist Aloy in a thrilling new adventure: winter. Other highlights included a look at the father and son romp, God of War 4, as well as Days Gone, another post-apocalyptic survival horror game, this time with bikers. Skyrim VR got an extended trailer, as did David Cage’s Detroit: Become Human. Activision’s Call of Duty: WWII also got an extended trailer, though it was tough to get a read on the game through the cacophony of bullets and bombs. Supposedly, CoD: WWII will feature African-American infantry units and female side-characters in its campaign, but the trailer didn’t expand on much. Sony closed out their stage time with a nine-minute gameplay trailer for Insomniac’s Spiderman, announced last year. The game looks great, and Sony surprised audiences with a reveal that Miles Morales will be in the game. Player character diversity: It’s unclear whether Nadine or Chloe will be the player character for Uncharted: The Lost Legacy, but to see two women, one of whom isn’t white, headlining is great. If it were a standalone, full-length title, that would be even better. Female protagonist Aloy returns as the player-character in Horizon: Zero Dawn’s The Frozen Wilds, though the cultural appropriation of Native cultures on a white woman still doesn’t play well . David Cage’s Detroit features multiple player characters, one of whom is a white woman, and one, Marcus, played by actor Jesse Williams, is a person of colour. There are also people of colour among the androids that Marcus liberates. Spiderman’s Miles Morales, of black and hispanic descent, is a pleasant surprise, though it’s unclear whether he will be a playable character. Bechdel test: Without any people on stage aside from Shawn Layden, the focus turns to the games shown. Uncharted: The Lost Legacy passes the Bechdel test from the off, though other games don’t quite match up. Compared to last year: With three games featuring women as playable characters, and more people of colour getting screen time, Sony is showcasing a broader range of diverse games than last year. Diversity rating: 4/5 [Note: this article was amended on 16 June to correct the mislabelling of a character in the game Detroit: Almost Human as white]"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"business/2017/jun/15/push-for-adani-to-appear-before-senate-inquiry-into-infrastructure-fund","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-06-14T18:00:17Z","webTitle":"Push for Adani to appear before Senate inquiry into infrastructure fund","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jun/15/push-for-adani-to-appear-before-senate-inquiry-into-infrastructure-fund","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2017/jun/15/push-for-adani-to-appear-before-senate-inquiry-into-infrastructure-fund","fields":{"headline":"Push for Adani to appear before Senate inquiry into infrastructure fund","bodyText":"The Greens will push for Adani to front a federal Senate inquiry into Australia’s infrastructure fund and “grill” the miner on its overseas environmental and business record. The Senate on Wednesday passed a motion for an inquiry into the Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility, which is considering a $900m concessional loan to Adani for a railway as part of its massive proposed Queensland coal project. The Queensland Greens senator Larissa Waters said she would seek to have Adani appear before the inquiry to “grill them” on their environmental history and “the allegations of fraud, corruption and the use of tax havens”. Waters said the company would be asked why it needed “a billion taxpayer dollars” if the mine, which would export up to 60m tonnes of coal a year to Asia, was financially viable. A spokesman for Adani, which has denied any wrongdoing in relation to claims of invoicing fraud under investigation in India, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The inquiry motion came a day after reports emerged that Adani Enterprises, the parent company of the Australian mine venture, had been in talks about establishing a weapons venture with an arms business that had earlier been banned in India amid a corruption probe. An Adani spokesman told the Economic Times of India that the company abandoned early talks with the arms business as it was not comfortable with the idea. The motion was passed with Labor and Greens support in the face of opposition by the government. The inquiry, to be run by the economics references committee, will examine the “adequacy and transparency” of the $5b infrastructure fund’s project assessment and approval processes. It will also scrutinise processes around Naif board appointments, including assessments of conflict of interest, and policies to manage these. Jason Clare, the Labor shadow minister for resources and northern Australia, told parliament there had been a “cover up” around governance questions surrounding a Naif board member, Karla Way-McPhail. Clare said an estimates hearing a fortnight ago had established that Way-McPhail, the CEO of two mining services companies that could benefit from Adani’s success, was a “personal friend” of the minister overseeing the Naif, Matthew Canavan, and was put forward by him as a board candidate. “And this government refuses to say whether she was in the room for [Naif board] discussions about these projects or whether she recused herself,” Clare said. Governance questions like that had prompted the inquiry and a separate Labor call for the Australian National Audit Office to investigate NAIF, he said. The inquiry will look at the adequacy of Naif’s investment mandate, risk appetite statement and public interest test guiding decisions of its board. It will also examine the role of state and territory governments, and any agreements with the federal government, around the fund. Waters claimed the NAIF was “not about encouraging investment in Northern Australia” but “creating a slush fund to prop up the dying coal industry”. Clare said it was a “fair bet” that Pippa Middleton’s Northern Territory honeymoon would “probably deliver more economic development to the north” than the Naif in its first two years. No projects had yet been funded yet more than $600,000 had been spent on salaries and expenses for board members, he said. “All we know is that over the last two years they have had 119 enquires for funding, they are apparently considering 60 active deals, but there are only four that are currently subject to due diligence.” A spokeswoman for Canavan said: “The NAIF is accountable to the parliament and will cooperate with requests, as it always has done including through appearances at Senate estimates. “This inquiry does not add any level of accountability as it is already possible for the Senate to call the NAIF before a committee, even if it’s not on a scheduled estimates day.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"stage/2017/jun/14/kiss-me-review-trafalgar-studios-london-richard-bean","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2017-06-14T11:22:04Z","webTitle":"Kiss Me review – Richard Bean's tender two-hander keeps you guessing","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/jun/14/kiss-me-review-trafalgar-studios-london-richard-bean","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2017/jun/14/kiss-me-review-trafalgar-studios-london-richard-bean","fields":{"headline":"Kiss Me review – Richard Bean's tender two-hander keeps you guessing","bodyText":"There is the kiss of death and there is the kiss of life – and both are present in Richard Bean’s delicate two-hander, set 10 years after the first world war. Claire Lams plays Stephanie, a former munitions worker who was widowed during the war. She is now 32 and has some independence: she lives in a shabby boarding house and drives a lorry for a living. Stephanie is a thoroughly modern woman. She even knows where her clitoris is located. But Stephanie longs for a baby. With women outnumbering men following the ravages of war and Spanish flu, she struggles to find a new husband. Helped by a shadowy Marie Stopes-type doctor, who goes under the unlikely name of Dr Trollope, she is put in touch with a man calling himself Dennis (Ben Lloyd-Hughes). Buttoned-up Dennis looks like a banker, but he turns out to be a walking sperm bank. Under Dr Trollope’s direction, he has already fathered more than 200 children. But there are rules around this encounter: no real names must be used and there must be no kissing on the lips. Sometimes, of course, rules get broken. Georgia Lowe’s simple design of tarnished mirrors adds to the sense of a play set in the past but reflecting current anxieties over fertility, and Anna Ledwich’s tender production brings out the comedy and the pathos. The initial, entirely silent setup scene, in which Stephanie nervously rearranges the bed, is a little miracle of revelations. It’s nice to see Bean, best known for One Man, Two Guvnors, writing on a smaller scale. This quiet and often quietly funny play may be understated in its brevity and scope, but it feels honest in its exploration of the complexities of being a survivor in a world tipped upside down. Beautifully played by Lams and Lloyd-Hughes, these two characters come vividly alive as it grows apparent how history, personal and social, can have an impact on current behaviours. There are ambiguities, too: the woman’s marriage may not have been quite what it first appears, and Dennis’s motivation is constantly under question. Is it survivor’s guilt that keeps him adding to the human race? Or does he just like no-strings sex? This is a show that enjoys keeping you wondering. At Trafalgar Studios, London, until 8 July.

The windows were slightly ajar, a woman was gesturing that she was about to throw her baby and if somebody could catch her baby. Somebody did, a gentleman ran forward and managed to grab the baby. My daughter’s friend said she observed an adult who made some sort of homemade parachute and tried to lower himself out of the window … floor upon floor, [there were] endless numbers of people. The kids … with their high-pitched voices – that will remain with me for a long time. Joe Walsh, 58: I saw … [a] parent throw two kids out of the window. I don’t know where they landed because I was on the other side. I doubt anyone caught them, I hope they did. It wasn’t that high up – it would have been the fifth or sixth floor up. There were still people screaming at quarter to four this morning. Isabel Afonso, 22 There were people in the tower sitting on the windows, saying: ‘I’m going to jump down,’ and people yelling at them: ‘Don’t jump, they are coming.’ This is like 1.30am and I didn’t see anyone being evacuated. A lot of neighbours were trying to help. Some of the apartments have access by a kind of bridge to our building so people were helping people over the gate between them. Some people were helping a family of four people with a baby. Line Sterring, 23 We could see people waving fairy lights and flags to show their position. At first people seemed calm, but then you could see smoke coming out of the windows. When they saw the smoke they started panicking. We saw people in the second top window of the tower. There were four people screaming and shouting and then the window went completely dark from the smoke and that part of the building was covered in flames. The worst thing was seeing people stuck and you feel so useless. You are just watching people probably dying and the feeling of not doing anything, you just can’t do anything ... Tamara, to BBC News We could hear people screaming: ‘Help me,’ so me and my brother, with some other people who live in the area, ran over to the estate to where you could still get underneath it and there were people just throwing their kids out saying: ‘Save my children.’ The fire crew, ambulance and police couldn’t do anything, they couldn’t get in, and they were just telling them to stay where they are, and we’ll come and get you. But things quickly escalated beyond measure and they couldn’t go back in and get them. Within another 15 minutes the whole thing was up in flames and there were still people at their windows shouting ‘Help me’. You could see the fire going into their houses and engulfing the last room that they were in. Amanda Fernandez, 31: We were just watching thinking ‘someone is going to stop it soon’. There’s been fires in that tower before, but it’s never escalated like that. There are these new panels on it, I don’t know what they were made of but it smelt like plastic.When [the fire] got outside [the building] it was literally so rapid, like when hair catches fire. First one side went, then another. Then you are just counting the floors, you can see people hanging out of the windows. And the screams, the constant screams. Saimir Iieshi, 39: I didn’t want them [my sons] to see what I saw. I said there had been a fire but the police had evacuated everybody. I tried to protect them but they could hear the people. I could hear people shouting: ‘Please, I have got kids, please save my kids.’ It makes you feel useless. You hear that, you have children and it makes you feel so weak, it makes you feel like nothing. I hope they [my sons] will forget what they heard. But me, I will never forget. Paul Littlejohn, to BBC News [There was] just fire coming out of every window, windows smashing and exploding. Things falling out, people screaming, people jumping out on fire, chucking ropes down what they’d made out of bedsheets, to try and climb out. Just complete nightmare, absolute nightmare. Mahmoud, 25 I spoke to my friend [Mohammed] at about 3.30am. He was saying: ‘Help me.’ My friend who escaped [Omar] went to one flat and he [Mohammed] went to another. They lost each other. I have been friends with them since I was six years old, I don’t know what to do. I am waiting. I hope he is alive. I last spoke to [Mohammed] at 3.30am. He was saying: ‘Please help me, please tell my family I love them.’ He sounded very scared. Paul Mennacer to BBC News The black smoke ... was coming at me ... I was only wearing a T-shirt. I had to take the shirt off to cover my mouth and my nose and as I was going down the stairs there were firefighters, truly amazing firefighters, going up the stairs to the fire, trying to get as many people [as possible] out of the building. Jody Martin, to BBC News I grabbed an axe from the fire truck, it looked like there was a bit of confusion about what to do. I ran around the building looking for a fire escape and couldn’t see any noticeable fire escapes around the building. A lot of debris falling down. I eventually gained entry on to the second floor, and once I got to the corridor I realised there was so much smoke there. I watched one person falling out, I watched another woman holding her baby out the window … hearing screams, I was yelling everyone to get down and they were saying, ‘We can’t leave our apartments, the smoke is too bad on the corridors.’ Taz: I heard screaming and shouting and looked out of my window. You could see kids waving from the windows. You could hear, ‘Mummy, daddy.” … I just ran down the street. The police were telling us the block’s going to collapse. People were crying outside for their family. It wasn’t a good sight to see. Mickey Paramasivan to BBC News People were banging on the windows, screaming, ‘Get us out, get us out’. Windows were blowing up. It was like a horror movie, I’m still shaking now. David Benjamin to BBC News There was smoke everywhere, literally everywhere, there was people downstairs, there was bits of the block, cladding falling off the block, that was on fire, people screaming. Muna Ali, 45 The flames, I have never seen anything like it, it just reminded me of 9/11. The fire started on the upper floors … oh my goodness, it spread so quickly, it had completely spread within half an hour."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2017/jun/14/ariana-grande-to-become-first-honorary-citizen-of-manchester","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2017-06-14T09:43:05Z","webTitle":"Ariana Grande to become first honorary citizen of Manchester","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/jun/14/ariana-grande-to-become-first-honorary-citizen-of-manchester","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2017/jun/14/ariana-grande-to-become-first-honorary-citizen-of-manchester","fields":{"headline":"Ariana Grande to become first honorary citizen of Manchester","bodyText":"Ariana Grande is to become the first honorary citizen of Manchester for helping to raise millions of pounds for victims of the Manchester Arena attack. The US pop star exemplified the “resilient and compassionate” way the city had responded to the terror atrocity that claimed 22 lives and injured 220 others last month, council leaders said. The accolade came as town hall officials announced plans for an event to recognise the “great many selfless acts and demonstrations of community spirit” in the aftermath of the attack on 22 May. Sir Richard Leese, the leader of Manchester city council, said: “This seems a fitting moment to update the way we recognise those who make noteworthy contributions to the life and success of our city. “We’ve all had cause to be incredibly proud of Manchester and the resilient and compassionate way in which the city, and all those associated with it, have responded to the terrible events of 22 May, with love and courage rather than hatred and fear. “Ariana Grande exemplified this response. I think many people would already consider her an honorary Mancunian and we would be delighted, if the council approves the proposal, to make it official.” Ariana Grande helped to raise nearly £3m when she returned to Manchester to perform a star-studded benefit concert at Old Trafford cricket ground 13 days after the suicide bombing, which struck at the end of her Dangerous Woman concert at Manchester Arena 23 days ago. The 23-year-old singer visited a number of injured children in hospital earlier this month. Her mother, Joan, who ushered concertgoers to safety backstage after the explosion in the arena foyer, was seen walking through the One Love Manchester crowd telling young fans not to give in to fear at the benefit concert on Sunday 4 June. The accolade is part of plans for a new system to recognise people from outside Manchester who have made an outstanding contribution to the city, a spokesman for Manchester city council said. Honorary citizenship is the highest honour a city can give apart from the rarely awarded freedom of the city, which has only been awarded four times since 2000. The stars granted the freedom of Manchester include the broadcaster Anthony H Wilson, the former England and Manchester United footballer Sir Bobby Charlton, the Manchester-based GB Cycling and Paracycling Teams, and the Nobel-Prize-winning University of Manchester professors Sir Andrei Geim and Sir Konstantin Novoselov, who first isolated the wonder material graphene. A Manchester city council spokesman added: “Civic leaders have thought for some time that there is a need for a new system of honours in addition to the rarely awarded freedom of the city, which will remain the highest honour the city can give, and the council’s Be Proud awards which celebrate the commitment of individuals and groups who volunteer their time to help their communities.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/jun/19/nsw-greens-drop-threat-to-boycott-party-politburo","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-06-19T06:43:45Z","webTitle":"NSW Greens drop threat to boycott party 'politburo'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/jun/19/nsw-greens-drop-threat-to-boycott-party-politburo","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/jun/19/nsw-greens-drop-threat-to-boycott-party-politburo","fields":{"headline":"NSW Greens drop threat to boycott party 'politburo'","bodyText":"A group of New South Wales Greens who refused to take part in a powerful internal committee have dropped their threat to boycott the democratic body they labelled a “politburo”. Justin Field – one of the quartet of MPs who also included Jeremy Buckingham, Dawn Walker and Tamara Smith – has told Guardian Australia there is “no boycott” of the parliamentary liaison committee but foreshadowed further efforts to reform it. The PLC provides a mechanism for Greens members to set the direction of the party and can even bind the parliamentarians when the party room is split and cannot reach consensus, although that power has rarely been used. Its six rank-and-file members are elected by the state delegates council and have 2.66 votes each, while the eight state NSW Greens parliamentarians and federal senator for NSW, Lee Rhiannon, only receive one vote each. On 9 June Guardian Australia reported that the group of four MPs had notified party officials they refused to take part in the PLC process until the question of its constitutionality was resolved, citing the fact it infringed the principle of “one vote, one value”. They have described the PLC as an internal “politburo” that had “powers to direct MPs” and warning it was open to being manipulated by factions. After the convenors of the NSW and Australian Greens rejected their view that weighted voting was unconstitutional, the recalcitrant MPs modified their stance. “There was never a boycott, we raised legitimate questions about how grassroots democracy should operate in the NSW Greens,” Field said. “We are glad there is now an active debate within the membership on how we can best ensure genuine grassroots participation in party decisions.” In a message to a NSW members Facebook group, Field added that the four MPs had been attending PLC meetings for the past three weeks but said he still disagreed with the NSW convenors about the constitutionality of weighted voting. Sylvia Hale, a former NSW upper house member and a PLC member, has written to party members defending the PLC’s power to break deadlocks, arguing that it “is vital that our parliamentary representatives continue to be accountable to the membership for all their activities”. She said the Greens didn’t pay “lip service to a hollow ideal” of grassroots democracy, and democratic structures were a key point of difference from political competitors. The PLC’s structure will be debated at the next state delegates council in July, including a motion put by the NSW Young Greens to censure the four MPs for the now-dropped boycott."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2017/jun/14/pay-squeeze-wages-growth-inflation-ons-unemployment-rate","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-06-14T10:25:57Z","webTitle":"Pay squeeze intensifies as wage growth falls further behind inflation","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jun/14/pay-squeeze-wages-growth-inflation-ons-unemployment-rate","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2017/jun/14/pay-squeeze-wages-growth-inflation-ons-unemployment-rate","fields":{"headline":"Pay squeeze intensifies as wage growth falls further behind inflation","bodyText":"Britain is experiencing a rapid decline in living standards with the biggest squeeze in workers’ pay since 2014, according to the latest official data. Regular pay adjusted to account for the impact of inflation fell by 0.6% year on year in the three months to April. It was the weakest data since the summer months in 2014, according to the Office for National Statistics. The decline followed a 0.4% drop in the three months to March. Trade unions reacted with dismay to the figures. Frances O’Grady, general secretary of union umbrella body the TUC, warned that Britain was heading for a fresh crisis in living standards. “Real wages have fallen for the second month in a row. Unless the government gets its act together, we’ll soon be in the middle of another cost of living crisis,” she said. “Ministers must focus on delivering better-paid jobs across the UK. And it’s time to bin the artificial pay restrictions on nurses, midwives and other public sector workers. Britain needs a pay rise, not more pressure on household budgets.” Len McCluskey, general secretary of Britain’s biggest union, Unite, said millions of workers were struggling to make ends meet. “The Tories have succeeded in creating the longest period of falling real terms pay since the Napoleonic wars. They are clearly the party of economic mismanagement.” When adjusted for inflation, UK employees are now earning £15 less a week after tax and deductions than they were in March 2008, six months before the collapse of Lehman Brothers and the global financial crisis. The latest drop in real wages reflects mounting pressure on household budgets, as the sharp drop in the value of the pound since the EU referendum drives up the cost of goods imported from abroad and feeds through to higher shop prices. The ONS said that before inflation, regular pay growth excluding bonuses slowed to 1.7% year on year in the three months to April. It was much weaker than the 2% growth in pay that had been expected by economists. Pay growth for the three months to March was also revised down sharply to 1.8% from a previous estimate of 2.1%, underlining the pace at which a drop in living standards is taking hold. Prices were rising at a faster rate, with inflation at 2.7% in April, and jumping to 2.9% in May according to ONS data published on Tuesday. The fall in real pay comes despite an employment rate which held 74.8% in the three months to April, the highest since records began in 1971. The number of people in work rose by 109,000 to 31.95 million. Meanwhile the unemployment rate was unchanged at a 42-year low of 4.6% and the number of unemployed people fell by 50,000 to 1.53 million. “The terrible news on pay comes despite another strong jobs performance, with unemployment remaining at its lowest level in over 40 years,” said Stephen Clarke, economics analyst at the Resolution Foundation thinktank. “The sharp contrast between our terrible record on pay and strong jobs performance shows that the currency-driven inflation we are experiencing is not feeding through into wage pressures and is simply making us all poorer instead.” The work and pensions secretary, David Gauke, highlighted the jobs figures. “This is yet another strong set of record-breaking figures with employment up and unemployment down, fuelled by full-time opportunities. This is good news for families as we continue to build a stronger, fairer Britain.” But Debbie Abrahams, shadow work and pensions secretary, said Labour was “deeply concerned” that millions of people remain in low paid, insecure work. Economists are predicting the pay squeeze will accelerate in the coming months, with inflation likely to rise above 3% and as firms limit pay rises as their own costs rise and the economy weakens. The squeeze is expected to weigh on consumer spending, which has been the key driver of economic growth since the financial crisis. “The UK economy faces a dangerous cocktail of political uncertainty, slowing growth and shrinking real wages,” said Ben Brettell, senior economist, Hargreaves Lansdown. The weak outlook for consumers and pay is expected to convince policymakers at the Bank of England to look beyond rising inflation – already well above the Bank’s 2% target – and leave interest rates on hold at an all-time low of 0.25% for a prolonged period. Economists at ING bank said policymakers are unlikely to raise rates before 2019. Neil Carberry, director of employment and skills for the CBI business lobby group, said the government must “put the economy front and centre, create stability and ensure the EU negotiations get off to a positive start”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2017/jun/14/thames-water-given-maximum-fine-for-missing-leak-target","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-06-14T10:38:37Z","webTitle":"Thames Water given maximum £8.5m fine for missing leak target","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/jun/14/thames-water-given-maximum-fine-for-missing-leak-target","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/jun/14/thames-water-given-maximum-fine-for-missing-leak-target","fields":{"headline":"Thames Water given maximum £8.5m fine for missing leak target","bodyText":"Thames Water will pay a £8.5m penalty after failing to meet its target to cut water leakage from its pipes. Ofwat, which regulates the privatised water industry, called the failure “unacceptable” and said the penalty was the maximum possible. Leaks from Thames Water’s network rose by 5% in the last year, or 35m litres per day. In May, the Guardian revealed that amid fears of a drought and with some water companies asking customers to save water, the vast amount of water that leaks from company pipes every day across England has not fallen for at least four years. The missed target was revealed in Thames Water’s annual report, which also showed profit before tax fell by 86% last year. In March, Thames Water was hit with a record fine of £20.3m after huge leaks of untreated sewage into the Thames, its tributaries and on to land, a failure the judge called “shocking and disgraceful”. The increased leakage from Thames Water pipes means 180 litres per day is leaking per property that the company supplies. The £8.5m penalty cannot be passed on to customers and Thames Water said the money would be returned to customers in the form of lower bills from 2020. “The failure by Thames Water to meet the leakage commitments it has made to its customers is unacceptable,” said Ofwat chief executive Cathryn Ross. Ofwat has also opened an investigation to consider whether enforcement action is needed over and above this automatic penalty. “Thames Water’s failure sends completely the wrong message to its customers at a time when households are being encouraged to use water more wisely,” said Sir Tony Redmond, London and South East chair for the Consumer Council for Water. “We have repeatedly called on water companies to show more ambition in reducing leakage, which is an issue that really matters to consumers.” Thames Water’s chief executive Steve Robertson said: “We’re working hard to get back on track after hitting our leakage targets for 10 years in succession, and reducing leakage by a third from its peak in 2004.” “The reasons for missing it are complex, and the evidence is being examined carefully in order to learn as much as we can,” he said. “But the fact that the target was missed despite significant additional expenditure clearly points to the need to improve both our planning and delivery.” Thames Water revealed it caused 315 pollution incidents last year, higher than the year before but below its 340 target. In the annual report, Robertson said: “We’re paying a high price both financially and reputationally for major pollution incidents [which led to the £20.3m fine) between 2012 and 2014.” Robertson, who joined Thames Water in September 2016, was awarded an annual bonus of £54,000 and is paid a basic salary of £700,000 a year. England is the only nation to have a fully privatised water industry, which has been criticised for making large dividend payments to owners. The Labour party’s recent election manifesto pledged to renationalise the industry, which it called “dysfunctional”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2017/jun/14/wannacry-attacks-prompt-microsoft-to-release-updates-for-older-windows-versions","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2017-06-14T11:26:43Z","webTitle":"WannaCry attacks prompt Microsoft to release Windows updates for older versions","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/jun/14/wannacry-attacks-prompt-microsoft-to-release-updates-for-older-windows-versions","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2017/jun/14/wannacry-attacks-prompt-microsoft-to-release-updates-for-older-windows-versions","fields":{"headline":"WannaCry attacks prompt Microsoft to release Windows updates for older versions","bodyText":"Microsoft has released new security updates for older versions of Windows as it warns of potential cyber-attacks by government organisations. The patches include updates to Windows XP, the operating system that was targeted by the WannaCry ransomware attack in May that attacked parts of the NHS and other companies worldwide. Typically, Microsoft only issues updates for its operating systems that are still supported – for consumers, that means Windows 7 and newer (with the exception of Windows 8, which is meant to be covered by the free upgrade to Windows 8.1). But in the wake of the WannaCry outbreak, which saw a ransomeware worm take advantage of un-patched versions of windows to encrpyt millions of computers worldwide, Microsoft is reassessing that policy. “Due to the elevated risk for destructive cyber-attacks at this time, we made the decision to take this action because applying these updates provides further protection against potential attacks with characteristics similar to WannaCrypt [alternative name to WannaCry],” Adrienne Hall, the head of Microsoft’s Cyber Defense Operations Center, said. Although Microsoft has not said what characteristics of the new vulnerabilities have led it to believe there is the potential for state-sanctioned attackers, the WannaCry reference has led security experts to conclude that the company is referring to leaked NSA hacking tools, released online by an entity calling itself The Shadow Brokers. The Shadow Brokers were responsible for releasing the vulnerability, referred to by the NSA as EternalBlue, which led to WannaCry being able to replicate itself and do so much damage internationally. WannaCry wasn’t the only malware that used EternalBlue to spread, but it was by far the most destructive. The Shadow Brokers have promised to release further vulnerabilities in the future, offering them to “subscribers” willing to pay $10,000 (£7,850) a month for the privilege. The new patches fix 16 vulnerabilities, of which 15 are ranked by Microsoft as critical. Craig Young, security researcher at infosec firm Tripwire, said: “Anyone still using Windows 2003 or XP should install these patches ASAP with the expectation that they will be actively exploited in the near term. This move may indicate that Microsoft has been made aware of exploits that may be pending imminent release from the Shadow Brokers. “WannaCry was orders of magnitude smaller than some successful malware campaigns of the past,” Young added. “We may not be so lucky the next time this happens.” But some criticised the move, arguing that continuing to support older versions of Windows was just delaying the inevitable. Peter Bright, from technology site Ars Technica, said: “patching is the wrong decision: it sends a clear message to recalcitrant corporations that they can stick with Windows XP, insecure as it is, because if anything too serious is found, Microsoft will update it anyway … Every time an organisation resists upgrading to Microsoft’s latest operating system, it jeopardises its own security.” The WannaCry outbreak led to criticisms of the NHS for the widespread use of outdated software across the health service. Windows XP was not affected by the malware (although the operating system is weak to the EternalBlue exploit, WannaCry itself persistently crashed before managing to encrypt drives), but a number of the affected systems were running Windows Vista, a slightly newer unsupported version of the operating system."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"artanddesign/2017/jun/22/vincent-fournier-photography-russian-cosmonaut-star-city-space-project","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2017-06-22T06:00:29Z","webTitle":"Vincent Fournier's best photograph: Boris the cosmonaut shows off his spacesuit","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2017/jun/22/vincent-fournier-photography-russian-cosmonaut-star-city-space-project","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2017/jun/22/vincent-fournier-photography-russian-cosmonaut-star-city-space-project","fields":{"headline":"Vincent Fournier's best photograph: Boris the cosmonaut shows off his spacesuit","bodyText":"Star City is a self-contained city for cosmonauts about an hour from Moscow. Astronauts still come from all over the world to get trained there. It might look dated but, underneath, the important stuff is all working. As well as a training centre, it has a launch site, a technical department, a school, and a hospital – everything really. During the cold war, when there was a lot of money going into the space race, it was an important place. That’s not so much the case now. We are all awed by space – and, although there is something old-fashioned, even funny, about this image, it is still noble. The subject’s name is General Boris V and I took his portrait back in 2007. Originally, the Yuri Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Centre had agreed to let me shoot on their premises, but when I got there they asked for money. In Russia, to get anything done, you need either money or vodka – so we went to the cafeteria and started drinking. After an hour or two, Boris suggested we take the spacesuit to his house and just do it there. He’s only had that suit on for less than half an hour, but it was so heavy he could hardly cope. You can tell he’s struggling – his expression is 100% natural. Taking the picture at his house made it so much more interesting. I love the contrast between this futuristic idea of space and the old-fashioned wallpaper. The bit of wood on the right is actually the corner of his son’s bed. It took me six to eight months to set up the visit to Star City – and just half an hour to get this shot. I spent the rest of my two days there being shown around, taking more photos. My work is a mix of documentary and staging. All the ingredients are real, but I like a formal composition. I like to use just a camera and a tripod, with no extra lighting. There are two iconic movies about space: 2001 by Stanley Kubrick and Solaris by Andrei Tarkovsky. You have the very clean American film: for them, space is something chaotic they have to tidy. For the Russians, space is this spiritual thing, your way of meeting God. So they’re not so interested in the material aspect. Growing up in the 1970s, space was such an inspiring thing for young people like me. I’ve been working on my Space Project series since 2007, photographing rockets, suits, radars, training centres, clean rooms, launch platforms, shuttles and astronauts. It’s taken me to Chile, French Guiana, the US, Norway, Kazakhstan, the UK and the Netherlands, as well as Russia. It’s ironic that I have been to all these places, surrounded by all these experts, yet I still don’t really understand it. I come at this world more from a science-fiction, futuristic, utopian angle: I love the aesthetic, the mystery, the sense of adventure. I’m going to be working with Nasa soon. They’re building the Space Launch System, their biggest, most powerful rocket ever. I’d like to combine the mechanics of the rocket with the human stories in Houston behind it, photograph the astronauts testing all their equipment. Hopefully, they’ll be happy to let me in.

Unconfirmed reports are circulating among local residents that a fridge may have exploded on the fourth floor of Grenfell Tower. Residents of the block had previously voiced concerns about piles of rubbish in communal areas presenting a fire risk. Were either of these a contributing factor or was there another cause? Did the recently completed refurbishment contribute to the blaze? As part of a refurbishment costing about £10m and carried out by the contractor Rydons, the building was covered in aluminium wall cladding, which appears to have burned strongly. Was this a factor or not? In July 2015, Kensington and Chelsea’s housing and property scrutiny committee reported that there had been “close liaison with London fire brigade with regard to works at Grenfell Tower – local operational crews regularly attend the block and liaise with the contractor, Rydons, on progress of works, impact on firefighting etc.” What about the external cladding? Firefighters, fire safety experts and architects voiced alarm about the speed with which the fire swept across the new polyester powder-coated aluminium facade, installed as part of the refurbishment to improve the building’s insulation and appearance. One architect responsible for several recladding projects said the tower’s cladding was designed to include fire breaks at every floor and around every window. He said that if the cladding was installed correctly, flames should not have been able to sweep through the cavities. This was confirmed by the Fire Protection Association, which carried out a laboratory study in 2015 after concerns were raised about such external thermal-insulated cladding systems. The FPA said on Wednesday that its study concluded that when the polystyrene insulation was properly enclosed, the extent of any fire could be limited to a “melt-out area”. However, it added that if the cladding was breached by bathroom vents or pipes it was possible for a “ground to roof fire” to spread rapidly. Although architects’ drawings for Grenfell Tower seen by the Guardian show provisions for fire breaks in the cladding, it is not known whether it was installed that way. We know that a rainscreen system marketed under the Reynobond brand was used in cladding at Grenfell, but speculation is also focusing on the insulation material behind that. Many noticed chunks of blackened material that came off the building. The FPA said building regulations did not cover the fire resilience of external cladding. It added that the materials used in cladding systems varied from non-combustible to highly flammable: “It is a matter of choice, and clearly some choices are better than others.” The contractor, Rydon, said the works met building regulation standards. What about the new gas pipes in the central stairwell? Did they exacerbate the blaze? A local councillor, Judith Blakeman, who sits on the tenant management organisation, raised concerns in March about the National Grid installation of gas risers or pipes in the main stairwell as part of the refurbishment. She was assured by the landlord that they would be boxed in with “fire-rated” protection, but this does not appear to have been done. The London fire brigade said on Thursday morning they had not been able to put out the flames until they had isolated a ruptured gas main in the block. How did the alarm system operate? Several residents said they did not hear a building-wide alarm. One man said the first thing he heard was the sirens of emergency vehicles. How was the building’s alarm system set up? More than one resident has claimed there was no central fire alarm system for the tower block – or that it had failed – and only smoke alarms in individual flats were working. Were they battery operated or hard-wired into the system? Board minutes suggest installing hard-wired fire alarms had been planned. What impact did the “stay put” fire advice have? According to the board minutes of the Kensington and Chelsea tenant management organisation, which runs the building, it has been engaged in “ongoing publicity to residents, particularly in relation to the ‘stay put’ fire strategy and procedures residents should follow in event of a fire in their flat or elsewhere in their block.” What impact did this advice have? The “stay put” advice stems from longstanding strategies for fighting fires in “compartmentalised” high-rise buildings. It assumes that most fires can be contained behind each flat’s fireproof front door. Firefighters then isolate the fire and rescue tenants floor by floor. But if the fire spreads, the brigade commander should order an evacuation. The fire was not contained in a single flat in Grenfell Tower but spread rapidly. So the outstanding questions are: why did the fire spread and why were so many people unable to get out? What about corporate manslaughter charges? The police, fire brigade and Health and Safety Executive have started investigations including a fingertip search and have said inquiries will be lengthy. Rachel Adamson, head of regulatory law at the law firm Stephensons, said corporate manslaughter charges were difficult to prove as they related to “the controlling mind of the business”. If an individual was considered to have been negligent, this may lead to a charge of manslaughter by gross negligence. A range of lesser potential charges include breach of fire regulations or health and safety regulations. Investigators will examine recent refurbishment work, whether building regulations have been complied with and what fire safety precautions were in place. What should the public inquiry cover? Theresa May has responded positively to Jeremy Corbyn’s call for a rapid public inquiry chaired by a cabinet minister over the summer. It will examine what happened but also needs to look at wider questions such as the record of implementation of new fire safety rules agreed after a tower block fire at Lakanal House in Southwark in 2009, in which six people died. In March the then housing minister, Gavin Barwell, now Theresa May’s chief of staff, delayed the completion of a recommended review of part B of the 2010 building regulations. Failings in the Southwark fire included inadequate fire-risk assessments and panels on the exterior walls not providing the required fire resistance. A Department for Communities and Local Government spokesperson said the work on the building regulations’ review was ongoing, and would not give a date for when updated regulations would be published. What about tenants living in similar blocks around the country? The policing and fire minister, Nick Hurd, has ordered checks to be carried out on tower blocks that have undergone similar refurbishments. Five London councils announced on Thursday that they would review the fire safety of their tower blocks. Local authorities around Britain took similar steps, with the Scottish government saying it was ready to take any actions necessary as lessons were learned from the Grenfell Tower fire. Why are police refusing to give an estimate of the number of victims? There has been anger from residents and people waiting for news of loved ones about the Met police’s refusal to issue an estimate of the number of dead. There are believed to be around 65 people missing and the Met could easily use this to issue guidance. But the answer is to some extent in the question – anything issued by the Met at this stage would be an estimate, which they are reluctant to give. Searches of the building continue and there have been something like 5,000 calls to the casualty bureau and 400 missing person reports, although some are multiple reports relating to the same people. But there are precedents for releasing official information about the number of missing: in the US authorities said soon after 9/11 that there were 3,000 people missing. How long can relatives expect to wait before hearing of the fate of loved ones? The Met’s emphasis on accuracy means identification can be painstakingly slow. This has prompted complaints by families after a number of incidents going as far back as 7/7. After the London Bridge attacks this month, the Spanish government said the failure of British authorities to provide details of the fate of Spaniard Ignacio Echeverría to his family was “a situation that isn’t far off being described as inhumane”. The police were slow to confirm identities after the London Bridge attacks, in some cases even when people had ID on them, because they rely on one of three “primary investigation methods” – fingerprints, DNA and teeth. This led to the Met sending emails out confirming deaths days after family members had already identified them as victims. The police fear that identifying people too quickly could lead to calamitous mistakes being made, and after such a ferocious fire the process of identification is particularly difficult."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"news/2017/jun/15/green-streets-way-to-go-weatherwatch-pollution","type":"article","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webPublicationDate":"2017-06-15T20:30:49Z","webTitle":"Green streets are the way to go","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2017/jun/15/green-streets-way-to-go-weatherwatch-pollution","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/2017/jun/15/green-streets-way-to-go-weatherwatch-pollution","fields":{"headline":"Green streets are the way to go","bodyText":"As the connected problems of climate change and air pollution from traffic make living in cities more hazardous, the health benefits of greening our streets become ever more apparent. On crowded city roads green barriers, in the form of dense hedges between traffic and people on the pavements, dramatically reduce the danger from fumes, but are difficult to squeeze in. Green roofs and walls, which take up no ground space and were originally introduced sometimes for aesthetic reasons, are proving that they have great value. They insulate buildings and lead to energy savings, reduce temperatures outside by absorbing sunlight, and mitigate the urban heat island effect. They also contribute to storm water management by soaking up the rain, and reduce noise and increase urban biodiversity. But the latest studies find green roofs and walls are also valuable for removing air pollution; they can reduce nitrogen dioxide by up to 35%, and make 50% cuts in the small particulates that damage lungs. However, in some street “canyons”, where trees are surrounded by tall buildings, pollution can be concentrated as foul air gets trapped below the canopy. Local weather conditions, especially humidity and wind, also make a big difference to the success rate of green barriers. Generally though the research shows that there are immediate benefits from having all sorts of plants growing in cities. Some evergreens with sticky or hairy leaves that capture pollutants, which can then wash off in the rain, are particularly effective all year. But can they cope with the pollution? Finding the plants that can thrive in all of these stressful conditions could require special horticultural skills."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"teacher-network/2017/jun/15/teachers-as-guides-inside-the-uks-first-montessori-secondary-school","type":"article","sectionId":"teacher-network","sectionName":"Teacher Network","webPublicationDate":"2017-06-15T13:34:51Z","webTitle":"Teachers as 'guides': inside the UK’s first Montessori secondary school","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/teacher-network/2017/jun/15/teachers-as-guides-inside-the-uks-first-montessori-secondary-school","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/teacher-network/2017/jun/15/teachers-as-guides-inside-the-uks-first-montessori-secondary-school","fields":{"headline":"Teachers as 'guides': inside the UK’s first Montessori secondary school","bodyText":"One student is completing a project on the rise of the emoji in modern culture. Another is making notes on the incubation of duck eggs, in anticipation of a hatching the next day. Others are outside in the garden, tending to basil, which will later be sold in a local shop. This is an usual place to learn, and the first Montessori school for adolescents in the UK to be endorsed by AMI, although there are others that teach in the Montessori style. There are no year groups, no subject departments, no timetables and no assessments. There are also no teachers in the traditional sense: adults are “guides”, mentors who meet with students weekly or fortnightly to review their work and set a programme of learning. Students study in mixed age groups, learning from each other and working on topics that interest them. Montessori pre-school and primary schools have become popular in the UK – with around 700 early years and primary institutions, four of which are state-funded. Outside the curriculum The Montessori Place is a converted conference centre in East Sussex with an extensive walled garden, “the living laboratory”, where students spend a large part of their time learning how to grow vegetables and tend to animals. The school opened its doors to adolescents in September and although there are currently only seven students, it plans to expand to 60 in the coming years. Paul Pillai, the softly spoken and intellectual head guide, describes the partnerships between students and guides as “a different relationship” to the usual teacher-student dynamic: “I’m more of a coach, or a line manager. I meet with the students individually, we discuss goals and how we’ll achieve them, and then we meet again and see how they’ve got on.” Deciding what each student will work on is about looking for “a spark”, says Pillai: “What fires this student up? If we don’t find that, we are wasting our time.” From there, they work together to plan a series of activities loosely covering recognisable curriculum areas such as the humanities, arts and maths. And then the students more or less get on with it. “Real work” and looking after the community are other vital elements of the student experience. So they help with cooking, cleaning and the maintenance of the building, as well as running a bed and breakfast for visitors. Students will take GCSEs in English and maths with the option to take science and other subjects by request, but qualifications aren’t the main focus. “There is a point at which a qualification is valuable and that’s A-level,” says Pillai. “Before that, we just want to feed a passion. There’s a joy to studying a subject without curriculum constraint.” Elitist? During sessions, students are also encouraged to take time out to reflect and “just be”. Dr Robert Loe, director of education consultancy and research organisation Relational Schools, believes it’s an approach that has value: “One of the biggest issues we face is that schools these days are time poor. Time is the currency of relationships, and relationships precede learning and success.” But the Montessori approach is not without its critics. They say that it’s too individualistic in its approach at the expense of group work and social interaction; that it focuses too much on the practical; and that it’s elitist, with most schools only being available to those who can afford the private fees. Life in Montessori schools starkly contrasts that in many UK secondaries, where budget constraints and performance measures see extracurricular activities cut and creative subjects sidelined. Since the Montessori Place is a private school, such education doesn’t come cheap. So does that investment lead to better results? There’s been little research into the academic results among adolescent Montessori students, but there is evidence to suggest improved motivation and engagement among Montessori middle-schoolers, and better academic performance among younger children in the US. And what about after they’ve taken their A-levels, when these students are applying for jobs, or for university courses? Will they be disadvantaged? Christine Doddington, fellow emerita of educational philosophy at the University of Cambridge, doesn’t think so. “These students may not have as many GCSE results, but they’ll have advantages in other ways,” she says. “In recent years, universities have been talking about how many students they get who don’t have the ability to think for themselves. So I think students who have had different experiences could be very attractive in that context.” She questions, though, whether so much independence is always positive. “There’s a real need to mediate learning for adolescents so that it is not remote, inert and dry but instead has the urgency, warmth and intimacy of a direct experience. This requires great artistry and skill as a teacher, and I’m not sure the idea of teacher as guide does justice to that.” What the future looks like for this first cohort of students from the Montessori Place remains to be seen. But in the context of increasing focus on academic subjects in secondary education more broadly, the school is perhaps one worth watching. This article has been amended to clarify that the Montessori Place is the first AMI Montessori school for adolescents in the UK, rather than the first to teach in the Montessori style.

And the dreams that you dreamed of, once in a lullaby. Oh, and Arsenal would like to sign Kylian Mbappé, which is good of them given that there is not one single reason for Mbappé to sign for Arsenal. But no one can say that they didn’t try, and that’s what’s important. Of course, it may be that he has a secret yen for Thursday trips to Shymkent and Marijampole, for being indulged to within a millimetre of his life and to trouble melting like lemon drops high above the chimney pots. But probably not. Arsène Wenger is also keen on Mbappé’s teammate, Thomas Lemar, and Lyon’s Alexandre Lacazette. He attempted to nab the latter last summer, but his bid of £30m was turned down, and a few goals later the price has nudged up to £60m. For their part, Lyon have said that Arsenal can have Lacazette in a player-plus-cash deal for Olivier Giroud, a particularly cruel joke, but anyway, Lacazette fancies himself in the Champions League. Players are also expected to forsake Arsenal. Despite being the greatest talent in the history of all sport, it is possible that Mesut Özil might be allowed to leave, so too Lucas Pérez, Kieran Gibbs, Carl Jenkinson, Mathieu Debuchy and England’s Jack Wilshere. One at a time please, don’t all rush at once. Across London, one-club hero John Terry is looking for a new club. Aston Villa, Birmingham City and West Bromwich Albion are all keen. Further north, the Manchester clubs plan to divest themselves of unwanted encumbrances. City would like rid of Samir Nasri, though need to reduce their asking price of £16m due to lack of interest; the multi-millionaire player no doubt understands his plight as simply a symbol of being against the system. And now that Pep Guardiola’s genius for spotting a talent has acquired him not only the world’s most expensive uncapped goalkeeper but the world’s most expensive goalkeeper, Willy Caballero is for the off; Chelsea are set to take him to Stamford Bridge. United, meanwhile intend for Chris Smalling to do one. José Mourinho is thought to doubt both his footballing ability and mental toughness, something of a problem for a footballer expected to be tough, and has already replaced him with Victor Lindelöf. As such, he will not cost a lot of money, depending on what one deems a lot of money – a mere £15m might get the deal done – and Arsenal, West Ham, West Brom and Everton have sent notice of their vacancy for an injury-prone defender with a particular fondness for conceding possession, getting caught under high balls and losing men in the box. Finally, in other centre-back news, Leicester like the look of Hull’s Harry Maguire, who is apparently worth more than two-time league champion, Chris Smalling. So far they have offered £16.5m, and £20m is expected to be enough to snare his services. Also interested are Tottenham and Newcastle, though the player is keen to play regularly and will take any decision with that in mind."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"uk-news/2017/jun/14/london-fire-have-you-been-affected","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2017-06-14T07:46:54Z","webTitle":"Have you been affected by the fire at Grenfell Tower?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/jun/14/london-fire-have-you-been-affected","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2017/jun/14/london-fire-have-you-been-affected","fields":{"headline":"Have you been affected by the fire at Grenfell Tower?","bodyText":"The number of people dead or missing and presumed dead following the fire at Grenfell Tower has risen to 79 .

Blaming Islam is blinding us to the new reality","bodyText":"As terrorist attacks in Manchester, London and, more recently, Melbourne unfolded over the past weeks, we have all collapsed into bewildered dismay at the violence perpetrated. Within the horror of these events, it is clear that things have changed. Regardless of this change, the now familiar denunciations began: about the need to interrogate Islam, about the failure to hold Muslims to account, about our failure to take on extremists, and to have held too dearly to our liberal values of diversity and pluralism, and the evils of political correctness. Theresa May’s “enough is enough” heightened the intensity of these calls. I understand the sentiment. I understand the anger. I understand and agree that questions need to be asked. I don’t agree that accusations and blame are necessary or can be meaningfully apportioned. It is not an honouring of lives lost. Whether we are trying to find answers or, for some, search for reasons to voice anti-Muslim vitriol, censuring Islam results in the same questions being asked and the same accusations being made. This ignores the fact that the violence being perpetrated today has changed from what it was. To stay narrowly focused on Islam impedes our understanding of this change. We’ve come to increasingly define criminal acts as terrorism by the impact of the violence, when traditionally terrorists have been defined by their intention to change society and to force governments to act in specific ways by causing terror. Terrorism by Muslims has traditionally been a type of guerrilla warfare when one side was greatly overwhelmed by the force and power of the other. It was a strategy of war. Muslim terrorism was never and, I would argue, still is not about furthering Islam. It was almost always about land rights, theft of natural and economic resources and global monetary policies that left entire populations in Muslim countries living in deprivation and destitution. Even when the rhetoric was Muslim, terrorism was almost always in pursuit of a nationalist cause. Traditionally, terrorist organisations recruited soldiers in a way an army might – it sought out those who could be controlled and were disciplined. Those prone to indiscriminate acts of violence were excluded. What has changed is that we no longer have solider-like terrorists serving a perceived higher cause. Those being selected and aspiring to Islamic State (Isis) membership are an entirely different breed. Rather than disciplined actors, today’s terrorists are either troubled men with a propensity for violence or opportunistic criminals. In no way can this be said to meaningfully represent the higher cause of defending Islam. In the Australian context, both Numan Haider and Farhad Jabar Kahlil appeared to be profoundly isolated young men consumed by inner turmoil. Man Haron Monis and Yacqub Khayre both had a long history of violence, and Khayre struggled with a drug addiction. Many of the Australian men who travelled to Syria and Iraq have long histories of petty crime and drug trafficking or drug abuse. It is not insignificant that both gangs and terrorist organisations seek to recruit disenfranchised young men and those in prison. It is clear of Monis, because we have a lot of information about him, but it is also true of many of the men who travelled to Syria and Iraq, that their adoption of Isis’s cause was entirely opportunistic, a desire to make their violence – and themselves – matter. This confusion of intention, the meshing of personal dysfunction and pain with broader political objectives, means that Muslim terrorism has now morphed into something else. Isis’s current strategy of attacking western nations for not allowing it to invade and occupy two Muslim nations, speaks of how profoundly in flux Muslim participation in terrorism actually is. Western Muslims who travelled to Iraq and Syria had the express task of invading and occupying Muslim populations. The new hyper-violence practiced by Isis was overwhelmingly practiced on indigenous Muslim populations who viewed western Muslims as foreign invaders. Given this state of flux, different questions need to be asked. It is no longer helpful to expect Islam to explain the act of violence we see both here and in Muslim countries. This was always a practice in futility. Terrorist groups, like Isis, had such a profoundly chaotic approach to Muslim text and doctrine that it was near impossible to comprehend how they arrived at their account of Islam. The only organising principle to their reading of Islam seemed to be violence; almost everything of Islam was expelled from their reading. Speaking about terrorism as if it is something about all Muslims not only displays breathtaking irrationality, but reveals that some people cannot see beyond their own prejudice. It denies that ordinary Muslims read their faith and hear no call to violence or destruction of any kind. Perhaps part of the anger directed at Muslims is that Islam to date has not provided meaningful answers to why Muslims commit terrorism. None of this is designed to hide from the reality that currently some Muslims are carrying out terrorism. The complexity and morphing nature of what is happening now, however, needs to be acknowledged and we need to start looking at a different framework to understand our current reality."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"uk-news/2017/jun/14/im-lucky-to-be-alive-residents-tell-of-escaping-the-grenfell-tower-fire","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2017-06-14T05:50:53Z","webTitle":"'I'm lucky to be alive': residents tell of escaping the Grenfell Tower fire","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/jun/14/im-lucky-to-be-alive-residents-tell-of-escaping-the-grenfell-tower-fire","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2017/jun/14/im-lucky-to-be-alive-residents-tell-of-escaping-the-grenfell-tower-fire","fields":{"headline":"'I'm lucky to be alive': residents tell of escaping the Grenfell Tower fire","bodyText":"Residents of Grenfell Tower who managed to escape the fire that ravaged their building early on Wednesday morning have described how they fled as the blaze took hold. The survivors, whose belongings are presumed to have been destroyed, gathered in the nearby Rugby Portobello community centre where they were given water, clothes and blankets. One resident, who did not want to give his name, said he first heard a neighbour’s smoke alarm and “thought nothing of it”, but realised something was wrong when he heard a neighbour shouting. “I’m lucky to be alive - and lots of people have not got out of the building,” he told Guardian. “I’ve lost everything I own. I’m standing here in everything I’ve got.” Siar Naqshabandi lives on the third floor with his brother and had been out when the blaze took hold. “I came back at about 1.45am and saw the building was on fire. I rang him [his brother] and said, get out.” He has more family living on the 23rd floor and an uncle is still missing. “They were telling people not to leave the building,” he said. “I told them to get down. They said we’re not allowed to get out.” David Benjamin, who was staying at his girlfriend’s flat on the 4th floor, told the BBC he was asleep when he heard banging. He got up to investigate and heard a neighbour shouting “fire! fire!”. Thinking he and his girlfriend might be safer inside the flat, he went back in and phoned another neighbour who told him to flee immediately. “We put on our trainers and went outside and saw people running, there was thick smoke. Our neighbour said to get out so we rushed out and rushed down the stairs.” ‘It just caught up like a matchstick’ Another man who fled from the 17th floor said he was alerted to the danger by the arrival of fire engines. “We saw the fire engines, so we were looking outside at what’s going on. There was no fire alarms anywhere, because we don’t have a kind of integrated fire system – it’s just everyone’s house for itself. “I walked out into the common area to see if the lifts are moving, to see if people are in a hassle – nothing. But I could smell the smoke.” The man said he only saw fire when he stuck his head out of the window. “I went back inside the house, looked out the window. I started looking down the window – I had to really pull myself out to look down the window, from the 17th floor, and I see the fire blazing, and coming up really fast, because of the cladding – the cladding was really flammable, and it just caught up like a matchstick.” He said he managed to get himself and his 68-year-old aunt through thick smoke and out of the building, but said he feared for the fate of others who waited longer to make their escape. A woman at the community centre was searching for her friend’s five-year-old daughter, who had become separated in the aftermath. Ahmed Chellat had come to the Rugby Portobello with his wife to look for his brother-in-law, his wife and three children. “We don’t know what’s happened,” he said. “I asked him to come out and he couldn’t. He was advised to put towels under the doors and he said they will come for him. We’ve heard nothing.” “Last time we spoke to them was about 2.30. He said the fire brigade’s coming up to me.” Many of the survivors criticised the lack of information they were receiving. “There’s no coordination from anyone,” he said. “The police have not come to speak to us. We’ve been unable to give anyone our names.” “It’s been five hours. There’s people here who don’t have a clue if their relatives are alive or dead.” Councillor Aicha Less, from neighbouring Westminster, was delivering water and blankets at the community centre and described the situation as a “complete shambles”. “There’s been no steer, no guidance,” she said. “People have been left there, they don’t know if their relatives are in the block or not.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2017/jun/14/tennis-pro-isaac-frost-charged-with-match-fixing-after-suspicious-bets","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-06-14T06:11:53Z","webTitle":"Tennis pro Isaac Frost charged with match fixing after 'suspicious bets'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/jun/14/tennis-pro-isaac-frost-charged-with-match-fixing-after-suspicious-bets","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/jun/14/tennis-pro-isaac-frost-charged-with-match-fixing-after-suspicious-bets","fields":{"headline":"Tennis pro Isaac Frost charged with match fixing after 'suspicious bets'","bodyText":"A professional tennis player in Brisbane has been charged with match fixing after an investigation involving “star chamber” hearings by Queensland’s Crime and Corruption Commission. Isaac Frost, 28, is accused of facilitating a fix on a match at the Challenger Tournament in Traralgon, Victoria, that police allege attracted “a number of suspicious bets”. Frost, whose highest world ranking was 651, has also been charged with nine counts of supplying dangerous drugs and one of possession. Queensland police said an investigation that began last year and involved the Victoria police sporting integrity intelligence unit “led detectives to suspect that a number of people received information that the match would allegedly be fixed and subsequently placed bets through various betting agencies”. Frost, of Chelmer in inner Brisbane, was given bail after appearing in the Brisbane magistrates court on Wednesday. The Crime and Corruption Commission has held coercive hearings in relation to the investigation in which people may be charged with contempt if they refuse to answer questions, police said. Match fixing in Queensland has carried a maximum punishment of 10 years jail since 2014, when the state government brought penalties into line with other Australian jurisdictions.

That seems to be the Wallabies’ motto as they use the June Test window to develop a new attacking style of play to put an end to the All Blacks’ 14-year dominance in Trans-Tasman rugby. If the Wallabies’ 37-14 win against Fiji in Melbourne last Saturday is any indication, Michael Cheika’s side are borrowing ideas from their great rivals across the ditch to create a kind of All Blacks-lite style. But will the Wallabies be able to beat the All Blacks at their own game? The New Zealandisation of the Wallabies began with the appointment of the former All Blacks skills coach, Australia-born Mick Byrne, as their own skills coach last year. Byrne’s task was to bridge the enormous gap in that department between the two nations. The up-skilling of the Wallabies is still a work in progress, but head coach Cheika has decided it is time to make a key strategic change, adopting attack from turnover ball, a hallmark tactic of the All Blacks. During the Wallabies’ golden age from 1998 to 2001, under Rod Macqueen, the referees’ interpretation at the breakdown favoured the attacking team, which suited Australia’s patterned, multi-phase style of game. But the IRB (now World Rugby) became concerned the Wallabies were turning the game into unlimited tackle rugby league and instructed referees to emphasise the contest for possession at every phase in the game, especially the breakdown. The New Zealanders were quick to pick up on this seismic shift in the game by attacking from turnovers. Now the Wallabies appear to have cottoned onto the idea too. While none of the Wallabies’ five tries against Fiji originated from turnovers, they attacked with every possession they received when the ball changed hands no matter where they were on the field. A good example of this occurred midway through the second half when Fiji lost the ball close to the Wallabies’ line. Halfback Will Genia scooped it up and threw a long pass across the goal-line to winger Dane Haylett-Petty, who raced down the right-hand side of the field to the 40-metre line. Unfortunately, old habits die hard and Haylett-Petty kicked the ball into touch instead of turning it inside to five-eighth Bernard Foley and keep the movement alive. The problem for the Wallabies was they did not win that many turnovers at the breakdown, something Cheika would have been bitterly disappointed with. Across the park the Wallabies did not play hard enough on the ball at the breakdown, leaving it to designated fetchers such as openside flanker Michael Hooper to go scavenging for turnovers. The New Zealanders have a completely different approach with every player from No1 to 15 trained to compete at the breakdown like a backrower. Macqueen describes Kiwi players as “foracks”, a combination of forwards and backs, and that is what Australia need to develop if the Wallabies want to play a turnover game. To play a turnover game you need to make your tackles. Struggling to contain off-loads, the Wallabies missed 34 tackles against Fiji, who were unable to finish their attacking moves. If Australia missed that many tackles against the All Blacks, they would concede 50 points. The Wallabies will receive a much better indication of their progress when they play the vastly improved Scotland in Sydney on Saturday afternoon. The Scots are still smarting from their controversial loss to the Wallabies in the quarter-final of the 2015 World Cup. They were highly impressive in their 34-13 win against Italy in Singapore last Saturday, playing an expansive, up-tempo style. Motivated by their snubbing by the British and Irish Lions selectors, the Scots are the tough sort of opposition the Wallabies need to gauge whether their new attacking game is on track to take on the All Blacks."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/jun/11/bring-on-election-theresa-may-labour-ready-tory-dup-alliance","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-06-11T16:40:23Z","webTitle":"Bring on the election – whenever Theresa May calls it, Labour is ready | Tom Watson","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jun/11/bring-on-election-theresa-may-labour-ready-tory-dup-alliance","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/jun/11/bring-on-election-theresa-may-labour-ready-tory-dup-alliance","fields":{"headline":"Bring on the election – whenever Theresa May calls it, Labour is ready","bodyText":"Theresa May has spent her weekend sacking her closest advisers and carrying out an emergency cabinet reshuffle in a desperate attempt to avoid taking responsibility for a disastrous election campaign and save her premiership.

A Tory-DUP alliance will be so fragile that it may even have collapsed under the weight of disapproval from the prime minister’s own MPs by the time this article is published. The DUP holds positions that are simply not compatible with the views of many Tory MPs. It is a coalition that cannot last. Labour MPs will return to parliament tomorrow rejuvenated, re-energised and united behind Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership, our numbers swelled by 47 newly elected colleagues who reflect the diversity of our country. They include 22 new female Labour MPs – taking the total on the opposition benches to 119 – two new disabled MPs and two new Sikh MPs, including the first turbaned Sikh and the first woman to be elected from the UK’s over 400,000-strong Sikh community. Like John Major’s administration in the mid-1990s, the Tories are in office but not in power. And just as Labour MPs did in parliament in the mid-1990s, it is our job now to make the government’s job a living nightmare. We will throw ourselves into the task of parliamentary scrutiny, with every vote on a knife-edge, every line of legislation scrutinised, every minister held to account. We will expose the ideological paucity behind the prime minister’s vacuous political slogans, which failed to convince the electorate that she could be trusted to run the country. Most important of all, we will identify the handful of seats we need to gain or reclaim in order to win the next election, which is highly likely to take place this year as May’s political authority is further eroded. There are 70 SNP, Lib Dem or Tory seats with majorities of less than 4,000. We need to win 64 of them to form a government. If we can win back those who voted for us in 2015 but not in 2017 and gain some of those who backed Theresa May but are horrified by her new coalition of chaos, while holding on to those motivated to support us for the first time by Jeremy Corbyn and his message of hope, we can gain the majority that has eluded us for the last three elections. In order to do so, we also need to reassure working-class communities who traditionally voted Labour that we are serious about security and the defence of the realm. In simple terms: we need to do a little better than we did this time, and we need to make sure the Tories do a little worse. It was the prime minister who called this election, but it is the Labour party that used it to build a coalition of 12.8 million voters who rejected May’s vision of an inward-looking, intolerant and unequal Britain. Places such as Canterbury, Peterborough and Kensington, which Labour has never won before or not held for many years, responded positively to Labour’s message of hope and rejected May’s relentlessly negative campaign. By voting Labour they told her their idea of “strength and stability” is being members of a society that looks out for the old and the dispossessed and offers young people a debt-free future they can believe in. They rejected the notion that narrow self-interest is the only thing that motivates us. They endorsed Labour values of community and fairness. If we can convince a greater number of people in places such as Mansfield, Walsall and Middlesbrough – places with a history of electing Labour MPs but which rejected us this time – Jeremy Corbyn could be in No 10 by the end of the year. That is the election-winning coalition we must build over the coming weeks and months. If the whole Labour party comes together, using our bigger presence in parliament to harry, harass and harangue the Tories with fresh intensity and a singularity of purpose, we can take them apart. That’s our job. We’re all going to get on with it."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"music/2017/jun/11/sir-jeffrey-tate-obituary-letter","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2017-06-11T16:08:44Z","webTitle":"Letter: Sir Jeffrey Tate obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/jun/11/sir-jeffrey-tate-obituary-letter","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2017/jun/11/sir-jeffrey-tate-obituary-letter","fields":{"headline":"Letter: Sir Jeffrey Tate obituary","bodyText":"Sir Jeffrey Tate was much admired in Italy, and there was much affection on both sides.

First, the reign of the tabloids is over. For weeks, the ancient bazookas controlled by Murdoch, Dacre and other press oligarchs were trained on Corbyn and McDonnell, portraying them as patrons of terror and fantasists forever shaking a magic money tree. The campaign failed because the British press is more distrusted than any other press in Europe (as revealed by the 2016 Eurobarometer survey), its circulation is in freefall, and young people in particular get their news and political information from the internet. The second myth is that parties only prosper if they stick to the middle ground (usually defined as the neoliberal political consensus). Labour moved to the left under Corbyn, fought on a radical social democratic manifesto, and increased its share of the vote since the 2015 general election from 31% to 40%, denying the Conservatives a majority. The centre ground myth was built on two false premises. It ignored the continuing commitment of the majority, revealed in comparable surveys conducted since the early 1980s, to higher taxes on the rich, an activist role of government in creating jobs, and collective public provision. Labour’s social democratic manifesto connected to this tenacious post-1945 legacy that never disappeared during the era of Westminster neoliberalism. Indeed, this legacy was boosted by a youth revolt that led to the rise of a marginalised backbencher to lead the Labour party. The centre ground myth also failed to grasp that growing numbers of people have simultaneously both left- and rightwing views. There has been a rightwing movement against migrants and “shirkers”, and a leftwing movement against continued austerity politics and economic insecurity. Corbyn’s pitch to Ukip supporters was to the radical element of their contradictory makeup. It worked better than anodyne centrism would have done. The Guardian’s election editorial (2 June) suggesting that a Corbyn Labour party could be the beginning of something important stood out from the crowd. It has been seemingly confirmed by this election result which few in the political-media establishment anticipated.

They pitched up in Christchurch with six players from the 2013 tour to Australia who were making their first starts in New Zealand: if it was not quite the A-team, they brought their A-game, led around the field by authoritative, pragmatic half-backs. The first two successful Lions tours, in 1971 and 1974, had a national pair of half-backs, Gareth Edwards partnering first Barry John and then Phil Bennett, and in South Africa in 1997 Matt Dawson and Gregor Townsend both played for Northampton. Ireland’s Conor Murray and England’s Owen Farrell started against the Crusaders, resuming their partnership in Australia, although they started only one match there together and spent a total of 89 minutes together. It lasted 28 minutes on Saturday, Jonathan Davies’s head injury forcing a reshuffle with Jonathan Sexton taking over at fly‑half and Farrell moving to the midfield. It gave Warren Gatland and his coaches the opportunity to look at an attacking midfield option that the squad’s lack of time together had looked like ruling out. When Eddie Jones took over as England head coach after the 2015 World Cup, he said that attack would be the last area he looked at because it took so long to develop. It took him the best part of a year but the Lions had four weeks between getting together and the first Test with the necessary emphasis on organisation, starting with defence which in Christchurch throttled one of the most potent attacks in Super Rugby. Murray’s tactical kicking not only pegged back the Crusaders but, allied with alert chasers who cut down the space for the catcher and also blocked off room on the outside, gave them few outs. He kicked the ball on 17 occasions, more than the opposition scrum-halves in the first three matches combined, dealing with slow ball himself. Farrell’s kicking also hurt the Crusaders, but no more than his distribution. His ability to stand square and hold the defence gave the Lions width which they failed to exploit, starting in the opening minute when Davies was unable to supply George North with a scoring pass. Farrell played a minor role on the 2013 tour, starting three matches and coming off the bench in the final Test. He had been a Test player for little more than a year then, comfortable in a structured environment rather than reactive, but he is now, in the words of the Crusaders coach Scott Robertson, world class, playing what is in front of him. Farrell and Murray helped the Lions to rise a few levels above their opening two performances, controlling both the pace and the shape of the match. The tourists may not have scored a try, and their count of two in three matches will have to rise in the next two weeks, but they created more openings than the leading team in Super Rugby without trying to mimic their offloading game. The way Sexton dovetailed with Farrell gives the Lions an extra midfield option, although it will probably be activated if they are playing catch-up. Ben Te’o again showed he is more than a centre who takes the ball up the middle and keeps hold of it and the missing link in attack is understanding between players who are getting to know each other’s thinking. New Zealand will know what is coming in the first Test, as the Crusaders did. They know that the surest way to mute Murray and Farrell is to take on the Lions at their strongest point, the set pieces, a hallmark of the All Blacks through the ages. A series that looks black and red will have shades of grey as the two sides trade in deception."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/jun/11/jeremy-corbyn-young-people-lifeline-gloom-future-lifted-hope","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-06-11T16:38:48Z","webTitle":"Jeremy Corbyn threw young people a lifeline – and we took it | Ellie Mae O’Hagan","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jun/11/jeremy-corbyn-young-people-lifeline-gloom-future-lifted-hope","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/jun/11/jeremy-corbyn-young-people-lifeline-gloom-future-lifted-hope","fields":{"headline":"Jeremy Corbyn threw young people a lifeline – and we took it","bodyText":"In the early hours after the election results, the week-long rain clouds over London were dissolved by morning light, and it’s been sunny ever since. I hadn’t expected this result, so I didn’t anticipate how I would feel afterwards. I didn’t expect everything to suddenly appear in Technicolor and alive with possibilities. I’m slowly getting used to having hope and a sense of belonging. These feelings have been so absent over the past couple of years that it almost feels uncomfortable to have them. Only since the election results has it become clear to me how deadening it’s been to live under an austerity-obsessed Tory government for the past seven years. It’s been a glacial process of my insides turning grey. A social contract that promises to look after people was utterly trashed by this government, (especially by George Osborne, who is currently being reinvented as a moderate) and it seemed the only certainty was deterioration. Whenever I dared picture the future, I imagined being at the mercy of rich landlords and taking out loans to pay for healthcare, before languishing in pensioner poverty – alone, without children, because I couldn’t afford to have any. As I write this we’re still living under a Tory government, propped up by a homophobic, anti-abortion, occasionally creationist DUP. But the current arrangement looks shaky, and a general election is a real possibility. And if that happens, a Labour party running on an explicitly socialist platform could very well be elected. Even if there isn’t an election any time soon, nearly 13 million people have already voted for that platform. We are now a political constituency with power: we must be listened to, and we’ll only keep building from here. For the first time in a good few years, I’ve stopped worrying about money. I can imagine living somewhere nice without having to move to another country. I feel less worried about my parents, who could now be cared for by a properly funded NHS as they get older. I have hope that we may start taking climate change seriously, and people my age and younger won’t be left scooping out buckets of murky water from our living rooms every year. I may finally stop being a member of a sprawling precariat without sick pay, holiday entitlement or job security. It’s amazing to think my parents took those things for granted, and only now do I realise how low my expectations have been. I know these things won’t happen overnight – maybe they won’t happen at all – but finally there is the possibility of them. Hoping for a better world doesn’t feel like a cruel and futile process any more. It feels rational; it feels like something we deserve. Last night, when I was out celebrating, I met a 25-year-old woman who was in a two-year unpaid internship and still living with her parents. I spoke to a man in his 30s who said he felt like he was still living like a student. Is it any wonder that the surge for Labour was driven by people under 45? This demographic doesn’t care that Jeremy Corbyn doesn’t look like a conventional politician (they like it), or about things he did before they were even born. They just want the constant tension that pervades their lives – the tension that comes with having virtually no financial security – to be lifted. Of course they were going to vote for Labour’s offer in huge numbers. As the woman I met last night put it: “I have to vote Labour, I want to get on the housing ladder.” The commentators currently clutching their pearls about the fact that young people are apparently attracted by socialism should consider that maybe they wouldn’t be had capitalism not treated them so badly. And there’s another thing: the young who drove the surge to Labour are less likely to be hostile towards immigrants , they’re liberated in terms of sexuality , they’re more likely to be feminist – and they don’t want Britain to turn into the kitsch 1950s throwback Theresa May seemed to represent. Every young person I met who voted and campaigned for Labour did so in part because they were tired of feeling like they were marooned on an island of curtain-twitching bigots. They wanted to stop the country being flooded by the Daily Mail’s narrow-minded effluent. And they – we – are getting our wish. For the first time since David Cameron and Nick Clegg stood in that rose garden and announced a coalition, I don’t feel like the only thing I have in common with the British people is that we’re all on the same landmass. I am part of something – there is no such thing as individuals and their families, there is only society. And at long last, it’s becoming the kind of society I want to live in."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"sport/live/2017/jun/11/f1-canadian-grand-prix-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-06-11T19:58:57Z","webTitle":"F1: Lewis Hamilton wins Canadian Grand Prix – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2017/jun/11/f1-canadian-grand-prix-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/live/2017/jun/11/f1-canadian-grand-prix-live","fields":{"headline":"F1: Lewis Hamilton wins Canadian Grand Prix – as it happened","bodyText":"Well, well, well. So the race started and finished with Lewis Hamilton in control, Sir Patrick Stewart in fine spirits and with Daniil Kvyat swearing down the team radio. Thanks for your company, that was a real belter. Have fun! Bye! He then proceeds to drink the champers from his boot. A ‘shoey’ they call it down under. And oh my goodness, Sir Patrick Stewart follows suit. Honestly, that just happened. “I am proud of you for doing that,” says Hamilton. Daniel Ricciardo is smiling too. “Today I only had fun when I saw the chequered flag,” he says. “It was tough, we were defending the whole race. It was getting hot and my concentration was being tested.” And then the champagne follows. And Sir Patrick Stewart is back to – awkwardly – interview the drivers on the podium. Hamilton starts with a charm offensive for the Canadian fans. “I am over the moon,” Hamilton then says. As for Bottas, he says: “Montreal has been a good place for me, as a team we really needed this one-two”. Here come those national anthems ... Lewis Hamilton cannot stand still – he is absolutely ecstatic. Hamilton, Bottas and Ricciardo ready themselves for the podium. Sebastian Vettel’s phenomenal finish was every bit deserving of a spot there too, but he had to settle for fourth in the end. This is Hamilton’s sixth win in Canada, and his 56th race win. Not bad going, eh? “Yes, finally some points, thanks a lot guys,” says Lance Stroll, the Canadian, down the team radio. “It has taken a while,” he says, after finishing ninth in Montreal. Mercedes tell Hamilton that “was a walk in the park”. It really was too. “Fantastic job guys, great points for the team,” says Hamilton. “Well done to Valtteri as well.” “This is not fair guys, he cannot do that,” says Ocon of his battle with Perez. “This is not fair at all.” The Force India team debrief will make interesting viewing, listening etc. Hamilton has the British flag in his hands and he’ll be delighted with that. He led from start to finish and it’s a Mercedes one-two as well, with Valtteri Bottas coming in second: 1 Hamilton 2 Bottas 3 Ricciardo 4 Vettel 5 Perez 6 Ocon Ten years after his maiden win here, he has won for a sixth time in Montreal and dented Vettel’s championship lead in the process. Lap 70/70: Alonso’s engine blew up, that’s why his race is over. The final lap in Montreal is underway and Hamilton – barring something disastrous – is coasting to victory ... Lap 69/70: And there comes Vettel again, who jumps into fourth and past Perez. He was down in 18th not so long ago. Brilliant, brilliant driving by the Ferrari. Is it too late to catch Ricciardo? Lap 68/70: Fernando Alonso is out of this race. It’s not clear why, but he’s finished here. Lap 67/70: Vettel really seized upon the Force India squabbling there. Great brave, driving. That could have gone so wrong, but the German, who leads this drivers’ championship, is after every point he can get. Lap 66/70: Ocon overtakes his team-mate Perez, but as he does so, Vettel speeds forwards and forces the Frenchman off the track. Ocon is the biggest loser there. To clarify, as it stands: 1 Hamilton 2 Bottas 3 Ricciardo 4 Perez 5 Vettel 6 Ocon Lap 65/70: Vettel has a go at Ocon but it comes to nothing. Meanwhile, Hulkenberg is making headway on seventh-placed Raikkonen. Lap 64/70: Raikkonen is all very excitable down the team radio but what is clear is that he is still struggling. Could Vettel finish any higher than sixth? He has the Force Indias of Ocon and Perez in front of him. Lap 63/70: Raikkonen is losing time on Vettel. It sounds as though he has braking problems. His team are frantically trying to address them but it could be too late. Lap 62/70: “What can I do?” yells Raikkonen. As it stands, Hamilton would make some real headway at the top of the drivers’ championship. Nine points could separate he and Vettel by the close of play. Lap 61/70: Vettel seizes on a mistake by Raikkonen who makes a mess of things before the chicane and the German flies into sixth. Lap 60/70: And Raikkonen is now closing on sixth-placed Ocon. He has shaved four seconds off that gap. “Kimi, you know the score, the front of this group is the podium, let’s push on,” is the message down the team radio. Lap 59 of 70: Fourth and fifth would be alright, wouldn’t it? Force India aren’t settling for second-best as such here. Lap 58/70: Force India are doing lots of talking over the team radios but Ricciardo still has a relatively healthy half a second lead over Perez. And that’s that for Kvyat, who becomes the fourth casualty of this race. He’s retired from down in the pits. Lap 57/70: Hamilton laps Lance Stroll and there’s a thumbs up from the Mercedes driver to go with it. This is all very easy. Perez says “just give me a chance”. He has been given three laps by Force India to attack Ricciardo. Lap 55/70: “It is a waste of time, I want the chance to overtake him [Ricciardo],” Perez says down the phone. ‘Why should I let my team-mate Ocon past?’, in other words. Lap 54/70: Kvyat comes down the pits, it looks like he is in trouble. A real mess in the pits, and he may as well retire here. Kvyat asks his team to stop the engine and Kvyat will be fortunate not to finish this as a back marker, if at all. Lap 53/70: “We are the fastest out on track,” Vettel is told on the team radio, after setting a fastest lap. Ocon and Perez are still chasing the Red Bull of Ricciardo. Lap 52/70: Hamilton leads Bottas by 12secs. Ricciardo trails Bottas by 13secs. Perez is one second behind the Australian and Ocon is less than a second behind his Force India team-mate. The two are probably not close enough for Ocon to bypass Perez without the Spaniard coming to a halt. Lap 51/70: Ocon continues to shave time off the gap between he and Perez. He has gained almost a second over the past five laps. The two Force Indias are in a prime position at the moment but Ocon probably has a better chance of nipping in ahead of third-placed Ricciardo. Lap 50/70: Sebastian Vettel pits and comes out on to the track behind Raikkonen and into seventh. And on Max Verstappen retiring. “It looks like an electrical issue, it was complete shutdown,” Horner says. Lap 49/70: Christian Horner, the Red Bull team principal, says: “The tyres seem pretty durable at the moment”. He reckons degradation’s not an issue on track. “I am more worried about Force India at the moment than I am Ferrari,” says Horner. Lap 48/70: “It is really hard to lean on them,” Ricciardo says of his soft tyres down the Red Bull radio. Lap 47/70: Hamilton is still out in front and untroubled, with Bottas trailing the Mercedes by 10secs. More good progress by Lance Stroll, who has just nipped in front of 10th-placed Alonso. Lap 46/70: Vettel is driving superbly, making some real progress out on the track from sixth. At this rate, he has every chance of grabbing a spot on the podium ... Lap 45/70: Vandoorne is asked to hold up Stroll, “if you can”, in order to help Fernando Alonso. Vandoorne is comfortably outdone on pace on the chicane though and the Canadian is up into 12th in front of his home crowd. Lap 43/70: Raikkonen sets a new fastest lap of 1.15.725 on those brand spanking new ultrasoft tyres. Lap 42/70: Alonso and Hulkenberg get a little touchy-feely but the Spaniard is still just ahead of him in eighth. Stroll has another go at Grosjean and this time nips in front of the Frenchman. “Do the other cars have to stop?” asks Vettel over the team radio ... Lap 41/70: Stroll is stuck behind 13th-placed Grosjean, who had an interesting start in Canada. Meanwhile, Raikkonen pits for the second time, as does back marker Wehrlein. Lap 40/70: Hmmm ... Lap 39/70: “Is Ricciardo still in the race,” asks Steve via email. Indeed, he is up in third at the moment. Perez is on his tail, though. Meanwhile, Mercedes talk to Hamilton about Vettel’s race plan. There’s some toing and froing between them, of course. Lap 38/70: Ferrari say the issue for Vettel, currently seventh, is that he has a “damaged floor”. That’s not good news. Lap 37/70: “A cake walk for Lewis Hamilton,” says John McEnerney via Twitter. The problem for Verstappen’s early retirement? A battery problem, a loss of power in the hybrid system, say Red Bull. A real shame that after a brilliant start. Lap 35/70: So at the halfway stage, Lewis Hamilton is in cruise control. He is 9.8secs in front Bottas. Ocon, meanwhile, is struggling to get close to Raikkonen. Lap 34/70: Hamilton sets a new fastest first sector, and his Mercedes is still slightly quicker than that of Bottas. Lap 33/70: On goes the supersoft tyre, and with Ocon also pitting Hamilton comes out in front – no problem. Ocon, though, comes out behind Raikkonen but just in front of Vettel, whose seventh. Kvyat, meanwhile, is swearing down the Toro Rosso team radio. He is not a happy bunny. Lap 32/70: Bottas almost gets a chance to pounce, with Ocon appearing to lose some grip on turn 1. The Force India just about redeems himself but Bottas will take encouragement from that. Meanwhile, race leader Lewis Hamilton comes in to pit ... Lap 31/70: Bottas trails Ocon by 0.630secs. Wehrlein is the back marker, just behind Stroll who has fallen to 16th. Lap 30/70: Magnussen does well to keep Kvyat at bay but he can only hold him off for so long, with Daniil Kvyat eventually soaring into tenth. Lap 29/70: Ocon is still keeping Bottas at bay, and this is dream scenario for Hamilton. “What is Ocon doing?” asks his Force India team-mate, Perez. He seems a little bemused as to how he’s so far in front. Meanwhile, Hulkenberg overtakes Magnussen to hop into ninth. Lap 26/70: ... and now Hulkenberg zooms past Stroll, with the Williams deciding to pit after that. In second, Esteban Ocon, is yet to pit. Alonso moans to his team, “you are not giving me the right information”. Lap 25/70: Hulkenberg and Stroll are having a tasty battle for tenth. Stroll is still winning it at the moment, though. Lap 24/70: “We are thinking soft tyre for next in. Ricciardo is on it now,” Mercedes tell Hamilton. Out on track, Lewis is currently on the ultrasofts. If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it? He has just set another fastest lap of 1.16.269. Lap 23/70: With all this going on, Hamilton is going about his business quietly, still out in front. Bottas pits, but its lightning quick and he’s back out on track. Lap 22/70: Vettel now storms past Magnussen to climb into eighth. His next target? Seventh-placed Fernando Alonso. Lap 21/70: Hamilton, Bottas and Ocon, the front three, are all yet to pit. And Vettel surges past Stroll up into ninth, he has turned his race on its head. It’s a corker here ... Lap 20/70: Vettel bypasses Hulkenberg and the Ferrari now has his eyes on overtaking Stroll. Perez, meanwhile, pits and now Ricciardo pips him back into fifth place. Lap 19/70: Ricciardo pits, so Alonso surges up into fifth for now. Lap 17/70: Hulkenberg, in tenth, bypasses Stroll but then the Canadian fights back and tries to get past Magnussen. They are not giving up their places easily, though, and each car resumes its spot. Raikkonen pits, and comes back out on the supersofts. Lap 15/70: Perez and Ocon, the Force Indias, are up into fourth and sixth respectively. This could prove quite the day for the underdog, with Verstappen out and Vettel struggling down in 13th. Lap 14/70: A drive through penalty for Kvyat, for “failing to regain position” before the safety car was out on track. He had made some slightly surprising headway. Easy to see why now. Lap 13/70: 17/20 drivers remain in Montreal. Hamilton leads from Bottas out in front. Lap 12/70: Bottas is up into second then, with Verstappen finished in Montreal. It appears his car just conks out on him just as he accelerates away from the corner. Meanwhile, Hulkenberg, Ericssen and Palmer all pit. More Ferrari debris on the track too. Lap 11/70: Heartbreak for Max Verstappen: his race is over. He is livid as he makes his way out of the cockpit. The virtual safety car is in order ... Lap 10/70: Hamilton sets another fastest lap, and he is four seconds clear of the Red Bull of Max Verstappen. Lap 9/70: Christian Horner: “hopefully we can hang on and give it our best shot”. Hamilton leads, with Verstappen in second, Bottas third and Ricciardo up into fourth. Lap 8/70: To clarify, Massa is also out. Meanwhile, Vettel says “I think I have lost some front wing again, something came off, something came off”. It does not sound too good. Red Bull chief Christian Horner, says Verstappen “had a mega-start”. Indeed. Lap 7/70: Carlos Sainz trudges back to the pits with his race over after that frenetic start, which resulted in him crashing out. Listening to the team radio, Grosjean seems adamant that that clash was Sainz’s fault. Hmmm ... Lap 6/70: Hamilton sets the fastest lap to date as Vettel pits. The Ferrari has the supersoft tyres on, as well as a new nose. We have some more debris on the track too. Lap 5/70: Raikkonen runs wide into turn 7 and he is a lucky boy to still be in this race. He slams into the barrier but bounces back onto the track. As for that missing front wing, that belongs to the Ferrari of Sebastian Vettel, who now pits ... Lap 4/70: There’s plenty going on here: we have another damaged front wing, with carbon fibre flung into the air just after the restart. Verstappen, meanwhile, is straight up in the face of Hamilton, but the Mercedes keeps him at arm’s length. Lap 3/70: The safety car is still dictating proceedings out in front. Lap 2/70: “Unbelievable, I have no idea what happened,” says Massa, with that incident under investigation. It would seem Grosjean hit Massa, who then flew into Sainz. Fernando Alonso’s thoughts? “What are they doing, they need to calm down,” says the Spaniard. Lap 1/70: And we already have a safety car out on track. No overtaking for the time being. Kvyat, despite those difficulties, is up to 10th. Sainz’s race is over, Massa bumps into the Haas of Grosjean, who now comes in to pit, with a changed front wring. Wehrlein is also into the pits. A manic start in Montreal ... Max Verstappen flies up into second place out of turn 1, and Carlos Sainz is straight into the barriers. Felipe Massa looks in trouble too. Hamilton still leads. It’s blowing a hurricane in Montreal – a hay fever nightmare. There’s rubbish, dust and all sorts floating about. As the drivers set off on their warm-up lap, with Kvyat eventually joining the others, after his car initially stalled on the grid. 1 Hamilton 2 Vettel 3 Bottas 4 Raikkonen 5 Verstappen 6 Ricciardo 7 Massa 8 Perez 9 Ocon 10 Hulkenberg 11 Kvyat 12 Alonso 13 Sainz 14 Grosjean 15 Palmer 16 Vandoorne 17 Stroll 18 Magnussen 19 Ericsson 20 Wehrlein Now for the national anthem of Canada. The racing is coming up in a few minutes ... The drivers are gearing up for a minute’s silence on the track. Just before, Fernando Alonso, who starts down in 12th, says he is confident he can make good progress in today’s race. Sir Patrick Stewart is the centre of attention on the grid, with all the usual pre-race rigamarole going on. He plugs a movie or two, and that’s that. Niki Lauda’s there too. “It is going to be very exciting and I hope that Lewis can do it,” Lauda says. Circuit Gilles-Villeneuve is the setting for today’s race, named after the late Ferrari racing driver. Despite its name and history, as well as Ferrari’s swashbuckling record in Canada – they have won here on 11 occasions – their last win on this track came in 2004. Sebastian Vettel, who starts alongside Lewis Hamilton on the grid, has every chance of changing that. “I expect a close race,” the German says. “When I was going into qualifying I had not even thought about equalling Ayrton,” Hamilton says. Mercedes’ boss Toto Wolff says the wind in Montreal is “very gusty, and it makes a huge difference” despite some lighthearted jokes about English weather. Lewis Hamilton’s in the driving seat for this one. The Mercedes driver produced a stunning lap to earn pole in Montreal, and Ayrton Senna’s helmet in the process. The 30-year old helmet was a gift from the family of the three-time champion after Hamilton equalled his record of 65 poles on Saturday. It is all promising for Hamilton who has won in Canada on five occasions. Hamilton finished the session 0.330 seconds quicker than Sebastian Vettel, with Mercedes team-mate, Valtteri Bottas, taking third spot on the grid. Vettel, though, still leads the way in the drivers’ championship by 25 points before lights out this evening. Kimi Raikkonen will start from fourth, Max Verstappen from fifth and Daniel Ricciardo from sixth. The gift of Senna’s helmet, from the late Brazilian’s family had Hamilton speechless. “Wow,” he said. “I’m shaking. Ayrton, I know for many of you was your favourite driver and he was for me. He inspired me to be where I am today so to receive this is the greatest honour. “It is the most special thing I have, beyond all trophies,” he added. As I kid I thought maybe one day I can get to Formula 1 and emulate Ayrton. To equal him; I just can’t believe it.” Of his lap time, Hamilton said: “It was a sexy lap, a great lap. I can’t believe it came together so well. The team did a great job to learn from our mistakes in the last race and I really owe it all to them.” Lights out: 7pm BST"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/2017/jun/11/castleford-warrington-super-league-match-report","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-06-11T20:08:35Z","webTitle":"Greg Eden runs in five tries in crushing Castleford win over Warrington","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/jun/11/castleford-warrington-super-league-match-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/jun/11/castleford-warrington-super-league-match-report","fields":{"headline":"Greg Eden runs in five tries in crushing Castleford win over Warrington","bodyText":"Greg Eden continued the remarkable revival of his career when he ran in five tries as Castleford took another important step towards ending their 91-year wait to win the championship with a resounding victory over Warrington which left them six points clear at the top of Super League. On this form the 26-year-old winger looks capable of eclipsing the 40 tries scored by Denny Solomona last season to set the competition’s record before he departed for rugby union. This was Eden’s fifth hat-trick in six games – including a Challenge Cup treble against St Helens – taking his season’s tally to 30 in 18 league games. Castleford’s coach Daryl Powell, who recruited Eden when he was at a low point following a spell in the National Rugby League with Brisbane, said: “The people on the inside of him do an outstanding job but he’s an incredible finisher. But we were scratchy in the second half I thought, and Warrington came back at us.” Just as Powell takes great credit over the Eden project, he equally deserves plaudits for turning the Tigers into a side who are the undisputed favourites for the Grand Final at Old Trafford in October. In recent weeks his team have shown an essential hallmark of a championship team by winning when they are below their best. That was never more evident than against St Helens last Sunday and, while mesmerising in patches here, they were again far from perfect yet still ran out comfortable victors. Warrington were the last side to defeat Castleford at home, in July 2016. But the chance of a repeat here was all but over by the end of a frenetic opening quarter in which the Tigers, with prop Andy Lynch playing the 500th game of his career, had opened up a commanding 20-0 lead after the Warrington captain, Chris Hill, had been sent to the sin-bin. That early burst was typical of so many of Castleford’s victories this season where a flurry of points in a short, sharp spell have proved decisive. “It made it hard to win from there,” the Warrington coach, Tony Smith, said. His team are now 11 points adrift of the top four and it appears their Challenge Cup quarter-final against Wigan on Saturday may well be season-defining. However, there is still the possibility of last season’s beaten grand finalists facing a battle against relegation in the Qualifiers. To illustrate the gulf in class between these two sides, Eden’s five tries here were one fewer than the six Warrington have managed in their past four games combined. The early signs were ominous for Warrington when they fell behind after three minutes as Luke Gale’s kick was claimed by Eden for the first of his haul. Hill’s yellow card proved a pivotal moment, as in his absence Castleford took control of the match with tries from Eden, Greg Minikin and Mike McMeeken. Tom Lineham’s try shortly after Hill’s return reduced the deficit, although only temporarily, with normal service quickly resumed when Eden completed a hat-trick following a looping pass from Junior Moors – whose knee injury was the only blot on another successful afternoon for the league leaders. The second half was much more closely fought and Warrington managed to score the game’s final two tries through Joe Westerman and Jack Hughes, but by that stage far too much damage had already been done to their cause. Eden scored his fourth and fifth tries and, for a brief moment, it looked like he would become only the second player in Super League history after the Bradford great Lesley Vainikolo to score six in a game. That was not to be but, on this evidence, there are still plenty more to come from him this season.

Hart had just been through the videos of the two free-kicks Leigh Griffiths had put either side of him during that wild finish to England’s 2-2 draw in Scotland and there was no indication that a goalkeeper with 71 caps, nine years at this level and more clean sheets than anyone in that position other than Peter Shilton and David Seaman, considered himself to be at fault. “As a goalkeeper, you set your wall up, and sometimes there’s nothing you can do,” was Hart’s take. “He’s produced two bits of quality. They weren’t sidefoots, they weren’t curlers, they were what I call ‘heavy’ – my boring goalkeeping technical term. He put them over the wall, then they picked up pace and sometimes you have to say well done. “I went over to him at the end to say well done because that’s my personality, hate it or love it. I wanted to congratulate him and talk about it because I was interested about his thought process, too. To do it twice in a few minutes, after not really having a sniff the whole game, was a big moment for him. He took one with a minute to go in the game at Wembley and used a different technique. It’s a free shot from 25 yards and unfortunately his training has paid off. “I asked my wall to jump but not excessively because people are clever now and they go underneath, but I’ve seen it again and we would have needed four or five Peter Crouches in that wall to make a difference. What else can you say? Sometimes you just have to say well done.” And he was right, to some extent, bearing in mind the lopsided amount of attention that has been paid to Hart’s goalkeeping rather than the elegance of those strikes – first to his left, then his right – from the Scotland striker. Unfortunately for Hart, these are not the first moments that have left the clear impression he is not the goalkeeper of old and the truth is neither free-kick was aimed fully into the corner of his net. From that distance, an elite goalkeeper would not normally be beaten twice and nobody could really take issue with Gareth Southgate if England’s manager is concerned about the way Hart’s career, at the age of 30, appears to be drifting. As it turns out, Southgate will remove him from the team to play France in Paris on Tuesday, a decision that Hart did not seem to have been notified about as he talked about devoting time to studying the free-kick techniques of Dimitri Payet and Paul Pogba. That, however, is not Hart being dropped, even if Southgate is aware it might be perceived that way. “Our intention was always to give someone else a game,” Southgate said. “However it looks, I will have to ride that out. I am seeing a headline that says ‘Hart is not safe’‚ but the fact is we need competition in every position. Who knows who will be fit and available [in the World Cup]? Too many times we have got to a tournament when a key player is not fully fit. We cannot rely on one or two players.” All of which makes perfect sense now Jack Butland has recovered from his broken ankle, with Tom Heaton and Fraser Forster also in better form than England’s established No1, and not forgetting the credentials of Jordan Pickford, currently preparing for the Under-21 European Championship. Southgate’s tone was supportive, on the whole, but Hart is in a state of limbo, back at Manchester City after a patchy loan arrangement with Torino but acutely aware he has no future under Pep Guardiola, the manager who fast-tracked him out of the club. In the circumstances, with zero offers from other teams, it is probably no surprise that Hart has never fully regained his best form since the ordeal of Euro 2016. “I am sure he will be playing at a high level,” Southgate said. “He has had an important experience abroad. His contribution [for England] has been high and without his save against Slovenia we would be worse off in the qualifying group. For me, the goals were two moments of high quality, but we will look at them.” Southgate’s hope is that Hart’s club situation will be resolved by the time England resume their World Cup qualifying programme against Malta and Slovakia, Group F’s second-placed side, at the start of September. In the meantime, the former England captain Terry Butcher was among those calling for Southgate to change his goalkeeper and there was at least an acknowledgement from Hart that he was vulnerable. “This shirt’s not mine,” he said. “It’s not nailed-on mine, it’s no one’s. We’ve got high-quality goalkeepers and I will have to be playing at a good, well, at the top level, to the maximum of my ability, even to get in the squad. “I am not a robot. Sometimes I do have thoughts about it [the uncertainty]. But there is nothing to get down about. It’s another exciting adventure, another move, the next step in my career, the next challenge for me personally. I love personal challenges. I have never shied away from one and I don’t intend to now.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"politics/2017/jun/11/208-female-mps-would-cheer-emily-davison-but-the-fight-for-parity-goes-on","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-06-11T17:51:05Z","webTitle":"208 female MPs would cheer Emily Davison, but the fight for parity goes on | Letter","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jun/11/208-female-mps-would-cheer-emily-davison-but-the-fight-for-parity-goes-on","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/jun/11/208-female-mps-would-cheer-emily-davison-but-the-fight-for-parity-goes-on","fields":{"headline":"208 female MPs would cheer Emily Davison, but the fight for parity goes on","bodyText":"Thank you for mentioning that the suffragette Emily Wilding Davison died on 8 June 1913, while campaigning for votes for women (Record number of female MPs win seats in 2017 general election, theguardian.com, 9 June).

England defeated Venezuela in Suwon on Sunday to record the nation’s first victory at a major global tournament since 1966, with Simpson insisting being crowned world champions “means everything” to his young group. “I hope it has a positive impact on English football,” Simpson, the former Shrewsbury Town and Stockport County manager, said. “I do not really know what is going to come but it is part of the development that we are trying to create football players who are capable of being successful at senior tournaments and hopefully this will go a long way to achieving that. I honestly don’t know what it means for English football. But for the Under-20s it means everything. This is what we have worked so hard for.” Dominic Calvert-Lewin, the match-winner, is, along with Sir Geoff Hurst and Martin Peters, one of only three England players to score in a World Cup final. The Everton forward, who started the season with Sheffield United in League One, slotted the ball past Wuilker Faríñez in the 35th minute after the Venezuela goalkeeper had saved his first effort. “It is hard to put into words what that feeling is like when the referee blew the final whistle,” Calvert-Lewin said. “We have wanted this so much that to come back to England as part of a select few who have won the World Cup means everything. “To be one of only three Englishmen to have scored in a World Cup final is amazing. I probably should have scored the first time, to be honest. I just anticipated the keeper parrying the ball and tried to keep my composure and managed to put it away. The feeling was just relief, to be honest. I can’t remember what I did – ran to the corner flag and hit it, I think, but then all the lads came over.” Calvert-Lewin said he hoped the squad members would now be able to secure more playing time in the Premier League. “We have proved we are as good as any country and hopefully there will be opportunities for the lads next season. I have had a taste of it last season with Everton and I just want to show I am capable of playing regularly next season.” Lewis Cook, the Bournemouth midfielder who captained England to victory at the tournament, said: “It is the best day of my life so far.” Freddie Woodman, the Newcastle United goalkeeper, said: “To be champions of the world – it is amazing. Hopefully we have done a lot of people proud back home.” Simpson was asked in March to take charge of the Under-20s from Aidy Boothroyd, who moved up to the Under-21s, following a reshuffle in the wake of Gareth Southgate’s appointment as England manager in September. Southgate said the Under-20s “have raised the bar for everybody” in the wake of their achievements. Simpson said this England squad, which, as well as Calvert-Lewin, includes Ademola Lookman and Dominic Solanke, outlined their ambitions to win the Under-20 World Cup shortly after he took charge. “I asked them the question, ‘What do you think you can achieve?’ and they told me they thought they could win a World Cup,” he said. “We said if we want to win a World Cup we have to be absolutely committed from that moment on and they have been. “This is the reward for some incredible work, some incredible sacrifices, and I do not think you can get a better feeling than what that felt like at the end of the game when the referee blew that whistle. We are world champions and we have waited 51 years to be able to say that again as an England team. It is an incredible feeling and I do not think it will ever go away if I am honest with you.” Simpson also said that while it was not his team’s “best performance” against Venezuela, who had a penalty saved by Woodman after 74 minutes, he is bursting with pride after ending England’s 51-year wait to again be crowned world champions. “I cannot sit here and say I thought it was our best performance. We really had to battle in that second half because Venezuela put us under so much pressure but the players defended for their lives. I suppose to win a World Cup you have to do that. There are more ways than one to win a game of football and sometimes you have to defend and that is what we did. “I think it is a really difficult thing to put into words. I said after the semi-final that I did not think there was a prouder Englishman anywhere in the world but I think I have just topped that today. I cannot believe the feeling of pride that I have got and I know it is the same for the players.” Meanwhile, the BBC has defended its coverage of England’s World Cup victory after failing to show the trophy presentation on BBC2, insisting that almost the entire British population could witness the celebrations via the BBC red button. The BBC secured coverage of the match, which was originally only to be available on Eurosport, at a late stage. The match finished at 12.50pm and BBC2 showed some brief highlights and studio reaction before switching to coverage of the World Triathlon Series. “We showed live coverage of the whole Under-20s World Cup final, including the trophy presentation,” read a BBC statement released to the Guardian. “The BBC2 programme included reaction to the victory before we switched to the red button – which is available to 97% of the population – for the extended period up to the trophy being lifted. This allowed us to show the scheduled live coverage of the UK leg of the World Triathlon Series on BBC2.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"stage/2017/jun/11/doreen-andrew-obituary","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2017-06-11T16:31:36Z","webTitle":"Doreen Andrew obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/jun/11/doreen-andrew-obituary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2017/jun/11/doreen-andrew-obituary","fields":{"headline":"Doreen Andrew obituary","bodyText":"My friend and colleague Doreen Andrew, who has died aged 93, was an actor whose working life covered the whole period of the British regional theatre movement – from its beginnings, with Arts Council grants given to town playhouses, to the virtual ending of its central producing role in the 1990s. Devoted to regional repertory production, hers was a career in what became “unfashionable” theatre, but a theatre that played a vital part in communities. Doreen was born in Kilburn, north-west London, to teenage parents, Stanley and Ethel (nee Arthur). Stanley worked in a bank and played the violin in the evenings for extra cash, and Ethel, known as Effie, was a typist. Doreen was sent to a boarding school in Buckinghamshire, where she excelled at chemistry; during the second world war she was employed in ordnance work. After the conflict ended, she found a job as an assistant stage manager and became a bit part player in various rep theatres. She worked her way up through the ranks and by the time I met her at the Everyman theatre, Cheltenham, in 1965, where I was an associate director, she had played leads all over Britain. My memory of her at this time was of a tiny powerhouse with a wonderfully varied speaking and singing voice. I directed her at four other theatres, and during this time she played for me the headmistress in John Dighton’s The Happiest Days of Your Life, Madame Ranevsky in Anton Chekov’s The Cherry Orchard and Julia in Noël Coward’s Fallen Angels – all splendidly contrasting. Doreen was not given to theorising about acting; she commanded her craft. She understood that style was knowing the sort of play you were in, as Gielgud succinctly put it. In her working life she played leads in seasons “everywhere”, in Shakespeare, Sheridan, Goldsmith, Wilde, Shaw, Priestley, Anouilh, Tennessee Williams, Albee, Miller, for Ayckbourn in Scarborough, and at the Royal Shakespeare Company. At a Samuel Beckett season at York Theatre Royal in 1976, for David Thacker, she was Winnie in Happy Days, a performance of wonderful range, combining her great gifts for comedy with Beckettian melancholy. You could rely on Doreen always to give of her best. Together with her ironic sense of humour, which did not fail her even when the four-poster fell about her on stage, she kept above all a sense of responsibility to the play, to her fellow actors and audience. Much as Doreen thrived doing her work she found time to be on the committee of the Actors’ Benevolent Fund, and enjoyed a full family life. She met Kenneth Keeling, an actor and theatre manager, on the steps of one of the Empire theatres in London before a rehearsal, and they married six weeks later, in 1947. He died in 1987. Doreen is survived by their two daughters, Anna and Ruth, and a grandson, Owen."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"politics/2017/jun/11/brexit-lite-back-on-table-as-britain-rethinks-options-after-election","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-06-11T15:49:53Z","webTitle":"Brexit-lite back on the table as Britain rethinks its options after election","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jun/11/brexit-lite-back-on-table-as-britain-rethinks-options-after-election","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/jun/11/brexit-lite-back-on-table-as-britain-rethinks-options-after-election","fields":{"headline":"Brexit-lite back on the table as Britain rethinks its options after election","bodyText":"When even Nigel Farage concedes it might be time for Brexit-lite, it is clear that Thursday’s general election is fast scrambling what few certainties there were left about Britain’s departure from the European Union. Fortunately for a political class still reeling from the rejection of Theresa May’s full-fat plan for Brexit last week, there is rapidly emerging consensus about what the country could do instead while still respecting the referendum decision to leave. Grandees at both ends of the political spectrum have spent the weekend dusting down options for how Britain might still leave the European Union but crucially stay within the single market. The so-called “Norway option” would see Britain remain within the European Economic Area – and therefore maintain full access to the single market – by rejoining the European Free Trade Association (EFTA), along with Norway, Switzerland and others. Much discussed immediately before and after the referendum, this scenario had dropped out of vogue in Westminster because of the requirement for EFTA members to maintain a degree of free movement of people. But now it is gaining support in unlikely quarters. “I think we are probably headed towards a Norway-type situation two-and-a-half years down the road,” former Ukip leader Farage told BBC Newsnight on Saturday. “Norway is better than where we are now ... it’s certainly not where I want to finish up [but] I do think now there will be backsliding.” For remain-supporters, too, this is perhaps the best that can be salvaged from an election that nonetheless saw two parties win 85% of the vote with manifestos that called for Britain to leave the single market. “The election has not usurped the EU referendum, but it has reshaped the kind of Brexit that is deliverable politically,” agreed former Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg on Sunday. “Only a soft Brexit will now command the majority [Theresa May] needs in parliament.” Most importantly, such thinking is again finding its voice in the Conservative party. A number of serving cabinet secretaries are also reported to want to put single market membership back on the table, including the chancellor, Philip Hammond, who echoes Labour calls for a “jobs-first Brexit”. “I think what’s really clear is that the Conservative party, having failed to win a majority, now needs to work with others,” added the Scottish Tory leader, Ruth Davidson. “And that means we can look again at what it is we hope to achieve as we leave the European Union – and I want to be involved in those discussions.” The clock is ticking fast. Jeremy Corbyn wants to put the jobs-first model in an amendment to the Queen’s speech next Monday that could be the first test of May’s fragile minority government. “Brexit is the cancer gnawing at the heart of the Conservative party and unless they address that we are in a very difficult situation where it is conceivable that the next election will put Jeremy Corbyn into No 10 Downing Street,” warned Tory grandee Michael Heseltine on Sunday. The advantages of EFTA as a solution to this also include the fact that it is a relatively off-the-shelf option, invented by the UK and others in 1960 for just this purpose and not needing extensive negotiation by a government that may not survive to see it through. Although it would require Britain to subject itself to the rule of an international arbitration court, this would conveniently be called the EFTA court rather than the European court of justice. States are exempt from most of the more contentious EU policy areas such as common agriculture and fisheries policies, customs union, common trade policy, common foreign and security policy, justice and home affairs and monetary union. “The areas in which the EU does have control are largely those to do with the single market, product standards and regulations,” explained Graham Reid, co-ordinator of the EFTA4UK campaign. “In many cases these rules are simply European interpretations of standards agreed at regional or global standard-setting bodies.” Such detail was not in the referendum question and even its most fervent adherents are now having second thoughts about the practicalities. “Brexit will go ahead. I am pretty certain of that,” concluded Farage on Saturday. “Having said that, do I think now, today, that we are going to get the kind of Brext that most of the voters thought they were going to get? I think that is in peril.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/blog/2017/jun/12/busted-flush-liquid-football-trouble-sporting-statues","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-06-12T07:30:20Z","webTitle":"Busted flush: liquid football and the trouble with sporting statues | Simon Burnton","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2017/jun/12/busted-flush-liquid-football-trouble-sporting-statues","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/blog/2017/jun/12/busted-flush-liquid-football-trouble-sporting-statues","fields":{"headline":"Busted flush: liquid football and the trouble with sporting statues","bodyText":"Today at about 10am the artist Nic Fiddian‑Green will complete the installation of his latest monumental sculpture at Ascot.

It is true that Britain continues to create statues of non-sporting inspirations – the past year, for example, has seen major public works commissioned or completed of Henry VII, Victoria Wood and an otter – and also that this is not exactly a new trend. Many Ancient Greeks, after all, could hardly walk past a chunk of marble without sculpting it into a scantily clad discus-thrower. But it was more understandable then, when making a representation of an athlete out of mosaic or masonry was the closest thing they had to an instant replay. For all that both bronze and marble are materials already associated with sport, through the Olympics’ least-important medal and the game played using spherical glass objects respectively, they are two media which in their solidity and permanence seem entirely antithetical to activity. In football, and indeed most sports, being considered statuesque is an insult, yet being rendered statuesque is an honour. It is far better for an individual to be labelled quicksilver or mercurial, or for a team to be in full flow; the phrase “liquid football” might have been coined by Alan Partridge, but it is a perfectly serious aspiration. This whole sporting statue business simply hasn’t been thought through. Geoffrey Green of the Times once asked Matt Busby how he went about building a football team. Busby smiled and said: “A sculptor was once asked how he managed to turn a square slab of stone into, say, an elephant. He said: ‘Easy. I just knock off the bits that don’t look like an elephant.’” So it is that the only similarity between team sports and sculpting seems entirely philosophical. Sport is the most ephemeral of activities. Its finest moments are conjured, savoured and lost in the same instant. They live on only in the memory of those who witnessed them, where they generate a spirit of their own, foggily recalled whirlpools of emotion and incredulity. This is why, while it may be an acceptable way to honour a particularly generous chairman or successful manager, sculpture is the clumsiest and most jarring possible method of remembering a sportsman. What is beautiful when fluent and ephemeral is clumsy when made immobile and hard-edged. Some sculptors, to their credit, have realised this and – often less creditably – tried to do something about it. Omri Amrany, a “mostly self‑taught” US-based artist who has specialised in commemorative sporting statues, says he likes to “work with new approaches, like fractal geometry and my own techniques of sculptural montage”, by which he means trying to capture motion in metal. Representations of Gordie Howe and Alex Delvecchio made for the Detroit Red Wings both have multiple excess limbs and hockey sticks and appear to be being agonisingly sucked into a space vortex; for a statue of the Arizona Cardinals’ Pat Tillman he gamely attempted to create in bronze the impression of flowing hair on a sprinting athlete and succeeded in making the player look like he was fleeing a burning building with his head on fire. Most famously, the family of the Washington Senators pitcher Walter Johnson boycotted the unveiling of his statue in horror at his motion-blurred mutant right arm. Johnson’s grandson called it “hideous” and “ridiculous”. He said: “It just doesn’t work. Those big pieces of matter coming out of Walter’s shoulder look like driftwood. I really object to it. Something is really wrong.” (“This is not just about sports; it’s about art,” countered Amrany.) Amrany’s version of Josh Gibson is a little more successful, but there are still better ways for artists to recall the spirit of sportsmen. Another creative type, Daniel Sonenberg, clearly thought so: his opera about Gibson – The Summer King – premiered in Pittsburgh in April (“a serious, thought-provoking piece, musically sound and emotionally musing” according to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette), and surely had a better chance of capturing the essence of the brilliant black batter who died, drunk and drug-addled, aged 35 in 1947. There are other options, some of them very simple. A young Arsenal fan will surely find more inspiration from tapping Thierry Henry’s name into YouTube than from his superficially impressive but emotionally vacant statue of the Frenchman’s celebratory knee-slide outside the Emirates Stadium. Perhaps it’s time for sport to think outside the blocks. There will always be a place for statuary, but its use – like most sportsmen – shouldn’t be set in stone. • This article was amended on 12 June 2017 because an earlier version said Ascot’s Royal Week starts on Wednesday.

This is not going to be a repeat of the David Cameron/Nick Clegg 2010 “rose garden” coalition. A “confidence and supply” arrangement falls far short of a full-blown coalition. It does not involve an agreed five-year programme of policies and may not even involve the junior party holding ministerial office, let alone taking on the role of deputy prime minister. The 2010 Conservative-Lib Dem coalition was seen in the Tory party as far preferable to a “confidence and supply pact” with the Ulster unionists, including the DUP. As Ken Clarke “joked” during the 2010 election campaign: “In the end, you can always do a deal with an Ulsterman, but that’s not the way to run a modern, sophisticated, society.” This time, Theresa May is faced with no other option but to try for a limited pact under which the 10 socially conservative DUP MPs agree to support her government in votes that are critical to its survival in office in return for some of their policies being enacted. But it is one step away from pure minority government, such as Harold Wilson’s February 1974 Labour government, under which the largest party does no deals with any other party but instead relies on the threat of a fresh general election to keep it in office. What does ‘confidence and supply’ mean? The Institute of Government says confidence deals “typically make clear that the support party or parties must back the government on explicit confidence votes, and votes on budgets and supply (government spending). In return, the support parties are given government support for specific policy priorities.” The most recent example in Westminster politics was the Lib-Lab pact of 1977-78 between Jim Callaghan and David Steel. It lasted only 18 months. In the 1990s, John Major found that his battles over Europe and Maastricht in the Tory party, byelections and floor-crossings were whittling away his original majority of 21. In the process he became reliant on the votes of Ulster Unionists to keep the show on the road but Major refused to do any kind of formal deal. At one point, £10m was made available to subsidise heavy electricity users in Northern Ireland and a promise was made that an electricity interconnector cable would be laid across to Scotland. Such an arrangement is being used to keep the National party in in government in New Zealand in a confidence deal with the Maori party. It has also been used in the devolved administrations in Britain. In 2007, the SNP did a deal with the Scottish Greens giving them the chair of a Scottish parliament committee in return for supporting the election of Alex Salmond as first minister. How does it work on a daily basis? The advantage for the governing party of confidence and supply arrangements is that they know they are not in danger of defeat at every key vote and do not have to give up ministerial posts or negotiate their policy programme with another party. For the smaller party it means they can secure concessions on specific policies without having to sign up to the entire government programme or lose their independent voice in parliament. The disadvantage is that in areas not covered by the agreement, ie beyond the Queen’s speech on 19 June and subsequent budget, the government still needs to build an issue-by-issue coalition to get business through parliament. This also opens the door for Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour MPs and the SNP to play a far more decisive role over government legislation. The disadvantage for the junior partner is that they have to back politically unpopular budget plans and have less influence on overall policy. In order to get its business done the government also needs to get its legislation through the House of Lords, where the DUP only has four peers out of 800. What difference does the Fixed-term Parliaments Act make? The Hansard Society says it breaks the link between issues of confidence and the dissolution of a parliament. The act takes away the prime minister’s power to call a general election. Before 2011, if a government was defeated on its Queen’s speech or on its budget, it would be regarded as loss of confidence that would lead to the PM’s resignation and a general election being called. Now the opposition parties are to be given 14 days to form a government and if their alternative coalition can win a confidence vote in the Commons then they will take over without an election."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2017/jun/11/jeremy-corbyn-labour-will-call-on-other-parties-to-defeat-government","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-06-11T16:05:27Z","webTitle":"Jeremy Corbyn: Labour will call on other parties to defeat government","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jun/11/jeremy-corbyn-labour-will-call-on-other-parties-to-defeat-government","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/jun/11/jeremy-corbyn-labour-will-call-on-other-parties-to-defeat-government","fields":{"headline":"Jeremy Corbyn: Labour will call on other parties to defeat government","bodyText":"Jeremy Corbyn has said Labour will invite parties to defeat the government and vote for Labour’s manifesto in a “substantial amendment” to the Queen’s speech, as well as suggesting the party would also kill off the “great repeal bill”. “We are ready and able to put forward a serious programme which has great support in this country,” he said, though the Labour leader conceded his party “didn’t win the election”. “We are going to put down a substantial amendment to the Queen’s speech which will be the main points of our manifesto, so we will invite the House to consider all the issues we’ve put forward – jobs-first Brexit, policies for young people and on austerity,” he said. Corbyn said the great repeal bill, designed to transfer EU law into British law to enable changes to regulations, “has now become history” and said Labour would offer something different. “We will put forward a position in which we negotiate tariff-free access to the European market and legislate after that,” he said. Labour has not yet begun reaching out to other parties for support in either defeating the government or gathering support for policies in its own manifesto. Both the SNP leader, Nicola Sturgeon, and the Lib Dem leader, Tim Farron, suggested before the election that they would be prepared to lend support to legislation, but said it would be done on merit, rather than as a result of any confidence-and-supply arrangement similar to what Theresa May is seeking with the Democratic Unionist party. A senior Labour source said the party needed to wait and respond to the arrangement May came to with the DUP. “If they are able to get as far as a Queen’s speech we will amend it to take into account as much of our manifesto programme as possible, deleting, removing the absolute worst aspects of theirs,” the source said. “We feel we can build a parliamentary majority for a whole range of proposals and against a whole range of their ones.” Passing Labour amendments to any Queen’s speech is fraught with difficulty and would likely require support from some rebel Conservative MPs. The source said those conversations had not started and would hinge on how upset some Conservative MPs might be with the DUP deal. Another Labour source close to the leadership said they felt the party was still fighting to form a government. “We’re in extra time at the moment. We haven’t lost,” the source said. “Now it’s about who is the party that can put an agenda to parliament that will gain the most support. “Given the fact our manifesto was far the most popular, I think we’ve got far more chance. Half of the Tories reject their own manifesto. We are in a position to put forward policies to parliament and command support for them.” The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, also said he believed there was a majority in parliament to maintain the winter fuel allowance and triple-lock pension, two issues the Conservatives proposed changing in their manifesto. “I believe the DUP is in favour of scrapping the bedroom tax,” he said. “There’s a whole range of issues like that where we think there’ll be a majority in parliament.” McDonnell said the party planned to keep up its campaigning momentum across the country, which saw scores of young people turn out to rallies, both in preparation for a potential snap election and as a way of galvanising opposition to unpopular Tory policies. “As soon as the prime minister said there wouldn’t be a snap election, we thought there would be,” he said. “And so we, we will continue on campaigning all throughout the country. “That’s the nature of the party we are now – we’re a social movement. But we’ll be campaigning on those individual issues that we’ll force votes in parliament on as well, so we can demonstrate popular support for those issues.” The shadow foreign secretary, Emily Thornberry, said Labour was seriously preparing for an opportunity to form a minority government if May’s Queen’s speech should fail. “We’ve got Theresa May squatting in Downing Street. We’ve got a full rebellion going on in the Conservative party. We’ve got no idea as to what’s going to be in this Queen’s speech. They have a manifesto that’s been completely repudiated by the public and indeed by Tory MPs themselves, and no idea what the DUP will agree to or not,” she told Sky News’ Sophy Ridge on Sunday. Corbyn said he expected there would be another election before the end of the year. A new Survation poll for the Mail on Sunday put Labour ahead on 45% and the Tories on just 39%. It also put May and Corbyn neck-and-neck on who would make the best prime minister, with both leaders on 39%, showing a surge in personal support for Corbyn. The Labour leader said the country could not continue with such unstable government: “We have a programme, we have support and we’re ready to fight another election campaign as soon as may be, because we want to be able to serve the people of this country on the agenda we put forward, which is transformative and has gained amazing levels of support.” Asked if he was prepared to lead the party for the long term, Corbyn smiled and joked: “Look at me, I’ve got youth on my side.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2017/jun/11/richard-hammond-escaped-crashed-car-seconds-before-being-incinerated","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2017-06-11T14:26:15Z","webTitle":"Richard Hammond escaped crashed car moments before being 'incinerated'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/jun/11/richard-hammond-escaped-crashed-car-seconds-before-being-incinerated","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2017/jun/11/richard-hammond-escaped-crashed-car-seconds-before-being-incinerated","fields":{"headline":"Richard Hammond escaped crashed car moments before being 'incinerated'","bodyText":"Former Top Gear presenter Richard Hammond was seconds from being “incinerated” after a car he was driving plummeted down a hill, flipped over and burst into flames. The accident occurred in the town of St Gallen in north-east Switzerland during a shoot for his Amazon show The Grand Tour. The 47-year-old managed to escape the wreckage of a Rimac Concept One supercar worth £2m that had plummeted down the steep Hemberg Hill climb. Fellow presenter Jeremy Clarkson tweeted it was the biggest and “most frightening” crash he had witnessed. The show’s producer, Andy Wilman, described how Clarkson and James May had run to the scene as soon as it happened, fearing the worst. “When they saw the wreckage on fire they thought Richard was dead. It was really bad,” Wilman told the Sunday Mirror. “If Richard had been a few seconds slower getting out, he would have been incinerated.” “They were staggered he had got out of it alive, because there was just nothing left,” he added. Hammond was taken by air ambulance to a nearby hospital but suffered only a fracture to his knee. Wilman said the presenter was “very shaken” by the accident and was being kept in for observation. “He has been very lucky. It’s a miracle really and certainly another one of his lives gone,” he said. The crash happened when Hammond was racing the electric car along the Hemberg Hill Climb, a one-mile-long course that climbs 157 metres (515ft). The Rimac Concept One car he was driving has a 1,224-horsepower motor and can reach speeds of up to 220mph. An Amazon spokeswoman said that Hammond had been “involved in a serious crash”, adding that he “very fortunately suffered no serious injury”. “Richard was conscious and talking, and climbed out of the car himself before the vehicle burst into flames,” she said. “The cause of the crash is unknown and is being investigated.” A statement from the organisers of the mountain race said: “On Saturday, an accident took place at the Bergrennen Hemberg in a demonstration run between the training courses. The vehicle left the track and landed in the meadow. The fire brigade extinguished the burning car quickly.” The latest incident comes less than three months after Hammond was injured falling off a motorbike while filming in a remote part of Mozambique. The presenter later posted on the DriveTribe website: “Yes I fell off but yes, I’m fine. Sorry … Thanks for inquiries re my slight shunt whilst filming for GT. I can confirm that yes, I fell off a bike, many times, in fact and yes, I banged my head and everything else. But life goes on.” Hammond suffered life-threatening head injuries and brain damage 11 years ago when the car he was driving at 288mph crashed while filming a Top Gear stunt. The presenter was in a coma for a fortnight but left hospital after five weeks and eventually made a full recovery. Hammond, along with Clarkson and May, were presenters of the BBC’s Top Gear but defected to Amazon after Clarkson was fired by the broadcaster for punching a producer. The Grand Tour made its debut on Amazon Prime in November 2016. The number of viewers each episode has attracted has not been made public by Amazon, with even the presenters saying they did not know. May said: “They won’t tell us. That’s the rules and they really won’t.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"football/2017/jun/11/venezuela-england-under-20-world-cup-final-match-report","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-06-11T13:47:44Z","webTitle":"England seal Under-20 World Cup glory as Dominic Calvert-Lewin strikes","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/jun/11/venezuela-england-under-20-world-cup-final-match-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/jun/11/venezuela-england-under-20-world-cup-final-match-report","fields":{"headline":"England seal Under-20 World Cup glory as Dominic Calvert-Lewin strikes","bodyText":"England Under-20s entered the history books after beating Venezuela in a frenetic World Cup final in South Korea to ensure the nation became world champions for the first time since 1966. Lewis Cook held the trophy aloft after becoming the first England captain to lead his country to victory in a major global final since Bobby Moore. A white sea of confetti slowly filled the pitch, with each England player taking hold of the trophy on the stage swiftly erected in Suwon to kick-start the celebrations. Fikayo Tomori, the Chelsea defender, sang “championes, championes” with his winners’ medal swaying from side to side. For Joshua Onomah and Ainsley Maitland-Niles, England banners doubled up as celebratory bandanas. More than 5,600 miles away Gareth Southgate, Adam Lallana and the rest of the senior squad huddled around a laptop at their France training base – before Tuesday’s friendly in Paris – to witness the next generation write history. Southgate will speak to Paul Simpson, the under-20s manager, after the win and has kept regular dialogue during the tournament. The squad also received a pre-match good luck letter from the Duke of Cambridge. Freddie Woodman was ultimately the hero after making a superb 74th-minute penalty save to deny Adalberto Peñaranda. Woodman, the son of former Northampton Town goalkeeper Andy and godson of Southgate, made a steely left-handed save from the spot-kick after Dominic Calvert-Lewin had given England a first-half lead. Simpson, the former Shrewsbury Town manager, had urged his players to seize the opportunity and attain “legendary status” and with this victory in Suwon his class of 2017 did not disappoint. Calvert-Lewin began this season as a second-half substitute for Sheffield United in a 2-1 domestic cup competition defeat by Crewe Alexandra but finished it as only the third England player to score in a World Cup final. Calvert-Lewin, who joined Everton last summer, scored what proved to be the winning goal before Woodman’s second-half heroics. These are exciting times for England and particularly for this group. Six of this side won the Under-17s European Championship in 2014 and the attacking trio from Everton and Liverpool – Ademola Lookman, Dominic Solanke and Calvert-Lewin – had an excellent tournament. Solanke was presented with the golden boot and Woodman with the golden glove. Each player, though, proved more than their worth over a campaign that began when Simpson’s squad convened at St George’s Park on 8 May. Perhaps these are some of the fruits of the FA’s purpose-built 330-acre site at Burton-on-Trent. Simpson tweaked his lineup from the one that prevailed against Italy in the semi-finals, with Tottenham’s Onomah returning from suspension to replace Arsenal’s Maitland-Niles. Onomah strutted around the England midfield with a classy authority and rattled the woodwork with a thunderous second-half effort that pinballed from the underside of the bar and the goalline before Venezuela cleared. England played positive, attacking football and Solanke, who will formally join Liverpool from Chelsea next month, squandered a couple of early chances, scuffing his shot inside the box and skewing wide from distance with another. He then turned provider, laying off to Lookman, who held off a challenge before forcing Wuilker Faríñez, the Venezuela goalkeeper, into a two-handed save after 22 minutes. Venezuela did not shrink into their shells, however, and Ronaldo Lucena’s ambitious free-kick from 40 yards out exemplified the confidence flowing through Rafael Dudamel’s side, who beat Germany and Uruguay en route to the final. Woodman was beaten but Lucena’s swerving, dipping effort crashed into his right post. Dudamel’s involvement is a compliment to the country’s next generation, given he is also the coach of Venezuela’s senior team, who already have eyes on the 2022 World Cup after a disastrous qualifying campaign for Russia 2018. England kept knocking at the door, though, with Calvert-Lewin sending a tame header at goal before Cook, the Bournemouth midfielder, supplied the striker with a lofted pass. It was a goal that showcased all of the 20-year-old’s qualities as he outjumped Nahuel Ferraresi to win the header and shot at Faríñez with his right foot before slotting home the rebound with his left. Shortly after that Lookman supplied Calvert-Lewin with another chance but Faríñez did well to quickly stifle the onrushing striker. Venezuela never relented and Peñaranda sent a curling 25-yard free-kick agonisingly close but the Watford midfielder, with unmissable bleach-blond hair, saw his effort fly just wide of Woodman’s goal. After the half-time interval, the South American side went on the offensive. The substitute Yeferson Soteldo slid through a perfectly weighted ball for Sergio Córdova but with only the goalkeeper to beat, Woodman smothered with his legs. Then Yangel Herrera, who joined Manchester City in January – unmarked from a corner – headed downward only for Woodman to again claim the ball. Venezuela, who introduced the exciting 17-year-old Samuel Sosa late on, pressed forward and eventually carved out a golden opportunity to level. Jake Clarke-Salter, the Chelsea defender, upended Peñaranda inside the box and after consulting the threesome of video officials inside the Suwon World Cup stadium, the referee, Bjorn Kuipers, pointed to the spot. Woodman denied Peñaranda from 12 yards, with the England goalkeeper, who dived low to his right, making a strong left-handed save to claw the ball away from danger. And just like that, after this courageous, fearless display, an arduous 51-year wait is over."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"us-news/2017/jun/11/donald-trump-state-visit-to-britain-put-on-hold","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-06-12T06:27:22Z","webTitle":"Trump's state visit to Britain put on hold","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jun/11/donald-trump-state-visit-to-britain-put-on-hold","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/jun/11/donald-trump-state-visit-to-britain-put-on-hold","fields":{"headline":"Trump's state visit to Britain put on hold","bodyText":"Donald Trump has told Theresa May in a phone call he does not want to go ahead with a state visit to Britain until the British public supports him coming. The US president said he did not want to come if there were large-scale protests and his remarks in effect put the visit on hold for some time. The call was made in recent weeks, according to a Downing Street adviser who was in the room. The statement surprised May, according to those present. The conversation in part explains why there has been little public discussion about a visit. May invited Trump to Britain seven days after his inauguration when she became the first foreign leader to visit him in the White House. She told a joint press conference she had extended an invitation from the Queen to Trump and his wife Melania to make a state visit later in the year and was “delighted that the president has accepted that invitation”. Many senior diplomats, including Lord Ricketts, the former national security adviser, said the invitation was premature, but impossible to rescind once made. Trump has named Woody Johnson, a Republican donor and owner of the New York Jets, as the new ambassador to the UK but has yet to nominate him formally. A large number of US ambassadorial positions remain unfilled worldwide largely due to the Trump team failing to make any formal nominations. The acting US ambassador to the UK, Lewis Lukens, a career diplomat, clashed with Trump last week by praising Sadiq Khan, the London mayor, for his strong leadership over the London Bridge and Borough Market terror attack. His remarks came just days after Trump criticised Khan for his response to the attack, misquoting the mayor’s message to Londoners not to be alarmed by the increased presence of armed police. Khan’s office pointed out Trump’s error later but the president responded by accusing London’s mayor of making a “pathetic excuse”. Khan then called on the UK government to cancel Trump’s invitation. No date had been fixed for the visit. The Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, said on Twitter that Trump’s decision was “welcome, especially after his attack on London’s mayor &amp; withdrawal from #ParisClimateDeal.” A Downing Street spokeswoman said it would not comment. “We aren’t going to comment on speculation about the contents of private phone conversations. The Queen extended an invitation to President Trump to visit the UK and there is no change to those plans.” The White House said in statement: “The President has tremendous respect for Prime Minister May. That subject never came up on the call.” Jenna Johnson, a Washington Post reporter tweeted to say that the White House press secretary had told her the Guardian’s report was “false” but added that the White House “won’t say when Trump plans to go to the UK”. Later, The New York Times, citing two unnamed administration officials, reported that Trump was considering scrapping or postponing the trip. The officials stressed that he might yet “warm to the idea” but that keeping it off the schedule was the best approach. The UK’s traditional effort to act as a bridge between the US and Europe has become more complex since the vote last year to leave the European Union and Trump’s support for policies that have angered European allies. The Foreign Office was disappointed when against its pleading Trump went ahead earlier this month with his plan to pull the US out of the Paris climate accord. The UK had lobbied hard for Trump not to take the decision, which has led to a wider break between the EU and the US. Trump had been an advocate of Brexit, and at one point seemed to want the EU to break up, but confidence has since returned to the bloc with pro-European Emmanuel Macron’s victory over far-right Marine Le Pen in the French presidential election.

Here’s the education they really need","bodyText":"It’s only after you have left school and, in adulthood, gained a bit of distance, that you can be fully aware of the gaps in your education. History is a prime example. A group of British people together around a pub table and can probably weave together some kind of cohesive narrative across the centuries. In isolation, however, what you discover is that one person did the Romans, another the second world war, and a third spent two years on medieval crop rotation. Meaning that as a school leaver, you’ll have a vague idea about how it all fits together, but whole epochs remain shrouded in mystery. That’s not to say that we should return to rote learning in the kind of system envisaged by Michael Gove. An ability to memorise dates informs little about the intellectual potential of any pupil. It just tells us that they are good at retaining information. But what the history problem does illustrate is that what you learn at school is entirely dependent on where you end up, how good your teachers are, which exam board they are using, and whether your school is well funded or deprived and stretched for resources. In an ideal world the education system would be radically overhauled, to deliver a truly national curriculum; where a child in one county has as much right to learn Spanish as a child in another. Options would not be closed off simply because of the catchment area. Furthermore an interest in, say, drama, would not preclude a pupil from also studying geography. A greater portfolio of core subjects would not only be available, but would also prevent pupils from being forced to narrow down their options at an age when they don’t yet know who they really are. As with the French baccalaureate, they would have a range of subjects to choose from based on their strengths, but they would also be required to study a number of key subjects regardless of chosen streams. French students are able to choose from a range of living European languages, regional languages and others such as ancient Greek or Latin. Such options are rarely available to children at state school in Britain. I would introduce a mandatory reading scheme, where older children spend time each week reading with the 11-year-olds who have just started secondary education. We did this at my school in an attempt to improve literacy and it was a great initiative, helping children grow in confidence. I would also reintroduce the books Gove dispensed with, such as To Kill a Mockingbird and Of Mice and Men – books that teach the importance of kindness and tolerance. English would have more of an emphasis on diverse voices and more modern literature. In science, there would be more practical work (a 2017 Wellcome Trust report found that pupils in deprived areas were much less likely to report having designed and carried out their own experiments), more trips to science museums, and a thorough teaching of evolution. Girls would be encouraged to pursue Stem (science, technology, engineering and maths) subjects. Maths would have more of a practical focus on practical applications, such as interest rates on credit cards. Adult skills, as part of an improved personal, social, health and economic (PSHE) curriculum, would teach the ins and outs of a consumer credit agreement, how to do a tax return without having a nervous breakdown, and the implications of credit card debt. Information technology would be integrated across most subject areas, and pupils would be taught to code. There would be a range of practical workshops in plumbing (everyone should know how to unblock a toilet), design and technology, woodwork, and art and graphics. The Conservatives may have finally yielded on the need for compulsory sex and relationships education – and it is essential – but pupils deserve more than just the mechanics. SRE would include sexual consent and the importance of respecting boundaries; contraceptive options; domestic violence and what a healthy relationship looks like; female genital mutilation; child marriage; LGBT issues; the importance of female pleasure; and all the technological advances with which young people are grappling, such as sexting, social media and pornography. It would follow on naturally from the foundations laid in primary school, with pupils from the age of four onwards receiving age-appropriate relationship education, as in the Netherlands – where this contributes to the very low teenage pregnancy rate. My revamped PSHE would emphasise the need to support those with poor mental health, and would encourage boys to feel able to express their emotions in a non-judgmental space. Because eating disorders, gym addiction and steroid abuse still loom large for many teenagers, body image would be a discussion topic for both sexes, including airbrushing and the role of social media in forming perceptions of what a desirable body looks like. PSHE would also include more cookery and nutrition classes. In this age of soaring teenage obesity, teaching pupils how to cook from scratch and how to have a healthy diet is a matter of urgency. This would take place in combination with expanded PE classes – without such an emphasis on team sports (those of us who regularly caught the ball with our faces still wince at the memory of hockey, netball or football) and dreaded cross-country. Dance, swimming, yoga, climbing and high-intensity interval training would also feature. In addition, pupils would be encouraged to spend more time outdoors, and there would be greater collaboration with organisations such as forest schools. Young people have felt alienated from party politics for too long. Jeremy Corbyn may have reversed that trend, and those of us who work or have worked with young people knew that alienation was not about apathy or lacking passion; young people just felt that institutions of power didn’t have anything to offer them. Politics and citizenship classes could of course teach the mechanics of power – how laws are made, what first-past-the-post entails, how the justice system works – but it would also teach activism. The aim would be to get pupils discussing the things that matter to them – sexism, racism, homophobia, housing, poverty, the environment – and examine why it is that their voices are so often ignored. There would be an in-built understanding of privilege and social mobility, and pupils would be encouraged to make themselves heard by writing to their MPs, composing speeches, launching their own campaigns and undertaking volunteer work. The focus of any curriculum should not simply be on attainment and “resilience” – the current buzzword – but on producing confident, well-rounded citizens who feel as though they belong and have value in society. As in France, students would study philosophy, allowing them to enter work or higher education (if they chose to do so) with the ability to construct an argument logically, and critically examine the media that they are presented with (so thatattempts to manipulate voters – on the basis of fear of immigration, say – will fall flat). As this is a utopia, I’d also ensure that those on free school meals don’t have to use a separate canteen, as happened at my school, thus marking them out as the poor kids. I’d bring back the education maintenance allowance in England. And I’d have teachers addressed by their first names. But most important, continuous assessment, practicals and oral exams would measure achievement, along with written papers. No one would be made to feel that they had been written off or that they were a failure because of their inability to retain and regurgitate facts."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"environment/2017/jun/19/thrall-nightjars-ghostly-song-country-diary","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-06-19T04:30:26Z","webTitle":"In thrall to the nightjar's ghostly song","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/jun/19/thrall-nightjars-ghostly-song-country-diary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/jun/19/thrall-nightjars-ghostly-song-country-diary","fields":{"headline":"In thrall to the nightjar's ghostly song","bodyText":"We found the nightjar on the edge of a young conifer plantation, just before 10pm. The weather rumbled ominously in the background as dusk settled around us, the trees soughing and shushing in the breeze. Willow warblers carolled in the canopy and a fat woodcock roded over. Luke lit a cigarette, I slapped at midges. We saw the nightjar before we heard him (which is unusual). Just enough light to see white wing patches, plumage like wave ripples on sand. He flew over, tentative, circling, standing on the handle of his tail and clapping his wings a few times, before arrowing off into the trees. Bedgebury’s 2,600 acres of rolling woodland, which includes the 320-acre National Pinetum, is one of the best spots for nightjars in the south-east, and Luke Wallace of the Woodland Trust and I were there for the annual nightjar survey. Caprimulgus europaeus is a bird with a mystical aura. Partly for its crepuscular habits and sphinx-like appearance, but mostly for its song. William Wordsworth described its bubbling call as like “the spirit of a toil-worn slave, / Lashed out of life, not quiet in the grave”, nodding to its nickname whip-poor-will (an American relative of our nightjar is still called by that name). He might also have been thinking of the legend that unbaptised children were turned into nightjars when they died. The song is that wraithlike, that hackle-raising. Our nightjar began to sing deep within the conifer thicket. We moved closer, stepping into the embrace of medicine-scented branches. As if wanting us to appreciate more fully the weird loveliness of its song, the nightjar flew towards us and settled on a branch above, letting forth a volley of ghostly churrs. For five or six minutes we lived nowhere but inside that eerie stream of sound. Back in my car I put on Joanna Newsom’s Divers, in which the nightjar is a kind of fluttering familiar. I rolled down the windows. Rain came, and thunder, and even over it and the music, I could still hear the nightjar calling, somewhere in the dense and ancient forest.

First of all, there is the reality of parliamentary maths. When I heard that exit poll at 10pm last Thursday, I was as thrilled as anyone on the progressive side to think that the anticipated Conservative majority wouldn’t be delivered. But as the dust settles on a totally unexpected result, we have to be honest about the challenges ahead. Yes, the Tory majority has been cut, but progressives still do not hold the keys to Number 10 and the potential influence of the climate-change-denying, abortion-blocking, homophobic DUP on policymaking is truly horrifying. It is incumbent on progressives in the House of Commons to work together to oppose the cruel agenda of those in government and to build a vision of a more confident and caring Britain. Second, I know that the progressive alliance helped us reduce the Conservative majority. At this election, what was new was not the idea of an alliance, something that has been talked about in the run-up to most recent elections, but the fact that the first step was made towards one. It was a tentative step but a step nonetheless. Twenty-four brave Green parties in marginal seats made the decision to stand aside to give a more viable candidate who supports electoral reform a free run at beating the Conservatives. Out of those seats, 10 went to either Labour or the Liberal Democrats and half of those were gains. I count every seat that was taken from the Conservatives as a victory. But just as important as individual examples of successful alliances is the impact that the decision made by those 24 parties had on the national conversation. Someone had to move first on the progressive side if an alliance was ever going to be tried and I am proud that we were the ones who did so, despite the hit in votes that we inevitably took. We’ve broken the seal. We’ve made our commitment to a better politics clear and we’ve helped to put collaboration and co-operation in politics on the agenda. This was about doing politics differently and it’s not just election results that are the measure of success. It’s the numbers of people who knocked on doors for parties other than their own, who came out and got involved in an election campaign for the first time and it’s the sense that politics has become something hopeful and positive again – that we, the people, own and make, not the rich donors and shady establishment forces. A majority of people in Britain have embraced a more plural and open politics and it’s critical that what happens next continues to build that vision. To do otherwise would be both a massive disservice to democracy and to misunderstand that the Corbyn effect is just one wave in the tide of change. I hope, therefore, that Labour and the Liberal Democrats will look at this election result and think what might have been. One of the priorities for a progressive alliance is to get electoral reform. The Conservatives have absolutely no intention of changing our voting system because it locks in two-party politics, which helps to keep them in or close to power. A cynic might also say that Labour have never been fully committed to it for the same reason. But, as in 2015, the translation of votes to seats in this election proves that the introduction of proportional representation is essential if we are to have a truly representative democracy in Britain. Make Votes Matter estimates that, had this election been run under PR, the Conservative lead over Labour would have been slashed to 16 seats. The Greens would have won 11 and our combined total, along with Labour and the Liberal Democrats, would have easily surpassed the Conservatives. A progressive government could have happened. Getting more Green MPs into parliament is essential: to give a voice to bold ideas such as a four-day working week and to secure action on climate change. In opposition, we would strengthen the progressive’s side; in government, we would embolden them. Whether the next election happens in five months or five years, I know that the actions we have taken at this election will have left their mark and will have taken us closer not only to getting more Green MPs on green benches but also forging a stronger, bigger and better progressive force in British politics."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/jun/10/forget-culture-wars-general-election-about-power-cash-opportunity","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-06-10T23:05:39Z","webTitle":"Forget culture wars, the election was about power, cash and opportunity | Tim Bale","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jun/10/forget-culture-wars-general-election-about-power-cash-opportunity","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/jun/10/forget-culture-wars-general-election-about-power-cash-opportunity","fields":{"headline":"Forget culture wars, the election was about power, cash and opportunity","bodyText":"Bliss was it in that dawn to be alive,” wrote Wordsworth, “but to be young was very heaven!” OK, maybe that’s going a little too far, especially if you didn’t get a wink of sleep on Thursday night. But still. If you were aged 18-24 and you voted, then you probably felt pretty pleased with yourself on Friday morning. Younger voters, it seems, were the key to Jeremy Corbyn feeling like he has won when he has lost. Cue talk of the personality cult surrounding Labour’s sainted leader, of social media memes shared by tech-savvy digital natives and the revenge of young remainers angry that their future had been stolen from them while they weren’t looking (and in many cases, if they’re honest, not voting) in the EU referendum last summer. But maybe something more fundamental – more Marxist even – is going on. Perhaps the apparent novelty of all the above risks distracting us from a rather more material explanation for what happened on Thursday and therefore for how politics will play out from now on. Maybe we have grown so used to asserting that politics these days is all about culture rather than cash, about open v closed rather than state v market, that we’ve underestimated just how much the economy will continue to play a role, particularly when its largesse (or otherwise) is so unevenly distributed between classes and demographics. We’ve seen the evidence for that inequality of opportunity, of earning power and of ownership – some of us with our own eyes, some of us in the pages of this very newspaper. But this election, especially after seven years of austerity falling disproportionately on the young and “the just about managing”, may turn out to be a tipping point, something that takes us back to the future. In the wake of the global financial crisis, much ink was spilled in trying to explain why the right rather than the left seemed to benefit electorally when careless capitalism was so clearly to blame. Certainly, one factor was the reputation of the former (more rhetorical than real, it has to be said) for balancing the books. Keynes may have been correct to argue that the worst thing to do in the teeth of slowdown is to stop borrowing and spending. But convincing most of us that the nation’s economy is not the same as our household’s is a famously hard sell, hence the infuriatingly persuasive power of the repeated accusation that Labour had “maxed out the nation’s credit card”. But that was a long time ago, an emergency, whether imagined or real, that had to be dealt with, not an agreement on the part of voters to year after year of manifest underfunding of core public services. Some on the right were clearly hoping that, after a while, this would become “the new normal”, accepted as an inevitable part of our daily lives, helping to keep taxes low and encouraging more and more of us to opt out into the private sector. But it turns out that, in Britain, at least, our sense of what the state can and should provide still runs pretty deep. As a result, just as has happened towards the end of every other period of Conservative government since the Second World War, a counter-reaction has begun to set in that anyone wanting to understand politics going forward has to understand. What is initially swallowed as good housekeeping eventually comes to seem like an ideological attempt to arrest the growth of the welfare state or even to shrink it, producing healthcare and education systems that increasingly, manifestly and tangibly fail to meet rising demand and expectations. Previously, this pattern played out over a longer period of time: 13 years between 1951 and 1964; 18 between 1979 and 1997. But the current correction has kicked in after just seven. First, because of the speed and scale of the retrenchment attempted by the Conservatives after 2010. Second, because that retrenchment has been going on (in marked contrast to the 1950s and 1980s) while growth, particularly real wage growth, has been anaemic to non-existent. And, third, especially (but not exclusively) for younger people, housing has become less and less affordable, employment less and less secure and personal debt an ever-growing, sometimes gnawing worry. But there is one more, essentially political, reason for the process being short-circuited this time around. It’s not just because Theresa May chose to call the election three years earlier than she needed to. It’s that her predecessor, David Cameron, came to power posing as a new kind of Conservative, creating expectations by no means all of which he had any genuine commitment to fulfilling. For well-heeled, well-educated voters, those expectations revolved mainly around promises of a more social-liberal, cosmopolitan stance that would consolidate, even extend, the achievements of the Blair era on gay rights, gender and ethnic equality, justice, civil liberties and Europe. With the signal exception of the last, as well as on immigration, those promises were basically met. But then along came Theresa May and the detoxification process looked as if it were not only stalling but being thrown into reverse. Far more important, but far more frequently forgotten, were the expectations that Cameron’s Conservatism was all about embracing rather than rejecting the idea of the fabled centre ground, a claim neatly symbolised by his first setpiece party conference speech as Tory leader. “Tony Blair,” he cried, “once explained his priority in three words: education, education, education. I can do it in three letters… NHS.” Allowing those words to ring more and more hollow, bleating about “ringfencing” and “record amounts of money” while people’s lived experience of increased waiting times and the rest told them something very different was going on, was something the Conservatives should never have allowed to happen. But they did, slipping back into presenting the essential choice in British politics as, to quote Maurice Saatchi, “efficient but cruel” Tories v “caring but incompetent” Labour. That depressingly reductive war cry worked in 2015 – but only just. Which was why many genuinely centrist Conservatives, even those who rather regretted Cameron’s self-imposed passing last year, fooled themselves into thinking that a couple of speeches, one in Birmingham and one on the steps of Downing Street, meant Theresa May (she was the future once!) was going to be canny enough to press the reset button. Brexit might mean Brexit, they reasoned, “control” might be brought back but so, too, would the message that the Conservatives genuinely believed in high-quality, well-funded public services. But a mixture of ideology and complacency – bolstered by the belief that Corbyn would be even easier to beat than Miliband, that banging on about Europe and immigration would win back Ukip voters, and that the Lib Dems were all but dead – seems to have put paid to the emergence of a genuinely post-Thatcherite Conservative party. This suits Labour as it’s currently configured. Denouncing “the same old Tories” is the political equivalent of painting by numbers on Britain’s left. It neither requires nor generates any new thinking, especially when the weakness of other progressive parties – the Lib Dems, the Greens and, to a lesser extent, the SNP – gives Labour a virtual monopoly on outrage. Meanwhile, its laudable, but hardly revolutionary, desire to show that it stands for “the many not the few” encourages Labour to adopt something-for-everyone policies focused on fairness rather than developing the kind of productive, high-skill social market economy likely to generate the wealth and security, and to pay for the public services, which most voters understandably crave. All this means that we are confronted with the prospect of Britain’s two biggest parties being incapable of securing a parliamentary majority even for the second-best solutions they stand for. This might not be so bad if the electoral system and political geography that helps produce that situation did not also mean that the parties on their flanks lack the mainstream views and/or the Westminster seats to resolve it – in a manner consonant with the peaceful coexistence in Northern Ireland and the have-our-cake-and-eat-it Brexit that the majority of voters seem to want. Politics now and in the future will revolve around interests as well as around identity, but it is badly blocked. After Corbyn’s victory of sorts and May’s equally equivocal defeat, talk of a new centre party has melted like snow in spring. That could be a pity: it might still turn out to be just what Britain needs to clear that blockage."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"politics/2017/jun/10/readers-on-the-general-election-fallout-may-wont-survive","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-06-10T14:25:37Z","webTitle":"Readers on the general election fallout: 'May won't survive'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jun/10/readers-on-the-general-election-fallout-may-wont-survive","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/jun/10/readers-on-the-general-election-fallout-may-wont-survive","fields":{"headline":"Readers on the general election fallout: 'May won't survive'","bodyText":"Theresa May’s joint chiefs of staff have both resigned, but our readers remain unconvinced that the prime minister will survive long in the job.

Now what?","bodyText":"The Cleveland Cavaliers are still the NBA’s current champion with essentially the same team from last year’s title and it was particularly cruel they had to spend three days at home enduring a debate about whether these Golden State Warriors are the greatest team ever. What happened Friday night with Cleveland’s 137-116 Game 4 trampling of the Warriors shouldn’t be a surprise. Did everyone really think Golden State – as good as they have played – are that much better than the Cavs? The Warriors might have two of the game’s three top players, but LeBron James is still the best of his generation. And though he tried to pretend late Friday night that he missed all the chatter of about Golden State’s historical brilliance, he certainly picked up enough to carry a grudge as big as the arena into Game 4. “Some of the other guys heard it and told me that they wanted to celebrate on our floor once again and they wanted to spray champagne in our locker room,” said James, who seemed specific on details despite his protests that he wasn’t listening to the talk about Golden State’s dominance. He even had an obvious culprit. “I think it came from (Warriors forward) Draymond (Green),” James added. The most honest words uttered so far in these finals came from Cavs guard Kyrie Irving who said: “We see everything, I’ll be sitting up here lying (if I said) we didn’t see it.” If there is one truth about today’s NBA players it’s that they read and hear every word said about them. Players are constantly griping about seemingly innocuous lines from weeks-old stories or stray comments thrown out on radio shows. The idea they slip themselves into cocoons, blacking out a media world swirling around them, is a farce. What they don’t see on their computers or glimpse on television is fed to them by an armada of sycophants eager to deliver any news that might catch the player’s attention. In other words, the Cavs – who still possess the most recent Larry O’Brien trophy – were well-aware that the Warriors have become the Showtime Lakers, Jordan Bulls and 1960s Celtics all in one. They also heard a lot of talk about how they were going to lose these finals in four games and that they were done as any real championship contender for the next few years. When asked what part of the Warriors talk upset him most, Irving said: “All of it.” “It’s part of the game, I understand that,” he added. “But we knew what we were faced with, that’s what it was. But then you add, of course, some chatter out there and that adds some extra motivation. And you give us a day in between and we were ready to come out - especially me because that taste wouldn’t have been the same if we would have lost tonight and they would have celebrated on our home floor. So I’ll just leave it at that.” The Warriors are a great team, they are probably the best team the league has seen in 20 years. They set the NBA record for regular-season wins last year and then got even better this year by adding Kevin Durant. Heading into Friday night, they had stormed through the playoffs with 15 straight victories, 30 wins in 31 overall, and it was plausible for people to wonder if they could become the first team to go 16-0 in a postseason. They are all but certain to win these finals. While last year’s team blew a 3-1 lead to these same Cavaliers in a similar situation (with two of the next three games in Oakland), the fact Golden State won Wednesday’s Game 3 makes everything different. There is a big difference between going up 3-0 in a series as the Warriors did this year as opposed to losing Game 3 as they did last spring and having to fight back to go up 3-1. Golden State are too good to lose four straight to Cleveland. The Cavs aren’t strong enough defensively to stop this Warriors team. They have too many weapons. But this expectation that Golden State were going to sweep Cleveland always seemed far-fetched. Remember, the Warriors – for all their dominance this spring – were down 25 points to San Antonio in Game 1 of the Western Conference finals and came back to win only after Spurs star Kawhi Leonard was knocked out of the series with a sprained ankle. Golden State probably would have won that series even if Leonard hadn’t been hurt, though it would have been more of a grind. And there wouldn’t have been any talk about the Warriors being the best team ever. A lot went against the Warriors on Friday. The crowd was extra loud, there were several early fouls called on the Golden State players that seemed to upset them and the Cavs hit 53% of their three-point attempts. They even feared they had lost Green for Game 5 for a second straight year when he appeared to draw his second technical and an automatic ejection, but the officials later said they had given Green’s first technical on Friday to Warriors coach Steve Kerr. A huge break for Golden State. But Game 4 was about the league’s current champion refusing to cede historic greatness to a team they beat last spring. “They were aggressive, you have to give them some credit,” said Green, who nonetheless still complained that so many Warriors were in early foul trouble that they couldn’t be as aggressive as they wanted. There’s still some pride in Cleveland."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"politics/2017/jun/10/nick-timothy-fiona-hill-resigns-prime-minister-theresa-may-election","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-06-10T12:54:03Z","webTitle":"May removed Nick Timothy and Fiona Hill 'under threat of leadership bid'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jun/10/nick-timothy-fiona-hill-resigns-prime-minister-theresa-may-election","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/jun/10/nick-timothy-fiona-hill-resigns-prime-minister-theresa-may-election","fields":{"headline":"May removed Nick Timothy and Fiona Hill 'under threat of leadership bid'","bodyText":"Theresa May has given in to angry pressure from Conservative MPs and ministers to remove her closest advisers from government, amid warnings that failure to do so would trigger an immediate leadership bid. Nick Timothy and Fiona Hill, who had jointly acted as chiefs of staff in Downing Street, offered their resignations after the prime minister’s snap election resulted in the Conservative party losing hold of its majority. Many politicians have been angry about their closed style of government amid allegations of bullying by Hill, with claims she had screamed and sworn at Cabinet members, and would loudly castigate members of staff in meetings. The critics had demanded that the pair must go if May wanted to avoid a quick leadership contest in which Boris Johnson and others would be likely to stand. It is thought that Graham Brady, who chairs the 1922 committee of Conservative backbenchers, had raised the concerns of colleagues at a meeting with the prime minister on Friday. In a statement, Timothy admitted that the party had failed to present a positive image, and said that he regretted failing to initially include a cap in the controversial social care plans that forced a mid-campaign U-turn. He insisted the policy was not his pet project – as had been depicted – but added: “I take responsibility for the content of the whole manifesto, which I continue to believe is an honest and strong programme for government.” The adviser, who is nicknamed Rasputin by some Tories, argued that, while he was disappointed by the result, colleagues ought to consider that the party secured 13.6m votes, higher than Tony Blair won in three successive elections. “The reason for the disappointing result was not the absence of support for Theresa May and the Conservatives but an unexpected surge in support for Labour,” he said. “One can speculate about the reasons for this, but the simple truth is that Britain is a divided country: many are tired of austerity, many remain frustrated or angry about Brexit, and many younger people feel they lack the opportunities enjoyed by their parents’ generation.” Hill said it had been a pleasure to serve in government and work for a such an “excellent prime minister”. “I have no doubt at all that Theresa May will continue to serve and work hard as prime minister – and do it brilliantly.” The pair had been the source of huge anger across the party after a stuttering campaign, up against a positive and vibrant effort from Labour’s Jeremy Corbyn, resulted in May losing a 20-point lead in the polls and delivered a hung parliament. There was particular anger at Timothy for the inclusion of the social care policy, and for the failure to address anti-austerity demands by making the case for fiscal discipline. In an immediate response to the news, one Tory MP sent a message claiming: “Rasputin had gone! There is a God. :).” Ben Howlett, who lost his Bath constituency in the election and who has previously spoken out about bullying and harassment in the youth wing of the Tory party, said: “In the national interest, the prime minister has put the country first and given the scale of the task ahead she has made the right choice to remove her two key advisers.” A MP from northern England, where the party had expected to make significant gains, added: “The sacking of Theresa May’s two advisers is much welcomed by Tory MPs. Those two have been instrumental in delivering the worst Conservative election campaign in living memory. Hopefully the PM will now begin to listen to her colleagues who are more in touch with the electorate than rely on a small group of out-of-touch advisers.” One minister claimed that colleagues had never wanted an early election, and had made that a condition of supporting May’s initial leadership bid. The Guardian has been told that the prime minister did not want to push ahead with it, but was persuaded to do so by aides, including Hill and Timothy, and by cabinet members. However, Labour’s deputy leader, Tom Watson, told the Guardian that the buck ought to stop with May herself. “Even with these resignations, Theresa May cannot avoid responsibility for her own defeat. She is the one who asked the people for a vote of confidence in her leadership. She was rejected at a general election. Without a mandate and with no authority she will remain a lame duck prime minister until she resigns,” he said. Supporters of the pair told the Guardian that they had been unfairly targeted following the election campaign. They pointed the finger at Australian strategist Sir Lynton Crosby instead, claiming he had insisted on relentless negative attacks and a heavy focus on May, despite it making her feel uncomfortable. They also accused him of telling colleagues that a manifesto was a “sideshow” in campaigns, and that the only aim should be to stick to a single message. Crosby is also damaged from the election result, and could face questions about his style after the negative focus of both the 2012 mayoral contest between Boris Johnson and Ken Livingstone and the 2015 general election. His company was also linked to the Tory effort against the London mayor, Sadiq Khan, which many felt had descended to dog-whistle politics that focused on the Labour politician’s race and religion. However, both Timothy and Hill were personally criticised during the campaign. Timothy was accused of failing to consider the political fallout of a social care policy, which targeted elderly voters who are considered core Tory voters, and failing to include any retail offers for MPs to sell on the doorstep. Hill, who was in charge of communications, was accused of failing to allow other cabinet members to carry out interviews and of treating journalists badly. She also initially blocked Sky News from joining the prime minister on her battle bus and refused to give the channel cabinet interviews, allegedly because she wasn’t happy with their political reporting. The result fallout triggered a string of accusations about Timothy and Hill being made public. One cabinet minister called on the prime minister to sack the “monsters who propped her up and sunk our party”. By Saturday, Katie Perrior, the former director of communications in Downing street, broke cover to accuse the pair of treating cabinet members in a “rude, abusive, childish” way. She described them as “great street fighters but poor political leaders,” saying: “What I could never work out was whether Mrs May condoned their behaviour and turned a blind eye or didn’t understand how destructive both were.” She said the prime minister now desperately needed people with “charm and diplomacy” around her. Joey Jones, a former spokesperson for May when she was home secretary, echoed that assessment in a piece for PoliticsHome in which he said that they were good at their jobs but could be “unacceptably aggressive”. He added that they exhibited a “desire for total control” and said that “under pressure, it looks like a model that is intolerant of reality”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2017/jun/10/how-to-detect-potential-terrorist-heed-warnings-of-family-and-friends","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2017-06-10T23:02:38Z","webTitle":"How to detect a potential terrorist?

Heed warnings from people who know them","bodyText":"In the last three months, the UK has suffered the most intense surge of terrorist activity for more than a decade. But who has attacked us? The obvious answer is the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (Isis). The group has launched a global offensive during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. As a consequence, there has has been a surge of violence from Nigeria to the Philippines. In recent weeks, there have also been other attacks elsewhere in the west, though thankfully without the same degree of harm. In Paris, a policeman was bludgeoned with a hammer, and in Melbourne, Australia, a woman was held hostage and a man killed. We do not know yet how closely the seven men responsible for these acts of violence were connected to Isis – even though the group has claimed responsibility for all of them. Salman Abedi, the 23-year-old student who attacked in Manchester, might have been in touch with Isis when in Libya only 10 days before striking. Khaled Massood, who drove a vehicle into pedestrians on Westminster Bridge and then stabbed a policeman to death outside parliament, appears to have been only inspired by the group. The shooting in Melbourne may not have been terrorism at all. The attacks in the UK involved only five men, as far as we know. With those in Paris and Melbourne, that makes seven. Do they share any characteristics that might help our security services to identify future attackers and avert future tragedy? At first glance, the answer seems to be yes. All are male, young, immigrants or born of immigrant parents and identify – at least when they commit their attacks – as Muslims. On close examination, however, the picture becomes more complex. Take the age of the attackers. The youngest was 22-year-old Youssef Zaghba, one of the three men who drove a van into crowds on London Bridge and then stabbed people in bars and restuarants. The oldest was Massood, the Westminster attacker, who was 52. The others were between 23 and 40. Education? Some of the seven have few or no real qualifications. But Farid Ikken, the man who attacked a policeman at Notre Dame cathedral in Paris, had a masters degree and was studying for a PhD in media at a French university. None were wealthy, but that’s hardly evidence of a link between poverty and extremist violence. Faith? Ikken, who had lived for a long time in Sweden with a Swedish woman, was described by friends as “soft, secular”. All seven appear to have become attracted to jihadism without first becoming devout Muslims. Moderate faith did not pave the way to a more extremist variety. One – Massood – was a convert. Hunting for devout Muslims will not help us. How about background? Most had unstable homes, often with absent fathers. Several had criminal records, mainly for acts of violence. One was a meth addict who had spent much of his adult life behind bars. Some were married. At least two had children. At least three had a history of controlling behaviour and violence towards women. It is unclear if any suffered mental illness. Yacquub Kharye, the Melbourne attacker, had travelled to Somalia to join an al-Qaida linked group. Khuram Bhutt had been involved with an extremist organisation for years. Others had no such connections. Other than Massood, all were immigrants or born of immigrant parents. But this bald statement hides vast differences between, for example, Abedi, who was born in the UK and grew up in Manchester, and Zaghba, a recent arrival from Italy. The conclusion is that any single “profile” which would cover all these variations would be so broad as to be useless. Repeated attempts to find “terrorist characteristics” by researchers have failed. Nor is evidence of radical views enough to spot a threat. Only a tiny minority of such people go on to commit violence. So how can we detect those who are a threat and stop atrocities? A breakdown in communication between Italian and British secret services led to Zaghba, a self-declared “terrorist”, slipping out of sight on arrival in the UK. So better coordination is essential. Others – such as Bhutt and Kharye – were clearly involved in extremist circles or even violent extremism and merited closer attention. But surveillance of large numbers of suspects is not practical without a vast expansion of our security services. The only way potential attackers will be identified before they kill and maim is through the most old-fashioned means one can imagine: someone warning authorities about what they plan to do. This can be people in the workplace, the mosque, or at school. Research tells us that more than 70% of Islamic militants who operate alone tell someone of their plans. The first line of defence against Islamic militancy is not our crash barriers or covert operations, nor armed cops or MI5, it is a potential terrorist’s brother, mother, partner or friend."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/jun/10/ostend-fishing-fleet-fears-brexit-return-to-british-waters","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-06-10T23:05:39Z","webTitle":"Belgian fishermen ready to battle for survival if UK ‘takes back’ its waters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jun/10/ostend-fishing-fleet-fears-brexit-return-to-british-waters","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/jun/10/ostend-fishing-fleet-fears-brexit-return-to-british-waters","fields":{"headline":"Belgian fishermen ready to battle for survival if UK ‘takes back’ its waters","bodyText":"Over the last year the decisions of the British public and, subsequently, the UK government have been observed with growing dismay by the people of Ostend. A slowdown in the number of Britons seeking a cheap bucket-and-spade holiday on the wide, soft-sanded beaches of the blowy North Sea resort ushered into administration the operator of the once popular Ramsgate to Ostend ferry four years ago, closing down the only direct link from the UK to the Flemish port. The Brexit vote last June, and the subsequent crash in the value of the pound, made it that bit more expensive for Brits who still wanted a break in Belgium. Staff at British Brands, a seafront souvenir shop that once did a brisk trade in flogging British-made goods to homesick tourists, admitted business had been slow recently. Ostend is increasingly becoming a resort for retired Belgians, drinking glasses of beer in the mid-morning sun. Now it is the suggestion that the British want to “take back” their fish that has caused Ostend’s fishermen, and all those who depend on the EU’s smallest fishing fleet, fresh concern. Last month the Conservative manifesto pledged to withdraw the UK from the common fisheries policy (CFP), fulfilling the Brexiters’ vow to take back control of British waters. The fisheries minister, George Eustice, has suggested that the British fleet will have access to hundreds of thousands more fish in the Brexit paradise to come. While the election result puts this, and other policies, into disarray, the signs are not good for the Belgian fishing industry. Three-quarters of the country’s fleet hunts in the 200 nautical miles from the UK coast over which Britain is to take sovereign control, be it in the North sea, the Channel or the Irish sea. Those waters account for half of the Belgian catch. As it stands, under the CFP Europe’s seas are effectively common to the 28 EU member states. The 100 fish stocks that swim in European waters move around, after all, and know no national boundaries. The total number of each species of fish that can be taken from various zones in the EU’s seas each year is settled by the member states on the advice of scientists, to ensure sustainability. Each country has a species-by-species quota they can take from that European haul. The quotas have been fixed since 1983 on the basis of the recorded catches of the various national fleets between 1973 and 1978. According to recent estimates, 33% of the catches of the European fishing fleet are caught in what could soon be claimed as British waters. Belgium’s 402 fishermen and their 65 boats, whose main catch is dover sole, are more dependent on those waters than most. It was not, however, because of fishing rights that Ostend once viewed the UK with such warmth that some would proudly advertise their home as “the most British town in Europe”. A grainy photograph of Field Marshal Bernard “Monty” Montgomery, who liberated the badly bombed port from the Nazis in 1945, still has pride of place on the seafront between the stalls selling escargots and whelks. But a few are now questioning their faith in perfidious Albion. Sitting in the quayside offices of the Rederscentrale, the organisation that represents Belgium’s fishermen, Emiel Brouckaert, its managing director, and Urbain Wintein, a 60-year-old fisherman who seeks catches in Britain’s seas, admitted their people were nervous. “Everyone is thinking about Brexit and the consequences,” Brouckaert said. “Just under 50% of our catches are in our waters, and we hear what our [British] colleagues’ requirements might be, though we realise there are some extreme views there.” The Belgian fleet is currently enjoying a healthy living, thanks to cheap fuel and higher prices being charged for their produce in the shops. But the last three decades have seen an unnerving decline. In 1990 there were 200 Belgian vessels. Economic realities hit, and there was a stream of mergers, as fishermen sought to squeeze the most out of the industry. “Then the last serious decline was from 100 vessels to the level we are now, and that was since the crisis in 2008,” said Brouckaert. Around 40% of the fleet today is owned by Belgian companies whose major shareholders are actually Dutch. Brouckaert is not yet linking the two challenges, but once individual Belgian fishermen start to struggle in a tighter post-Brexit reality, the bigger foreign companies could again swoop – bringing an end to the Belgian fishing industry in all but name. “We realise that, in a small fleet in a small sector, besides Brexit we have another important challenge for our sector’s survival, and that is succession planning,” he said. “There is a huge interest for any fishing opportunities we might have, not only from Holland, but from all countries, and successful companies that are restricted in their growth. They are constantly saying, ‘Where can we find more growth?’ If we don’t have Belgian succession for fishing possibilities, there’ll be lots of European colleagues on the quayside to take it.” The Belgians have joined eight other fishing communities in Europe with an interest in British waters to make their case in the Brexit talks. They have compiled a manifesto of sorts, which they have presented to the EU’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, a former French fisheries minister, who was said to be highly sympathetic. But fishing disputes have a tendency to get messy quickly. During the cod wars in the 1970s, Icelandic gunboats harassed British boats out of their waters in a row over access to their seas, and its coastguard took knives to their fishing lines. More recently, a row over scallops in the Channel saw French fishermen pelt British boats with flares and rocks. There has been talk of blockading English produce from continental Europe, should the British seek to restrict European fishermen’s access post-2019, when the UK leaves the EU. Olivier Leprêtre, president of the regional fisheries committee for the Hauts-de-France region, covering Nord Pas-de-Calais and Picardy, feared tempers would flare up again on the open seas. “It’s a very emotional issue,” he said. The Belgians aren’t talking about an uprising just yet. “We’ve had up to now very good relations with our British colleagues,” Brouckaert said. “A decision has been made by the UK to leave the EU and it is making people worried, but despite all the political things happening, we still hope we can have business as usual. If that’s in a common fisheries policy or a policy jointly negotiated, that is the first thing we are thinking about. Similar access, similar distribution of the quota.” One option, to fish in European waters elsewhere, was not possible, said Brouckaert. “They [the fishermen] are used to operating on fishing grounds they know inside out, from generation to generation.” And, he can only hope, generations to come."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2017/jun/10/theresa-mays-rude-abusive-and-childish-advisers-face-calls-to-quit","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-06-10T09:39:46Z","webTitle":"Theresa May's 'rude, abusive and childish' advisers face calls to quit","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jun/10/theresa-mays-rude-abusive-and-childish-advisers-face-calls-to-quit","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/jun/10/theresa-mays-rude-abusive-and-childish-advisers-face-calls-to-quit","fields":{"headline":"Theresa May's 'rude, abusive and childish' advisers face calls to quit","bodyText":"Theresa May’s chiefs of staff, Fiona Hill and Nick Timothy, are facing calls to quit, as one former Downing Street aide spoke out about their “rude, abusive and childish” approach to running No 10. A string of MPs are demanding changes to the way May governs, including the removal of one or both of her powerful advisers after they ran her disastrous general election campaign that resulted in the Conservatives losing their overall majority. Katie Perrior, the former director of communications at No 10, who left at the election, said she respected May but her office was “pretty dysfunctional”. Writing in the Times, she said: “What I could never work out was whether Mrs May condoned their behaviour and turned a blind eye or didn’t understand how destructive they both were. For all the love of a hierarchy, the chiefs treated cabinet members exactly the same – rude, abusive, childish behaviour. “For two people who have never achieved elected office, I was staggered at the disrespect they showed on a daily basis. I never hated them. I felt sorry for them and how they measured success by how many enemies they had clocked up.” The pair are widely credited with running May’s election campaign, which focused attention on the prime minister rather than the cabinet and ended with the Conservatives losing 13 MPs. The vote was originally expected to result in a landslide victory for the Tories, with May commanding a double-digit lead in the opinions polls for much of the campaign. But after a series of disastrous missteps, including a U-turn on social care in the Tory manifesto, May was stunned by a surge in support for Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour party. The party gained 32 MPs and dramatically increased its share of the national vote. Asked why May was not able to operate without advisers like Hill and Timothy, Perrior told the BBC: “Being in the Home Office for such a long time with that being her top team she became accustomed to that being it. Of course, running the Home Office is very different from running the country. “Trying to make that change to Number 10 was more difficult than she possibly anticipated. I used to wonder why because actually she needed to broaden her circle of advisers, she needed to have a few grey hairs in there who have been around the block a bit, who could say: ‘don’t do that, don’t make enemies when you don’t need to’.” Perrior described a fearful atmosphere with Hill and Timothy in morning meetings with the prime minister, who only rarely challenged ideas that were often “batshit crazy”. She also said that Hill and Timothy bullied cabinet ministers. “There was not enough respect shown to people who spent 20 years in office or 20 years getting to the top seat in government. They would send people text messages – rude text messages – which is not acceptable,” she said. “What the prime minister needs at a time that you’re going through Brexit is diplomats not street-fighters. They only really know one way to operate – and that is to have enemies and I’m sure I’m one of them this morning.” Perrior said she had already been close to leaving the post after a “toxic” 10 months but Hill in effect told her she had no place in the team. Several MPs told the Guardian that the prime minister had no hope of fighting another election as Conservative leader, describing her as finished within months. MPs have been privately discussing the possibility of lining up behind Boris Johnson, the foreign secretary, or Amber Rudd, the home secretary, as a replacement leader but there is also a desire among senior Brexiters to see her steer the UK through at least the first part of negotiations starting in 10 days. May was too weakened to move any of her senior cabinet posts and may be forced to accept an experienced hand as deputy prime minister to help her avoid more missteps and keep her team in check. As the results of the election were pouring in during the early hours of Friday morning many said May would have to go, but as the day wore on discussions between MPs became focused on making sure Brexit went ahead. Iain Duncan Smith, the former party leader, said it would be “suicide” for anyone to launch a leadership bid ahead of the talks, describing such a move as turkeys voting for Christmas. But all agreed that one of May’s two closest advisers had to go, with anger at Hill in particular for bullying behaviour. “It’s unacceptable for her to send sweary texts to cabinet ministers,” said another member of the cabinet who described Hill telling a senior government figure to “fuck off”. Others were angry at Timothy for including the social care policy in the manifesto. They said there was no “retail offer” and no attempt to explain why they weren’t including a string of giveaways. The issue of her staff is likely to arise at a meeting of the Tories’ backbench 1922 committee next week, amid strong feelings about the poor showing in the election campaign. Insiders said the Downing Street advisers were not to blame and instead pointed the finger at the Australian strategist Sir Lynton Crosby, claiming he told colleagues that manifestos were a “sideshow” and refused to take part in policymaking. A source also told the Guardian that Crosby insisted on focusing the entire message on May’s personal character, the 11 days until the start of Brexit negotiations and relentless negative attacks against Jeremy Corbyn. Sarah Wollaston, who was returned as Tory MP for Totnes, cited a controversial social care policy that was branded a “dementia tax” and resulted in a U-turn. She also blamed “US attack-dog style politics” that made people feel sorry for Corbyn. “I do think she [May] should stay on, but I wouldn’t be surprised if we end up having another election soon and people will be absolutely appalled by it … I can’t see the advisers staying. I think they should go,” she said, arguing there had been serious errors. “I think those who were most closely involved in advising need to consider their positions.” Rob Wilson, the Conservative culture minister who lost his Reading East seat, said the manifesto had struck like an Exocet missile through the heart of our main supporters” and that the party could not be run by such a small group of people."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2017/jun/10/voices-and-votes-leaders-personality-crucial-in-unexpected-election-result","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-06-10T11:55:13Z","webTitle":"Voices and votes: leaders' personalities were crucial in unexpected election result","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jun/10/voices-and-votes-leaders-personality-crucial-in-unexpected-election-result","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/jun/10/voices-and-votes-leaders-personality-crucial-in-unexpected-election-result","fields":{"headline":"Voices and votes: leaders' personalities were crucial in unexpected election result","bodyText":"After recording their varying views of the general election campaign for the Voices and votes project, we have been listening to swing voters’ reactions to the result. They have been of universal shock. Some are happy, some are sad – but it’s clear that when they woke up on Friday morning they, like much of the political commentariat, did not see this coming. “Did not expect it to be a hung parliament … Interesting to see how the day unfolds now …” Despite their surprise, their attitudes help us understand the unexpected outcome, and early analysis reveals some key themes. We identified a marked shift in perceptions of both Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn during the course of the campaign. This election was unusual in that, when it was called, voters told us that they didn’t feel they knew much about either prime ministerial candidate – and the personal profiles of both leaders appear to have been crucial to explaining why our swing voters voted the way they did. Those who ended up voting Labour in one-time Conservative targets such as Harrow West and Birmingham Erdington have told us that they were won over by Corbyn’s hopeful message: “Corbyn offers a fresh approach to politics and a new direction for Britain, which I hope will prove to be a very positive change.” His perceived honesty and warmth relative to Theresa May was also crucial: “Watching the campaign over the last few weeks, I feel Jeremy Corbyn has come across as far more trustworthy.” This contrast between Corbyn and May was accentuated by the difference in the brands of their two parties, which we wrote about earlier this week. Rather than citing specific manifesto promises, many of our swing voters were swayed by whether the party and its leader were perceived to have the interests of ordinary working people at heart. While the Conservatives were “posh” – and the fox hunting pledge spoke to this feeling – Labour was “on their side”: “I voted for Labour because I do believe they have better intentions and will act upon their promises.” But our undecided voters indicate that there are also other dynamics at play in Corbyn’s (relative) success around the country. In Hartlepool, it seems that his somewhat anti-establishment appeal was an important driver of votes, and indicates why the Conservatives’ move rightwards didn’t necessarily see them home in leave-voting constituencies that were previously fertile ground for Ukip: “It’s time for a change. The Conservatives have been in power for a while now and nothing is getting done.” In Cambridge, this feeling seems to have been symbolised by Labour’s manifesto pledges, which voters found very attractive – more so, indeed, than the Liberal Democrats’ manifesto, with its position on Brexit centre stage: “I voted for Labour mainly because of the promise to invest in public services. I didn’t choose Lib Dem in the end because it didn’t feel like they were a real threat to the Conservatives.” In Scotland, the dynamics were completely different. Although our Voices and Votes seat, Glasgow East, opted to stay with the SNP, the mindset of those undecided voters who chose the Conservatives here provides a clear indication as to reasons for the party’s surge north of the border: “The biggest driver for me was to avoid another independence referendum in Scotland.” Even among those who voted for Nicola Sturgeon’s party, some accept this vote as evidence that #indyref2 should not be revisited in the near future: “I wanted SNP to stay in power in Scotland – however, I wasn’t sure about another referendum and, truthfully, looking at the results, I think Nicola has her answer. Not all Scottish people want independence.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2017/jun/10/the-snap-theresa-may-still-prime-minister-but-for-how-long","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-06-10T05:48:17Z","webTitle":"The Snap: Theresa May – still prime minister, but for how long?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jun/10/the-snap-theresa-may-still-prime-minister-but-for-how-long","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/jun/10/the-snap-theresa-may-still-prime-minister-but-for-how-long","fields":{"headline":"The Snap: Theresa May – still prime minister, but for how long?","bodyText":"Here we are, the morning after the morning after, with Theresa May still in No 10, still prime minister and still without a majority.

Thanks to all who read the Snap, and to those who sought me out in the comments or on Twitter in the last seven weeks. Unlike many news organisations, the Guardian hasn’t put up a paywall – we want to keep our journalism as open as we can. The Guardian’s independent, investigative journalism takes a lot of time, money and hard work to produce. Here’s how you can support it. The winners who lost It turns out that June could still be the end of May – but perhaps not quite yet. The prime minister zipped off to see the Queen on Friday, without quite having her own queenmakers in place. While Arlene Foster, leader of the Democratic Unionist party, agreed that Northern Ireland’s biggest group of MPs would be holding talks with the Tories, no firm deal appears to have been struck, and May herself mentioned her “friends and allies” only fleetingly in her “this is fine” Downing Street address. Her new government would “provide certainty”, the PM insisted, trying gamely to give the impression that losing her majority had been the plan all along and she absolutely meant to kick herself in the head. Somehow she forgot to mention the vanished majority at all, or the colleagues who had found themselves out of a job (an addendum issued later, a sad-faced oops). Wiped, too, is the “Theresa May’s team” branding. Back in comes the official but rarely deployed “Conservative and Unionist party”. That title at least gives some Venn diagram overlap with the DUP, but questions persist over where else they might find accommodation. Jonathan Powell, chief of staff to Tony Blair at the time of the Good Friday agreement, was not the only person to question what this might mean for the Westminster government’s duty to be neutral in Northern Ireland, especially against the backdrop of a mothballed Stormont. Given the fascination during the campaign with Lib Dem leader Tim Farron’s views on gay sex and abortion, it’s no surprise that the same scrutiny is now turning to the 10 DUP MPs. The answers (along with a tinge of climate change denial) might be no surprise either, but are causing concern among some in a Tory party already rather rattled by their leader’s unnecessary electoral self-own. Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson – a rare cheery Tory yesterday, who saw the number of MPs in Scotland spiral from one to 13 – tweeted that she was “a Protestant Unionist about to marry an Irish Catholic”, partner Jen Wilson. She said she had received “categoric assurance” from May that gay rights would not be harmed by a deal with the DUP: I told her there there was a number of things that count to me more than party. One of them is country, one of the others is LGBTI rights, and I asked for a categoric assurance that if any deal was done with the DUP there would be absolutely no rescinding of LGBTI rights in the rest of the UK and that we would try to use any influence that we had to advance LGBTI rights in Northern Ireland. Davidson also labelled as “B****cks” – her asterisks, not mine, this is the Guardian – a claim by the Telegraph that Scotland’s Tories were set to “go their own way” in the wake of May’s hubristic result. Also going nowhere, for now, are five key cabinet ministers. Shuffling the deck is hard when your hand is broken. Chancellor Philip Hammond, home secretary Amber Rudd, foreign secretary Boris Johnson, Brexit secretary David Davis and defence secretary Michael Fallon all stay put. But May’s closest aides, Nick Timothy and Fiona Hill, described by one anonymous cabinet minister as “monsters who propped her up and sunk our party”, might not get one of her categoric assurances. The thornier question is whether the PM’s own life cycle is longer than a mayfly. An optimistic reference in her speech to her ambition to “over the next five years build a country in which no one and no community is left behind” could prove to contain a glaring exception. With the rightwing press darting from cheering her efforts to “crush the saboteurs” by calling the snap election, to “she’s had her chips” in the hours afterwards, allies might be harder to find than an ordinary person at a Theresa May campaign rally. Still, someone has to turn up for those Brexit negotiations 10 days from now: the talks May said she was concentrating on so much she couldn’t spare the time for TV debates. The talks she said would be fronted by Jeremy Corbyn if she lost six seats (she lost 13). The losers who won Who’d make predictions these days, but chances are it won’t be Corbyn at those Brexit chats. Nonetheless, the Labour leader, who lost the election but emerges as the closest thing to a winner, insisted he was “ready to serve”. A euphoric day for Labour (tempered by the occasional reality check that they were not the government) was dealt an extra dollop of homemade jam on Friday night when it took Kensington – the Kensington, one of London’s richest, if not evenly spread, constituencies – from the Tories by an elfin 20 votes. The stream of Labour MPs confessing to their own faulty polling predictions provided extra balm to Camp Corbyn. Here’s Owen Smith, last year’s leadership challenger: I was clearly wrong in feeling that Jeremy was unable to do this well and I think he’s proved me wrong and lots of people wrong and I take my hat off to him. So where did that Labour surge come from? Memes, obviously, and a canny social media strategy. But beyond that, the answers were complex and indicative of a shrugging of the political landscape. There was the youth and student contribution. There was the fact that the disintegration of the Ukip vote did not land plumly in the laps of the Tories but sought out Labour too. There was the Labour manifesto, and the malfunctioning Conservative version. There was Wales. There was even Scotland. Talking of which… Continuing the theme of the day, the SNP won the most seats in Scotland and simultaneously received a thrashing. In 2015, they scooped all but three of the 59 constituencies; the others were doled out neatly one each to Labour, the Conservatives and the Lib Dems. Two years later, the SNP took home 35 seats, saying farewell to its biggest names on the way, and witnessed Labour leap up to seven, the Lib Dems to four, and the Tories to an eye-rubbing 13. It wasn’t all about talk of another independence referendum, insisted Nicola Sturgeon, while conceding it “undoubtedly” was a factor. Her deputy John Swinney thought the prospect of indyref2 was a “significant motivator”, saying the SNP would “have to be attentive to that”. The Lib Dems, too, found that the promise of another vote wasn’t a huge vote-winner. Twelve seats is, mathematically, a chunky boost to the eight they won in 2015 (there was a brief dalliance with a ninth, but with Richmond Park returning to Zac Goldsmith after just six months in Sarah Olney’s hands, we’ll skim over that). Twelve seats is not, however, the party of the 48%. Then again, nor was May’s result, argued Farron, a mandate for hard Brexit. Oh, and a Ukip leader resigned.

Other MPs are gently exploring the possibility of submitting letters to the chairman of the 1922 committee – 48 would be required to trigger a leadership contest. Another former minister told me: ‘I just can’t see how she stays.’ In the New Statesman, Patrick Maguire says the Tory-DUP alliance poses a challenge to the future of Northern Ireland’s devolved legislature: The closeness of the government to the DUP in the last parliament led to James Brokenshire, the Northern Ireland secretary, taking lines that were frankly nakedly partisan on issues such as Troubles legacy prosecutions. This, like the other points of disagreement between the DUP and Sinn Féin, was supposed to have been dealt with by the Stormont House and Fresh Start Agreements of 2014 and 2015. Brokenshire’s posturing won him few admirers among the nationalist cohort at Westminster. If Nigel Dodds ends up wielding considerable influence over the next Tory government, he will have fewer still. There is very little trust and very little goodwill left on Sinn Féin’s part towards the UK government, and, indeed, its ability to broker a deal that saves the devolved institutions. Breakthroughs of the day A record number of women were elected to the House of Commons: 208. (That’s only 32%, though, so still plenty of patriarchy left to ruffle.) Over half of MPs in the incoming parliament went to state comprehensives, which is somehow, staggeringly, the first time that has happened. The Sutton Trust finds 51% went to comprehensives and 29% were privately educated. And 3% of all MPs went to a single school, which was … drumroll … Eton. Preet Gill, winning Birmingham Edgbaston, became the first Sikh female MP; Tanmanjeet Dhesi, in Slough, is the first turban-wearing Sikh MP. There are now 52 minority ethnic MPs, according to thinktank British Future, which called it the “most diverse UK parliament ever”. And there is also a record number of LGBTQ MPs: at least 45.

On Tuesday night it is the Stade de France to meet the finalists of Euro 2016. England’s last foreign excursion was to play in Germany and they will meet the world champions again at Wembley in November. Southgate’s team have already taken on Spain and, continuing the theme, there is the possibility of a game against Holland in Amsterdam next March. England, Southgate freely admitted, are deliberately making life hard for themselves. The reason says a lot about their manager when, barring a win in France, England will go into the summer break after only three wins from eight matches since the Football Association promoted him from his role with the Under-21s. Those victories have come in World Cup qualifiers against, in order, Malta, Scotland and Lithuania – the teams 182nd, 61st and 104th in Fifa’s world rankings – and Southgate acknowledged it was inevitable his win ratio would “probably get spouted out at some point” if the Football Association continued choosing elite opposition. At the same time he also made a credible case why it was the logical decision when England’s opponents have been so moderate during their long unbeaten run, stretching 35 matches to October 2009, since they were beaten in any qualifying fixture. “It would have been easy for me to ask for easier teams to try to manipulate our ranking and think about my own win percentage, but what’s the point?” Southgate said. “We have to test ourselves against the best. It’s the best way to learn and improve. It’s about the evolution of the team and how we get better. We have to challenge the lads, with or without the ball, to perform at the highest level. “Tactical details, things we need to improve upon. If we are playing teams who play with a low defensive block all the time, that’s one problem we have to resolve. But we also have to play teams who come at us. Can we play out? Can we break down really high-quality defenders? We need these different type of challenges.” That process will continue here with a new goalkeeper taking over from Joe Hart. Two, in fact, bearing in mind Southgate will start with Tom Heaton – “statistically, the highest-performing English goalkeeper in the league” – and then replace him at half-time with the fit-again Jack Butland. Hart, Southgate insisted, was still the established No1 but the manager has had time now to analyse the two free-kicks from Leigh Griffiths at Hampden on Saturday and, for all his diplomacy, it was noticeable he could not excuse England’s goalkeeper of any blame. Likewise Southgate was unwilling to say Hart, with his club career in limbo, would return to the starting lineup when England resume their World Cup qualifying programme against Malta and Slovakia in early September. “Joe has been excellent for us. The two goals at the weekend were the first he has conceded in this qualifying campaign and we owe him for the point in Slovenia [the 0-0 draw last October] after one of the best saves I’ve ever seen. His contribution has been excellent since I’ve been manager. That said, I don’t want anyone to feel completely comfortable in their position because I’m not sure that’s healthy.” The loser here is actually Fraser Forster, a regular of England’s squads but now the odd man out at a time when Southgate has taken the unusual decision to include four goalkeepers and is also keeping in mind Karl Darlow from Newcastle United and Brighton’s David Stockdale. “I’ve spoken to him [Forster] and, of course, he’s disappointed,” Southgate said. “He’s travelled quite a bit with England and not had the number of matches he would have liked. I’m conscious that’s very difficult because I was close to Nigel Martyn when he was doing the same. We’ve got the four guys who are with us, we’ve got Jordan Pickford who will come into the equation and a couple of others with the teams that have been promoted. It’s hard to keep all those guys happy. But I wanted Fraser to be part of this squad because he is close. I’ve had to make a decision about this game and I can’t make him feel any better other than to communicate with him and show him that respect.” Harry Kane will continue in his new role as captain, a trial that is expected to be made into a full-time position in the autumn, but Southgate is intending to field an experimental side otherwise and has moved John Stones into a defensive midfield position in at least two training sessions over the past week. Stones was left out of the Scotland game and there is a passage in Tony Adams’s new book when the former England captain, a man who knows a thing or two about the art of defence, describes Manchester City’s £47.5m signing as “average” and claims the most expensive English defender in history reminded him of Tony Gale – reasonable on the ball but not good enough, defensively, to win international honours. Southgate, however, offered a more positive appraisal and will bring Stones back into the team for his 18th cap. “John has huge potential. Defending is a skill you learn and he’ll learn a lot with a coach [Pep Guardiola] asking a lot of him with the ball. Next season, at club level, he’ll be much stronger for what he’s been through: the move, being at a club where so much is expected of him, the transfer fee and everything surrounding it. He’s become a father. There’s a lot going on in his life and he will be a much better player for those experiences.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"society/commentisfree/2017/jun/13/tories-face-down-opposition-nhs","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2017-06-13T11:00:56Z","webTitle":"Can the Tories face down opposition on the NHS?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/commentisfree/2017/jun/13/tories-face-down-opposition-nhs","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/commentisfree/2017/jun/13/tories-face-down-opposition-nhs","fields":{"headline":"Can the Tories face down opposition on the NHS?","bodyText":"It was a curious election from an NHS point of view. The state of the health service was voters’ number one priority, but the NHS still did not dominate the campaign debate. Labour gained favourable headlines for several health policies, such as scrapping both the NHS pay cap and sustainability and transformation plans (STPs), and the party’s NHS focus was doubtless a key factor in the Corbyn surge. Theresa May looked both out of touch, when she insisted that “complex reasons” explain why some nurses use food banks, and uncaring on NHS staff’s stagnating pay. The result: the NHS has the same prime minister (for now) and the same health secretary (now heading towards his sixth year in post), and certainly the same familiar problems – too little money and too few staff to do its job properly in the face of a tsunami of rising demand and costs. However, the fact that the Tory manifesto included a new and radical prescription to revamp the NHS means the nation’s most cherished institution will keep generating political heat for those in office. Largely unremarked on when the manifesto came out, the government backed the big programme of hospital unit closures envisaged by the STPs, albeit “providing they are clinically led and locally supported”. It is also prepared to introduce legislation to clear the way legally for STPs to morph over time into “accountable care partnerships” – beacons of the new NHS which both NHS boss Sir Simon Stevens and May are committed to deliver by 2022. It plans for good measure to sweep away the NHS’s internal market - the purchaser/provider split, which a previous Tory administration created in 1990. And it wants to slash the service’s “costly bureaucracy”, which – more irony – is code for the 209 NHS clinical commissioning groups introduced by none other than Andrew Lansley in his disastrous, damaging Health and Social Care Act 2012. Pursuing that agenda will make it impossible for the prime minister to realise her ambition of keeping the NHS off the front pages. But the unavoidable political pain along the way may be worth it, if modernisation on this scale and another NHS reorganisation creates a health service that is both fit for tomorrow’s medical and care challenges and better-equipped to live within its budget. But how much reform will May or her successor dare to push through? Labour’s seizure of Canterbury after 176 years as a Tory seat, when its candidate Rosie Duffield made saving the at-risk Kent and Canterbury hospital a key priority, is likely to have a chilling effect on government backing for controversial NHS reconfiguration schemes. This is especially true when that involves a Tory MP, as many of the STP-driven plans to overhaul the role of local hospitals do. As one trust chief executive puts it: “Canterbury could prove to be another Kidderminster”. That was the hospital, the threat to which led to its Labour MP losing his seat in 2001 to a doctor from it, Richard Taylor, who was elected not once, but twice, on a ticket to protect it. Unless the government faces down opposition in the many equivalents of Canterbury to come, what is the point of ministers pledging to “back the implementation of the [Five Year Forward View] at a local level”? The Stevens plan to which May and Hunt swear allegiance involves unprecedented centralisation of services; if they rule out every controversial change, they will defenestrate it. In that scenario, given Stevens’ huge investment in the five-year plan, why would he hang around, his plan potentially fatally neutered? Beyond the fantasy finances and unrealistic pledge of an NHS providing “exceptional standards of care, wherever, whenever”, what would the government do? May, forced to produce her own NHS policy, would find this prospect terrifying."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/jun/12/jeremy-corbyn-austerity-labour-leader","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-06-12T19:10:38Z","webTitle":"This is Corbyn’s moment: he’s rescued Britain from the chains of austerity | Polly Toynbee","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jun/12/jeremy-corbyn-austerity-labour-leader","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/jun/12/jeremy-corbyn-austerity-labour-leader","fields":{"headline":"This is Corbyn’s moment: he’s rescued Britain from the chains of austerity","bodyText":"Nothing succeeds like success. Jeremy Corbyn looks like a new man, beaming with confidence, benevolence and forgiveness to erstwhile doubters, exuding a new father-of-the-nation air of authority, calmly awaiting his imminent elevation to power. When I met him on Sunday he clasped my hand and, with a twinkle and a wink, thanked me for things I had written. Indeed, I had saluted his election campaign, with its optimism and exuberance, enjoying his cornucopia of a manifesto and its popularity. But before that I had also written of my deep doubts that he could ever bring Labour anywhere near victory when he was a steady 20 points behind. Remember how sudden and unprecedented was the turnaround in his fortunes. Opinion polls may now be regarded as no better than political astrology – but it was the real result of the council elections in May that caused Labour MPs such paroxysms of fright: a short month before the general election, Labour fell 11 points behind in actual votes cast. No wonder a clutch of Labour MPs were starting to eye the situations-vacant pages assuming they were done for. Now, in addition to their own efforts, those same MPs owe a great deal to Corbyn. No one else could have done it, as MP after MP reported cadres of young and never-before voters asking the way to the polling station. Victory feels breathtakingly close. Theresa May’s perilous DUP coalition could collapse at any time. The Brexit virus that has killed off every Tory leader since Margaret Thatcher still courses through the veins of her party. Yet the Sun’s tally finds a majority of all MPs favour soft Brexit (staying in the single market or near as dammit). On any issue, awkward squads can easily upset the applecart. Expect an amusingly brief Queen’s speech for lack of much to agree on: most items in the “worst manifesto in history” are toast. There are schadenfreude delights to relish: with no majority, the Salisbury convention – whereby the Lords let through anything in a government’s manifesto – is out. Peers will be bloody-minded over every Brexit detail, with no Henry VIII powers passing them by. Boundary changes destined to deliver Tory hegemony may be a dead duck too: it will require final legislation to abolish 50 constituencies, mostly Labour. But some Tory MPs with vanishing seats will find reasons to vote against – and the DUP is vehemently against losing Northern Irish seats. Parliament may be not be very busy: the DUP only turns up at Tuesday lunchtime and leaves on Wednesday evening. One issue May hopes might skewer Labour is anti-terror legislation, banning “extremism” – but defining in law a dangerous thought without a criminal act is so fiendishly difficult it may be confounded by its own impossibility. The Tory men in suits are said to want May to stay for two years, to draw upon herself all blame for the crescendo of agony ahead. After Brexit has dragged to its messy conclusion, either her own Brextremists will be incandescent with disappointment or, if they are satisfied, the economy will tank, with trucks queuing for days at blocked customs crossings and EU citizens deserting in droves. Only then the party plans to untether the May scapegoat and send her into the desert. The election was called partly because, ahead, everything gets worse: living standards are falling, inflation rising, the ligature around the NHS is tightening, schools are shedding teachers, benefit cuts are biting; nothing good beckons. The chance of a May U-turn to adopt Labour’s largesse is near zero: they are all state-shrinkers. Let May own all the economic misery her party has caused and this Brexit crisis born of Tory insanity. Labour would be lucky not to take over until all this reaches its bitter end. But mayhem may sink this government any day and Labour could inherit pandemonium. Success draws new people in. It may be no better than reading tea leaves, but I can’t help eyeing the latest (post-election) Survation poll in the Daily Mail which puts Labour ahead by 45% to 39%, with 12% more people expecting a Labour win. To a remarkable degree, Corbyn’s respectability and plausibility as prime minister is now established. In the end the Mail and Sun did him a service: by dredging up every accusation against him yet failing to frighten voters away, they have demolished their own power. His past has been cauterised and there will be no point in dragging it out again. This is Corbyn’s week zero, a man remade as the avuncular saviour of young and old from the chains of austerity. He declared himself on Sunday’s Andrew Marr show as “the most generous person in the world”. But that spirit has to inhabit his team too. Punishment beatings, calls for Maoist re-education and Twitter storms from his followers against anyone on the left who ever feared bad polls and council election results might augur failure, risk damaging him by association. To show magnanimity, he could embrace erstwhile opponents with forgiveness, with a gesture of welcome to one or two outsiders. An extravagant display of confident Labour unity would be a jubilant contrast to utter Tory disarray. Labour is preparing for another snap election. The party should reconsider being ungenerous to the progressive alliance, where Green candidates stood down to help Labour, but not one Labour seat reciprocated. Attitude matters more than electoral maths. An open state of mind to embrace proportional representation too. Work has begun to make the next manifesto Institute for Fiscal Studies-proof: not by junking spending commitments that attracted voters, but by iron-cladding its priorities, costings and revenue-raisings. The Tories’ “magic money tree” jibe has become Labour’s friend. Ahead is nothing but political pleasure for Labour: no need to put a foot wrong. With forensic finesse, they can trip up the Tories as they misstep on the Brexit path. Barry Gardiner, shadow trade secretary, today spelled out a good Labour line for “achieving the benefits” of the single market: putting jobs and the economy first allows Labour to savage every Brexit move that makes people poorer. Labour can relish the political spectacle from now on, while preparing for government."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"society/2017/jun/13/european-court-charlie-gard-baby-experimental-treatment","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2017-06-13T06:00:49Z","webTitle":"European court to decide whether to hear more evidence on ill baby","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/jun/13/european-court-charlie-gard-baby-experimental-treatment","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2017/jun/13/european-court-charlie-gard-baby-experimental-treatment","fields":{"headline":"European court to decide whether to hear more evidence on ill baby","bodyText":"The European court of human rights is due to decide on Tuesday whether it will hear legal arguments from the family of a severely ill baby who want him to be sent to the US for treatment. Chris Gard and Connie Yates, from Bedfont in west London, believe their 10-month-old son, Charlie Gard, who suffers from a rare genetic condition and has brain damage, should undergo experimental medical therapy in the US in the hope of prolonging his life. Last week the supreme court in Westminster rejected the family’s appeal and effectively decided that he should be allowed to die with dignity. The ECHR in Strasbourg has ordered the UK to continue Charlie’s life-saving treatment, but that requirement is due to expire at midnight on Tuesday. The court has been considering written submissions made by the family’s lawyers. The judges have not yet decided whether they will hear more detailed, oral evidence. Specialists at Great Ormond Street hospital, where Charlie is being treated, say the nucleoside bypass therapy proposed by a doctor in the US is experimental and would not help. They believe the life support treatment should end. A high court judge in April had ruled against a trip to the US and in favour of the Great Ormond Street doctors. Mr Justice Francis concluded that life-support treatment should end and that Charlie should be allowed to die with dignity. Three court of appeal judges upheld that ruling in May and three supreme court justices on Thursday dismissed the couple’s latest challenge after a hearing in London. Yates screamed when the supreme court justices announced their decision. Gard and Yates, who are in their 30s, have launched a fundraising appeal to help pay for doctors’ bills in the US. It reached a £1.2m target before the high court trial. That figure has now topped £1.3m, consisting of more than 83,000 donations. Their lawyer, Richard Gordon QC, told the supreme court: “The issue is whether the state has the power to intrude on decisions the parents have made in order to mandate that child’s death before it might come to an end. These are model parents trying to do all they possibly can for the benefit of their child. Their view on what is best for Charlie differs from the court.” Gordon said that where parents are agreed, questions of upbringing “should not normally come before the court”. Parental responsibility, he added, was being eroded."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/jun/12/the-guardian-view-on-the-french-elections-macrons-quiet-revolution-of-the-centre","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-06-12T18:03:42Z","webTitle":"The Guardian view on the French elections: Macron’s quiet revolution of the centre | Editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jun/12/the-guardian-view-on-the-french-elections-macrons-quiet-revolution-of-the-centre","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/jun/12/the-guardian-view-on-the-french-elections-macrons-quiet-revolution-of-the-centre","fields":{"headline":"The Guardian view on the French elections: Macron’s quiet revolution of the centre","bodyText":"Fortunate car drivers may be familiar with the “green wave”, in which a sequence of traffic lights are coordinated so that each conveniently turns to “go” just as the vehicle approaches. To judge by the first round of France’s parliamentary elections on Sunday, Emmanuel Macron seems to have invented the green wave’s political equivalent. In the 10 months since he launched his meteoric political career, Mr Macron’s radical centrist project has found every traffic light of the many that might have blocked his path on green. If next week’s second round confirms Sunday’s results, the French president and his new party will have secured an overwhelming parliamentary mandate for his reform agenda. Theresa May, who will sit next to Mr Macron at the Stade de France on Tuesday evening for a football match, can only look on with drooling envy. At the start of this year, Mr Macron’s fledgling party La République en Marche did not even exist. Now it is projected to win between 400 and 450 seats out of the 577 in France’s national assembly. In Sunday’s first round, La REM finished first in the majority of seats and came far ahead of its nearest rival in terms of national share of the vote. This sweeping success is one of the largest in the history of the Fifth Republic. Yet it has been achieved not by one of the well established parties or blocs but by a new movement, half of whose candidates had never stood for public office before. In some respects this is an even more formidable achievement of mobilisation than Mr Macron’s success a month ago. It is significant that more than half of French voters failed to go to the polls on Sunday. Turnout was a mere 49%, compared with 78% for the first round of the presidential election at the end of April. Yet this high rate of abstention needs to be interpreted with care. The Fifth Republic’s constitution has always elevated the president above the parliament. National wariness about political “cohabitation” – a president and parliament of competing parties – tends to be reflected in higher abstention on the opposition side, as on Sunday. And the French electorate may be suffering voter fatigue after a succession of primaries and presidential votes in recent months. To that extent, low turnout may not be as damaging in practice to Mr Macron and La REM as the numbers may imply. For the moment, however, it is Mr Macron’s political opponents who are in disarray. France seems to be witnessing a process of dégagisme – of clearing out old parties and leaders. The left is deflated after the worst Socialist result in parliamentary elections since François Mitterrand refounded the party at the Épinay congress in 1971. The centre-right is deeply divided. Meanwhile the hard right Front National, which lost 4 million votes on Sunday compared with Marine Le Pen’s showing in the first round in April, now faces a gruelling internal conflict over its political direction, a battle that is likely to come to a head at its party conference in 2018. Mr Macron is on course to win a decisive mandate. This is important not just for France itself but for the European Union. Germany’s willingness to help loosen the eurozone’s fiscal strictness will inevitably have to await the Bundestag elections in September. Yet Berlin will be under little pressure to act unless Mr Macron is seen to be credible as a reformer of France’s high-spending, high-unemployment economy. That depended upon the results in these elections. Signs of improving economic growth are yet another well-timed green light for Mr Macron. The fact remains that three out of four French voters did not vote for Mr Macron in the first round in the presidential contest, while two out of three of those voting on Sunday did not support La REM either. This will certainly not prevent Mr Macron from getting his public spending plans and his labour market liberalisation proposals through parliament later this year. He will face challenges, perhaps including demonstrations and strikes, from the unions (with whom he has promised to consult over the summer) which will test the resolve and discipline of his tyro legislators. Plans to incorporate emergency anti-terror powers into the criminal code after the welcome ending of France’s 14-month state of emergency provide a further point of conflict. One day, Mr Macron will be faced with a red light. Seen from across the Channel, however, France’s quiet revolution of the centre appears an extraordinary and, in many ways enviable, contrast to the snarl-up in Britain."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/jun/13/the-little-blue-bird-has-flown-how-twitter-lost-its-value-as-a-news-source","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-06-13T01:54:55Z","webTitle":"The little blue bird has flown: how Twitter lost its value as a news source | Matthew Clayfield","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jun/13/the-little-blue-bird-has-flown-how-twitter-lost-its-value-as-a-news-source","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/jun/13/the-little-blue-bird-has-flown-how-twitter-lost-its-value-as-a-news-source","fields":{"headline":"The little blue bird has flown: how Twitter lost its value as a news source","bodyText":"A little over a week ago, as I was preparing for bed, I heard through the grapevine that there had been an explosion in Turin, Italy, where fans of Juventus FC had been watching their team play Real Madrid on a large screen in Piazza San Carlo. I’m currently living in Genoa, two hours to the south, and as a journalist knew that if anything untoward had occurred I’d need to be on the next train north. Five years ago, I would have turned to Twitter and watched the situation unfold in real time, relatively certain, given the people I was following, that the information in my feed would be up-to-the-minute and, more importantly, accurate. I didn’t do that when I heard about Turin. Instead, I visited the Italian newspapers’ websites. As a result, I knew what was actually going on long before many on the social network did. At least since the Boston bombings four years ago, Twitter’s value as a news source has gradually but inexorably faded. In the case of Turin, long after the newspapers had reported that the explosion was a fireworks accident, Twitter was still comparing Turin to Manchester and marvelling at Europe’s latest terror attack. (Of course, not everyone was doing so: “There are people in Turin who actually support Juventus?” one wag wrote. “Now that’s a news story.”) Even as English-language news sources caught up to the Italian ones, news-aggregation accounts with thousands of followers were still retweeting the original headlines, most of which hinted at malicious intent. For hours, Twitter users promised their follows that they’d never forget the victims. What they had apparently forgotten was every other time social media had failed them as a news source over the past couple of years (though it’s entirely possible that it failed to tell them about these failures in the first place). The 2016 US presidential election put Facebook’s role and responsibilities in the spotlight. In 2013, the vigilantism that followed the Boston attack, which led to innocent parties being accused and subjected to harassment, put Reddit in it, too. Twitter comes in for regular drubbings, by journalists and regular users alike, and disenchantment with it is nothing new. That’s partly because it did have some real and tangible successes early on. I still smile when I think of Sohaib Athar, who effectively live-tweeted the raid that killed Osama bin Laden, unaware that he was taking part in the year’s biggest story even if he wasn’t exactly breaking it. (That honour went to Keith Urbahn, the former chief of staff to Donald Rumsfeld, who tweeted the news himself before it was officially announced.) And the use of Twitter during the early days of the Arab Spring – before governments began to wise up and use it to crack down on activists – brought western and Arab reporters together, be they on the ground or in the office, with citizen journalists and ordinary people in a truly ground-breaking way. That promise has largely been squandered. What Twitter most resembles now is a cable news channel. The hundreds of pundits talking at cross-purposes, breaking little but wind. The race-to-be-first mentality that precludes due diligence and fact-checking in favour of the win. (The tendency of news websites to post a single, deeply uninformative sentence followed by the words “More to come... ” is a similar result of this mindset.) The thousands of viewers – or in this case followers – who take what they’re told and run with it, even after the truth has been reported by professionals. There are other similarities. It can be argued that the cultivation of personal brands on Twitter is not unlike the jockeying of cable news hosts for centrality – the channels breed names, not loyalists – and that most tweeters have given up on the multi-directional nature of the beast in favour of something more akin to traditional broadcasting. To this extent, the US president, Donald Trump, is the most representative of all contemporary tweeters. The thing has become little more than a megaphone, and not merely for publicising, as so many once feared, descriptions of what one had for lunch. In 2012, I published an article in Metro Magazine called “Tweet the Press: How Social Media is Changing the Way Journalists Do Their Jobs.” I’ve never been a subscriber to what Evgeny Morozov has derisively called “technological solutionism” – for one thing, the digital divide remains too wide – but it’s interesting to go back now and see how enamoured I was with the platform at the time. I doubt I would have written the article otherwise. I certainly wouldn’t write it now. My ardour wasn’t entirely shared by the journalists I interviewed. Mark Colvin, who before his untimely death last month was unarguably Australian journalism’s most prolific tweeter, said that every time he retweeted a link he went through “the usual process of triangulation to work out [the link’s] authenticity”.

His words reveal, too, that the 31-year-old Spaniard, who has suffered more injuries than is good for his long-term health, is not done just yet. “Very organised people, very proactive people, know exactly what they’re going to do next,” Nadal said after looking about as organised as is possible on a tennis court in demolishing Stan Wawrinka in three sets to win his 10th French Open. “I do things as they come. Right now, I don’t really know. I’m just going to keep on playing as long as it makes me happy. If one day I get up in the morning and I’m no longer motivated to go train, well, I guess that day I will put an end to my career. You know what? I’m not worried. I’m a happy person.” Like his oldest rival, Roger Federer, he is playing with the sort of freedom known only to the very young and those who have seen it all. It is a joy that might carry Nadal to his first Wimbledon final in seven years. He might even win for the third time there. Or, as he admits, he could just as easily fall early if his unreliable knees do not adapt quickly to the peculiar demands of grass, as they did when he lost to the world No100, Lukas Rosol, in the second round in 2012. Nadal, more than most players, has endured extended periods of struggle, when his love for the game has been tested. He almost expects them to return. In 2005 his emotions were dragged in all directions. He met his long-time girlfriend, Maria Francisca Perello, and won the first of the 10 French championships that set him on his journey to La Decima on Sunday, as well as an unprecedented decade of winning at least one slam every year. However, 2005 was also the year that structural weaknesses surfaced in his feet and knees and they have plagued him, to a great or lesser degree, ever since. He has been struck down in 2006, 2009, 2012 and 2014. In 2013 he came back from nearly eight months out to heal ruptured patellar tendons and won two majors among 10 titles and posted 75 match victories. It was an astonishing achievement. Bjorn Borg, no slouch on the dirt, was moved to call him “the greatest clay-court player to ever play”. Carlos Moyá, who has since joined him as eventual coaching successor to uncle Toni, described him as “a warrior”. Jimmy Connors remarked at the time: “His passion and the way he grinds is really something special.” Because he can play no other way it is easy to take this commitment for granted, without wondering about the price he pays. Last year he had to quit the French Open after two quick wins because of a wrist injury. Only this season has he begun to resemble the old Nadal. If he looks commanding and fierce on court – so deep in “the zone” Nadal rarely reacts to extraneous activity – he sometimes appears uncertain of himself. Eight times in one answer on Sunday evening, he used the word “doubts”. For a long time he had pronounced it “doobts”. He knows how to say it now and he has a proper grasp of its essence. “I have been very honest with you all the time,” he said. “I have doubts every day. If you have no doubts, probably [it] is because you are too arrogant. I don’t consider myself arrogant.” What might surprise Nadal, however, is that there is a groundswell of worthwhile opinion saying he can win Wimbledon again. It would be on a par with Federer’s win in Melbourne this year, when he beat Nadal in the final. Even so, nobody – not even uncle Toni or his understudy Moyá – would previously have suggested Nadal could conquer the All England Club’s grass again. He told the English-speaking press on Sunday: “I love grass, everybody knows, and it’s a surface that I really enjoyed a lot playing there.” However, he said to Spanish reporters later: “Grass is not my speciality, but I’m very motivated.” He nonetheless reminded everyone when beating Wawrinka 6-2, 6-3, 6-1 that clay fits the script for a natural clay-courter who has rediscovered his killing top-spun forehand and now owns a backhand that is nearly as lethal. If he stays fit and healthy, he could win another two or three titles in Paris, putting him beyond reach in the record books. That might also haul him alongside Federer on 18 majors – although there is no sign the Swiss has finished collecting big silverware. If Nadal rules clay again, Federer likewise is ready to retake his Wimbledon crown. What a story it would be if the draw kept them apart until the last Sunday. It is nine years since Nadal won possibly the best final in the history of grand slam tennis, when, over five sets of almost unbearable intensity, he deconstructed Federer’s elegance with the sheer power of his will, it seemed. Before they arrived at that 2008 Wimbledon they played in the final at Roland Garros. Nadal won 6–1, 6–3, 6–0. It was one of the most humiliating experiences of Federer’s career. Now Wawrinka has felt the French heat of Nadal before Wimbledon. It would be foolish to predict the Spanish master could not do that double again."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/2017/jun/12/pakistan-sri-lanka-champions-trophy-group-b-match-report","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-06-12T17:59:37Z","webTitle":"Pakistan see off Sri Lanka to set up Champions Trophy semi-final with England","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/jun/12/pakistan-sri-lanka-champions-trophy-group-b-match-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/jun/12/pakistan-sri-lanka-champions-trophy-group-b-match-report","fields":{"headline":"Pakistan see off Sri Lanka to set up Champions Trophy semi-final with England","bodyText":"There have been higher-quality games of cricket in this tournament but none yet with such a taut finish. Beyond the dropped catches (there were plenty of those) and the overthrows and the wanton strokes there was at the end of Cardiff’s sunniest day so far the wonderful tension that knock-out cricket can generate. At the end of it all Pakistan scraped to a victory that should have been so much more straightforward. They won by three wickets but they needed an eighth-wicket partnership of 75 between their captain, Sarfraz Ahmed, and Mohammad Amir to get them over the line. Sarfraz produced a captain’s innings of 61 not out but he was badly dropped on 38 and less culpably on 40 as Sri Lanka faltered in the field in the closing overs. This victory means that England will meet Pakistan in Cardiff in the first semi‑final on Wednesday. They may be happy about that for the surface here seems to suit some of their team (their bowlers if not their batsmen). There has not been much encouragement for bowlers in this tournament but the likelihood of some lateral movement for the fast men has been greater in Wales than in England. There may not be much pace in the pitches in Cardiff but good bowlers have sporadically found some movement. In earlier games Tim Southee, Liam Plunkett and Mark Wood have gained some assistance from grass, which Eoin Morgan has described as “thatchy”. Pakistan, especially with the introduction of Junaid Khan as a replacement for the volatile Wahab Riaz alongside Amir and Hasan Ali, now have a triumvirate of pace bowlers who seem adept at exploiting any help. Hence they may be more dangerous opponents for England than Sri Lanka might have been. Their pace trio were effective on Monday. Between them they took eight wickets with the debutant seamer Fahim Ashraf also picking up two. Such conditions favour Pakistan’s style of play. They are not so well equipped to chase the mega-totals as their batting lineup may be described as old-fashioned – with the exception of the newcomer Fakhar Zaman, a left-hander who wastes no time. But mega-totals in Cardiff are not guaranteed. On a cloudy, mercifully dry day Sri Lanka were restricted to a modest total of 236. Amir and Junaid combined to puncture the Sri Lankan effort, taking four wickets for six runs in four overs. Hence the innings subsided to 167 for seven and beyond significant restoration even though Asela Gunaratne and Suranga Lakmal managed to raise the target to 237. Sri Lanka looked to be on target for many more. After the early loss of Danushka Gunathilaka, Niroshan Dickwella and Kusal Mendis combined to add 56 enchanting runs. One ramp over the wicketkeeper’s head by Dickwella off Junaid was a shot of startling impudence and skill; Kusal Mendis oozed quality in a more orthodox manner. However, Mendis was defeated by a lethal in-ducker from Hasan Ali and Dinesh Chandimal dragged his second ball on to his stumps. Now Angelo Mathews expertly resuscitated the innings alongside Dickwella so that Sarfraz summoned up his opening bowlers in tandem. Mathews, maybe surprised by extra pace from Amir, was bowled off the inside edge; Dhananjaya de Silva nicked a beauty from Junaid, a fierce introduction to the tournament for a man who has only just been called up as a replacement for Kusal Perera. Next Dickwella was brilliantly caught by Sarfraz from an inside edge; the Pakistan captain was swamped by his colleagues in their excitement and in their recognition that this was an extraordinary one-handed take. Thisara Perera soon followed as the heart was ripped out of the Sri Lankan innings. The Sri Lankan attack does not possess the same potency but theirs is a team of granite resolve. When Pakistan were 74 without loss in the 12th over the game seemed over. But some spirited bowling and panicky Pakistan batting soon put a stop to that notion. At the start of the chase Fakhar, who has a licence to swing, drove lustily, taking three fours from a Lasith Malinga over with Azhar Ali a more watchful partner. Fakhar reached 50 from 34 balls and was promptly caught on the boundary. No matter; the older grafters would surely take Pakistan to their destination. It is never that simple. Those grafters contrived to spoon and nick catches and the Sri Lankans under the calm leadership of Mathews started to believe. Pakistan plummeted to 137 for six with Sarfraz alone suggesting permanence. In came Fahim for his first international knock and the cricket acquired a technicolour tension. A bouncer from Malinga was hooked into the crowd by Fahim to get off the mark; another was top-edged wide of the long leg fielder. He was starting to enjoy this. Perhaps the uncluttered novice would do the trick, as 25 runs were added rapidly. Then a firm straight drive from Sarfraz flicked the fingers of the bowler Perera before hitting the stumps. Fahim’s bat was over the line but not touching the turf and his dream was over. Sarfraz and Amir stayed cool; Perera at mid-on then dropped a sitter after Malinga had duped Sarfraz, the biggest and most decisive mistake of an error-strewn yet rather magnificent match."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"us-news/2017/jun/13/jeff-sessions-senate-testimony-russia-comey","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-06-13T07:00:51Z","webTitle":"Jeff Sessions poised for legal minefield as he prepares to testify on Russia","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jun/13/jeff-sessions-senate-testimony-russia-comey","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/jun/13/jeff-sessions-senate-testimony-russia-comey","fields":{"headline":"Jeff Sessions poised for legal minefield as he prepares to testify on Russia","bodyText":"The US attorney general, Jeff Sessions, is likely to step into a legal minefield on Tuesday when he answers questions under oath before the Senate intelligence committee about his contacts with Russian officials and his role in the firing of the FBI director, James Comey. What Sessions tells the committee could in turn affect the legal jeopardy of Donald Trump, who has also said he is willing to speak about his interactions with Comey under oath, although he did not indicate in what forum. The attorney general – who failed to inform the Senate about his meetings with Russian officials in his confirmation hearings – will face particularly tough questioning from the senators over his apparent role in Comey’s dismissal. One White House version of events said that Trump fired the FBI director on 9 May after concerns over his performance were raised by Sessions and his deputy, Rod Rosenstein. But Sessions had previously recused himself from matters connected to the Russia investigation, and Comey was overseeing that investigation. Furthermore, Trump said in a television interview and in an Oval Office conversation with the Russian foreign minister and ambassador the day after Comey’s dismissal that the decision to fire him was linked to that investigation. “Recommending director Comey’s firing would seem to be a violation of his recusal, and attorney general Sessions needs to answer for that,” the Democratic Senate leader, Chuck Schumer, said in a statement after Sessions’ Senate appearance was confirmed on Monday. Sessions will be appearing before the intelligence committee five days after Comey’s testimony raised new questions about the attorney general’s role. After Comey’s appearance on Thursday, the justice department put out a statement contradicting the ousted FBI director’s account of an appeal he made to Sessions to make sure he was not left alone with the Trump, who Comey believed was pressuring him to curb the scope of the investigation of contacts between the Trump campaign and Kremlin representatives. Comey said Sessions did not respond to that appeal. The justice department described the conversation very differently. “Mr Comey said, following a morning threat briefing, that he wanted to ensure he and his FBI staff were following proper communications protocol with the White House,” the statement said. It insisted that the “attorney general was not silent; he responded to this comment by saying that the FBI and department of justice needed to be careful about following appropriate policies regarding contacts with the White House”. If Sessions repeats this version of events on Tuesday, he will be testing his credibility against Comey’s. Ryan Goodman, a former Pentagon special counsel, argues that it was a test the attorney general was likely to fail, having previously made statements in the Senate that were proved untrue. At his confirmation hearing, Sessions volunteered that he had never met with Russian officials during the presidential campaign. He was later allowed to amend the record after press reports that he had met the Russian ambassador, Sergey Kislyak, twice. In the past week, there have been reports of a third meeting. Goodman argues that the justice department account is unlikely, given that the Comey-Sessions conversation was the day after an extraordinary event, in which Trump ordered other officials, Sessions included, out of the Oval Office, so that he could talk to Comey alone – a violation of White House norms that are supposed to insulate FBI directors from political pressure. “It is increasingly common these days for the administration to include a falsehood in an official statement,” Goodman wrote on the Just Security blog, which he co-edits. “Repeating that falsehood under oath before Congress is an entirely different matter. It’s a federal crime. And these proceedings have a special counsel looking over them.” Sessions may seek to invoke executive privilege in discussing his conversations with Trump, and possibly other communications too. The White House press secretary, Sean Spicer, on Monday did not rule out the possibility of Sessions invoking executive privilege to avoid answering questions about his conversations with Trump relating to Comey. “I think it depends on the scope of the questions,” he said. “To get into a hypothetical at this point would be premature.” If he does so, a lot will depend on the reaction of the committee’s chairman, Senator Richard Burr. At a hearing last week in which intelligence officials sought to evade questions, Burr warned them to go back and consult with the White House about their legal position. “At no time should you be in a position to come to Congress without an answer,” the Republican senator said. Sessions will appear in the Senate well aware he is under scrutiny from the special counsel on the Russia investigation, Robert Mueller, and that anything he says under oath will eventually be compared with Mueller’s conclusions. In his own testimony on Thursday, Comey hinted that Sessions’ involvement in the scandal could be deeper than has been revealed until now. Explaining why he had left the attorney general out of the loop in discussions about the Russia inquiry, Comey said: “We also were aware of facts that I can’t discuss in an open setting that would make his continued engagement in a Russia-related investigation problematic.” After Sessions had ducked appearances before other congressional committees, sending Rosenstein in his place, there was some question as to whether he would demand to speak in a closed session of the intelligence committee. Democrats, led by Senator Ron Wyden, said the session must be open as the matters to be discussed, Wyden said in a letter to Burr, “are directly related to threats to our democratic institutions” and therefore of the “utmost public interest”. On Monday morning, the justice department said Sessions himself had asked to speak in public. “He believes it is important for the American people to hear the truth directly from him and looks forward to answering the committee’s questions tomorrow,” it said in a statement.

The potential offer to sweeten the pill of the UK’s Brexit bill is a sketchy idea rather than a detailed proposal, but two sources familiar with the Brexit negotiations confirmed it had been discussed. “It would solve a lot of problems and mean there is no hole [in the EU budget] in 2019-2020,” said one senior source. The EU wants the UK to respect a pledge made by David Cameron as prime minister when he signed up Britain to the EU’s €1tn budget for 2014-20. The UK is due to leave the EU in March 2019, 21 months before the end of the seven-year budget. “The fact the EU budget gets messed up because of Brexit is going to cause so much anger,” Guntram Wolff, the director of the Bruegel thinktank, has said. “It will be a nightmare and major issue poisoning the debate.” The idea shows the EU is open to several varieties of Brexit, as long as it can protect its laws and budget. But it is not a foregone conclusion that the EU’s 27 member states will agree to make the offer. “It could be done if [the British] change the tone of the discussions,” suggested a source. Neither will the plan cancel out the Brexit bill, although it could knock off €36bn (£32.3bn) from the mooted €75bn net bill, as the UK would remain part of the EU budget. If the idea were on the table, Theresa May could face accusations of Brexit betrayal from hardline Eurosceptics who want to sever all ties with the EU as quickly as possible. The prime minister has said the UK will stop “making vast annual contributions to the European Union budget”, although the Tory manifesto hinted it would be “reasonable” to make a contribution to participate in some EU programmes. The plan could refocus attention on the Brexit campaigners such as Boris Johnson, now foreign secretary, and Michael Gove, newly appointed as environment secretary, who travelled on a Vote Leave battlebus emblazoned with a promise of a £350m-a-week bonanza for the NHS, based on incorrect figures on the UK’s contribution to EU coffers. The UK’s official statistics watchdog rebuked the leave campaign for the “misleading” claim, which it said undermined trust in official statistics. Johnson has since claimed May had promised £350m a week for the NHS, but neither she nor the party manifesto made any such commitment. The UK Statistics Authority said the UK paid the equivalent of £190m a week into the EU budget in 2010-14, once EU grants to Britain and the rebate secured by Margaret Thatcher were stripped out. If the EU decides to go ahead with this offer, leading Brexiters would have to confront the EU budget reality that member states pay in but also get back grants. In 2019-20 the UK is due to pay at least £32.3bn into EU coffers, which could rise to £41.5bn without the British rebate. For this membership fee, the UK would get £11.5bn, mostly in farm subsidies and economic aid for poorer regions. Grants to British scientists are not included in these Treasury figures, but the UK is the biggest beneficiary of EU research funding. Before this proposal was circulating, European politicians had stressed the UK would lose its rebate – worth £9.2bn in 2019-20 – after Brexit. Reimer Böge, a German MEP and veteran of the European parliament’s budgets committee, told the Guardian there should be no rebate for the British outside the EU. “If you want something, you are obliged to pay for it,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2017/jun/13/fearless-review-helen-mccrory-thriller-art-of-japanese-life","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2017-06-13T05:00:48Z","webTitle":"Fearless review – Helen McCrory shines in a fabulously classy thriller","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/jun/13/fearless-review-helen-mccrory-thriller-art-of-japanese-life","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2017/jun/13/fearless-review-helen-mccrory-thriller-art-of-japanese-life","fields":{"headline":"Fearless review – Helen McCrory shines in a fabulously classy thriller","bodyText":"If I didn’t know Fearless (ITV) was written by one of the writers and producers of the likes of Homeland, 24, and Person of Interest – Patrick Harbinson – I would be slightly worried about the number of balls that had been chucked gleefully into the air by the end of the first episode in its six-part run. To wit: 1. A human rights lawyer (Emma Banville, played with characteristic passion, intelligence and assiduity by Helen McCrory), whose speciality is uncovering miscarriages of justice, is being persecuted by the tabloids, who claim she is hellbent on setting “paedos” free. 2. Whose latest case involves investigating the possibly unsafe conviction of Kevin Russell, a man who has been in prison for 14 years for the murder of schoolgirl Linda Simms. He says his confession was coerced, and Emma – by the remarkably simple means of getting the autopsy report looked at by a scientist not in the police’s pocket and finding therein a whole lot of stuff that simply Does Not Add Up – quickly secures a retrial. 3. Who is also in the process of trying to adopt a child with her partner, an unfriendly witness from a former case. He is an erstwhile newspaper photographer and is played by John Bishop, who has an honest face but a thick Liverpudlian accent so we don’t know what to think. 4. And who is sheltering the wife and child of a refugee doctor who has returned to Syria to treat patients there. 5. Thus causing her to be surveilled and suspected by counter-terrorism agencies at every turn. 6. And who appears in the last 10 minutes or so to have unwittingly waded even deeper into the mire with Kevin. For lo! A set of photographs of Linda semi-clad and posing in his workshop turn up for the retrial, closely followed by Michael Gambon. He rings an American woman on a secure line and they talk cryptically about how much these photos might reveal if they did not “own” the man who took them. 7. Oh, and she is beset by nightmares connected to her father (in a hospital bed and, in his delirium, urgently apologetic to her), so a layer of dark family secrets are neatly added to the thriller millefeuille. The thrillefeuille. It is all fabulously confident and classy stuff. Lots is clearly going to happen and we may all need notebooks to keep track but after a barrage of psychological dramas, it feels quite refreshing to be watching something that acknowledges a wider world and works with a broader palette than one baffled/grieving/terrified/secretly pathological man/woman/unassuming middle manager/parent plunging down a mental rabbit hole. The Art of Japanese Life (BBC4), a three-part documentary exploring the complexities of Japanese culture, presented by Dr James Fox, promises to be utterly gorgeous in every way. Last night’s opening episode concentrated on the influence of nature, via Shinto and Buddhism, on Japanese art and an aesthetic that runs counter to ours by prizing simplicity, transience and uncertainty, and privileging questions over the hunting and spearing of facts. Emblematic of it all – after a brief summary of the history of brush painting in Japan and its place in Buddhist meditation – was Sesshu Toyo’s Haboku-sansui. An impossible variety of shades from a single colour in this 1495 splashed-ink masterpiece, applied in 50 or 60 strokes to create crags, trees, mountains, a tavern, a boat, a lake and an eternal beauty. The rest of the programme explored various formative myths, Zen gardens, bonsai art, Japan’s reverence for the cherry blossom and its painfully fleeting beauty, the effect of modernisation on the country’s traditional harmony with nature, along with so much else in an hour and in so unhurried a fashion that you felt you must have entered some kind of meditative Zen-like state yourself. Primarily, this was thanks to Fox himself and his spare and effective commentary – 50 or 60 strokes of his pen on a script and you have a landscape of knowledge. He is the ideal art presenter – expert and engagingly enthusiastic, but self-effacing; keen to explain only as much as the viewer needs to let appreciation grow and imagination bloom before moving, never too swiftly, on. The next two programmes will look at Japan’s relationship with the city and with the home.

They are now 23 and 25. It was taken on their dad’s 34th birthday. We were living in a rented flat in Edinburgh, to which we had moved not long before. We had come back from Penzance in Cornwall, where the girls were both born, to Edinburgh where their dad and I are from. They were excited about their dad’s birthday and wanted to do something special for him. He was at work all day and they were impatient for him to get home and start enjoying his birthday. We had lots of old cardboard packing boxes folded up in the flat. One of them came up with the idea of making one of the boxes into a toilet and thought it would be a great idea to hide in it until their dad came home when they would burst dramatically from the “toilet”, shouting happy birthday. They had great fun painting the box and making it into a toilet, which somehow ended up yellow with a red seat. This photo is of them practising what they were going to do when their dad walked into the room. Kirsten is the one in the toilet and Rachel is rehearsing being surprised at her sister bursting out from under the seat – as they hoped their dad would be. Their poor dad arrived home tired and stressed from a job he was not really enjoying to be faced with one child bursting out of a toilet box and the other one over-acting on the sidelines. He had no idea what on earth was meant to be going on, but acted surprised, which delighted them and made all their efforts worthwhile. Unfortunately, I didn’t take any photos of him at the crucial moment. I love this photo as it reminds me of how much I enjoyed them when they were wee. They were full of life and imagination and it was infectious. We had great fun together and I miss this aspect of our relationship now that they are older. Rachel works with people with mental health problems and her great imagination is put to good use in this role. Kirsten is just about to finish an architecture degree, so maybe it was her idea to build the toilet. I don’t think even they have any idea why they thought bursting out of a toilet would be a great birthday treat for their dad. I am now looking forward to having some grandchildren to have childish fun with, but I think that’s a few years off yet. Heather Pont Playlist: A song that transports us to the Côte d’Azur Midnight Blue by ELO “I see the lonely road that leads so far away / I see the distant lights that left behind the day / But what I see is so much more than I can say / And I see you in midnight blue” I grew up on a remote farm in mid-Wales in the 1970s and my sister and I discovered ELO in the hotel disco during the hot summer nights of 1976, on a family holiday to Bournemouth. Good times but, by the summer of 1980, the weather had cooled. My dad decided we had seen enough of East Sussex and planned instead to drive his family to the south of France. It couldn’t possibly take more than a couple of days door to door in a Ford Granada. Even after the initial sweltering four-hour drive to London, where we had to stop for a tyre change on Park Lane mid-rush hour traffic, my dad didn’t lose his focus. When we reached France, he drove as if he had been born driving on the right-hand side, spending eight hours at the wheel before admitting defeat and pulling off the motorway to go in search of a B&amp;B. On the evening we officially reached the south of France, descending a winding hairpin track from the mountains to see the colours of the coastline at dusk stretch out before us, Jeff Lynne of ELO was singing Midnight Blue. The air was filled with the scent of lavender and the sounds from the stereo and the sight of the sea mesmerised the senses of a road-weary Evans family. It was just the best holiday, captured for ever for us through the tracks of ELO’s Discovery album. My lovely dad is 86 now and living in a care home and has dementia. On a good day though, I will take him out for a drive and we will zoom around the Welsh hills of his youth, while the sun shines down and Jeff Lynne sings. Music magically joins up the dots in his brain and soon enough he is right back there on the Côte d’Azur, his clear blue eyes still smiling at the beauty of it all. Thanks for the memories, Dad – we love you.

Pour the mixture over the toast, grate a bit more cheese on top and grill. After an impoverished time living in London, Peter heard that the streets of Australia were paved with gold and emigrated. On arriving there, he became an eminent engineer, touring the west coast advising on construction and demolition in equal measures. Although the streets weren’t glittering, the beaches were, and he would spend every spare moment by the ocean – either having barbecues or surfing – until a shark scared him out of the water. He enjoyed sharing the barbecues with his family and friends, and was very generous in offering ice-cold cans of lager as the last rays of the sun set beyond the horizon. Back at his house he would use the last dregs of beer to make his famous “poor boy in London Welsh rarebit” – a reminder of how tough things had been but how well he had eaten on a minimal amount of money.

Another MP leaving the committee room said: “She was very concerned about people who have lost their seats. The party is going to help them, some of them are in dire financial situations. She did say sorry, several times. She apologised for colleagues losing their seats, for making the call about the early election.” Tories banged on the tables for about 30 seconds as May arrived for the crunch meeting in front of her politicians, many of whom have expressed anger at the result. The prime minister was said to offer reassurance that an electoral pact with the DUP would not affect gay rights. MPs said the room was roasting hot, packed with members of the House of Lords as well as MPs. May took questions, but one MP described them as more like “speeches”. There was no appetite for a leadership election, the MP said. “That’s the last thing the country needs. She said she would serve us as long as we want her, and that she’s been a party servant since she was 12 years old, stuffing envelopes.” MPs said there was a tacit acceptance of the need to build a better consensus. “A broader backing for Brexit has to be built and I think she recognises that,” one former minister said. “She was clear she was responsible. She agreed on the need to listen to all the wings of the party on Brexit.” At the centre of the debate were concerns about the manifesto. MPs told the prime minister it had been a disaster with voters, particularly policies on social care and the decision to press ahead with school funding cuts. “Public sector workers felt very strongly about austerity,” a former cabinet minister said. “We have to offer a message of aspiration, which is a very Conservative word.” The so-called “dementia tax” reforms to social care were also raised, MPs said, and the prime minister acknowledged the move had been unpopular, as had school cuts. Several MPs told May they had difficulties rebutting questions over school funding on doorsteps and in local hustings. Justine Greening, the education secretary, had been told to focus on addressing those concerns, the prime minister said. Leaving the committee room, MPs described May’s response as “emotionally intelligent” given how she had been criticised for not mentioning the colleagues who had lost their seats in her first appearance after the election as she entered Downing Street. “There was a discussion, but there wasn’t a single MP who dissented,” one minister said. Several were aghast at the idea of another election. Lessons would be learned from what went right as well as wrong, one minister said, with the party’s 12 new Scottish MPs greeted with cheers when they arrived. Gavin Barwell, the former housing minister who lost his seat and has since been appointed the prime minister’s chief of staff, was cheered on arrival and hailed by one MP previously critical of May as “a huge step forward”. MPs said May spoke unprompted about concerns they might have about the DUP, especially over gay rights. “She said there would be no watering down of equalities legislation, which is to be welcomed,” one MP said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2017/jun/16/stockholm-my-love-review-mark-cousins-neneh-cherry","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2017-06-16T06:00:01Z","webTitle":"Stockholm, My Love review – a cerebral city-symphony film from Mark Cousins","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/jun/16/stockholm-my-love-review-mark-cousins-neneh-cherry","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2017/jun/16/stockholm-my-love-review-mark-cousins-neneh-cherry","fields":{"headline":"Stockholm, My Love review – a cerebral city-symphony film from Mark Cousins","bodyText":"Stockholm, My Love is an intriguing and palate-cleansing work, ruminative and cerebral, with a literary feel, like an elegant European novella in translation. There are some tremendous reportage images created by both Mark Cousins and Christopher Doyle as cinematographers, showing the city’s clear, open, mostly unpopulated spaces. In the city-symphony tradition, it has something of Chris Petit and Iain Sinclair’s London Orbital or Cousins’ own previous work, I Am Belfast. This is vernacular cinema, in its way, straightforwardly taking the camera for a walk. Stockholm, My Love stars singer Neneh Cherry, presented in downbeat, daylit and unglamorised closeup, and the whole film could be seen as a reverse engineered video for her title song, which comes in at the very end. She plays an academic who had come to Stockholm to give a lecture on the city’s architecture, but has abandoned this plan, apparently in the grip of depression, and instead wanders Stockholm without speaking. A voiceover narrative gives us her thoughts in a pensive undertone. She addresses her dead father, who lived in the city, and another man to whom she feels a heavy, grief-laden debt due to an awful event in which she was involved the previous year. Her anxiety is numbed and displaced outwards, into the cityscape, as a way of managing her emotions and re-establishing her authority. It is a study of grief suppressed and a personality becalmed."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"news/2017/jun/13/corrections-and-clarifications","type":"article","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webPublicationDate":"2017-06-13T20:00:07Z","webTitle":"Corrections and clarifications","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2017/jun/13/corrections-and-clarifications","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/2017/jun/13/corrections-and-clarifications","fields":{"headline":"Corrections and clarifications","bodyText":"• Some errors crept into our general election coverage on Saturday. We said 315 MPs were needed for a working majority in the 650-seat House of Commons, because the Speaker and his three deputies do not vote, and the seven Sinn Féin MPs will not take their seats. Taking these into account, 320 MPs are needed for a simple majority (Governing in the minority, page 6). • In mapping the results (page 9), we showed Labour winning Rochdale from the Conservatives. Labour won the seat from Simon Danczuk, who had been suspended from the Labour party and ran as an independent candidate. The Conservatives gained Southport from the Liberal Democrats, not from Labour. We credited Liverpool Walton with the biggest winning majority, at 32,551 (In numbers, page 11).

Where is Hope Solo? The former – and perhaps future – US women’s goalkeeper, who parlayed her fame into an appearance on Dancing With The Stars and legions of social media followers, had pulled a reverse DB Cooper, leaving Washington state and disappearing into an area defined by her management only as “rural North Carolina”. Now she’s tiptoeing back into the spotlight. She’s making a handful of media and public appearances, all on her own terms. Over the weekend, she was in Philadelphia as an ambassador for Street Soccer USA, which hosted a youth event and announced teams for the Homeless World Cup. She’s doing neither of the things for which she’s famous – playing soccer and stirring up controversy. Those who know Solo still aren’t ready to talk about her and what she may do in the future. Among those who declined or didn’t respond to requests for comment from the Guardian for this story: Solo’s lawyers, the US women’s players union and a number of former team-mates. So now the question is more complex: who is Hope Solo? And who will she be when she’s healthy enough to play again? Solo has little left to accomplish in international soccer. She has two Olympic gold medals and one World Cup title. Individually, she has two World Cup Golden Glove awards and a staggering 102 shutouts in 202 games. She has been off the field for two reasons. Firstly because of shoulder replacement surgery, a final effort to clear up some long-standing issues. Secondly, and more infamously, because of her six-month suspension (now served) from the US team after the 2016 Olympics. In Rio, she referred to Sweden, the first team to beat the USA in the quarter-finals of a major tournament, as “a bunch of cowards”, the latest in a long line of controversies dating back to her benching and subsequent outburst at the 2007 World Cup. Solo has said her fight for equal pay for women’s players was a factor in her dismissal. But the other players who led that effort – Becky Sauerbrunn, Carli Lloyd, Alex Morgan and Megan Rapinoe – continue to have prominent roles with the team, sometimes in spite of hard-core fans’ preferences to see younger players in the mix. Another narrative: US Soccer put up with Solo until a drop in performance, including a couple of uncharacteristic blunders in the 2016 Olympics, made her expendable. CNN commentator Mel Robbins made that case in criticizing US Soccer as an example of a dysfunctional organization tolerating misbehavior by its top performers: “She’s dominated the field for more than a decade, which is why her behavior off the field has been tolerated for so long. She has trashed her coaches, berated team-mates and frustrated the federation. And until now, US Soccer has given her behavior a slap on the wrist. Last Wednesday, that came to an end.” US Soccer did indeed put forth the line that the “cowards” comment was simply the last straw. “Each time an action has been taken there’s been made clear an expectation that this would be the last time such a step would be necessary,” coach Jill Ellis said in September. And Solo’s list of controversies, and triumphant returns, is long. She was benched for the 2007 World Cup semi-final against Brazil – reasons cited include the implausible notion that the team had more confidence in rusty veteran Briana Scurry and the plausible notion that missing curfew and a team meeting had not gone over well – and sounded off after the USA’s 4-0 loss with a cutting comment: “shere’s no doubt in my mind I would’ve made those saves.” She was cast out by angry team-mates. But the next year, she was back. And in the 2008 Olympic final, she turned in one of her many big-game masterpieces as the USA won gold and exacted revenge on the Brazilian team that played them off the field in 2007. Over the next four-year cycle, she courted controversy several times, hurling accusations of favoritism and even racism at rivals and others associated with Women’s Professional Soccer, the league that ran from 2009 to 2011. Her 2012 book, Solo: A Memoir of Hope, doubled down on some of those accusations and re-opened the scars of the 2007 benching. A couple of her targets returned fire. Greg Ryan, who was US coach during Solo’s benching at the 2007 World Cup, denied her allegation that he shoved her in a meeting. Andrew Crossley, a former executive with the Boston Breakers, picked apart Solo’s restated accusations of racial abuse from Boston fans. Maksim Chmerkovskiy, her partner on Dancing With The Stars, denied claims that he slapped her. But most of her former colleagues simply don’t engage. Brandi Chastain, a veteran player who handled commentary duties in the 2012 Olympics, said little in response to Solo’s Twitter critique of her broadcasting skills. Team-mates from 2007 said little about her accusations of unfair treatment. And once again, Solo shook off the controversy and emerged with on-field honors: a Golden Glove and Bronze Ball in the 2011 World Cup despite a loss in the final to a brilliant Japanese team, then Olympic gold in 2012. The controversies of the next four years didn’t involve soccer. The general public learned of her engagement to former NFL player Jerramy Stevens when police arrested Stevens at her house the evening before their wedding in 2012. (Stevens was never charged.) In 2015, Stevens served 30 days in jail and Solo was suspended from the national team for 30 days after Stevens was arrested for DUI while driving a US team van. Another family incident is still tied up in Washington’s courts. In 2014, she was charged with two counts of fourth-degree assault after an incident with two relatives. A local judge dismissed the charges the next year due to issues with depositions and witnesses, but prosecutors successfully appealed to reinstate them in October 2015. Solo’s legal team has fought the decision to reinstate the charges ever since, losing several appeals and reviews but eventually getting the case put on hold until the state Supreme Court rules on an unrelated case that also has witness issues. All of which means Solo may or may not need to return from her new home or perhaps a new club team to stand trial in Washington, depending in part on how well prosecutors followed procedure in an obscure DUI case that doesn’t involve Solo in the least. But Solo was able to participate in the World Cup and Olympics, all while maintaining a high profile. A documentary called Keeping Score had a shocking finale: Solo’s raw emotions after US Soccer suspended her for six months and terminated her playing contract. Solo also opted against returning to her NWSL team, the Seattle Reign. A month later, she had her shoulder surgery. And for the most part, she dropped from public view for a while. She still isn’t doing many interviews. An exception was an interview/photo shoot for Seattle-based Ville Magazine that offered more brand promotion than in-depth information. Next to a photo of Solo wearing $798 leggings and a $436 leather jacket, the introduction maintains the well-worn narrative of Solo as the target of misplaced slings and arrows: “However, physical injuries aren’t the only challenge she’s had to withstand. Being a subject of controversy in her personal and professional life has taken its own toll. The media has painted a negative picture of this Washington native, but that is far from what defines her and who she really is.” She did give a glimpse of her controversial side in an entertaining promo for TV network Eurosport. Filmed in Barcelona, the short video shows Solo bossing around the equally colorful Eric Cantona, riffing on Lionel Messi’s tax issues, and firing back at Polish legend Zbigniew Boniek over his dismissal of “a woman’s input” in soccer. “Well, Zbigniew,” Solo says to the camera. “How about my foot in your balls? Is that useful input?” She also works in a shot at the US women’s national team’s new collective bargaining agreement. “They finally made it equitable,” Solo says. “Meaning equal minus 40%.” The new CBA terms aren’t public, but we know that the team’s leaders – at least, once Solo was no longer in the picture – asked to maintain the women’s team’s unique salary-based structure rather than the men’s bonus-only structure, rendering a strict percentage comparison impossible. But such barbs are infrequent these days. Her once-fiery Twitter feed is now a low-key, erratically updated stream of gardening photos, promotions for refugee aid, positive reinforcement of other political causes, and the occasional playful tweet making light of her absence from soccer fields and TV screens. She has more video projects lined up – an appearance on a golfing series with Lady Antebellum’s Charles Kelley, and a medical documentary series called The Cutting Edge, for which she is also an executive producer. She also teased a return to the field, then revealed she was merely playing in a alumni game at the University of Washington. Such tweets raise the inevitable question: can Solo come back? Or is she ready to make a metamorphosis like John McEnroe, who plays the bad-boy image from his playing days for the occasional laugh? Her interview with Ville magazine leaves things vague. “I’m not trying to be in any hurry right now,” she says. “I’m just going to follow what Dr [Frederick Matsen, her surgeon] had to say and listen to my body. I’m not going to be pressured by anyone – I’m going to do what’s best for me.” Solo mentions overseas options. And though she speaks highly of Seattle’s incumbent keeper Haley Kopmeyer in her Ville interview, she says the Reign would welcome her back. In the same interview, she appears to rule out playing for the USA as long as men and women are not paid equally. Even if she makes peace with the women’s pay and US Soccer gives her another chance, an aging keeper – Solo turns 36 in late July – returning from surgery may find it more difficult to claim a spot on the US roster. The starting goalkeeper position has rarely been in dispute – Scurry from 1995 to 2004 except for a brief tenure for Siri Mullinix, then Solo ever since – but it’s open now. Alyssa Naeher and Ashlyn Harris took turns as Solo’s primary backup, and the NWSL has seen the emergence of a younger generation, including Kopmeyer. But Solo, who has always been better in international play than in club play, has that intangible – a tendency to come up big in the biggest games. “I believe she’s still the best goalkeeper in the women’s game, and if she wants to play, I would never doubt her,” says Ann Killion, a Bay Area sportswriter and the co-author of Solo’s memoir. And whether she returns to the US team or not, Solo may still make waves again. Ville magazine says, “Hope may have left Seattle on her quest to get back some peace, but she doesn’t plan on staying quiet.” So what would an older and presumably wiser Solo say?"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/jun/13/election-tories-media-broadcasters-press-jeremy-corbyn","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-06-13T18:43:26Z","webTitle":"The election’s biggest losers?

Not the Tories but the media, who missed the story","bodyText":"The election was a crushing defeat – but not for either of the major parties. The faction that now retreats in utter disarray wasn’t technically standing, though in the past it has arguably wielded more power than the formal contestants. I’m talking about the media. The rightwing press threw everything it had at Jeremy Corbyn, and failed to knock him over. In doing so, it broke its own power. Its wild claims succeeded in destroying not Corbyn’s credibility but its own. However the problem is by no means confined to the corporate media. The failure also belongs to media outside the grasp of billionaires. It is one from which some platforms may struggle to recover. There is no point in trying to hide or minimise this: the election has been a disaster for mainstream outlets. They missed the moment because they were constitutionally destined to do so. The issue that caused this disaster is the one that eventually fells all forms of power: the media has created a hall of mirrors, in which like-minded people reflect and reproduce each other’s opinions. The broadcasters echo what the papers say, the papers pick up what the broadcasters say. A narrow group of favoured pundits appear on the news programmes again and again. Press prizes are awarded to those who reflect the consensus, and denied to those who think differently. People won’t step outside the circle for fear of ridicule and exclusion. A study at Cardiff University shows how the broadcasters allow themselves to be led by the newspapers, despite the massive bias of the printed press. For example, during the 2015 election campaign opinion polls revealed that the NHS came top of the list of voters’ concerns while the economy came third. But the economy, on which the Conservatives were perceived to be strongest, received four times as much coverage on TV news as the NHS, which was seen as Labour’s strongest suit. This appeared to reflect the weight given to these issues in the papers, most of which sought a Conservative victory. An analysis by the Media Reform Coalition and Birkbeck College found that, despite the rules on impartiality and balance, when Corbyn’s leadership was being challenged last summer, the BBC’s evening news bulletins gave almost twice as much airtime to his critics as they gave to his supporters. They often ascribed militancy and aggression to him and his supporters, but never to his challengers. One report on the BBC News at Six finished with the words “This is a fight only one side can win. The others are being carted off to irrelevance. The place for political losers.” The accompanying shot showed a dustbin lorry setting off, painted with the word Corbyn. This problem also affects the Guardian. According to a study by the London School of Economics of the representation of Corbyn by newspapers in his first two months as Labour leader (in the autumn of 2015), around a fifth of news articles in this paper lacked balance. Overall, roughly 18% of its coverage was judged supportive of Corbyn, 53% was neutral, and 29% was negative. This is a better balance than in the other liberal papers. Indeed, the Guardian had more diverse and more pro-Corbyn voices than any other mainstream outlet. Only the Guardian and the Mirror enthusiastically supported both Labour and Corbyn in election editorials. But the scales still didn’t balance. Even I, who was supportive at the beginning of Corbyn’s candidacy and during his election campaign, fell into despair about his leadership during the winter after a series of fiascos in parliament, and tweeted: “I have now lost all faith.” The net result is that the most dynamic political force this nation has seen for decades feels alienated by the media, and not just by the Tory press. Those who have thrown so much energy into the great political revival, many of whom are young, have been almost unrepresented; their concerns and passions have been unheeded, misunderstood or reviled. When they have raised complaints, journalists have often reacted angrily, writing off movements that have gathered in hope as a rabble of Trots and wreckers. This response has been catastrophic in the age of social media. What many people in this movement now perceive is a solid bloc of affluent, middle-aged journalists instructing young people mired in rent and debt to abandon their hopes of a better world. Why has it come to this, even in the media that’s not owned by billionaires? It is partly because this industry, in which people without a degree could once work their way up from the floor, now tends to select its entrants from a small, highly educated pool. The use of internships narrows the selection further. Wherever they come from, journalists, on average, end up better paid than most people. Whatever their professed beliefs, they tend to be drawn towards their class interests. But the biggest problem, I believe, is that we spend too much time in each other’s company, a tendency that is fatal in an industry that is meant to reflect the world. There has been a major effort by some media, including the Guardian, to get away from Westminster and to hear the voices of the rest of the country. This is good, but it is not enough. What counts is not only the new people and new ideas you encounter, but also the old ones you leave behind. The first ambition of a journalist should be to know as few journalists as possible – to escape the hall of mirrors. The media as a whole has succumbed to a new treason of the intellectuals, first absorbing dominant ideologies, then persuading each other that these are the only views worth holding. If we are to reclaim some relevance in these times of flux and crisis, we urgently need to broaden the pool of contributors and perspectives. We should actively recruit people from poorer backgrounds, and diversify our expertise. Newsrooms tend to be largely peopled by humanities graduates. Over the years, I have found myself explaining to other journalists how to calculate percentages, that two orders of magnitude greater does not mean double, and that animals and mammals are not synonyms. There is a lack of contact not only with most of the population, but also with the material world and its physical parameters. We need to interrogate every item of the news agenda and the way in which it is framed. We should ask ourselves where our own interests lie – and how we might avoid reproducing them. And, to the greatest extent possible, we should avoid each other like the plague."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"film/2017/jun/16/by-time-gets-dark-review-bangkok-protests-massacre-anocha-suwichakornpong","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2017-06-16T11:00:07Z","webTitle":"By the Time It Gets Dark review – engrossingly mystical Bangkok protests drama","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/jun/16/by-time-gets-dark-review-bangkok-protests-massacre-anocha-suwichakornpong","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2017/jun/16/by-time-gets-dark-review-bangkok-protests-massacre-anocha-suwichakornpong","fields":{"headline":"By the Time It Gets Dark review – engrossingly mystical Bangkok protests drama","bodyText":"Thailand could yet be the birthplace for a new kind of cinema: Buddhist supernatural realism. This fascinating, enigmatic feature from 41-year-old Thai film-maker Anocha Suwichakornpong is obviously comparable to the work of Thailand’s much-garlanded Cannes Palme d’Or-winning director Apichatpong Weerasethakul. She has something of his quietism and transcendentalism, the same feeling for the mysteries of the northern forests and the alternative spiritual realities that can make themselves plain in a simple setting. But she has a distinctive postmodern angularity and quirk; Suwichakornpong keeps you off balance with shroom-fuelled fantasy and Lynchian departures. On the surface, it is a movie within a movie about a notorious military massacre of student protesters in Bangkok in 1976. We see glimpses of this, followed by a scene showing a film director, Ann (Visra Vichit-Vadakan), welcoming the now middle-aged former protester Taew (Rassami Paoluengton) to the pleasant vacation hotel where she plans to conduct interviews on which she will base a script. The intercut protest scenes are perhaps how the resulting film pans out, or how Ann imagines it, or how Taew remembers it. But then we get digressive scenes showing Peter (Arak Amornsupasiri), the main actor, and his celebrity life unfolding in parallel. We see Ann – dissatisfied with her own glib and superficial treatment of history – diarising to camera about how as a child she could move objects with telekinesis. We see her hallucinating in the forest, and we see the waitress who served them coffee and breakfast recurring as different characters. It is an engrossingly strange, confident leap down the conceptual rabbit hole, and a very accomplished piece of film-making."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"books/2017/jun/17/rereading-my-cousin-rachel-daphne-du-maurier","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2017-06-17T11:00:36Z","webTitle":"My Cousin Rachel: Daphne du Maurier's take on the sinister power of sex","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/jun/17/rereading-my-cousin-rachel-daphne-du-maurier","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2017/jun/17/rereading-my-cousin-rachel-daphne-du-maurier","fields":{"headline":"My Cousin Rachel: Daphne du Maurier's take on the sinister power of sex","bodyText":"At first sight, the scene could not be more romantic. Philip Ashley, on the verge of coming into his inheritance, intends, in just a few hours, to tip the lot – vast Cornish estate, family jewels and his entire fortune – into the lap of his dead cousin’s widow Rachel, the older woman with whom he is besotted. He takes a euphoric late-night dip in the sea and strides back to the house where – though he does not know it yet – she is about to make him the happiest man alive. As he makes his way through the eerily moonlit woods and chooses the path which will lead him to his lover (and, it turns out, a lot more besides), an odour reaches his nostrils – a “rank vixen smell” which for a moment or two seems to stop him in his tracks. Rank vixen smell. I wonder if I even noticed these three brooding little words when I first read My Cousin Rachel as a teenager. Now though, rather like its protagonist, I am also stopped in my tracks. In fact, revisiting this fantastically well-wrought novel of suspicions and betrayals some four decades later – and watching Roger Michell’s startlingly honest new film, starring Rachel Weisz – they might as well be lit in blazing neon. I doubt there’s a phrase in the entire novel which better sums up what Daphne du Maurier is up to. In some ways it is an age-old story, albeit with a trademark Du Maurier twist: sexually inexperienced 25-year-old becomes infatuated with someone 10 years older. Having already lost his heart, he is then (very willingly) initiated into sex, assuming all the time that marriage, or at least everlasting love, is on the cards. But no, he wakes next morning – ecstatic and feeling that “everything in life was now resolved” – to discover that the object of his affections is cool and distant, acting as if nothing much has happened. Nothing new about this; it is after all a position in which women have found themselves for centuries. Only here Du Maurier artfully turns the tables, handing the power and control to the woman. The passionate tryst which Philip took to imply betrothal turns out, for his more experienced and worldly lover, to have been no more than friendship-with-benefits. And though My Cousin Rachel – written in 1951 when Du Maurier was, arguably, at the height of her confidence and powers – might appear to be a simple did-she-didn’t-she thriller about Cornish estates and poisonings, it is absolutely and inescapably a novel about sex. Most specifically female sexuality: its ambiguity, its mystery and its potentially fatal – as perceived by men – power. Indeed, the sinister, devouring threat of the female – in the shape of black widow Rachel, who might as well be a spider for the patient way in which she watches and weaves and waits – is present almost from the first chapter. When he is orphaned as a baby, Philip is adopted by his kindly older cousin Ambrose. The household is a gruff male bastion – which has so far successfully protected itself in every possible way from the opposite sex. Even the servants and the dogs are male. So when “crusty cynical woman-hater” Ambrose writes home from Florence to say that he is to be married, the news is greeted with shock and bafflement – and a certain amount of resentment from his young charge. How could any female have managed to storm his battlements? Rank vixen smell, indeed. And when Ambrose dies in mysterious circumstances and we learn that the widow is on her way to see Philip, the odour only intensifies. His suspicions about his cousin’s death may be well-founded but they are also, you sense, at least partly driven by fear of this particular unknown. For here is a young man who has never been in close proximity with a woman. “It was a queer sensation having a woman in the pew beside me,” he says of his first outing to church with Rachel. The queer sensation is to prove ever more intoxicating. In love with the sheer novelty of femaleness, Philip is easy prey – and Rachel does not hesitate to take advantage. Allowing him to glimpse her in various states of undress (pinning up her hair, leaving the door of her boudoir ajar while she dresses, putting flowers about the house), she employs her full arsenal. And Philip is naturally bewitched. “I think she had no knowledge what it did to me,” he declares with touching yet preposterous innocence, remarking on the way that she touches his head or his shoulder in passing. Watching Rachel slowly land Philip is one of the chief pleasures of the novel – and Du Maurier makes sure it is done with a rhythm and honesty and even humour which cannot help but make us complicit. For although the story, tightly plotted with small clues slipping out here and there, encourages us to fear for Philip, we cannot help it: we want Rachel to have him. In fact, and this is true of much of Du Maurier’s work, subtle humour is key. Without it, Rachel would be a much less interestingly complex and ambiguous character. With her eyes full of a “solemnity” which “spelt mischief”, we can’t help but warm to her. And neither can Philip, who is quick to forget that he ever suspected her of anything. Back in 1975, when I first checked the book out of Nottingham Central Library in its polythene-covered yellow Gollancz jacket and read it in my nylon-quilted single bed, I think I believed Philip – 10 years older than I was, just as Rachel is another 10 years older than he is – to be a grown-up. I believed every word he said and I fell in love with Rachel through his eyes. But I certainly feared for him as well. My strongest memories of the novel are of treading its pages alongside him – hanging on every word of this most plausibly reliable narrator, of being frightened and drawn in equal measure by those shadowy corridors and candlelit boudoirs, the ominous stashes of laburnum seeds and, most memorably of all, the rickety bridge strung up high over a sunken Cornish garden. Danger, subterfuge and the possibility of falling. At 15, I was still an awkward few years away from kissing my first boy and Rachel’s world – a world of dizzy sexual heights – seemed quite literally frightening. “Was Rachel innocent or was she guilty?” wonders Philip in chapter one. Back then, suspecting that if you could seduce a man this effortlessly then you could also, surely, poison him, I don’t think I was in any doubt: she was guilty. But what a difference four decades make. One of the most likeable aspects of Michell’s wonderfully crunchy new film is that, though it leaves itself open to either verdict, still it tilts things – rightly I think – very slightly in Rachel’s favour. Though he sticks almost word-for-word to the plot, there are some nice new touches. An extra, faintly comical sex scene, only barely implied in the book, makes a satisfying kind of sense. There is also a strong suggestion that Rachel’s slippery friend Rainaldi, far from being some kind of a Machiavellian paramour (something which always felt troubling in the book) is in fact homosexual. Which again makes total sense. In fact, both additions make Rachel’s world seem more rather than less complicated – and also emotionally honest. Du Maurier would approve. Rachel is a woman who, at 35, has been married at least twice and clearly had other love affairs. She has miscarried a child – something which both book and film hint has taken an emotional toll. It is also strongly implied that she has suffered violence at the hands of more than one man. There have been hands at her throat, we are told. Rachel is a woman who has felt shame and fear as well as loss. With her small hands – repeatedly described – and small narrow face, she is an undeniably exotic presence, but a vulnerable one, too. It is hard not to feel – and Du Maurier leaves plenty of room for such an interpretation – that it is in part her very vulnerability that makes her so terrifying to men. It is easy to forget that the novel begins with a description not of love or sex, but of death. As Ambrose forces seven-year-old Philip to look at a body swinging from a Cornish gibbet, dead for four weeks, its “swollen limbs like pulpy paper”, he invites his young charge to be sick behind the hedge if necessary “and remember I have not seen you”. Witnessed or not, Philip barely makes it to the hedge. Later, on his brief trip to Florence to attempt to rescue Ambrose, Philip encounters a young female beggar with an “ageless, haunting” face – a person who seems to have “contemplated life so long it had become indifferent to her”. The beggar’s face haunts the novel and seems in some way to be linked to the image of the corpse on the gibbet. I remember that this image troubled me as a teenager, and it is all credit to this most superlative of writers that even now all these years later, contemplating this tightly plotted, sinuous and undeniably feral piece of work, I am still trying to decide what I feel about it. • Julie Myerson’s latest novel is The Stopped Heart (Vintage).

The veteran politician, known for his controversial remarks on climate change, rape and homosexuality, is standing down from the European parliament on 31 July, after an 18-year career as an MEP. He can appeal against the repayment demand at the European court of justice in Luxembourg. If he loses, the parliament has the right to claw back the money by withholding a chunk of a generous “transitional allowance” MEPs get on their departure. His resignation was announced in a European parliament notice published in Strasbourg on Tuesday. No explanation was given for Helmer’s decision to resign midway through the European parliamentary term. The Guardian has learnt that Helmer faces a bill close to £100,000 for illicitly employing a Ukip party worker, Paul Oakden, as his assistant. Oakden’s contract has already been suspended. MEPs are banned from hiring full-time assistants who have jobs in national political parties. Paul Oakden was employed as Helmer’s assistant, while also working as Ukip chairman, according to the party website and in-house magazine. European parliament financial controllers began their investigation last year and are due to send Helmer a formal “letter for recovery” because they are not satisfied with his explanations of an “administrative misunderstanding”. Helmer can appeal to the European court of justice in Luxembourg to contest the repayment demand, but if he loses the parliament can claw back the money from a possible €159,000 transitional allowance that the MEP is entitled to for two years after stepping down. The sum for Helmer’s transitional allowance has been calculated by the Guardian using the parliament’s rulebook, but the final amount could vary and has not been set by in-house accountants. Contacted by the Guardian, Helmer said: “The only comment I have is how do you know about it and I don’t.” He declined to answer further questions, but said he would make a statement in a regular news bulletin to his supporters later on Tuesday. The Guardian was copied into an email Helmer sent to senior officials at the European parliament in February, where he rejected the allegations as “black propaganda”. Helmer is one of eight Ukip MEPs who has been investigated by European parliament financial controllers for alleged misuse of EU funds in 2017. Investigations are ongoing into the offices of Ukip former leaders Paul Nuttall and Nigel Farage, as well as other MEPs, including Raymond Finch, a Farage protege. The parliament has closed cases into assistants working for James Carver and Jonathan Arnott, without further action. But further demands for repayment of EU funds are expected. Helmer, 73, was a businessman who was elected to the European parliament in 1999 as a Conservative party MEP and re-elected in 2004 and 2009 before defecting to Ukip in March 2012. Known for his hostility to climate science, Helmer has described global warming as “myth” and as a Conservative MEP spent public money on a billboard campaign decrying wind turbines in his East Midlands constituency. He caused outrage when he said some people find same-sex relationships “distasteful if not viscerally repugnant” and argued that there are “different degrees of culpability” in rape cases. Farage, then Ukip leader, said some of Helmer’s remarks on homosexuality had gone too far. But the MEP continued to play a prominent role in Ukip’s team and was deployed on the airwaves to defend the party, when in 2016 it was asked to repay €173,000 (£148,000) in misspent EU funds and denied an even larger amount in grants, for misspending EU money. A European parliament political group dominated by Ukip was found to have broken EU rules by pouring European money into their campaign war-chest in the 2015 British general election."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/jun/13/eu-takes-action-against-eastern-states-for-refusing-to-take-refugees","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-06-13T16:31:25Z","webTitle":"EU takes action against eastern states for refusing to take refugees","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jun/13/eu-takes-action-against-eastern-states-for-refusing-to-take-refugees","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/jun/13/eu-takes-action-against-eastern-states-for-refusing-to-take-refugees","fields":{"headline":"EU takes action against eastern states for refusing to take refugees","bodyText":"The European commission has launched a legal case against Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic for refusing to take in refugees, intensifying a bitter feud within the bloc about how to deal with migration. The Eurosceptic governments in Poland and Hungary have refused to take in anyone under a plan agreed by a majority of EU leaders in 2015 to relocate migrants from frontline states Italy and Greece to help ease their burden. The Czech Republic initially accepted 12 people but has since said it would not welcome more. Speaking at a news conference on Tuesday, the EU’s migration chief, Dimitris Avramopoulos, said: “I regret to see that despite our repeated calls to pledge to relocate, the Czech Republic, Hungary, and Poland have not yet taken the necessary action. “For this reason, the commission has decided to launch infringement procedures against these three member states … I sincerely hope that these member states can still reconsider their position and contribute fairly.” The legal action is likely to reinvigorate the debate over the independence of EU states from Brussels. It kickstarts months, or even years, of legal wrangling before a top EU court could potentially impose financial penalties. Out of 160,000 refugees due to be taken under the scheme agreed in 2015, only 20,869 have been relocated. In theory, countries can be fined for every refugee in the quota they fail to accept. The Czech prime minister, Bohuslav Sobotka, nosediving in the polls and facing elections in November, claimed the commission was “blindly insisting on pushing ahead with dysfunctional quotas which decreased citizens’ trust in EU abilities and pushed back working and conceptual solutions to the migration crisis”. He added: “Given the deteriorating security situation in Europe and the non-functioning of the quota system, the Czech government will not participate in it. We are ready to defend our position in the EU and the relevant judicial institutions.” But speaking in Prague, the former Italian prime minister Massimo D’Alema said the EU “cannot tolerate countries that do not respect the law that is based on our fundamental values and those values are to respect human rights”. He added: “The only way to solve the crisis is to share the burden. It is not acceptable for Germany to take 1 million refugees and for some EU states to simply say no. In that case, sanctions are needed.” The eastern states are firmly opposed to accepting any asylum seekers, and believe their populations will not accept large numbers of migrants, especially if imposed by the EU. Speaking in Hungary’s parliament earlier on Monday, the prime minister, Viktor Orbán, said: “We will not give in to blackmail from Brussels and we reject the mandatory relocation quota.” Poland’s interior minister, Mariusz Błaszczak, said: “We believe that the relocation methods attract more waves of immigration to Europe; they are ineffective.” The Czech Republic had initially taken in 12 people from their assigned quota of 2,691, but said earlier in June it would take no more, citing security concerns. Sobotka argued on Monday that the biggest crisis facing the EU was terrorism. Poland and Hungary have refused to take in a single person under a plan agreed in 2015 to relocate 160,000 asylum seekers from Italy and Greece, which had been overwhelmed by an influx of people from the Middle East and Africa. Although the number of refugees coming into Europe from Syria along the Balkan route has fallen, the number of migrants crossing the Mediterranean from Libya has risen significantly, placing great pressure on local Italian authorities. Critics of the eastern European countries’ stance over refugees claim they are willing to accept the economic benefits of the EU, including access to the single market, but have shown a disregard for the humanitarian and political responsibilities. Hungary, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Romania opposed agreeing to the relocation scheme for asylum seekers in 2015, but were outvoted. Although generally opposed, Poland eventually voted with the majority."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"culture/2017/jun/13/michael-palin-donates-notebooks-to-british-library-monty-python","type":"article","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webPublicationDate":"2017-06-13T16:06:53Z","webTitle":"Michael Palin donates 22 years' worth of notebooks to British Library","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2017/jun/13/michael-palin-donates-notebooks-to-british-library-monty-python","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/2017/jun/13/michael-palin-donates-notebooks-to-british-library-monty-python","fields":{"headline":"Michael Palin donates 22 years' worth of notebooks to British Library","bodyText":"They are the pages where an unwilling messiah Brian, Mr Creosote, the Ministry of Silly Walks, a football team of philosophers and a dead parrot were all born. Now, more than 50 notebooks of original sketches and ideas for Monty Python have been donated to the British Library by Michael Palin. The public will now be able to freely peruse Palin’s archive of writings from 1965 to 1987, including the books where he and Terry Jones would write the early sketches for Monty Python’s Flying Circus. Ideas for characters that have become household names, from Arthur “two sheds” Jackson to Mr Gambolputty, can be seen scribbled down in the lined pages, alongside doodles and rough ideas for sketches that would eventually become some of the most recognisable comedy moments on British television. The vast archive donated by Palin also includes draft episodes of Monty Python’s Flying Circus – the early sketch show that launched their careers – personal reflections on his own writing, Monty Python’s first job offer from the BBC, as well as his own personal diaries. “I was a bit shy about it really,” admitted Palin. “I thought I should go to a smaller library, maybe my local library, to see if they wanted it.” He added: “My work has been inspired by, and created in, this country, so I’m very pleased that my archive has been accepted by the British Library, and that they will make it publicly available, so that future generations will know not to make the same mistakes again.” Rachel Foss, the British Library’s head of contemporary archives and manuscripts, said it was delighted to have the extensive archive as part of the collection, and said it complemented other recent donations by British writers such as Joan Bakewell and Kenneth Williams. “Monty Python has had an unparalleled influence on British comedy,” she said. “it’s very subversive and very self-consciously literary, so it fits in interestingly with the library’s literary collection. “It’s interesting to reflect on the fact that Python-esque has entered the English dictionary and is now really is a byword for the subversive and the surreal. This is a testament to the extent to which Monty Python has really pervaded our cultural consciousness.” Foss said the chance to see how some of the most beloved comedy sketches and quotes had come into being, often revised and perfected again and again by Palin and his fellow Monty Python comedians, was a rare privilege. “The sketches we see written in the Python notebooks are ones that we know so well and have been immortalised, but here you can see the stuttering and the false starts and the refining and perfecting, so you can really see the craftsman at work,” she said. While he made his name as part of Monty Python, Palin’s career has extended well beyond their surreal sketch comedy, and films such as Holy Grail and Life of Brian, and his donation to the British Library also includes files from his other film and book projects, such as his novels The Truth and Hemingway’s Chair. Palin’s personal diaries also reveal the comedian commenting on election politics, the moon landing in 1969 and the birth of his son. While edited version of his diaries have been published in the past, Foss said these offered even more of an insight into Palin’s experiences and observations as Monty Python took off. Foss said Palin was keen the public use the diaries as creative inspiration, not just for historical reference. “Michael Palin wanted this to be made publicly available because he want people to learn from it,” she said. “I think he’s particularly excited by the idea that future comedians or young emerging writers might get some inspiration from seeing how creative writing can happen, particularly debunking that myth that these things just drop from the sky in a burst of inspiration.” The collection will be available to view in the British Library reading rooms from spring 2018. • This article was amended on 14 June 2017 to clarify that Michael Palin worked with Terry Jones on the early sketches for Monty Python’s Flying Circus."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"culture/shortcuts/2017/jun/13/why-america-have-so-many-halls-of-fame-jay-z","type":"article","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webPublicationDate":"2017-06-13T15:41:43Z","webTitle":"Why does American music have so many halls of fame?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/shortcuts/2017/jun/13/why-america-have-so-many-halls-of-fame-jay-z","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/shortcuts/2017/jun/13/why-america-have-so-many-halls-of-fame-jay-z","fields":{"headline":"Why does American music have so many halls of fame?","bodyText":"Hip-hop has always been about stacking paper. Yet despite having money on their mind, artists seem to have taken a while to adopt America’s favourite lucrative merchandising strategy: Disneyfication. Thankfully, this oversight has been remedied this week, with news of a planned Hip-Hop Hall of Fame in Harlem. The $150m (£118m) complex, potentially somewhere near the legendary Apollo Theater, will one day offer the likes of Young Thug and Bubba Sparxxx the chance to be pickled in aspic and flogged as throw cushions in a gift shop. And, as if the commercialisation of black American culture wasn’t having a good enough week, Jay Z will be the first rapper inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame at a ceremony in New York on Thursday. Jay Z was reported to be “over the moon” about his inclusion, taking it as vindication of his art form. This is mystifying to us in Britain, where the concept of the hall of fame has never really taken hold. In 2004, Channel 4 did attempt to create a UK version – the UK Music Hall of Fame. More of a TV format than a physical space, after just three years it held its final outing in 2006, inducting Prince, who was “sorry he couldn’t be there in person”, and Rod Stewart, who was also “sorry he couldn’t be there”. James Brown did turn up – sadly it turned out to be his final performance. Yet in the US, the founding of the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame was the subject of fierce bidding between rivals Cleveland and Memphis – the latter’s city authority poured in $65m (£51m) to clinch the bid. Founded in 1986, it has since inducted fistfuls of middle-American faves, among them John Mellencamp, Linda Ronstadt and Journey. Yet it was far from the first. In fact the Country Music Hall of Fame had been going as far back as 1967. It now covers a 12,000 sq m site in downtown Nashville. For visitors, it must compete with the Musicians Hall of Fame, also in downtown Nashville. A confusing brief, themed not entirely around session men but also around “musicianship” more generally, it has inducted the Crickets, as well as Booker T and the MGs, Toto, Stevie Ray Vaughan and Keith Richards. Booker T would also be a shoo-in for the Official Rhythm &amp; Blues Music Hall of Fame, invented by former Harlem Globetrotter LaMont Robinson. On Saturday, it inducted its most recent crop at a rambling four-hour show in Detroit featuring Gladys Knight. Those with twangier tastes will have to wait until 2018 to visit the new Bluegrass Hall of Fame, in Owensboro, Kentucky, but if that’s too long, be comforted by the fact that music halls of fame proliferate throughout the US. Even the fifth least-populous state in the union – South Dakota – has one. Its 2016 intake included the likes of “Handy Bros Chessman Show, a late-60s racially integrated soul band from Sioux Falls” and “WhiteWing, an ethereal progressive rock band from Rapid City”. Not everyone can be famous, but in the US, almost everyone can be in a hall of fame."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"guardian-masterclasses/2017/jun/13/beginners-guide-novel-writing-tim-lott-course","type":"article","sectionId":"guardian-masterclasses","sectionName":"Guardian Masterclasses","webPublicationDate":"2017-06-13T14:56:59Z","webTitle":"The beginner’s guide to writing a novel | Tim Lott","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/guardian-masterclasses/2017/jun/13/beginners-guide-novel-writing-tim-lott-course","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/guardian-masterclasses/2017/jun/13/beginners-guide-novel-writing-tim-lott-course","fields":{"headline":"The beginner’s guide to writing a novel","bodyText":"This course has now passed, but you can be the first to know about the next one - and other workshops like this - by signing up to our newsletter here.

We rejoice at the fact the Conservatives have been pegged back and the landslide they presumed was theirs by right has been denied them. We are delighted that an alternative to austerity and nearly 40 years of free-market fundamentalism has secured 40% of the vote. We celebrate the exuberance and scale of the youth vote and both feel an incredible duty to repay their faith in us and our colleagues. And we are proud that in some key marginals cooperation not to split the progressive vote resulted in the Tories losing. But equally we felt a profound sense of frustration and dismay when Tories won by narrow margins in places such as St Ives, Richmond Park and Hastings – it really could have been so different. In seat after seat, progressive votes were wasted, because of our broken electoral system. If every progressive voter had placed their X tactically to defeat the Tories then Jeremy Corbyn would now be prime minister with a majority of over 100. Electoral alliances, which in this instance saw people across parties cooperate on tickets that included support for proportional representation and the common goal of preventing Conservative candidates winning, were pulled together quickly for the snap election. There wasn’t time to build deep relationships at either the top of the parties or more importantly on the ground. They were not perfect nor, in many instances, were they more than loose arrangements around tactical voting. However, more than 40 local alliances were formed, where almost exclusively Greens put the national interest before their party. It had a huge impact on the vote – more than doubling the average swing away from the Tories. But just as important as the vote was the cultural effect of people from different parties working together to a common aim. This was about doing politics differently and it’s not just election results that are the measure of success. It’s the numbers of people who knocked on doors for the party most likely to beat the Tories, who came out and got involved in an election campaign for the first time ever, and it’s the sense that politics has become something hopeful and positive again. People in Britain have embraced a more plural and open politics and it’s critical that what happens next continues to build that vision and listen to their voices. To do otherwise would be both a massive disservice to democracy and to misunderstand that the Corbyn effect is just one wave in the tide of change. During an election campaign everything inevitably becomes very transactional – it’s about seats, candidates and votes. But we shouldn’t forget the challenges we face – of markets that are too free and a state that can be too remote, a democracy that still leaves so many voices unheard and, of course, climate change on a scale our people and our planet simply can’t cope with. It is going to take a politics that is social, liberal and green to overcome these challenges. No single party or movement has all the answers. We are going to have to learn to cooperate as well as compete to build the society of which we dream. And we are going to have to recognise that the future is not a two-party system but one in which smaller parties grow – both in influence and in their electoral representation. Indeed, this is exactly the mood of the millions of young people who voted. They live in a world of social media in which their identities and allegiances are permanently in flux. They like and they share. They flock to one idea, group or party and then another. We need a politics that is purposeful but also as responsive, open and collaborative. We can and must fight many things: inequality, climate change and our democratic deficit – but what we can’t fight is the collaborative culture of our age. Instead we must bend this new collaborative modernity to our values of equality, sustainability and democracy. We can’t forget either that the Tories will do their utter cynical best to hold on and regroup to maintain their grip on power. And in the face of that, the sheer scale of alliance and tactical voting this time cannot be taken for granted. Support and votes were lent to Labour, but people can and will take their votes back if they don’t see a new politics emerge. So what next for electoral alliances? A whole group of MPs have felt their benefit and must now work together in parliament on a cross-party basis so we can build a progressive relationship with Europe, make the case for electoral reform, tackle the environmental crisis and establish the basis for a post-austerity and post-neo-liberal economy. The regressive alliance we see forming before our eyes between the Tories and the DUP can only be fully countered by a progressive alliance on the opposition benches. On the ground, party activities who have tasted this more collaborative future are going to want to set up local electoral alliance groups, not just for electoral purpose but to work together across all parties to make change happen where they live. Some will want to believe that what we have seen in this election is the reversion to two-party politics. That misreads the mood. Yes, the Labour party has been the main beneficiary of the hunger for change in our country, but this doesn’t mean Labour alone owns it. Politics is now so incredibly volatile and complex. If progressives want to win big, not just to peg the Tories back, or be in office for a short period to ameliorate the worst excesses of free-market economics, then we must build a permanent and vibrant progressive majority for change. One in which diversity is seen as a strength and no party has a monopoly on your vote. We are from different parties and different political traditions – and we celebrate that because, while we share so much, we can learn much more from each other. If we work together there is nothing progressives can’t achieve. The limits of the old politics are there for everyone to see – the limitlessness of the new we are just starting to explore."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/2017/jun/13/macedonias-nato-hopes-rise-as-deal-with-greece-looks-feasible","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-06-13T15:44:45Z","webTitle":"Macedonia and Greece appear close to settling 27-year dispute over name","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jun/13/macedonias-nato-hopes-rise-as-deal-with-greece-looks-feasible","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/jun/13/macedonias-nato-hopes-rise-as-deal-with-greece-looks-feasible","fields":{"headline":"Macedonia and Greece appear close to settling 27-year dispute over name","bodyText":"Macedonia is poised to dispatch its foreign minister to Greece as speculation mounts that the two countries are moving towards settlement of the name dispute that has kept them at loggerheads for the past 27 years. Signalling that a compromise is in the offing, Zoran Zaev, the Balkan state’s new Social Democrat leader, used his first official trip to Brussels on Monday to announce that a solution was possible. “I know that if we have friendly relations and a good approach then a solution is feasible,” he told reporters before talks between Macedonia’s foreign minister, Nikola Dimitrov, and his Greek counterpart, Nikos Kotzias, in Athens on Wednesday. Zaev, whose investiture two weeks ago followed prolonged political turmoil in the former Yugoslav republic, said he wanted the small but strategic nation to join Nato and the EU “in the shortest possible time”. Macedonia, he suggested, could participate in both under the provisional name it currently uses at the UN – FYROM or the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. “We will try all possible measures to move Macedonia to membership,” said the pro-European prime minister standing alongside Nato’s secretary-general, Jens Stoltenberg. The quest comes amid accusations of Russian interference across the Balkan region. The Macedonian government claims the meddling has made membership more vital. Stoltenberg underscored that position, saying Nato’s mission was to support all aspiring countries. “We want to see your country as part of a stable, democratic and prosperous region,” he said. The long-running name row has been the single biggest impediment to Macedonia’s integration with the west. Greece, which vetoed the country joining Nato in 2008, has argued vehemently that its northern neighbour’s nomenclature conceals territorial ambitions over the eponymous Greek province that lies directly to the republic’s south. In nearly three decades of often bitter public exchanges, Athens has frequently accused the country of indulging in cultural theft, saying the predominantly Slavic state has deliberately appropriated symbols and heroic personalities from ancient Greek history to buttress its claim to the name. But Zaev, who formed a government in coalition with parties representing the nation’s large ethnic Albanian minority, has taken a much more conciliatory approach. Last week the centre-left politician criticised his rightwing predecessor, Nikola Grueski, accusing him of provocations during the decade he held office by pushing ahead with a controversial statue and monument-building campaign that named a slew of public edifices after Alexander the Great. In a television interview the new prime minister said the politics of antagonising Athens would be terminated immediately. “I can only say that the era of monuments, renaming of highways, airports, sports halls and stadiums with historical names ends,” said the leader whose lividly scarred forehead is testimony to the civil unrest that has gripped the mini-state. “We shall generate a politics of joint European future.” Zaev was injured when, in an orgy of violence, a pro-Grueski mob stormed parliament in April. Any potential name change would be put to public plebiscite for approval. Mooted name changes have included adding geographic qualifiers such as “upper”, “new” or “northern” Macedonia. In what was seen by Athens as a major compromise, Greece announced in 2007 that it would give its consent to a composite name in which the word Macedonia could feature. At the time the compromise was supported by Panos Kammenos, the leader of the small nationalist Independent Greeks party currently in power with prime minister Alexis Tsipras’s leftist Syriza party. Since then, emotions have abated as a sense of realpolitik in both countries has taken root. While Zaev believes membership of Euro-Atlantic bodies will help stabilise his ethnically fractious nation, debt-stricken Greece also sees a solution as bolstering its crisis-wracked economy in the Balkan peninsular. “It is very important that Greece settles this dispute if it is to play an important role in the Balkans,” said Dimitris Keridis, professor of political science at Athens’s Panteion University. “Our neighbour is suffering from very deep internal divisions with the new government believing that the only way to stabilise it is to make the country part of the Euro-Atlantic architecture,” he told the Guardian. “Clearly it is willing to reach a compromise with Greece to achieve this, a compromise that after years of being able to hide behind Grueski’s intransigence is going to put Greek diplomacy on the spot.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/jun/13/russian-courts-sentence-protesters-arrested-anti-corruption-rallies","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-06-13T16:36:11Z","webTitle":"Russian courts sentence protesters arrested at anti-corruption rallies","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jun/13/russian-courts-sentence-protesters-arrested-anti-corruption-rallies","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/jun/13/russian-courts-sentence-protesters-arrested-anti-corruption-rallies","fields":{"headline":"Russian courts sentence protesters arrested at anti-corruption rallies","bodyText":"Russian courts have started to hand down jail terms to demonstrators arrested at a series of anti-corruption protests across the country on Monday. Several protesters in Moscow and St Petersburg were on Tuesday sentenced to 15 days in jail, including Ilya Yashin, the opposition leader and political partner of Boris Nemtsov, who was murdered in 2015. Investigators also announced that charges of assaulting police officers, which carry a maximum sentence of 10 years, would be launched against at least two people. The protests, called by opposition politician Alexei Navalny, drew several thousand people in Moscow and Petersburg, as well as smaller numbers in dozens of other cities. According to a rights monitoring group, 800 people were detained in Moscow and 900 in St Petersburg. Police have officially stated that there were 650 detentions across the two cities. Many of these people were released but may face court cases or fines in the coming days and weeks. Navalny was detained outside his home before the protest. Late on Monday he was sentenced to 30 days in prison for calling people to an unsanctioned protest. He has been jailed on many occasions before, including for 15 days after the last major protest in late March. “I saw the photos and you were awesome,” Navalny said in a video message to supporters shortly after the verdict. “I’m proud that I’m in the same movement as you.” Navalny has stated his intention to stand for president next March, opening volunteer bases in cities around the country over the past months, as well as organising protests against government corruption. It is almost certain he will not be allowed onto the ballot, and authorities have to decide how to handle his protest movement, which has shown it can mobilise tens of thousands of young Russians across the country. Vyacheslav Volodin, the speaker of the Russian parliament, said on Tuesday the current president was the only candidate people should vote for in the election. “For those who want a future for Russia, wellbeing for the country and its citizens and a peaceful sky over their heads, there is only one candidate – Vladimir Putin,” he told the Russian website Life. Putin’s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said the “provocative acts” of the opposition were “dangerous to bystanders” and would be met with the full force of the law. Authorities had previously refused to grant Navalny permission to hold rallies in central Moscow, but this time they agreed, offering a reasonably central space. At the last minute, Navalny changed the venue to Tverskaya Street, where a city-organised historical fair was taking place, citing pressure from the authorities on suppliers that made it impossible to hire speakers and equipment for the venue. Some in the protest movement felt it was needlessly provocative to move the location, but thousands of people still turned out. They were engaged in a standoff with riot police for several hours, causing surreal scenes as they mingled with costumed medieval knights and men in second world war uniforms who were on the street for the historical reenactments. Separately, Ukrainian news outlets identified one of the commanding officers of the riot police in central Moscow as Sergei Kusyuk, who was formerly the deputy commander of the Berkut riot police in Kiev and took part in the crackdown on the Maidan protests against President Viktor Yanukovych. When Yanukovych was toppled in February 2014, many of the Berkut commanders fled to Russia to avoid prosecution for their role in suppressing the Kiev protests. Kusyuk, who is wanted on criminal charges in Ukraine, is now apparently commanding Russian anti-riot troops. There was no official confirmation that the man pictured was indeed Kusyuk."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"science/2017/jun/14/risk-of-bleeds-and-death-with-daily-aspirin-use-higher-than-thought","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2017-06-14T05:05:27Z","webTitle":"Risk of bleeds and death with daily aspirin use higher than thought","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/jun/14/risk-of-bleeds-and-death-with-daily-aspirin-use-higher-than-thought","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2017/jun/14/risk-of-bleeds-and-death-with-daily-aspirin-use-higher-than-thought","fields":{"headline":"Risk of bleeds and death with daily aspirin use higher than thought","bodyText":"The risk of long-term aspirin use causing major bleeding and death is higher than previously thought, with over-75s particularly vulnerable, a study suggests. Around 40% of adults aged 75 or over in the UK take a daily aspirin and lifelong treatment is recommended for patients who have previously had a heart attack or stroke. The preventative effects are well-established in people who have suffered a major heart event, reducing the risk of another by 20%. But Prof Peter Rothwell, from Oxford University and the lead author of the study, said there are about 20,000 major bleeds and around 3,000 deaths caused by aspirin or other antiplatelet drugs each year. He says the answer is for people taking aspirin to be prescribed heartburn drugs known as proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs), which reduce the risk of bleeding by 70% to 90%. Currently they are prescribed only in a minority of cases. The research, published in the Lancet on Tuesday, found that for patients under 65 taking daily aspirin to prevent a recurring stroke or heart attack, the annual rate of bleeds requiring hospital admission was approximately 1.5%, compared with 3.5% for patients aged 75 to 84, and 5% for those aged 85 or over. The annual rate of life-threatening or fatal bleeds was less than 0.5%, for patients under 65, 1.5% for those aged 75 to 84 and almost 2.5% for patients aged 85 or over. “The risk of serious bleeding is much higher in the over-75s,” said Rothwell. “In people under 75 the benefits of taking aspirin for secondary prevention after a heart attack or stroke clearly outweigh the relatively small risk of bleeding – these people needn’t worry. “In the over-75s the risk of a serious bleed is higher – but the key point is that this risk is substantially preventable by taking PPIs alongside aspirin. Since many of the 3,000 excess deaths are preventable by taking PPIs, people over 75 should be prescribed a PPI along with their aspirin. Regardless of age, nobody should suddenly stop taking aspirin without speaking to their doctor.” The Oxford Vascular Study followed 3,166 patients who had previously had a stroke or heart attack and were prescribed antiplatelet drugs (mostly aspirin). Over the 10-year period, 314 patients were admitted to hospital for bleeding. Analysis showed the risk of bleeding, in particular the risk of fatal or disabling bleeding, increased with age. As the study was observational, it could not establish that increased risk is entirely caused by aspirin but previous research suggests about half of bleeds would have occurred whether or not people were on the drug. The authors believe the low uptake of PPIs is partly due to their side effects, but also to previous underestimations of the risk of bleed. As the population has aged so the proportion of people taking aspirin likely to experience major or fatal bleeds has increased. The results also have consequence for people who choose to take an aspirin for its primary preventative effects – it also reduces the risk of cancer – ie who have not previously suffered a stroke or heart attack. This accounts for around half of the total number of people aged 75 and over taking the drug daily. Rothwell said he personally would not take an aspirin for primary prevention but he also said that for safety reasons no one currently taking it daily should stop doing so without consulting their doctor. Dr Tim Chico, reader in cardiovascular medicine and consultant cardiologist at Sheffield University, said: “Prescription of any drug is a balance between the benefits of the medication against its risks, and aspirin is no different. Certainly, people should not stop their aspirin if it has been prescribed by a doctor after a stroke or heart attack, since stopping it can cause another heart attack or stroke. “However, I would strongly recommend that people who are considering taking aspirin to prevent potential future problems such as cancer or heart attack (ie not for secondary prevention) should discuss this with their doctor.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/jun/13/1970s-hung-parliament-westminster","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-06-13T16:06:27Z","webTitle":"A hung parliament?

It’ll be the 1970s again, and people will die","bodyText":"We’ve been here before, and it wasn’t fun. People died. As a playwright, I may be prone to dramatic exaggeration – but in this instance, I don’t think so. We thought we were here in 2010, of course, but we weren’t. Not really. That parliament was hung in name only. The five years of the Conservative-Lib Dem alliance were dramatic only in that very little drama happened when it came to marital crises. The majority was large and stable. The Fixed-term Parliaments Act banished the spectre of a snap election. The government survived. No, the last time we were here, the period frequently invoked with justifiable dread in the hours after that impossible exit poll last Thursday night, is the 1970s: a time when a US president was under threat of impeachment, terrorist attacks haunted British streets, and a referendum on Europe was launched to settle the continental question once and for all. Thank God things change... The February 1974 election was called (further irony alert) by a Conservative leader before it was necessary, on the premise of shoring up the government against what he perceived to be opposition to his authority – in Ted Heath’s case, the unions. The gamble failed. Harold Wilson’s Labour party took power, 17 seats short of a majority. A second election that year returned it a tiny majority of three (an alliance with the Democratic Unionist party would offer Theresa May, or whoever succeeds her, a slender majority). And this is where history sends its warning down the tracks. It took only a matter of months for that majority to disappear again, and keep falling. And falling. Ideological defections, byelection losses and, yes, deaths. Between 1974 and 79 more than a dozen MPs lost their lives through the physical and mental stress that is part and parcel of being hung. The all-night sittings, the games of sabotage, the turning up to every single vote, knowing every day might be the government’s last. One government whip, Joe Harper, delayed emergency surgery in his determination to never miss a vote, in effect sacrificing his life for the party he loved. This was an age when Commons offices became bedrooms for sick MPs, where ambulances arrived into parliament so that infirm and sometimes dying MPs could be “nodded through” if they were unable to physically walk through the lobby. On one infamous and somewhat dark occasion, a Labour whip and his Conservative counterpart assessed quite “how strong” the pulse was for the poor member for St Helens, before deciding he was, in fact, just about alive enough for his vote to count. Such craziness is an inevitable byproduct of such crazy times. This is why, when I was researching for my play This House, which covered that period, one of the remaining survivors described it to me as “the most dramatic parliamentary term in British history”. Well, it looks like they’re making a sequel. And we need to get ready. So what challenges can May and her whips expect? There are your own individual backbenchers, for a start, who suddenly become more powerful than ever. They know the government needs their vote – their individual loyalty. As in 1974, they may behave at first, passing the Queen’s speech through, but soon the demands will start piling in. Then there are your alliance partners to keep happy. A “confidence and supply” arrangement would bind the DUP only on votes of no confidence and the budget. On everything else it can deny the government a majority. So the party of 318 must listen to the party of 10. And then, of course, there are your “friends across the aisle”. In the 70s the Labour whips called these the “odds and sods” – the Liberals and smaller nationalist parties. Deals, even bribes, became par for the course. Another warning from history: it was these nationalist parties, with their own specific agendas, who eventually turned and took the government down. The rope that holds you can also hang you. That’s why, historically, hung parliaments tend also to be parliaments of “firsts”: 1974-79 saw the government’s budget amended by backbenchers working with the opposition (the Rooker-Wise amendment, for future pub quizzes) – such is their vulnerability. In 2017, a potential first is a curiosity within the Fixed-term Parliaments Act that creates, in the event of a no-confidence defeat, a 14-day period in which other parties can try to form a government. Could we witness the changeover of a governing party without an election? Unlikely. But then, witness this week the head-scratching over goat parchment drying times and all absurdities suddenly become less implausible. When I say I think that today it won’t be much fun – though I hope our show was – it’s because right now, at a national crossroads, with the historic challenges we face, what we desperately need is the politics of the possible. And hung parliaments are the politics of paralysis. We thirst for opportunities but we will find only limitations. We crave unity but will meet only division. In any great drama, at the climactic moment of crisis, what we usually witness is characters – people – becoming either the very best versions of themselves or the very worst. Given the recent rhetoric of “traitors”, “enemies of the people” and “saboteurs”, I expect the latter. I hope I’m wrong. But if the 1970s teach us anything, it’s that this probably won’t be fun. And we should get ready."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"society/2017/jun/13/gloucestershire-council-sorry-serious-failings-childrens-services-ofsted","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2017-06-13T14:50:10Z","webTitle":"Gloucestershire council sorry for 'serious failings' in children’s services","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/jun/13/gloucestershire-council-sorry-serious-failings-childrens-services-ofsted","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2017/jun/13/gloucestershire-council-sorry-serious-failings-childrens-services-ofsted","fields":{"headline":"Gloucestershire council sorry for 'serious failings' in children’s services","bodyText":"Gloucestershire county council has been forced to apologise after an Ofsted report into its children’s services division questioned the integrity of the senior leadership team and found that “serious and widespread failures” were putting children at risk. The damning report found that the quality of support given to families had “deteriorated significantly” since a previous “inadequate” rating of some aspects of its performance in 2011. While one area, adoption, was rated “good”, inspectors described a culture in which relationships between managers and frontline social workers had broken down. Despite its relatively affluent profile with few pockets of deprivation, the local authority is one of 29 in England to be given the worst Ofsted rating for its children’s services. “We are very sorry to the children and families affected,” said Gloucestershire council’s chief executive, Pete Bungard, who acknowledged instances of poor case work, but said the responsibility for the council’s dire performance lay squarely with the children’s services senior leadership team. “We have 500 committed social work staff and I don’t think it’s their fault. They have been let down by poor leadership and practice.” Ofsted was alerted to problems in Gloucestershire’s children’s services by what the report said were “an unprecedented number” of whistleblowing concerns. A four-week county-wide inspection into every aspect of child protection and safeguarding in Gloucestershire uncovered inadequate management, failures to identify poor social work, failure to identify risks to children, poor quality and delayed assessments that left children exposed to danger, badly maintained case records and significant delays in starting care proceedings for the most needy children. Some staff, the report said, “feel vulnerable, unsupported by senior managers and fearful of challenging and exposing poor practice. Relationships between senior managers and practitioners have broken down”. The council said cuts were not to blame, pointing to a £2m investment in social workers last year and an additional £9.2m in funding for children’s services that has just been agreed. Several key members of staff have retired, left the council, or been demoted in recent weeks. Serious concerns about the performance of the council’s children’s services department had already been raised in a number of excoriating family court judgments published over the last two years. In March 2015, the most senior family judge in the region, Stephen Wildblood QC, lambasted the council’s social workers for “the most extreme example of institutional failure” he had witnessed in the courts. In a further September 2015 ruling, he described “very poor practice” and criticised the council’s decision-making and costly mismanagement in an adoption case. A council committee had also raised its concerns. There were also concerns about the length of time decisions take, with experts saying that delays were damaging for children. In January this year, documents seen by the Guardian showed that the council missed the statutory six-month target for a permanent decision to be made on children’s futures in 44.4% of cases, an unusually high failure rate. Nearby Bath and north-east Somerset missed the target in 23.25% of cases, while south Gloucestershire did so in 4.8%. The inexperience of the large number of newly qualified social workers on the council’s staff was highlighted in the Ofsted report. A freedom of information (FoI) request by the Guardian shows that at the end of November last year, 49% of Gloucestershire’s frontline child protection social workers were 18 months qualified or less, and had little experience with which to make vital judgments about how to protect children at risk. Bungard on Tuesday confirmed that half of the remaining frontline social work staff werer less than two years qualified. The FoI also revealed that two-thirds of frontline social workers were in post for less than three years before being promoted to a team manager role. Ofsted warned of a shortage of good supervision in the department. High turnover of staff was also identified as a problem in the report. Figures provided to the Guardian revealed that Gloucestershire’s spending on agency staff had risen from £1,264,655 in 2014-15 to £1,414,784 in 2015-16."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2017/jun/14/jo-cox-death-of-an-mp-review","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2017-06-14T05:00:18Z","webTitle":"Jo Cox: Death of an MP review – engrossing, worrying, but mostly heartbreaking","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/jun/14/jo-cox-death-of-an-mp-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2017/jun/14/jo-cox-death-of-an-mp-review","fields":{"headline":"Jo Cox: Death of an MP review – engrossing, worrying, but mostly heartbreaking","bodyText":"You wouldn’t expect to find anything to smile about in Jo Cox: Death of an MP (BBC2). There was one little moment though, for me anyway. Maybe Jo would have seen the funny side too. Her sister Kim is talking about their childhood in Heckmondwike, West Yorkshire. “We used to go up and play in the barley fields,” she says. What! You as well? What is it about future politicians and cereal crops? Wait though, there was maybe more danger for Jo and Kim – they got chased by a horse, and a bull! Yeah, Theresa, off our naughty step, goody two-shoes … Actually there’s more, if not to smile about, then at least to feel good about here. Jo just sounds like such a bloody brilliant human being, and that’s not something that’s often said of a member of parliament. But then it’s not often that you really believe a politician has gone into it as a means to helping people. “It was never just about getting a constituency,” says Kim. “It was getting her home constituency, with the people that she cared about and the area that she knew and loved.” And they loved her back. Not just her family, and Fazila and Sandra who worked with her and were with her when she died, and Brendan her husband, of course, now bringing up their children without her. But also people who didn’t agree with her views. Like Alistair here, sales director of the fire engine factory she visited on the morning of her death. They were all staunch leavers, and she had been campaigning hard to remain in Europe. But, “Jo was respectful of people’s views; she listened,” he says. “I just instantly felt a lot of warmth for Jo.” Even her supposed flaws make her more appealing. Jo was a rubbish cook, says Brendan. There was never any milk in the fridge, or money in her purse, or clothes to wear. Who cares about frigging milk though, or cash, or clothes, when there’s work to be done, a difference to be made, a world to be changed, for the better? “I can’t remember anyone not liking Jo,” says Kim. Thomas Mair didn’t like her. Well, maybe he would have done, if he had actually met her, instead of just shooting and stabbing her. He didn’t like what she stood for though. The film traces his life backwards from that moment too, so far as it can of a man who no one really knew. There are chilling clips from the police interview room, of Mair with his arms folded, appearing calm and offering nothing – not saying “no comment” but actually saying nothing at all, for six hours. And CCTV footage of him in town in the time leading up to the attack, staking it out, pacing around with his pathetic disguise and his bag of killing equipment. Members of the investigating team contribute as well, describe what they found on his bookshelves at home and in his search history, the extreme rightwing stuff he was looking at every day. Here was a lonely obsessive, immersing himself in Nazi ideology – pornography of hatred. You can imagine him sitting there, at home and in the library, thinking that he, who had never belonged to anything before, was part of something bigger. And yet he was also complex and contradictory. He volunteered at a charity that had been useful to him, helping others, including people of different races. “There was never any indication that he was racist in any way,” says Karen, the head of the charity. “The Tom I knew was so kind, considerate, caring.” It’s brave of her to say so, but she gets some backup from Prof Roger, the fascism expert. “Nobody is ever completely a terrorist,” he says. You do often hear that so-and-so was polite and neighbourly, before the evil won out. This poignant documentary does not make sense of it, because it is senseless. But it asks the right questions, from and about everyone involved, about the murder and about the climate in which it happened. It is a thorough and forensic exploration – engrossing, worrying, but mostly just really sad. Most heartbreaking of all: the home video footage, of Jo with the kids, playing in the kitchen, larking about in the back of the car. She looks pretty brilliant at that too, being a mum."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/jun/29/wines-to-drink-with-a-barbecue-fiona-beckett","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"2017-06-29T15:59:14Z","webTitle":"Wine: bargains for a barbecue","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/jun/29/wines-to-drink-with-a-barbecue-fiona-beckett","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/jun/29/wines-to-drink-with-a-barbecue-fiona-beckett","fields":{"headline":"Wine: bargains for a barbecue","bodyText":"The conventional wisdom about barbecue drinking distils into two words: big reds. But there’s a problem: how to keep them at a drinkable temperature. Whites and rosés probably occupy your only fridge and bucket space, leaving the reds sitting on the side, sweltering in the sun and easily creeping up to 25C or more, which will accentuate the alcohol in what are probably already alcoholic wines. Does that matter? Possibly not. Friends who like 14.5% abv reds probably couldn’t give a damn if their wine tastes warm and soupy, but bearing in mind that most producers recommend a drinking temperature of 17-18C and that practically every other drink you’re offering, whether it’s rosé, beer or cocktails, will be chilled, it’s hardly the most refreshing of options. I have two solutions, the first being my own preferred strategy, which is to drink lighter, fresher reds such as pinot noir, beaujolais and the bright, breezy and utterly delicious South African Surfer’s Path Shiraz 2016 (£8 Morrisons), which, for a shiraz, is a relatively modest 13.5% abv. The second is to leave your reds somewhere cool overnight, such as a shed or garage, then keep them in the shade, ideally in a couple of cool bags; you could even drop a couple of ice cubes into your glass, stir and fish them straight out again. For a more conventional barbecue wine, Aldi’s Exquisite Collection has the very decent Australia Shiraz 2015 (14.5% abv) for just £5.79, and it has all the lush, ripe fruit you’d expect from Down Under, while Majestic has a similar wine for £5.99 in its new Majestic Loves… range, Majestic Loves… Shiraz (14% abv), which is made for them by Aussie producer De Bortoli. It’s not the subtlest of bevvies, maybe, but the price is good and the label absolutely brilliant. If you’re doing a fishy barbecue, fancy a white and have a Tesco nearby, grab a few bottles of its Côtes de Gascogne Blanc 2016 (11% abv), which has all the bright citrus and passionfruit aromas of a New Zealand sauvignon blanc for just a fiver. (Where have you been lately, Tesco wine team, by the way? You’ve been hiding away.) And, again from Aldi, you can’t quarrel with the £4.69 it is charging for the easy-drinking Fire Tree Pinot Grigio Sauvignon Blanc 2016 (12.5% abv), which comes from Sicily.

Delhaize has been ordered not to repeat any claims about its Choco spread being better for the planet or your health, on pain of a €25,000 (£22,000) fine for each repetition.Ferrero argued that the Delhaize campaign unfairly damaged its iconic Nutella brand, which was placed next to the Choco spread on the supermarket’s shelves. Delhaize, which had won an earlier court case on the issue, told the Guardian it was considering further legal actions but would not appeal the verdict. At issue is a short-lived Delhaize advertising campaign in 2013, which claimed that the Belgian outlet’s best-selling Choco spread was better for the planet and for consumer health because it contained no palm oil. Ferrero argued this implied that firms which used sustainable practices for buying palm oil within existing supply chains were ethically inferior. Greenpeace, which in 2015 rated (pdf) Ferrero one of the best of 14 global manufacturers with “no deforestation” policies, said the case had turned into a battle of sales strategies. “Ferrero is definitely one of the companies doing its best to implement sustainable commitments,” said An Lambrechts, a Greenpeace Belgium spokeswoman. “This case is more about marketing ploys and market shares and less about who has the best initiative on palm oil.” Ferrero’s use of palm oil was pushed into the spotlight in 2015 after then-French environment minister Ségolène Royal called for a consumer boycott of Nutella over deforestation concerns. Royal subsequently backed down from the call, offering the confectionery titan “a thousand apologies”. Multiple studies (pdf) have drawn causal links between the growth of palm oil plantations in south-east Asia and deforestation but the court ruled that Delhaize’s claims were unverifiable. Ferrero has a robust palm oil charter and says it can trace almost all of its palm oil to sustainable sources. The company came top of a WWF sustainability league table of 137 palm oil buyers last year. It is a member of the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil and the Palm Oil Innovation Group. “The court sustained Ferrero’s arguments that it is illegal to claim that a product without palm oil is de facto better for environment and has better nutritional qualities than one containing palm oil,” a spokesman for Ferrero said. “Ferrero has taken admirable steps to reduce the impact of palm oil within its supply chain,” said Glenn Hurowitz, the CEO of Mighty, which campaigns against deforestation caused by palm oil. “But it is as yet impossible to delink one company’s supplies from the broader, continued deforestation of the palm oil industry as a whole.” A separate argument by Ferrero that Delhaize not be allowed to call their spread “Choco” – because it contains no chocolate – was thrown out by the court. For its part, Delhaize said Choco was still being manufactured with sunflower oil, cocoa butter and coconut oil – and packaged as palm oil-free. “We have not seen any impact on [Choco] sales. On the contrary,” said the firm’s communications director Roel Dekelver. “Despite this judgement, we will continue to propose and present innovative and inspirational products to customers that answer their different needs. This won’t hold us back.” The Belgian supermarket, which merged with Ahold to create a €40bn retail empire last year, had also alleged health benefits from palm-oil free produce, citing “potential health concerns” from palm oil in an assessment by the European Food Safety Authority. However, this assessment also applied to other vegetable oils and products, and the analysis is currently being reassessed. Ian Barber, the communications director of the Advertising Association, said that the first rule of advertising was: “If you can’t back up the claim, you can’t make it”. “I’d imagine the strategy open to Delhaize now is just to advertise that they’re palm oil-free and leave world to make up its mind if that’s a good or a bad thing,” he said.

But Grace Wales Bonner’s company is unapologetically highbrow. Thanks to her, I have now read James Baldwin’s 1956 novella Giovanni’s Room and want to read Gary Fisher’s notebooks, published after he died of Aids in 1994 at the age of 32. That’s the book propped up on her bedside table. Rest assured, Fisher isn’t there for any opportune shelfie purposes. Fashion is a world in which a veneer of cleverness – wearing glasses with non-prescription lenses, for example – is often mistaken for actual intelligence. But 26-year-old Wales Bonner is the real thing: book-smart, almost academic, in her thinking. “I am very interested in post-colonial theory, black literature and post-black literature,” she explains, in a quiet, determined tone. Writing and research is tangled up with designing. When graduating from Central Saint Martins, she voluntarily produced a 10,000-word dissertation along with a collection. Wales Bonner is an anomaly in fashion, beyond her ability to think deeply: a female, mixed-race designer, designing menswear. Only three years after launching her label, Wales Bonner, in 2014, she is the undisputed star at London men’s fashion week, the menswear shows that took place last weekend. Awards are an annual occurrence: she won emerging menswear designer at the 2015 British Fashion awards, and the LVMH young designer prize, judged by Phoebe Philo and Karl Lagerfeld, the following year. She has done all this with ridiculously little self-promotion, quite a feat when you consider that Wales Bonner is a card-carrying millennial who is supposed to love nothing better than talking about herself. I meet her – tiny, hair pulled back into a bun, wearing Adidas trainers and a jacket of her own design with a striped crochet collar – in the cafe underneath her Hackney studio. The interview took five months to arrange. This isn’t because she is difficult or even slightly diva-ish. It’s because, reading between the lines, she has far more important things to do than meet journalists. For her, work is the thing. She’s almost unnervingly self-possessed, the only time she even slightly squirms is when we veer off topic. What does she do for fun? Pilates, cooking, meditation. The kind of monkish pastimes that would sound Gwyneth Paltrow-ish if her mind wasn’t so radical. The audience at a Wales Bonner show can expect to feel out of their depth and in need of Google. She has used references including Malik Ambar, who went from Ethiopian slave to Indian ruler in the 17th century, and Haile Selassie in the 1930s. Her most recent show, Blue Duets, took place on Saturday evening in a church in Holborn, central London. It came with a handout worthy of a university lecture, where famous names such as James Baldwin and Chris Ofili mixed with Carl Van Vechten’s nudes of young black men in Harlem in the 20s, an essay on Baldwin by Hilton Als and a poem by Essex Hemphill. It also included an additional bibliography. Not the usual press release knocked up the night before, then. The designer is now such a big deal in fashion, though, that she persuaded the great and good of the industry to forgo their beloved front row and stand up to watch her show, resulting in some wry smiles from notebook-toting reviewers. A cast of mostly non-white models wore leather trousers, open shirts and bare feet, building on her reputation for clothes that are opulent, gender-fluid and slightly retro. Prints of Ofili’s and Van Vechten’s work featured on some of the shirts. The young men crossed each other’s paths in the space to the ominous strains of a post-minimalist Julius Eastman score. It felt urgent, languid and raw all at the same time – like a love affair. “It was sexuality instead of sensuality,” she said afterwards. “I was thinking about a day, and then there’s a transition and it becomes night and they dress up to go out. The finale is that they have stayed up all night and have learned something from the experience.” Baldwin’s Giovanni’s Room, which chronicles a gay relationship with the backdrop of after-dark Paris bohemia, was an inspiration. Wales Bonner is one of a number of non-white designers finally joining fashion’s elite. London menswear is leading the way – Martine Rose, Nicholas Daley and A Cold Wall’s Samuel Ross are among other notable names. Her own circle includes musicians Dev Hynes and Sampha, as well as painter Lynette Yiadom-Boakye who wrote a poem for her January show. The hiring of Edward Enninful, who was born in Ghana, as the editor of Vogue, has also been hailed as a triumph. Wales Bonner, in her old soul way, is wary of calling these changes a shift, however. “There’s still a long way to go,” she says. “I guess I don’t think of the fashion industry exclusively, I am more interested in the bigger picture.” Wales Bonner is not overtly political, like some of her contemporaries in the industry. She doesn’t use her work to bang a drum, she’s not one to rant on social media. Instead, her work takes the long view. She is drawn to similarities across the centuries where black male identity is what she calls “gentler” – a contrast perhaps to the contemporary mainstream ideal of a black man, who is typically athletic in build and alpha male in character (see Idris Elba, Usain Bolt and, to some extent, Kanye West). By contrast, the models in Wales Bonner’s shows are mostly willowy and arty-looking. “I remember seeing these images from 100 years ago of these quite tender relationships between black men, being very beautiful, princely characters,” she says. “I don’t like to say fluidity, because it has been quite overused, but it is more about a kind of openness and a hybridity.” The designer grew up in south-east London, between Dulwich and Stockwell, where her business-adviser mother still lives. She was the middle of three daughters that her parents had before separating, and she says that exploring her father’s heritage – his parents came to the UK from Jamaica in the 50s – has fuelled her work. “I have had to work things out, things haven’t been told to me,” she explains. “I have had to educate myself about my background so it’s always been something interesting to me, to make sense of things.” Her own mixed-heritage identity seems to be where her mind naturally leads her. “It’s working out how I could be and that I didn’t need to prove anything to be who I was,” she says. “At school, I had some pressure to prove my blackness. It takes you a while to work out being ‘this’ doesn’t mean that you have to be ‘that’.” In fact, being neither definitively one thing or the other is where she feels most comfortable. “I have to be between places, because that’s a creative space for me,” she says. “I guess that is the foundation of what I am doing, a meeting point and collision of cultures.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"books/2017/jun/18/benjamin-markovitz-parenthood-has-changed-and-so-has-the-literature-that-comes-out-of-it-","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2017-06-18T06:30:05Z","webTitle":"Benjamin Markovits: 'Parenthood has changed.

And so has the literature that comes out of it'","bodyText":"When I became a father, a number of people made some half-joking reference to me about the “pram in the hall”. By that stage I had published two novels, and the point of the joke was to ask me, sympathetically, if I was worried that having kids would get in the way of writing more. It’s amazing how the line has stuck, how – with the garret and the Olivetti – it has become a part of the myth of the writer in the public imagination. So that even people who don’t know the rest of the quote, or who wrote it, or haven’t read the book he wrote it in, remember that phrase and what it stands for, or seems to stand for. Recently, I read Cyril Connolly’s 1938 Enemies of Promise (it seems to be out of print), from which the infamous phrase comes, in an old Penguin edition from 1961. It’s a very smart, entertaining, deeply weird and often offensive book that Connolly wrote partly to explain why he himself had not yet produced his masterpiece … but it’s also true that by that point in his life (he was 35), he had not produced any kids, either. The artist he’s talking about isn’t someone who works while the baby is napping, or changes nappies, or prepares formula in steam-sterilised bottles several times a day. Or, for that matter, breastfeeds. The writers he’s talking about are probably men, and the danger of the pram in the hall isn’t that they have to look after the child sleeping in it, but that they’ll find some boring job to pay for the middle-class life the pram symbolises and which they’ve signed up to: “The harried author who sits in a garret surrounded by screaming children, with duns at the door and a sick wife nagging from the bed, is a thing of the past. But there remains some substance in the vision. The initial difficulty is in the sensitive writer’s inability to live alone. The more he is alone the more he falls in love, if he falls in love he is almost certain to marry, if he marries he is apt to take a house and have children, if he has a house and children he needs more money, must do uncongenial work and so deny himself the freedom which may have inspired him.” The most dangerous job, by Connolly’s lights, is journalism – the kind of thing I’m doing here, now, because it teaches novelists to write only for a first reading and a general public: “Marriage can succeed for an artist only where there is enough money to save him from taking on uncongenial work,” Connolly writes, “and a wife who is intelligent and unselfish enough to understand and respect the working of the unfriendly cycle of the creative imagination. She will know at what point domestic happiness begins to cloy, where love, tidiness, rent, rates, clothes, entertaining, and rings at the doorbell should stop, and will recognise that there is no more sombre enemy of good art than the pram in the hall.” There are women novelists he writes about and praises – for example, Virginia Woolf and Elizabeth Bowen – though neither of them had children and both belonged to the upper classes. They wrote in the “mandarin” style, intellectual, experimental, difficult and exclusionary, as opposed to the “vernacular” (natural, pacey, populist), and one of the points of his book is to suggest the opposition to each other and limits of both. I don’t know how this context changes the way we should think about the pram in the hall – if it means that we should worry about it less. But Connolly’s argument is part of a much older debate, not just about gender roles and sexuality, but social class and literary style. And not just style, but subject matter, too. A hundred-odd years before Enemies of Promise, Walter Scott wrote in his journal about Jane Austen: “That young lady had a talent for describing the involvements and feelings and characters of ordinary life … The Big Bow-wow strain I can do myself like any now going; but the exquisite touch, which renders ordinary commonplace things and characters interesting, from the truth of the description and the sentiment, is denied to me.” In some sense, American novelists who emerged in the decades after Connolly wrote his book, writers such as Saul Bellow, Philip Roth and John Updike, answered the challenge of combining mandarin and vernacular styles. As Martin Amis put it in his essay in The Moronic Inferno about Bellow: “To evolve an exalted voice appropriate to the 20th century has been the self-imposed challenge of his work.” Amis contrasts Bellow’s “Big Bow-wow strain” with the typical English novel – “225 sanitised pages about the middle-classes …” – a line that recalls another Scott comment about Austen: “They do not, it is true, get above the middle classes of society, but there she is inimitable.” It’s hard not to hear, in these descriptions of middle-class life, a comment on what male writers think of as women’s worlds, what Connolly variously described as the world of “love, tidiness, rents, clothes … courtship, marriage, childbearing, adultery”. I’m also aware that my list of mid-century American writers who answered Connolly’s call to reconcile the mandarin and vernacular included only men. Bellow and Roth and Updike have meant a lot to me, and yet one of the ways they have meant less – as literary models, I mean – has to do with their accounts of parenthood. The artist of Connolly’s warning is not only male but unlikely to have been particularly involved in night feeds or changing nappies, and yet for most modern parents equality in duties is a standard to be strived for. One of the things that having kids teaches you (or reminds you of, if you needed reminding) is the high stakes and intensity of day-to-day domestic life. Which is why the literary tradition I found myself turning to, after they were born, had more to do with Alice Munro and Anne Tyler than Roth or Bellow. (The title of one of Munro’s collections of stories sounds very like the Connolly list: Hateship, Friendship, Courtship, Loveship, Marriage.) It’s tricky to talk about these things (as Connolly proves) because you tend to reveal yourself in ways you can’t control – in the assumptions you make. There are great women writers who, like Roth and Bellow and Updike, took up the challenge of combining the mandarin and vernacular styles. There are women writers who aren’t particularly interested in domestic life, and male writers who care about little else. (Sometimes you find them in the least likely places. Philip Larkin’s A Girl in Winter is about a female librarian who helps an ill colleague.) But just as habits of parenthood change, the tradition that writers see themselves as working in must change, too. And for many writers, of both sexes, the pram in the hall doesn’t mean the death of good art, but the beginning."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"membership/2017/jun/23/the-films-that-changed-my-view-of-britains-shifting-political-landscape","type":"article","sectionId":"membership","sectionName":"Membership","webPublicationDate":"2017-06-23T11:00:23Z","webTitle":"The films that changed my view … of Britain's shifting political landscape","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/membership/2017/jun/23/the-films-that-changed-my-view-of-britains-shifting-political-landscape","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/membership/2017/jun/23/the-films-that-changed-my-view-of-britains-shifting-political-landscape","fields":{"headline":"The films that changed my view … of Britain's shifting political landscape","bodyText":"Richard Hector-Jones, 48, lives in Chorlton-cum-Hardy, Manchester, and works for a communications agency dealing with social issues. John Harris’s Anywhere but Westminster series is, and has always been, brilliant journalism. Armed with a video camera and plenty of curiosity, Harris and John Domokos go in search of the UK’s “real politics”, away from the chatter of Westminster. I think this series really came into its own in the run-up to last summer’s EU referendum, when they used it to shine a light on what was happening in areas not in the political spotlight. They were showing a reality utterly consistent with the mood of the wider UK, pre-Brexit, while few others were really listening. Harris and Domokos were on a mission to get to grips with the rising sense of discontent across the UK. By talking to people about real issues that matter to them, these interviews cut through so much of my own confusion. Their road trip from post-industrial Labour towns to rural Tory heartlands lifted the lid on concerns about immigration and national identity, and even went some way towards attempting to bridge generational and social gaps. It was a simple method that illuminated the fractured, chaotic state of British politics at a pivotal moment in history. Harris seems to have a particular knack of talking to people that means they feel able to open up to him, sometimes almost forgetting they are being interviewed. He doesn’t come across as a conventional journalist – more like one of us – and I don’t think this series would be the same in the hands of anyone else. He’s never sniffy or superior, which was important in a debate that was partly about class, and last year there was a very strong sense that what those in power thought was happening wasn’t. Manchester, where I live, looked to be increasingly Remain. Elsewhere there were people voting out of fear and anger, and rather than grouping them all in one bucket and dismissing their opinions, Harris asked the questions others wouldn’t, or couldn’t. He called it for the Leave campaign early on. And he was absolutely right. By capturing what was going to happen before events unravelled as they did, the series shifted my understanding of how the vote could go and, more importantly, why. I wasn’t surprised when the country voted as it did. By stepping outside the liberal bubble, Harris enabled those of us engaged with the series to read society with a fresh perspective. A month before the vote, the pair published an article calling for suggestions as to who they should speak to, which made it feel even more open-minded, collaborative and real. They did a similar thing with Donald Trump, going to Indiana and watching him win the presumptive election, and speaking to voters who thought he was the only viable option. I often find the short films in this series very affecting; each one is a snapshot of social history. The boldness of Harris and Domokos’s approach and the honesty with which real people respond to them about how politics is impacting their lives makes for compelling viewing. I think a lot of politicians would do well to watch it."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"media/2017/jun/14/andrew-bolt-glitter-bombing-police-release-photos-of-alleged-assailant","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"2017-06-14T06:54:18Z","webTitle":"Andrew Bolt glitter-bombing: police release photos of alleged assailant","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/jun/14/andrew-bolt-glitter-bombing-police-release-photos-of-alleged-assailant","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2017/jun/14/andrew-bolt-glitter-bombing-police-release-photos-of-alleged-assailant","fields":{"headline":"Andrew Bolt glitter-bombing: police release photos of alleged assailant","bodyText":"Police have released photos of a man they allege was responsible for glitter-bombing the News Corp columnist Andrew Bolt in Melbourne.

Lee Wei Ling and her brother Lee Hsien Yang said in a public statement released in the early hours of Wednesday that they were “disturbed by the character, conduct, motives and leadership” of the premier and his wife. Their criticism appeared to focus on a dispute over the fate of the family home, the influence of the first lady on government, and allegations that the prime minister had unannounced political ambitions for his son. “We feel extremely sad that we are pushed to this position,” they wrote. “We have seen a completely different face to our brother, one that deeply troubles us.” Lee Hsien Loong later said he was “deeply saddened by the unfortunate allegations”. Since the death of their father and former leader, Lee Kuan Yew, two years ago, the siblings said they had “felt threatened by Lee Hsien Loong’s misuse of his position and influence over the Singapore government and its agencies to drive his personal agenda”. “We feel big brother omnipresent,” his siblings said, adding that Lee Hsien Yang, chairman of the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore, and his wife now felt “compelled to leave the country”. Lee Kuan Yew ruled from 1959 to 1990 and is credited with turning the former colony – which is poor in resources – into south-east Asia’s wealthiest nation, with a dynamic tech industry. His eldest son and current leader also retains a firm grip on power and widespread popularity, winning 83 of 89 seats in a 2015 election. Wednesday’s statement did not explicitly state any dangers posed to siblings but said that the PM was driven by a desire for “power and personal popularity”, milking his father’s legacy for political purposes. “We feel hugely uncomfortable and closely monitored in our own country. We do not trust Hsien Loong as a brother or as a leader. We have lost confidence in him,” the statement read. “We also believe, based on our interactions, that [the PM and his wife] harbour political ambitions for their son, Li Hongyi.” The comments by Lee Wei Ling, a neurosurgeon, and Lee Hsien Yang also took aim at the first lady, chief executive of the state investor Temasek. They said that unlike their mother, who acted outside the limelight as a private adviser, Ho Ching had amassed huge influence that extended “well beyond her job purview”. The extraordinary display of disapproval rushed through social media in Singapore, where open criticism of political leaders is discouraged and can lead to prison sentences. The bulk of the six-page statement focused on a dispute over the family home, 38 Oxley Road, referencing how their father had asked for it to be demolished upon his death, which they said was part of his long-held beliefs against monuments and self-aggrandising. “However, we believe that Hsien Loong and Ho Ching are motivated by a desire to inherit Lee Kuan Yew’s standing and reputation for themselves and their children,” the statement read. “The simple truth is that Hsien Loong’s current popularity is tied to Lee Kuan Yew’s legacy. Preserving Lee Kuan Yew’s house would allow Hsien Loong and his family to inherit a tangible monument to Lee Kuan Yew’s authority.” They said Lee Hsien Loon had opposed Lee Kuan Yew’s wishes and “expressed plans to move with their family into the house as soon as possible after Lee Kuan Yew’s passing”. The prime minister’s statement said he was “very disappointed that my siblings have chosen to issue a statement publicising private family matters”. Denying the allegations, including harbouring any political ambitions for his son, he said differences among siblings should “stay in the family” and the statement had “hurt our father’s legacy”. Although rare, the ruling family have had public spats in the past – Lee Wei Ling said in April 2015 that the government had tried to use the first anniversary of Lee Kuan Yew’s death as “hero worship” and that her brother was “abusing his power”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/jun/14/gwyneth-glows-like-a-radioactive-swan-my-day-at-the-goop-festival","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2017-06-14T16:19:32Z","webTitle":"'Gwyneth glows like a radioactive swan' – my day at the Goop festival","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/jun/14/gwyneth-glows-like-a-radioactive-swan-my-day-at-the-goop-festival","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/jun/14/gwyneth-glows-like-a-radioactive-swan-my-day-at-the-goop-festival","fields":{"headline":"'Gwyneth glows like a radioactive swan' – my day at the Goop festival","bodyText":"Culver City, Los Angeles, is socked in by haze, and a line of women in black athleisure – more blondes than one is accustomed to seeing in one place at one time – stretches down the block. Each has paid between $500 and $1500 (£390 and £1,175) to stand in this line and attend In Goop Health: Presented by Goop, the inaugural “health and wellness expo” of Gwyneth Paltrow’s lifestyle brand, Goop. People are excited, a little nervous and giddy. It feels as if we are waiting for the bus to summer camp, if your summer camp gives out free lube and Nicole Richie is there. At 9am the beefy security team parts and we pour into a courtyard where employees sort us into more lines based on how much we have paid to be here. Colour-coded bracelets indicate whether you are a Lapis ($500), Amethyst ($1,000) or Clear Quartz ($1,500) Gooper. More money means more activities: a foam roller workout, a “sound bath”, even lunch with “GP” herself in the “Collagen Garden”. Apparently, a prohibitively expensive, celebrity-studded self-help salon isn’t exclusive enough: the very rich can’t have fun without a little class hierarchy. We pass into a second courtyard, which offers clusters of tasteful white furniture ringed by a variety of “wellness adventures”. In one corner, you can sit cross-legged on a cushion and the “resident Goop shaman” will tell you which crystal you “need”. In the opposite corner is a woman who will photograph your aura in a little tent. There is an oxygen bar and an IV drip station. And there is food, of course, just in very small pieces: tiny vegan doughnuts, quinoa and lox swaddled in seaweed, ladles of unsalted bone broth, fruit. I take a lap of the courtyard and the cavernous hangar where we will be spending the next nine hours (there is no re-entry). Inside, interspersed among the Goop-approved matcha and coconut-water stalls, is the Goop Marketplace, where attendees can buy face potions, rolling pins and Tory Burch’s new line of active wear. For $55, you can buy one of the jade eggs that Goop famously suggested women carry around in their vaginas. Or, a rose quartz egg, if you have “seen results with the jade egg and want to take your practice a step further”. I head back outside and get in line for the shaman. Turns out, the shaman is a little backed up, so they are scheduling appointments instead. A friendly employee writes my name on a clipboard and tells me to come back at 4.05pm. The line for aura photography is even longer. I wait about 10 minutes before a staffer announces that the schedule is full and we are all fired from the line, but we can check back later. That’s fine. Everyone is feeling good. Employees weave through the crowd with trays of probiotic juice. I decide I like the Goop expo. It is silly, but most of us seem to be in on the joke – like Dungeons and Dragons for your vaginal flora. Why not? I don’t believe that my proximity to crystals (or lack thereof) has any effect on my wellbeing, but I don’t think it is interesting or sophisticated to mock people who do. These women are having fun. They are sitting on pillows and connecting with each other. It is the kind of spontaneously intimate conversation that happens among women all the time, dressed up in the language of magic and, sure, monetised. As long as you are not promising miracles and swapping carnelian for childhood vaccines, organising your inner life around crystals doesn’t seem much different than organising it around “bullet journalling”. There is a line, of course, between having fun with rocks and exploiting people’s fears for profit, and I am expecting to approach that soon enough. I wander back inside and there she is, gliding through the Bulletproof Coffee line like our priestess. Here is just a true fact: Gwyneth glows like a radioactive swan. She emits light. She would be great in a power outage. Though the FAQ specifically directed attendees to wear athleisure (with a link to the Goop store’s athleisure page – just to be helpful!), Gwyneth appears to be wearing a sirocco of flower petals. She leads us, her flock, into the auditorium and the real show begins. After a brief history of Goop (“I started to wonder: Why do we all not feel well? Why is there so much cancer? Why are we all so tired?”), Paltrow introduces her personal physician, Dr Habib Sadeghi, DO. He talks for an hour about “cosmic flow”; his left testicle; the “magnificence” of Gwyneth (“I’ve been down and I’ve touched her feet … and I’ll do it again”); and his belief that “consciousness precedes phenotypic expression”, which means, basically, that all ailments are on some level psychosomatic and your ovarian cysts are really just little nodules of emotion – or something. The next panel, on gut health, counters Sadeghi’s consciousness theory with the assertion that all human illnesses are caused by antibiotics, ibuprofen, caesarean sections and legumes. The human gut is a rich rainforest, they say. Antibiotics are “napalm”, and taking one ibuprofen is “like swallowing a hand grenade”. Someone relates an anecdote about a marathon runner who had to get a faecal transplant from her fat niece, and it made the marathon runner fat. In mice, faecal transplants have been found to make fat mice thin, and anxious mice calm. Oh, my God, I realise. Paltrow is going to start selling her own poop. Dr Steven Gundry, author of The Plant Paradox, reveals that from January to June inclusive, he consumes all his calories between 6pm and 8pm, because “we evolved to search for food all day and then fast”. It’s funny how our understanding of human evolution – of the point at which we were once our truest selves – can shift according to which restrictive diet is on-trend that day. Next to each of our chairs is a complementary bottle of hot-pink, watermelon-flavoured water, sickly-sweet with Stevia. You know, just like the cavemen used to drink. Gundry argues that human beings aren’t meant to eat any plants native to North America, because we are native to “Africa, Europe and Asia”. At one point, Dr Amy Myers casually distinguishes between the gut bacteria Asian people need (because “they” eat a lot of seaweed) and the gut bacteria that “we” need. You don’t have to glance around the room to know who “we” are. In Goop Health is shockingly white – even to me, a blond, white person who went in expecting whiteness. Obviously, this is anecdotal – I haven’t conducted a census – but I don’t recall seeing more than 10 people of colour among the attendees, and that’s a generous estimate. The panellists are almost exclusively white. I wonder if anyone at Goop brought up the lack of diversity in their speakers during the planning stages, or anticipated this criticism. But to acknowledge it would be to acknowledge politics, and In Goop Health stays as far away from politics as it can get. However, an event supposedly focused “on being and achieving the optimal versions of ourselves”, as Paltrow put it during her welcome address, cannot truly be depoliticised. You can’t honestly address “wellness” – the things people need to be well – without addressing poverty and systemic racism, disability access and affordable healthcare, paid family leave and food insecurity, contraception and abortion, sex work and the war against drugs and mass incarceration. Unless, of course, you are only talking about the wellness of people whose lives are untouched by all of those forces. That is, the wellness of people who are disproportionately well already. Towards the end of his speech, Sadeghi tells a story about an epiphany he had in the anatomy lab. He says he discovered that the first valve of the heart flows straight back into the heart: “Selfish little organ there! No, no, not selfish – self-honouring. Wooo! What a difference! I could never give anything to anybody – ask my beloved wife – until I take care of me. Until my needs are met. Right? Right? When you fly down, the first thing that they tell you is that before you put the mask on anybody else, put it on yourself.” I hear that idea repeated over and over again at the Goop conference – take care of yourself so you can take care of others. Put your mask on first. Hold space for yourself. Be entitled. Take. At a certain point, it begins to feel less like self-care and more like rationalisation. I don’t know anything about the personal lives of the women at In Goop Health – who they give money to, what hardships they have endured, why they were drawn to this event – and every person I interact with is funny and smart and kind and self-aware. But it is self-evident and measurable that white people in the US, in general, are assiduous about the first part of that equation (caring for ourselves) and less than attentive to the second (caring for others). It is OK to love skin cream and crystals. It is normal and forgivable to be afraid of dying, afraid of cancer, afraid of losing your youth and beauty and the currency they confer. We have no other currency for women. I understand why people spend their lives searching for that one magic supplement, that one bit of lore that will turn their “lifestyle” around and make them small and perfect and valuable for ever. I also understand, especially at this moment in history, why people long to step outside of politics for a day and eat kale-flavoured ice cream (real, not satire, actually good) in a warehouse full of Galadriels. But the idea that anything is apolitical is an illusion accessible only to a very few. And the absolute least the Galadriel-in-chief ought to do is acknowledge that. At 4.05pm I dash outside for my shaman appointment, only to be told they are running about an hour behind. “Should I come back in an hour,” I ask. “I mean, you could try,” the woman says in a way that means, “No”, or maybe, “Not with that bracelet”. For her keynote to close the day, Paltrow purports to dissect the complexities and woes of being a working mother with a panel of famous gal pals: Cameron Diaz, Tory Burch, Nicole Richie and Miranda Kerr. How do they do it? How do they have it all? The women deliver a bounty of platitudes about ambition, female friendship, self-care, their mothers and sticking to one’s “practice”. They are charming and humble. Richie is funny. But at no point do any of them say the words: “I HAVE LOTS AND LOTS OF MONEY AND A STAFF.” In the context of a conversation about the challenges facing working mothers, the omission is, frankly, bizarre. It is a basic responsibility of the privileged to refrain from taking credit for our own good fortune. They might as well have been reading from Ivanka Trump’s book proposal. As with all the other panels, they do not take questions. There is one moment I can’t stop thinking about. Near the end, Kerr casually mentions that she once tried leech therapy as part of her wellness practice: “One was on my coccyx because it’s really good to, like, detox the body, rejuvenate the body … I had a leech facial as well. And I kept the leeches. They’re in my koi pond.” I am fat. I was the fattest person at the Goop expo. Strangers regularly contact me to tell me that I’m unhealthy and I’m going to die. A sampler from my emails: “Being obese is NOT OK. It is associated with many health risks including: diabetes, high blood pressure, cardiovascular disease, and premature death. Go lose some weight you fat slob, and do it before you go on disability so we don’t have to pay for you.” “I don’t know what sort of message you are trying to send out to young girls/women, but that it is OK to be obese, and it is some sort of feminist sin to want to keep to a natural healthy shape can’t be a good one.” Kerr’s body is almost certainly what those people mean when they say “a natural healthy shape”, because our society conflates conventional beauty with health. But, I don’t know – I might be fat, but I’ve never felt like I needed to get an IV drip on a patio in Culver City or put leeches on my butt to suck out toxins, and I’m grateful for that. I guess Goop did make me feel well after all."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2017/jun/15/wanted-season-two-channel-seven-must-watch-australian-tv","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2017-06-15T03:54:24Z","webTitle":"Wanted's second season has upped the ante.

This is must-watch Australian TV","bodyText":"Who would win in a fight to the death between Rebecca Gibney and Liam Neeson? Your media consumption to date has, perhaps, gravitated you towards the latter. You are undoubtedly recalling the grizzled alpha male’s famously crotchety face and I-eat-puppies-for-breakfast demeanour. But I am here to tell you that it would be Gibney by a country mile. Don’t believe me? In Channel Seven’s Wanted (which premiered its second season last week) the proof is in the pudding. If you didn’t catch the first season, it is necessary viewing for anyone partial to a pulse pounder: a lean, punchy, pressure-cooked on-the-run action thriller following two seemingly ordinary women who evade dangerous goons and crooked cops. Gibney, also a producer and co-creator (with fellow showrunner Richard Bell), plays Lola: a badarse supermarket employee. We don’t grasp the extent of her badarsery until she discovers herself at the centre of a frenetic, blood-splotched cross-country trip, whooshing from Sydney to Queensland in a hot car with tonnes of money in the back that isn’t hers. Lola’s companion is timid office worker Chelsea (Geraldine Hakewill); their chalk and cheese personalities give the show an Odd Couple-style twang. It would be wrong to say Wanted, which had an average combined audience of 1.85 million viewers, is paced as fast as an action movie. It’s much faster than that. Season one concluded with a cliffhanger; a rather brusque phone call from a criminal snarling, “Did you think this was over? We have your son.” The second kicks off with Lola and Chelsea travelling to Bangkok to rescue said son. Thus there’s a touch of Bangkok Hilton, involving the Thai underworld instead of the justice system. In the second episode, a character responds to a head honcho’s grisly directive by asking, “Do we really need more bodies?” If an answer in the affirmative guarantees more Gibney-delivered arse walloping, the answer is yes. A thousand times yes. Anchored by the presence of two hotheads behind the wheel of a car, fanging it cross-country – the police and others on their tail – comparisons to Thelma and Louise were perhaps inevitable. Gibney and Hakewill’s casting is nevertheless gender-blind: their characters are not written to be women, but rather happen to be women, and there’s a big difference between the two. You could call this progressive – but given the (near-complete) extent to which these kinds of tough, ultra-resilient roles have been taken by men, necessary might be a better word. The show’s unconventional casting could also be a reason sections of the media don’t seem to know how to deal with it. For example one journalist described Wanted as a “dramedy”. In one of the quieter scenes in the first season, Lola lures a cold-blooded killer through a cornfield. When he gets out of it he delivers a slightly hammy monologue (“We are the same, you know, we have both taken life … ”), before he notices something smells funny about the ground beneath him. Its a trap! Lola has covered it with petrol. Gibney bends over, lights the earth on fire, and the would-be assassin goes up like a scarecrow at Burning Man, screaming as his flesh sizzles. If Wanted is a “dramedy”, Snowtown is a life-affirming musical. The second season ups the ante by introducing a globetrotting element. The action remains on-the-run but Lola and Chelsea’s challenge is ultimately intellectual. When the principal characters solve one problem, they are quickly confronted with another, and then another. At its core Wanted is about the power of resourcefulness in the most challenging of scenarios. The approach of the screenwriters (Timothy Hobart, John Ridley and Kirsty Fisher) hinges on asking two questions synonymous with the “writers’ room” problem-solving-esque approach, applied to great American programs such as Breaking Bad. 1. What are the characters thinking; and 2. What happens next? The power of those simple but crucial questions, and the discipline involved in never ceasing to answer them, cannot be underestimated. It is one of the reasons Wanted is, if not a masterclass in sustaining pace and momentum, then certainly a gallingly good case study for the wider Australian television industry. The writing alone makes it the kind of program we should be making more of. As does the casting. In an interview, Gibney commented that she “wanted to create a character that wasn’t invisible”. That, surely, is the least of her achievements. • Wanted aires at 8.40pm on Mondays on Channel Seven"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2017/jun/14/chinese-tycoon-reportedly-caught-up-anti-corruption-crackdown-wu-xiaohui-anbang","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-06-14T09:36:55Z","webTitle":"Chinese tycoon reportedly caught up in sweeping corruption crackdown","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jun/14/chinese-tycoon-reportedly-caught-up-anti-corruption-crackdown-wu-xiaohui-anbang","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/jun/14/chinese-tycoon-reportedly-caught-up-anti-corruption-crackdown-wu-xiaohui-anbang","fields":{"headline":"Chinese tycoon reportedly caught up in sweeping corruption crackdown","bodyText":"The chairman of an influential Chinese insurance company has stepped down after domestic media reported that he had been detained as authorities pursue a sweeping campaign against alleged corruption in the financial industry. Wu Xiaohui, the chairman of Anbang Insurance, was “unable to perform his duties for personal reasons”, the company said. Caijing, a respected Chinese news magazine, reported that Wu Xiaohui had been taken away by police on Friday in Beijing and that government regulators had then met the company the following day. The report was quickly deleted, highlighting the sensitivity of the case. Anbang, which is closely connected to the Chinese government, said the company was operating normally and that Wu had delegated power to other executives. The company had been in controversial talks earlier this year to invest $400m (£313m) in a New York building owned by Jared Kushner’s company. The deal was scrapped after intense public scrutiny, amid criticism from lawmakers and government ethics experts who saw it as a potential attempt by China to curry favour with the White House. Kushner, who is Donald Trump’s son-in-law and an adviser to the president, has been tasked with heading up the White House’s relations with China. Wu’s detention comes amid a flurry of political activity among Chinese tycoons in the months leading up to a critical Communist party meeting later this year. In January, Xiao Jianhua, a billionaire, was abducted by Chinese security agents from his apartment at the Four Seasons in Hong Kong and spirited across the border. In recent months, Guo Wengui, a businessman in self-imposed exile in New York, has accused top Communist party officials of corruption, threatening to release documents proving his allegations while publicly hoping to come to a deal with Chinese leaders. Many saw Wu as more politically secure. He is married to the granddaughter of Deng Xiaoping, China’s paramount leader in the 1980s credited with the country’s rapid transition to a capitalist system and economic fortune. Wu was recently barred from leaving China, according to previous reports. Anbang is also rumoured to have a host of politically connected investors, but its ownership structure remains opaque. That lack of transparency led regulators in New York to demand details of Anbang’s funding and shareholding structure before approving the purchase of a US insurer. The deal eventually collapsed after the company refused to comply. China’s anti-corruption watchdog has begun targeting the insurance sector, including the country’s regulator, and Anbang has been banned from offering new products since last month for “wreaking havoc on market order”. The head of the China Insurance Regulatory Commission was detained in April for graft, in a sign that President Xi Jinping’s wide-ranging anti-corruption campaign has turned its focus to the financial industry. Critics of the campaign say it is politically motivated and has done little to attack the root cause of graft in China. Anbang has about $300bn in assets and Wu led the company as it embarked on a worldwide buying spree, including purchasing the Waldorf Astoria hotel in New York, spending $6.5bn on another 16 luxury hotels and buying South Korean and Dutch insurance companies. Last year Anbang made a failed $14bn bid for the Starwood hotel chain."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/ng-interactive/2017/jun/14/david-squires-on-a-busy-week-for-australian-football-and-aeronautics-enthusiasts","type":"interactive","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-06-14T19:00:18Z","webTitle":"David Squires on ... a busy week for Australian football and aeronautics enthusiasts","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/ng-interactive/2017/jun/14/david-squires-on-a-busy-week-for-australian-football-and-aeronautics-enthusiasts","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/ng-interactive/2017/jun/14/david-squires-on-a-busy-week-for-australian-football-and-aeronautics-enthusiasts","fields":{"headline":"David Squires on ... a busy week for Australian football and aeronautics enthusiasts","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"uk-news/2017/jun/14/what-we-know-so-far-about-the-london-tower-block-fire","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2017-06-14T11:40:20Z","webTitle":"What we know so far about the London tower block fire","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/jun/14/what-we-know-so-far-about-the-london-tower-block-fire","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2017/jun/14/what-we-know-so-far-about-the-london-tower-block-fire","fields":{"headline":"What we know so far about the London tower block fire","bodyText":"At least 12 people have died after a huge fire engulfed a tower block in west London and the Metropolitan police have said the figure is likely to rise. The fire broke out shortly before 1am on Wednesday at Grenfell Tower in Latimer Road, near Notting Hill. The tower is 24 storeys high and contains 120 flats. A local councillor said it is home to between 400 and 600 people. More than 200 firefighters tackled the blaze at its peak with more than 40 engines. London ambulance service said it was called at 1.29am and 20 crews raced to the scene. Firefighters arrived within six minutes of the first 999 call. The London ambulance service said 68 patients were taken to six hospitals across London, 18 of whom are receiving critical care, while a further 10 patients self-presented at hospitals. Eighteen remain in critical care.There have been multiple reports of people trapped in the blaze. London fire brigade said it had reached the top of the tower block by early evening on Wednesday. No more survivors are expected to be found. Pockets of fire were still burning on Wednesday evening and firefighters will remain on the scene overnight. Witnesses described screams of terror and people jumping in an attempt to reach safety. A baby was caught by a member of the public after being dropped from the ninth or 10th floor, a witness said. Streets around the tower have been sealed off and residents in their houses told to move out. Falling debris also caused nearby flats to be evacuated. The fire brigade has called it an “unprecedented incident” and said there is currently no known cause of the blaze. The Grenfell Action Group, a residents’ association, repeatedly warned about the risk of fire in the tower and claimed that a major blaze was narrowly averted after a power surge in 2013. The group said its concerns were dismissed. Experts said the fire spread at unusual speed and raised concerns whether the cladding may have contributed to this. The mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, declared the fire a major incident. Transport for London has suspended services on the Circle and Hammersmith and City tube lines between Hammersmith and Edgware Road. The A40 Westway is closed in both directions. The tower, which was built in 1974, recently underwent a major refurbishment. The Met has an emergency number for anyone concerned for loved ones.

He seemed to have forgotten that he’d been raised by a mother and lived in a society made up of nearly 51% women. And that men have a gender too. Like quite a few of his peers in the group, he was out of his comfort zone and starting to learn some unpleasant realities about his own privilege and what that means for the women who make up nearly 47% of the Australian workforce. Men are part of the problem and need to be part of the solution, authors Graeme Russell and Michael Flood point out in a timely new Diversity Council Australia report titled Men Make a Difference: Engaging Men on Gender Equality. Getting blokes on board is not a magic solution to gender inequality, the report notes, but without it the “systematic pattern of female disadvantage and male privilege” is unlikely to change quickly. This was also my conclusion in my book, Stop Fixing Women: Why Building Fairer Workplaces is Everybody’s Business (NewSouth). Men are key to addressing an uneven system largely sustained by them, the report notes, but not because women are weak or can’t contribute. It’s about changing how men think, behave and relate to women and other men. Genuine engagement however involves two uncomfortable home truths about most workplaces: that power needs to be shared but is still largely in the hands of men; and men have traditionally been the beneficiaries of “unearned” benefits. Men’s views are often taken more seriously, they are evaluated more positively and seen as more “natural” leaders. Challenging those biases, my research suggests, needs to start with those at the top who can change the rules and deal with resistance. It’s not about simply turning up to White Ribbon Day or men calling themselves feminists. In fact, the report makes it clear that effective efforts should avoid putting men on pedestals or hiding behind token efforts – often known as “gender-washing” because there’s more talk than action. And male advocacy is not a replacement for – but should sit alongside – programs that support women. But getting buy-in is still hard work: men don’t think it’s their problem, they fear judgement by their peers if they speak up, and many claim they don’t know what to say or do. But there’s also a major upside, Flood and Russell point out: men will benefit from progress towards gender equality personally, in their intimate and family relationships, and in their workplaces and communities. And most men broadly support gender equality. In fact, men may even find it easier to make an impact, whether individually or through the Male Champions of Change, programs such as the Workplace Gender Equilibrium Challenge or networks like The 100% Project. Research shows that because men at the higher levels of workplaces can take for granted their gender and leadership positions and their acceptance by masculine establishments, they are often perceived more positively than women when acting as public champions. But passive resistance is still rife within many organisations, where the latest diversity measures are often seen as “unfair” to men. Backlash is particularly virulent in the middle ranks of management – sometimes called the concrete layer. No wonder it’s so much easier and less disruptive to tell women they need to “lean in” or gain confidence, which leaves the status quo in place. The male leaders I interviewed were clear that they had to face up to the reality of what happened in their own workplaces and put their foot down to get new rules embedded. They did more than talk and were using interventions to prevent bias in recruiting, promoting and paying employees. Examples included anonymous recruiting, which removes candidates’ names from applications, reviewing how work was allocated to ensure women were getting similar experience and opportunities to their peers, and conducting pay audits to identify gender gaps. This included Lance Hockridge, former CEO of Aurizon, who introduced new recruitment programs and targets, and made sure he spoke directly to dissenters; and Martin Parkinson, former treasury secretary (now secretary of the department of prime minister and cabinet) who realised the work done in the past had dealt with symptoms and not the cause of the problem. Several of these men acknowledged their efforts didn’t make them very popular in the ranks, but they were motivated by a strong sense of justice and the upside for their business. And like the chair of Diversity Council Australia, former Australian of the Year and chief of army, David Morrison, they agreed that once you see sexism you can’t unsee it. Gender equality is a business issue, not a women’s issue, concludes the report which provides much-needed research and advice by men on how to engage men in this effort. Fixing women hasn’t delivered fairer outcomes because it only focuses on half the workforce and reinforces the stereotypes that underpin an unequal system. Now we need the men who designed our workplaces and mostly run them to take action. They are the system and they need to help change it."},"isHosted":false},{"id":"uk-news/2017/jun/14/fire-safety-concerns-raised-by-grenfell-tower-residents-in-2012","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2017-06-14T13:08:47Z","webTitle":"Grenfell Tower residents say managers 'brushed away' fire safety concerns","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/jun/14/fire-safety-concerns-raised-by-grenfell-tower-residents-in-2012","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2017/jun/14/fire-safety-concerns-raised-by-grenfell-tower-residents-in-2012","fields":{"headline":"Grenfell Tower residents say managers 'brushed away' fire safety concerns","bodyText":"Residents of Grenfell Tower have said they raised multiple concerns about the risk of fire in the months before the fatal blaze at the building, but were “brushed away” by the council’s tenant management organisation. Survivors of the disaster said on Wednesday they had raised fears about the fact that there was only one escape route. They also told the Kensington and Chelsea tenant management organisation (KCTMO) of their concerns over the placement of boilers and gas pipes, the absence of a building-wide fire alarm or sprinkler system, and piles of rubbish being dumped and causing a fire risk. Investigations have begun into the cause of the fire and how it swept so rapidly up the tower’s 24 storeys, apparently spreading across a new thermal cladding system installed last year as part of a £10m refurbishment. Only last November, the Grenfell Action Group warned of “dangerous living conditions” and said: “It is a truly terrifying thought but the Grenfell Action Group firmly believe that only a catastrophic event will expose the ineptitude and incompetence of our landlord, the KCTMO.” In the same month, the Guardian has learned, KCTMO placed fire safety issues across its estate under review and ordered multiple changes to the way it handled fire risk in its properties. As well as tackling hoarding and clutter in communal areas, it said it would speed up the installation of self-closing doors. The disaster has sparked a review by construction professionals of dozens of similar refurbishment projects involving recladding that have been undertaken in recent years. One architect said he had placed the design of a dozen towers under review. The policing and fire minister, Nick Hurd, also announced checks would be carried out on projects currently under way. As well as examining the cladding at Grenfell Tower, another line of inquiry is likely to be whether gas pipes triggered or exacerbated the blaze. Firefighters, fire safety experts and architects all voiced alarm about the speed at which the fire swept across the new polyester powder-coated aluminium facade, installed as part of the refurbishment to improve the building’s insulation and appearance. “I don’t think we have seen this sort of fire in the UK before,” said Mike Penning, former fire minister in David Cameron’s government. “We have to check if the existing regulations have been adhered to and it looks to me, from a distance, that that may not be the case.” In March, local councillor Judith Blakeman, who sits on the KCTMO board, raised residents’ fears about the installation by the National Grid of gas pipes in the main stairwells. The landlord assured her they would be boxed in with “fire-rated” protection, but this was not done, Blakeman said. She also said she requested an independent safety adjudication of the building, but this was declined. “I was treated like I was a nuisance,” she said. “I raised 19 complaints on behalf of individual residents. Every single time we were told that the board had satisfied itself that the fire safety was fine.” David Collins, a member of the Grenfell Tower residents’ association, said it had “repeatedly reported concerns to the tenant management organisation of the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, including fire safety concerns which were not investigated during the regeneration works”. He said there were “concerns over locations of boilers, concerns about escape, concerns about fire escape lighting – the list goes on”. “I spoke to councillors and they refused to investigate,” Collins said. “They wouldn’t believe that the residents were concerned. Ninety percent of residents signed an independent petition asking for there to be an investigation into the organisation that runs this building because they were so incompetent. And the council turned it down.” The KCTMO said in a statement: “We are aware that concerns have been raised historically by residents. We always take all concerns seriously and these will form part of our forthcoming investigations. While these investigations continue with our cooperation, our core priority at the moment is our residents.” The organisation said it was “too early to speculate what caused the fire and contributed to its spread”. Later, the chief executive of KCTMO, Robert Black, told ITV News London that he and his colleagues were “in complete shock”. He said: “I’ve been here since 3.30 this morning working on the ground, it’s part of my job ... trying to actually manage the outcome of that devastation and make sure people are covered and they’ve got somewhere to go tonight. “As a tenant management organisation, we do listen to people and we have listened to people and that’s what we’re doing,” he went on. Asked to comment on observations that the cladding on the tower may have added to the speed and intensity at which the fire spread, he said: “We had no expectation this would happen, we are absolutely devastated by it.” The council has admitted it received complaints over the refurbishment. Asked whether the council had received complaints and was acting on them, the leader of the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, Nick Paget-Brown, said: “I think that’s going to have to be looked at in even more detail during the investigation behind this. “But it is perfectly true that Grenfell Tower underwent a major refurbishment programme, starting about two and a half years ago, to improve the hot water system, to improve the heating, to improve insulation, put in new windows, new external cladding, to improve the quality of life for people who were living there.” Rydon, the contractor for the refurbishment, said it “met all required building control, fire regulation and health and safety standards”. The architect was Studio E. In a statement, they said: “We are deeply shocked and distressed over news of the devastating fire at Grenfell Tower. Our thoughts are with those that have been affected by this tragic incident, together with all of their relatives and friends. Given the ongoing nature of the incident, it would be inappropriate for us to comment or speculate further at this stage. We will be available to assist the relevant authorities as and when we are required.” One architect, who has been responsible for several recladding projects, said the tower’s cladding was designed to include fire-breaks at every floor and around every window. He said that if the cladding were installed correctly, flames should not be able to sweep through the cavities. Eyewitnesses including Beinazir Lasharie, councillor for Notting Dale ward, where the fire struck, told the Guardian the cladding appeared “very flammable”. “The flames were working their way up and it seemed like the cladding had caught fire,” she said. “That is how it spread.” Lasharie said residents often had meetings with the KCTMO and the organisation would “brush away” their worries. Experts voiced differing opinions on the role of the cladding, which fell off in blazing chunks. According to planning documents, it was constructed from units called Reynobond rainscreen cassettes and was installed by Harley Facades Limited. The company declined to comment “until we have more information ourselves”, but described the blaze as “devastating”. The London fire commissioner, Dany Cotton, said: “I do not want to speculate about the cause of the fire or what has caused it to spread in the way that it did.” According to board papers for November 2016, KCTMO was handed a “deficiency notice” last year by the London fire brigade after an audit at another of its properties – Lonsdale House on the Portobello Court estate. The notice related to flat entrance doors and the requirement for regular inspections of self-closing devices. “Before the regeneration, people raised concerns about how it was going to be made safe,” said Cllr Lasharie, speaking about Grenfell Tower. “Once it was done, the finishing wasn’t done properly. People were worried there was only one fire exit, that there was rubbish being left at the bottom of the tower where dumping was going on, open wires when the works were being done. They were concerned there was no proper evacuation process, no proper fire alarm for everyone to hear and there’s no sprinkler system.” She said boilers were left “bare” in living rooms and kitchens. “It was poor work.” “People were worried from the start about the safety and the workmanship,” she said. “This is the worst thing that could have happened. People have died.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/jun/14/senior-labor-figures-support-inquiry-into-foreign-influence-on-australian-politics","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-06-14T07:24:29Z","webTitle":"Senior Labor figures support inquiry into foreign influence on Australian politics","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/jun/14/senior-labor-figures-support-inquiry-into-foreign-influence-on-australian-politics","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/jun/14/senior-labor-figures-support-inquiry-into-foreign-influence-on-australian-politics","fields":{"headline":"Senior Labor figures support inquiry into foreign influence on Australian politics","bodyText":"Senior Labor figures have joined a call by MP Anthony Byrne for a parliamentary inquiry into foreign influence after reports the NSW branch of the party received at least $120,000 in donations from companies with links to a Chinese-born businessman on its Senate ticket. Fairfax Media and the Australian reported that “Simon” Shuo Zhou, a gold trader who ran for Labor as a Senate candidate in the 2016 election, quit a part-time job at the NSW Labor headquarters this week after the party was questioned about his alleged link to a tax scam involving gold dealers. In the reports Byrne called for an inquiry by the parliamentary joint committee on intelligence and security, commenting that it “has to be done, even if it involves our own side”. On Wednesday the former treasurer Wayne Swan and the frontbench MP Ed Husic added their support to the call for an inquiry. Labor and the government focused on foreign donations in question time, when the treasurer, Scott Morrison, targeted the opposition’s links to Zhou. He said “gold-plated fraud” – referring to tax evasion scams in precious metals he said had cost taxpayers $860m – had “wormed its way into the Australian Labor party”. At a doorstop in Queanbeyan the party leader, Bill Shorten, said he didn’t know “the ins and the outs of the matter”. He referred questions on Zhou to NSW Labor and reiterated his call last week for a bipartisan reference to the committee. On Wednesday, the Australian newspaper reported that four companies run by or linked to Zhou donated at least $120,000 to the NSW ALP on 15 and 16 May 2016, while Fairfax reported the total was $140,000. Guardian Australia has confirmed the $120,000 total in four donations through the NSW ALP’s disclosure to the Australian Electoral Commission and those of each donor: AGSX Pty Ltd $26,000 AUGS Markets Pty Ltd $30,00 Gold and Silver Exchange Sydney Pty Ltd $29,000 AGSX Investables Group Pty Ltd $35,000 Zhou, given the unwinnable seventh spot on Labor’s NSW Senate ticket at the 2016 election, has been named in an administrative appeals tribunal case as being connected to a company involved in a $143m gold-trading scandal. The Australian reported that the scandal resulted in the Australian Taxation Office seeking $20m in unpaid taxes and penalties, including a $2.5m bill from Zhou’s company Australian Coin Exchange before it collapsed this year. Asked about Byrne’s call for an inquiry on Wednesday, Husic, the shadow employment services minister, said he “absolutely” supported it. “I think it’s important that people have confidence in the system,” he said. “If there are questions that are being asked, get them answered.” Swan also said he was in favour of a reference for an inquiry on foreign donations. “The Liberal party once again won’t face up to facts here and does not favour the inquiry, once again sticking its head in the sand,” he said. Last week Four Corners alleged that Senator Sam Dastyari contradicted Labor party policy on the South China Sea a day after influential Chinese billionaire Huang Xiangmo threatened to withdraw a promised $400,000 donation to the party. On Wednesday Shorten said he had written to Turnbull, following the Four Corners story last week, to call for the parliamentary joint committee on intelligence and security “to have a look at how we can better safeguard against foreign interference in elections and our electoral process”. In question time, Shorten asked why the government did not support a Labor bill to ban foreign donations, prompting the prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, to respond that one could “drive a truck through” the loopholes in Labor’s proposal. The government intends to introduce a bill in the spring parliamentary sitting to ban foreign donations not just to political parties but also to third-party activist groups, such as GetUp. Turnbull accused Dastyari of “a disgraceful performance of cash for comment and clear policy switch” on the South China Sea, and questioned why Shorten had stood him down for only six months before he returned as deputy Senate whip. Morrison noted that Labor had recruited Zhou to run for the Senate, jibing that the political aspirant “wanted to be a gold member of the Australian parliament”. “At the end of the day, the real question for the leader of the opposition is this: will the Labor party set aside that $140,000 in a trust account so it can be accessed by the Australian Taxation Office, as a result of their investigations into this gold fraud?” Labor targeted foreign minister, Julie Bishop, asking if she was aware one of the Liberal party’s largest donors, Chinese mining magnate Sally Zou, reportedly set up a company called “Julie Bishop Glorious Foundation”. Bishop replied that all donations to the Liberal party were declared to the AEC and until the media raised it with her a week ago, she was not aware of the foundation. Guardian Australia approached the ATO, NSW Labor party, Dastyari and executives of each of the four companies named as NSW Labor donors for comment."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/jun/14/coal-dinosaurs-arguing-against-the-finkel-review-clearly-dont-understand-it","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-06-14T03:34:16Z","webTitle":"Coal dinosaurs arguing against the Finkel review clearly don't understand it | Michael Slezak","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/jun/14/coal-dinosaurs-arguing-against-the-finkel-review-clearly-dont-understand-it","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/jun/14/coal-dinosaurs-arguing-against-the-finkel-review-clearly-dont-understand-it","fields":{"headline":"Coal dinosaurs arguing against the Finkel review clearly don't understand it","bodyText":"Energy and climate is a complex policy area. But the amount of rubbish floating around both from the pro-coal dinosaurs in the Coalition backbench and from similarly inclined commentators is astounding. The Finkel review recommendation a clean energy target be implemented has been at the core of conservative objections and about 20 Coalition backbenchers spoke against the recommendations in a party room meeting. Many of their arguments have been aired publicly or leaked. Here are some of the silliest. ‘Emissions-lowering policy will push up power prices’ This is the line being run by Tony Abbott and, reportedly, by others including the Victorian Liberal moderate Russell Broadbent. For a party traditionally geared towards helping businesses make more money, this line of argument reveals the ideological commitment to fossil fuels, which ignores the pleas of energy users everywhere. The Business Council of Australia, the Australian Industry Group and the Energy Users Association of Australia all agree the lack of policy that puts a price on carbon is pushing up prices by stifling new investment in new generators. At some point greenhouse gas emissions will need to be eliminated from the electricity sector; investment decisions become much riskier until investors know what the policy is that will drive that. Finkel noted this in the first few paragraphs of his report. “We quickly discovered that, beyond the cost of gas, uncertainty around emissions reduction policies was pushing up prices and undermining reliability. Our plan removes that uncertainty.” Submissions from the big “gentailers” – companies that own generators and retail assets – made this point explicitly. Origin, Energy Australia and AGL each made submissions that argued this. Modelling in Finkel’s report – which backs up earlier modelling – shows instituting any of the emissions-lowering policies he considered would drive down both wholesale and retail electricity prices, compared with doing nothing. Why commentators and politicians would continue to argue that emissions reductions policies will push up prices, contradicting what energy generators, energy retailers and energy users say – and what all the science and modelling work shows – is a bit mysterious. ‘We should delay action on climate change because it will be cheaper in the future’ The Liberal backbencher Craig Kelly, who is chair of the Coalition backbench committee on climate and energy, said on Radio National on Wednesday that it would be better to “backload” emission reductions closer to when they need to be achieved, because by that time technology will be better or cheaper. In other words, we should delay cutting emissions. He said: “That will give you the opportunity to actually use a lot of these technologies as they’re developing rather than jump in now and spend billions of dollars in capital investment in some renewable technologies that in three or four years could be redundant.” But this idea seems to just be completely made up. If the aim is to reach a certain target by 2030, it will be cheaper to get there slowly, rather than to try to do it quickly at the last minute. Sending clear long-term signals to the electricity industry, which invests in assets that last decades, will be less disruptive than doing something at the last minute. Indeed, that is the plea from industry: set the emissions reduction policies in place now, so that long-term decisions can be made. As it happens, the Climate Institute modelled the exact question of the relative costs of taking action now, or leaving it to the last minute. The two cases they compared were not those being considered by the Finkel review but they showed convincingly that last-minute action causes large disruptions and comes with large social and economic costs. ‘Coal energy is cheapest’ Despite Finkel’s recommendations making very little dent in coal generation above business as usual, the recommendations have provoked a revolt in support of coal. Abbott has labelled Finkel’s recommended clean energy target as a “tax on coal” and, on Radio National, Kelly said coal power is still “our lowest cost of electricity generation”. That’s just not true. If you’re comparing the cost of new-build electricity, coal is the most expensive of all. And if you’re comparing the cost of existing power, that produced from wind or solar is by far the cheapest – often bidding into auctions at zero dollars, since the marginal cost of each watt-hour they produce is virtually nothing. ‘We should allow coal to get clean energy certificates’ As it happens, while it sounds perverse to let coal get clean energy certificates, this doesn’t seem like the worst idea being floated by the pro-coal commentariat. Under the proposed clean energy target, if the benchmark were set high enough to allow so-called new “high-efficiency, low-emissions” coal power plants to receive clean energy certificates, it wouldn’t incentivise one to be built. Such a plant is clearly not economical to build now and, if it just scraped into the proposed framework, it would receive so few certificates compared to cleaner energy that it wouldn’t change the economics. Indeed, even if it were set high enough to allow the cleaner existing coal power plants to receive clean energy certificates, all it would likely do is give a boost to gas and help encourage the dirtiest coal power plants to close earlier."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/jun/14/voters-prefer-low-emissions-target-to-carbon-trading-guardian-essential-poll","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-06-13T19:00:06Z","webTitle":"Voters prefer low emissions target to carbon trading – Guardian Essential poll","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/jun/14/voters-prefer-low-emissions-target-to-carbon-trading-guardian-essential-poll","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/jun/14/voters-prefer-low-emissions-target-to-carbon-trading-guardian-essential-poll","fields":{"headline":"Voters prefer low emissions target to carbon trading – Guardian Essential poll","bodyText":"Australian voters would back a new low emissions target over emissions trading as a policy to reduce carbon pollution, but are not sure about including “clean” coal in the mix, according to the latest Guardian Essential poll. The latest survey of 1,785 voters, which follows Tuesday night’s three-hour Coalition party room meeting in which significant concerns were ventilated about the Finkel review, also taps significant community concerns about the rising threat of terrorism in Australia. Seventy-four per cent of the sample said the threat level in Australia had increased over the past few years, and 46% believe the Turnbull government should be spending more on counter-terrorism measures. A new clean energy target is the centrepiece of the review of the national electricity market by Australia’s chief scientist, Alan Finkel, handed to the prime minister and the state premiers on Friday. While Coalition MPs spent Tuesday night arguing about the impact of the clean energy target on power prices in the biggest internal Coalition stoush about climate policy since 2009 – and the energy minister, Josh Frydenberg, said afterwards it was too soon to say whether the Coalition would ultimately adopt the policy – Australian voters seem sanguine about the idea. Forty-five per cent of the Guardian Essential sample preferred a low emissions target to carbon trading, while 20% endorsed an emissions intensity scheme. Thirty-six per cent said they didn’t know which option was best. The voters most likely to prefer a low emissions target were people aged 65+ (51%), Liberal/National voters (51%) and high-income earners. Greens voters preferred carbon trading to a target. Government conservatives, egged on by the Canberra-based lobby group representing the resources industry, are pushing to have high-efficiency coal included the new scheme, but the new poll suggests voters aren’t sure. Asked whether they thought coal generation with 100% capture and storage should be considered a “low emission” energy source under the proposed low emissions target, 27% of the sample agreed, 29% said no, and 44% of the sample weren’t sure. In an interview with Guardian Australia this week, Finkel said it would be “surprising” if governments went on to legislate a clean energy target that “incentivised” new coal-fired power stations. He also pointed out that modelling commissioned as part of the review did not predict any construction of new coal-fired power. “Under the modelling, none came in,” the chief scientist said. But with internal pressure mounting from conservatives, the prime minister used question time to insist Finkel had proposed a clean energy target which “does not penalise coal, [and] does not prohibit the construction of a coal-fired power station or indeed a gas-fired power station”. Turnbull said: “What he seeks to do there is to provide incentives for lower emission technologies including, but not exclusively, renewables.” Frydenberg repeated that sentiment after the internal debate at special party room meeting. “Dr Finkel has made it very clear he is not putting in place any prohibitions on coal or any form of generation capacity”. “He is putting in place incentives for lower emission generation. It is not a price on carbon or a tax on coal. Indeed, it has similarities to what John Howard put forward back in 2007”. Voters most likely to think coal should be in the mix were Coalition supporters (36%), men (33%) and older people. People most likely to have the contrary view were Greens voters (55%), people under 24 (37%), and South Australians (35%), with that state having a high proportion of wind energy. With the energy fight expected to drag on for many weeks as the government finalises its response to the Finkel review, this week’s Guardian Essential poll has Labor still ahead of the Coalition in the national political contest on the two party preferred measure, 52% to 48%. The gap between the major parties narrowed in the month following the May budget, but within the poll’s margin of error, which is 3%. This week’s two party preferred result was the same as last week. The apparent narrowing of the gap between the major parties has come at a time when terrorism has been firmly back in the headlines, both domestically and internationally. The survey asked voters whether they approved of the way Turnbull was handling the terror threat. Forty-seven per cent approved of the prime minister’s handling of the issue, down 9% since October 2015, and 24% disapproved, up 7%. The questions in 2015 were put to voters during the Turnbull honeymoon – shortly after he took the Liberal party leadership from Abbott. Voters most likely to approve of Turnbull’s handling of the issue were Liberal/National voters (68%) and people aged 65+ (61%). Men (51% approve) were also more likely to approve than women (45%). Interestingly, the group most likely to disapprove of the prime minister’s approach were voters signalling their intention to vote independent or other (38%), followed by Labor voters. Forty-six per cent thought the government should be spending more on anti-terrorism measures, which is up 7% from when the question was previously asked in March 2015, and 9% thought the government should be spending less (down 3%). Voters were asked about the balance between security and personal liberty. They were asked whether they thought there should be more restrictions on rights and freedom for some people so there could be more security for others – or whether they thought laws already went too far in restricting freedom. Fifty-four per cent thought there should be more restrictions on rights and freedom in an attempt to combat terrorism. Twelve per cent thought current restrictions went too far, and 19% thought they struck the right balance. People more inclined to support restrictions were older voters (79%), “other” party and independent voters (68%) and Liberal/National voters (66%). The cohort most likely to think the right balance is being struck were Greens voters (36%) and young people (29%). Concern from voters about the threat level was roughly the same as when questions were previously asked eight months ago. Voters most likely to think the terror threat had increased were older – 88% of 55-64 year olds, and 87% of over 65s – as well as Liberal/National voters (81%)."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/jun/13/tax-office-chief-michael-cranston-charged-with-two-counts-of-abuse-of-public-office","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-06-13T06:27:13Z","webTitle":"ATO official Michael Cranston resigns after being charged with abuse of public office","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/jun/13/tax-office-chief-michael-cranston-charged-with-two-counts-of-abuse-of-public-office","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/jun/13/tax-office-chief-michael-cranston-charged-with-two-counts-of-abuse-of-public-office","fields":{"headline":"ATO official Michael Cranston resigns after being charged with abuse of public office","bodyText":"The Australian Tax Office deputy commissioner Michael Cranston has resigned after been charged with two counts of abuse of public office for allegedly obtaining information and exercising influence to obtain a benefit for his son.

The US Open this week offers a record prize fund of $12m (£9.5m). One must look seriously hard at the PGA Tour’s schedule to find a tournament which does not bestow immediate millionaire status on the winner. And yet the feeling persists that golf is a sport from a bygone age, being left behind by those considered more trendy. Other obvious realities play a part; golf remains time-consuming, not always easily accessible and generally expensive. In the United States 23.8 million people are considered golfers. “You see two and a half million players enter the game this past year,” says Jay Monahan, the PGA Tour’s commissioner. “That’s the highest number on record, exceeding the 2.4 million in 2000 when Tiger Woods was at the top of his game. “We have 2.9 million juniors; that’s up 25% since 2011. You look at underneath that number, in 1995, 17% of those juniors were female. Now that’s 33%. So you are seeing growth at the junior level. I get the fact that there’s a lot of discussion on the health – and some of it is negative – but I think there are some really positive trends and storylines underneath it.” That negativity to which Monahan refers is more prevalent in the UK, where there are reportedly 4.5 million golfers and a steady rather than sharp annual drop. Partly linked to economic scenarios from 2008 onwards, clubs have shut down across the country. And many of those which remain have slashed entry costs in a desperate bid to pull in the generation which will take them into a new era. Basketball, volleyball and hockey feature regularly on school physical education curriculums whereas golf never does. Although impossible to measure, golf may suffer from historical and accurate perceptions of a discriminatory environment. A firm upside might yet be provided by Olympic participation, which was restored for golf in Rio last summer. “In terms of the golf clubs themselves, I challenge them,” says Keith Pelley, the European Tour’s chief executive. “I challenge them to think differently. I challenge them to look beyond the rules that have always been there and I think this is critical for the success of our game going forward. “There are always going to be clubs who stand above the rest but it is all those other golf courses that will succeed and become even more profitable if they engage more people. The way they are going to engage more people is by thinking outside the box. Let them in. What we don’t want to be is a sport for the elite.” Pelley personifies golf’s quest to remain relevant. The European Tour smartly recruited the Canadian from outside golf in 2015. That is not the way things tend to happen but it was deliberate; Pelley’s fresh eyes were necessary. “I remember during the interview process, talking about: ‘Are you willing to change? Are you willing to look at all facets of your business and be open to adaptation of any aspect of the game?’” he recalls. “They were emphatic that they were. If you aren’t willing to change, you run the risk of falling further and further behind the phenomenal experience that is Premier League football. “When you look at golf from a UK perspective, I thought it would be higher in the psyche than it is. That led me to the fact that we need to loosen some of the traditions and open up the game to a much younger generation. “People’s concentration is different from what it once was. For a 13- or 14-year-old to sit in front of a television for five hours watching golf is not realistic. For them to play golf two or three times a week for that long, with everything else they have at their disposal, is not realistic.” The European Tour has already experimented with a Golf Sixes team competition. Music has been heard blaring out from certain events, not that it has met with universal approval. “I still think walk-up music to the tee is a horrendous idea,” says the world No2, Rory McIlroy. More serious is where precisely tournament golf, while maintaining professional interest but attracting a bigger audience, may go. Pelley believes the likes of the Masters and Open Championship will always retain blue-chip status – and these events continue to expand – as more standard tour stops are subject to tweaks. “The other events run the risk, based on the saturation of content that’s out there, of being vulnerable,” Pelley adds. “That’s where creativity needs to come in. That’s where innovation needs to be at the forefront. I do see a world where there are 72-hole tournaments and there are 10-15 of them but all the others have a different format. A format that engages people in a completely different way.” But what of an improved spectator experience? “Play the actual hole that you are watching on your broadcast, right there,” says Pelley. “So if somebody makes a putt for an eagle on the 15th at Augusta, you can do it in your living room. It will happen, it’s going to happen. To be in the shoes of that professional, even just for a second, I do believe that is the future. “I think a stadium event will happen. Wouldn’t it be terrific to have an incredible video board where you have players on the pitch, so you can see every single shot by every single player. It would be a completely different consumption of the game. Maybe that’s where the six-hole games goes. Maybe it becomes stadium sport.” McIlroy might have an aversion to Rihanna blaring out at his work but he remains one of the most identifiable and appealing individuals in his sport. “Golf needs characters; look at Rickie Fowler, we need more people like that. Kids can relate to him,” he says. “I think we have to move with the times, moving accordingly with whatever technology is out there; be that virtual reality, live PGA Tour streaming via Twitter or whatever it may be. “I think people are getting sick and tired of watching tour rounds that are five, five-and-a-half hours long. I understand that, people don’t have the time. Speeding up the game is one of the most important things we need to do.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2017/jun/11/republic-ireland-austria-world-cup-qualifier-match-report","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-06-11T18:05:52Z","webTitle":"Jon Walters rescues point for Republic of Ireland against Austria","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/jun/11/republic-ireland-austria-world-cup-qualifier-match-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/jun/11/republic-ireland-austria-world-cup-qualifier-match-report","fields":{"headline":"Jon Walters rescues point for Republic of Ireland against Austria","bodyText":"Roy Keane had called for a war but what he got was bloody awful until, that is, Jon Walters stormed to Ireland’s rescue five minutes from time. The Irish had trailed since the 31st minute, when Martin Hinteregger struck for a depleted Austrian side who seemed on course to revive their World Cup qualification hopes by dealing a blow to those of their hosts, who were incoherent for much of this match. But then Ireland rallied, equalised and even forced the ball into the net a second time, only for the referee to disallow the goal for a supposed foul on the goalkeeper by Shane Duffy, much to the anger of Martin O’Neill. With Serbia and Wales also in the running Group D looks likely to go down to the wire and Ireland can take confidence from this demonstration of their ability to fight to the finish. Whatever else they lack, their determination is bottomless. No one personifies it better than Walters. “Jon’s not the quickest but he’s got a real knowledge of the game and a really great will,” O’Neill said. “He is totally invaluable to us.” Dublin looked a picture under a glowing sun but this match all but defaced it in the first half. With wayward passes, clunky touches and negligible imagination it was grisly viewing until Austria scored with a goal of incongruous quality. The visitors had offered a smidgin more neatness than the hosts in the opening half an hour but nothing that foreshadowed the artfulness of their breakthrough. It came from a corner delivered by David Alaba. Aleksandar Dragovic and Sebastian Prödl flummoxed the Irish defence by letting the ball run past them and over to Hinteregger near the penalty spot. He took one touch before firing past Darren Randolph. There was no immediate trace of an Irish riposte. Robbie Brady and Jeff Hendrick can usually be relied on to serve up a measure of creativity but both were sloppy, Brady ineffective from the right wing and Hendrick offering meagre invention in an advanced central role. The game was crying out for Wes Hoolahan, the 35-year-old on the bench. “I knew at half-time that we had left so many things behind and there was a determination in the second half to redress it,” said O’Neill, who made no personnel changes during the break but his team did emerge with more dynamism. The fragments of class still came from Austria, though. The visitors forged a chance to increase their lead when Alaba drove through midfield before flipping the ball wide to the dangerous Florian Kainz and charging into the box. Kainz’s low cross was fractionally in front of Alaba, who had to stretch as he shot from 10 yards and that affected his accuracy. O’Neill rejigged his team in the 55th minute, introducing Daryl Murphy up front alongside Walters and reassigning Brady to left-back in place of the substituted Stephen Ward. Ireland improved. They cranked up the intensity and delivered more and better balls into the box. For the first time Austria looked vulnerable. McClean rattled them further when he cut inside from the right and shot a couple of yards wide from the edge of the area. O’Neill cast on Hoolahan in the 71st minute and the little schemer almost created an equaliser within moments, delivering a wicked inswinging cross from the left that triggered such panic that Stefan Lainer almost slashed it into his own goal. The goalkeeper, Heinz Lindner, came to his rescue. Austria rode that storm and would have increased their lead if not for a fine save by Randolph. Just as the visitors sensed a victory, Walters struck. It was classic Walters, the striker marauding on to a punt by Randolph, outmuscling Dragovic and walloping the bouncing ball into the bottom corner from 18 yards. The crowd went wild and two minutes later they thought things had got even better when Duffy headed into the net from close range after a massive scramble in the Austrian goalmouth. But the Spanish referee, David Fernández Borbalán, reckoned there had been a shove on the goalkeeper. “We had a legitimate goal disallowed,” O’Neill said. “The referee was not to blame for our performance in the first half but I thought he was very poor indeed. The Austrian centre-back Prödl said on the pitch that, if it had been the other way round he would have been very disappointed.” The draw, at least, suited Ireland more than Austria."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"fashion/2017/jun/11/martine-rose-takes-high-fashion-outdoors-for-new-menswear-collection","type":"article","sectionId":"fashion","sectionName":"Fashion","webPublicationDate":"2017-06-11T22:10:56Z","webTitle":"Martine Rose takes high fashion outdoors for new menswear collection","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2017/jun/11/martine-rose-takes-high-fashion-outdoors-for-new-menswear-collection","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/fashion/2017/jun/11/martine-rose-takes-high-fashion-outdoors-for-new-menswear-collection","fields":{"headline":"Martine Rose takes high fashion outdoors for new menswear collection","bodyText":"Martine Rose’s show at London men’s fashion week took place at a climbing wall in Tottenham on Sunday night. It is testament to the buzz around the 37-year-old designer that the fashion crowd made the trip far out of their central London comfort zone. Rose is one of the most exciting talents in London menswear. Her label dates back to 2007, but after a hiatus she relaunched it on the catwalk in January. That show was also presented in Tottenham, at Seven Sisters Market. With an 80s take on workwear with silky shirts, Phil Oakley haircuts and tie pins, it was a hit and demonstrated that Rose was one to watch. She also designs for Balenciaga, a highlight of the Paris schedule. This collection continued on the theme of the everyday but moved the focus from work to leisure. The front row seats were made of crash mats, and the moulded climbing wall with colourful grips formed the backdrop. It was appropriate. Models, male and female, wore fleeces, cargo shorts, hoodies and wide jeans – outdoorsy clothes given a high fashion edge. The workwear that Rose proposed last season was also featured, with striped shirts, wide-legged trousers and blazers. These came in oversized proportions that changed them from banker-wear to something more suited to the kind of creatives in Rose’s milieu. “I started to look at subcultures in Toronto, Portland and Sydney – couriers and people doing outdoor sports,” Rose said at a preview of the collection. She was open about tapping up territory not usually part of the fashion vocabulary. “I was interested in traditionally uncool things like golf,” she said. “It’s the corporate man off duty, like a tech dad.” Of course, a trip to Millets wouldn’t be sufficient here. Rose mixed rambler-wear with rave staples, like cycling shorts and oversized sportswear. This was inspired by the photography of Trevor Hughes, and his pictures of the Toronto cycling and music scene in the 80s and 90s. Rose namechecked Steve Jobs as an inspiration and said that the corporate world she touched on previously remains fertile territory. “That bled through from last season,” she said. “I think it’s the idea of taking the ordinary and making it extraordinary.” Jeremy Corbyn – on his bicycle, wearing rainproof clothing – featured on the “save the date” for this show. The kind of items usually reserved for biking on a rainy day or for the camping backpack gained an unlikely endorsement on Sunday night but they fit into a wider trend. Identified as “gorpcore” by New York magazine in May, outdoorsy pursuits – or at least the outdoorsy wardrobe – is becoming fashionable. Young urbanites are swapping glamour for fleeces, cagoules and hiking boots – not for practicality but as a fashion statement. Other designers at London men’s fashion week have explored similar territory. Cottweiler’s collection, shown on Saturday, had models toting square water carriers more usually seen on a camp site. With her studio close to the climbing centre, Rose wants to keep things in her community, using a local roti restaurant as caterers. “It’s really important to the brand,” she said. “I’m really excited to bring people to Tottenham again.” London men’s fashion week finishes on Monday, with Craig Green and Vivienne Westwood on the schedule. Across the four-day event, a genderless, artistic and anything goes aesthetic has dominated. Designers including Charles Jeffrey, Edward Crutchley and the duo Art School had male models wearing ornate dresses, and there have been performances from dancers on their catwalks. The focus will now shift to Florence, where Off White and JW Anderson will show collections."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/may/27/manchester-our-values-prevail-speak-up-for-them","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-05-27T17:10:33Z","webTitle":"After Manchester, our values will only prevail if we speak up for them | Nick Cohen","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/may/27/manchester-our-values-prevail-speak-up-for-them","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/may/27/manchester-our-values-prevail-speak-up-for-them","fields":{"headline":"After Manchester, our values will only prevail if we speak up for them","bodyText":"Communities are “coming together, we will not allow them to divide us”, said Sir Richard Lees, the leader of Manchester city council, as my home town began a struggle to come to terms with an atrocity designed to provoke retaliation. “We are strong,” said Andy Burnham, the mayor of Greater Manchester. “Our values, our country and our way of life will always prevail,” said the prime minister. Before I go further, I should say the politicians were broadly right. The stereotype of warm northerners is overdone. Mancunians can be as vicious as anyone else. But a Londoner does not have to spend too much time in Manchester to notice a convivial willingness to talk to strangers that is absent from the capital. As much as the pictures of dead girls, as much as the relief at finding that my niece, an Ariana Grande fan, had decided to give the concert a miss, the stories of taxi drivers giving free rides to the injured, the lawyers offering free advice and the cafe owners proffering free meals to the emergency services floored me. Manchester is not a city being torn apart by hatred. Nor is Britain a country on the edge of civil war. Online jihadis celebrated the bomber as a “lion”, but there were no blood-maddened celebrations here. Donald Trump in the US and Marine Le Pen in France would have exploited the mass murder to arouse ethnic and sectarian hatred. Our far right does not include actual and potential presidents. Instead, we have Allison Pearson from the Telegraph calling for internment and Katie Hopkins gabbling about a “final solution” to the Muslim problem like a Devon Eva Braun. These are marginal figures, for all fuss made about them. But warm words about “our way of life prevailing” rub up against scratchy questions about what our “life” is now and which way it is taking. Talk to anti-Islamist Muslim writers and activists and they are worried. They don’t see “diversity” and “community”, those warmest of 21st century words, as synonyms but opposites. No one knows the level of Islamic State support in Britain, they say, but with MI5 monitoring 3,000 suspects it isn’t negligible. Beyond the violent and potentially violent lie fractured and isolated ghettos, where large numbers are prey to religious demagogues. Shiraz Maher, of King’s College London, points me to a paradox. If you measure success in business, the professions and politics, Muslims do better in Britain than in any other European country. But those who get on have little influence. Those who are left behind listen to Islamists who tell them that the west is decadent. Rabbil Sikdar, a liberal Muslim friend and Labour activist, is equally bleak. Many Muslims just don’t see Britain as their home, he wrote after the attack. “It’s why they’re more obsessed with Palestine than the NHS and why integration of Muslims is so poor. We culturally isolate ourselves because to integrate is to apparently lose your Muslim identity and become western.” Fiyaz Mughal runs the Tell Mama civil rights group. As it monitors attacks on Muslims you might have thought its enemies were all of the Katie Hopkins variety. But its activists are as likely to be denounced by Islamists at Muslim Engagement and Development (Mend) for being “phony” Muslims as they are to be denounced by the Telegraph. Their crime, their break with Muslim values, is allying with Jews and gays in the fight against prejudice. Mughal, too, tells me has no doubt that Mend and groups like it are winning the battle for Muslim minds. They have certainly won the battle to control Labour policy. Labour either does not know that extremists want to stop anti-extremism policies or knows but does not care. It is promising to review the Prevent anti-extremism initiative. Burnham went further last year and demanded that it be scrapped. Think of that. The mayor of a city that was to be attacked by a suicide bomber damning as “toxic” a strategy that aims to stop Muslim teenagers being groomed online by Islamic State and white teenagers being groomed by neo-Nazis. It’s as if he had condemned “toxic” social workers for trying to keep children from paedophiles. On the other side of the coin, the comforting notion that anti-Muslim bigotry is confined to a handful of click-seeking media whores does not hold. Look at the Conservative press or read the output of Tory thinktanks and you can suspect that liberal conservatism barely exists today. I accept that absence of evidence is not evidence of absence. But if you watch for the arguments that aren’t made and the fights that aren’t picked you will notice that mainstream conservatives greet anti-Muslim bigotry with silence. There is no debate on the right about the dangers of toppling over into the sectarian politics of a Trump or Le Pen. On racial hatred as much as on Brexit you can wait forever for a liberal Tory dog that never barks. Beyond that, and as destructively, the Conservatives have no plans to slow the growth of faith-based schools, which segregate children by religion and, more often that not, race. The cause of secular education, like support for the single market and opposition to anti-Muslim bigotry, is an idea whose time appears to have gone on the right. I don’t wish to sound alarmist. There is no conveyor belt that picks up believers in reactionary religion and transports them to religious violence. You can spend your life believing women should be second-class citizens and homosexuality and apostasy are crimes that in an ideal Islamic state deserve the death sentence and never harm anyone apart from your wife and children. Equally, desegregating the school system is a modest reform, not a panacea. As for the silence of mainstream conservatives, I am sure that if Theresa May is re-elected she will not call for a Muslim travel ban. But if you believe ideas have power, then you must believe in the power of bad ideas to harm when they are left uncontested. Liberal Muslims suffer from the widespread belief that to be “liberal is a contradiction of the faith”, as Rabbil Sikdar put it. With honourable exceptions, white liberals prefer the safe life and hold that it is “Islamophobic” to help their cause and argue their case. Liberal conservatives say nothing because they fear their party leadership won’t support them and know the rightwing press will denounce them. They too cede the field without striking a blow. “Our values will prevail,” says Theresa May. No they won’t. Not if no one is prepared to say what they are, let alone prepared to fight for them.• Comments will be opened later"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"sport/2017/may/26/wasps-danny-cipriani-better-brain-premiership-final","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-05-26T21:00:09Z","webTitle":"Wasps’ Danny Cipriani takes ‘better brain’ into Premiership final | Michael Aylwin","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/may/26/wasps-danny-cipriani-better-brain-premiership-final","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/may/26/wasps-danny-cipriani-better-brain-premiership-final","fields":{"headline":"Wasps’ Danny Cipriani takes ‘better brain’ into Premiership final","bodyText":"It is a common storyline in sport, and it is common in life, legend and literature. The brilliant youth; the effortless, vertiginous rise; the prosaic, enraging restrictions; the exile and fall. And then – well, it depends on our hero. Icarus fell straight into the sea, but Danny Cipriani came again. As he prepares to step out at Twickenham for Wasps’ first tilt at the Premiership title since the final days of the Lawrence Dallaglio era in 2008, he is better than ever, more measured, more in tune with those around him, more of a fly-half. “I probably understand the game a lot better now,” he says. “I feel like I’ve got a better brain for it as a fly-half.” The truth is, when he burst into Dallaglio’s great Wasps side as a teenager, he was less a fly-half than a wandering maverick, a player without portfolio. It was his misfortune, perhaps, to begin his rise just as Wasps’ dynasty was about to enter its decline, but he sparkled then as a concession to the unorthodox. In his first season, which culminated in a second Heineken Cup win for that generation, in 2007, the No10 shirt was the long-held property of Alex King, that most consummate of fly-halfs, so Cipriani played most of the season as a brilliant counterattacking full-back. But even when he assumed King’s shirt after the latter’s departure the following season, he continued to burnish his reputation with brilliance in the outside channels. Wasps’ policy was to withdraw him from the frontline when they were defending, and when turnover ball was whipped wide there he was to exploit disjointed opponents with acceleration that was superior to most of the best wingers. When Wasps won the last of their titles, in 2008, he was voted the players’ player of the season. He had won man of the match on his England debut too. He was 20 years old. “I just thought every year was going to be like that. But it’s been a long time since then.” He did not play in the Premiership final that year because of the horrific ankle injury he suffered in the semi-final. And so the trouble began. Wasps’ form fell away as the team broke up; he angered team-mates with his reluctance to tackle; he infuriated the new England coach, one Martin Johnson, who was English rugby personified in a way Cipriani was not. The uncharitable accused him of thinking himself above his mortal team-mates. Perhaps a fairer assessment is that he was rebelling against the straitjacket culture of English rugby, by which he felt blissfully – or perhaps torturously – unrestrained. So he left on what he describes as “a two-year gap year” with the Melbourne Rebels, where he befriended, among others, Kurtley Beale, now his team-mate, albeit missing from Saturday afternoon’s final because of injury. But the brilliance remained beset by the controversy, even if the boy might have been learning. For he chose as his next stop Sale and a mentor in Steve Diamond, as earthy as Cipriani had been flamboyant. “My learning curve was really at Sale,” he acknowledges, “becoming a traditional fly-half but still learning how to manipulate defences.” He played some of the best rugby of his career in the four years that followed, less the individual showman, more the master puppeteer. His defence improved, as did his goalkicking. On form alone he should have made England’s World Cup squad in 2015, but the dynamic had shifted. Owen Farrell and George Ford had emerged, steeped in the virtues of northern modesty that Cipriani was embracing too late. It seems his England chances have passed now, not that he has given up hope. “If it happens, it happens. If it doesn’t, I can’t really control that. It’s not like they’re going too badly right now. Everyone still wants to play for England, don’t they – that’s the pinnacle of the game.” When his first club came calling last summer, Cipriani could not resist the move back home. Now armed with the wisdom lacking the first time he was there, he found himself among a new breed of attack-minded Wasps. If he forced himself into the Wasps team of the previous decade, this one has reached out to welcome him home. The fit is snug. “Talent-wise, I would say this team is better, man for man, but it was the experience of the other one [that made them stand out]. We are hopefully going to see this team grow into an even greater team than the one that was before.” If Cipriani is anything to go by, experience will only make this dazzling Wasps side better. The defeat by Leinster in the Champions Cup quarter-final, in which Cipriani himself suffered a rare dip in form, will qualify as one significant lesson, but they recovered to finish the season top of the table, the most prolific try-scorers the Premiership has ever known. There is something unusually stable about their policy of all-out attack, so often the preserve of the inconsistent or the desperate. They will no doubt turn it on again at Twickenham, led by a boy who once flew so high so fast, but now has settled at last among the flock."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"film/2017/may/26/helen-fielding-says-bridget-jones-books-are-not-anti-feminist","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2017-05-26T19:24:32Z","webTitle":"Helen Fielding says Bridget Jones books are not anti-feminist","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/may/26/helen-fielding-says-bridget-jones-books-are-not-anti-feminist","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2017/may/26/helen-fielding-says-bridget-jones-books-are-not-anti-feminist","fields":{"headline":"Helen Fielding says Bridget Jones books are not anti-feminist","bodyText":"Bridget Jones novelist Helen Fielding has taken a swipe at “shallow” critics who call her books anti-feminist. The writer was in Hay-on-Wye for the 30th edition of the literary festival and admitted the accusation was one that irritated. “Number one, we are not a minority,” she said. “If we can’t laugh at ourselves, we haven’t got very far at being equal, have we? “I think it’s worrying in the first place that people would think a book about a woman laughing about her foibles is not feminist. It is a mark of strength to be able to laugh at yourself, not weakness. “Humour is a very powerful tool as we all know for getting through difficult times.” Fielding’s four Bridget Jones books, helped by three films, have sold around 40m copies worldwide. But they have faced criticism that the Jones character is too much of a victim, too in thrall to men. The Guardian writer Suzanne Moore has called it ‘anti-feminist’ fiction. “The humour that comes from her rhetoric about being a strong independent woman is always undermined by her pseudo neurosis – waiting for the man to ring or, now she has discovered social media, to ping.” Fielding, who was born in Yorkshire and now lives in Los Angeles, told a hugely supportive audience at Hay: “If I may, the accusation of it being not feminist is a little shallow.” The Jones books began as a column in the Independent in 1995, charting the chaotic life of a 30-something singleton in London. Fielding, whose latest Jones book last month won the Bollinger Everyman Wodehouse prize for comic fiction, admitted that she had regularly denied the character was based on her but could now admit it. “I was just embarrassed because I was trying to write serious novels ... I was very shy about the connection.” Although, she stressed, it was a hugely exaggerated version of herself: “I have never got pregnant by two men. I have never eaten more than 30,000 calories in one day.” Among the serious novels Fielding had been writing was one about the cultural divide in the Caribbean. “It was so boring,” she said. She had also tried her hand at Mills &amp; Boon, submitting a doctor-nurse novel called Fires of Zanzibar set in a refugee camp. It was turned down. “I really did put a lot of effort into it and they rejected it and sent me a letter saying ‘neither your characters nor your story are up to the standard demanded by Mills and Boon’. I was really upset and didn’t write anything for a few years.” Fielding said she found the unpublished novel recently and read her last line about the doctor pulling the trembling, questioning nurse against him roughly and before delivering the line: “It’s all right, it isn’t a snake.” “I think I can see why they rejected it,” she admitted to Hay."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"artanddesign/2017/may/26/raphael-drawings-oxford-judy-chicago-beatles-mural-liverpool-andrew-luka-zimmerman-the-week-in-art","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2017-05-26T18:55:06Z","webTitle":"Raphael's drawings, Judy Chicago's Beatles mural and Istanbul street dogs – the week in art","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2017/may/26/raphael-drawings-oxford-judy-chicago-beatles-mural-liverpool-andrew-luka-zimmerman-the-week-in-art","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2017/may/26/raphael-drawings-oxford-judy-chicago-beatles-mural-liverpool-andrew-luka-zimmerman-the-week-in-art","fields":{"headline":"Raphael's drawings, Judy Chicago's Beatles mural and Istanbul street dogs – the week in art","bodyText":"Exhibition of the week Raphael: The Drawings You can’t get much better than this.

At one end of the ground, a sea of red and white will offer a perfect demonstration of the positives that can be achieved when supporters have a say in the running of their club. Facing the followers of Exeter City, however, the swaths of empty seats in the Blackpool section will tell a sorry story about what happens when football fans are pushed too far. The League Two play-off final pits together one supporter-owned club and another whose disenfranchised fans are so fed up with the people in charge that many of them are boycotting Blackpool’s biggest match of the season. For Blackpool fans who have made the painful choice to stay away from Wembley, winning promotion to League One is of secondary importance compared with the onerous task of getting the Oyston family out of Bloomfield Road. There is an argument they ought to have put their protests to one side for a day. Yet for those who have vowed never to give another penny to the Oystons, whose stewardship of the club has caused so much anger, purchasing a ticket would have been akin to abandoning their cause. Their relationship with Karl Oyston, the chairman, and his father, Owen, was damaged beyond repair as soon as the pair launched libel cases against dissenting supporters. In better times, the queue from the ticket office would have snaked around Bloomfield Road. Blackpool took about 37,000 fans to Wembley when they beat Cardiff City in the Championship play-off final in 2010 and about 30,000 when they lost to West Ham two years later. They have sold about 5,000 this time. “There’ll be plenty of Oyston Out scarves in the ground,” Andy Higgins, a member of the Blackpool Supporters’ Trust, says. “Most of us think that if you’re going to go and finance that family, who are intent on suing supporters, you’re financing litigation. That’s when they went too far. Litigation against your own fans is beyond the pale.” While the BST has been frustrated in its attempts to host a big screen event, at least it is likely to be a busy afternoon for the pubs in Blackpool. But there will be mixed emotions when the game begins. Some supporters want Blackpool to win despite the acrimony. Others believe that victory would strengthen the Oystons’ position. “That creates division even before you get to the people who support the team and in some cases the owners,” Tim Fielding, the BST’s honorary vice-president, says. “But the best interest of the club is served by the owners selling up. I don’t think promotion will facilitate that. “I spoke to Owen when he spoke to fans at the Blackpool Hilton last summer. I repeatedly asked him to stop suing fans and consult with the BST. And they won’t do any of it, so some people will not give them any more money. There aren’t exceptions made for Wembley. “It’s taken a lot to radicalise us and the Oystons have managed it. We’re seen as the vanguard of the protest movement about fit and proper owners. We work closely with Leyton Orient, Charlton and Coventry.” How the BST would love to emulate Exeter’s model. It has been 14 years since the Exeter City Supporters’ Trust took over, following relegation from the Football League under owners who had left the club on the brink of financial ruin, and Paul Tisdale, Exeter’s manager, calls the trust a “bubble in a rotten industry”. Arsène Wenger is the only manager working in the English game to have been in the job for longer than Tisdale. Exeter were bottom in November but Tisdale was given time to revive his team. Martin Weiler, the ECST chairman, says: “We’ve steadily had over 3,000 members and that’s withstood peaks and troughs in form. What we benefit from is an enormous outpouring of volunteering. For the semi-finals, we had a whole team of volunteers who came in to be trained in ticketing. We have a pop-up store in the middle of Exeter selling merchandise for the final. That spirit is worth an awful lot financially but culturally it reinforces the sense of ownership. It’s our club. Why wouldn’t we help it?” Blackpool’s fans are forced to help their club in different ways. The BST protests outside every home game and that can lead to disputes with supporters heading into the ground. There have also been issues online. “There are all these made-up user names on social media who will do anything to vilify the trust,” Higgins says. “Nobody knows who these people are, coming out and saying they witnessed verbal abuse and intimidation.” The BST can only look at Exeter and wonder. “Scenarios like this have put paid to the argument that football fans know nothing,” Fielding says. “It’s about time there’s a radical overhaul in this country and fans were in the boardroom.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"us-news/2017/may/26/the-resistance-now-new-york-new-thunderbolts","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-05-26T19:23:33Z","webTitle":"The Resistance Now: New York and New Hampshire are 'thunderbolts'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/may/26/the-resistance-now-new-york-new-thunderbolts","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/may/26/the-resistance-now-new-york-new-thunderbolts","fields":{"headline":"The Resistance Now: New York and New Hampshire are 'thunderbolts'","bodyText":"Body-slamming fails to swing Montana special election Activists transformed Rob Quist from a long-shot candidate to a legitimate challenger in Montana, but in the end not even an assault charge could stop Republican Greg Gianforte from winning the state’s special-election. As you may have heard, Gianforte attacked Guardian reporter Ben Jacobs in Bozeman, Montana on Wednesday night. Democrats were hopeful the unprovoked “body-slam” would turn voters away from Gianforte, but he won 50% of the vote to Quists 44% in Thursday’s election. Quist was endorsed by Bernie Sanders and his election campaign was propelled by progressive activists, who made calls and fundraised on his behalf. But in the end it wasn’t enough to stop Gianforte, a businessman and major donor to Montana’s creationist Dinosaur and Fossil museum. ‘A thunderbolt of resistance’ The resistance movement had better luck in New Hampshire and New York this week, when two Democratic women won long-time Republican state legislature seats on Tuesday night. In New Hampshire Edie DesMarais became the first Democrat ever elected to represent her New Hampshire house seat, Vox reported. In New York, Christine Pellegrino won the 9th assembly district – which voted overwhelmingly for Donald Trump in November – with 58% of the vote. “This is a thunderbolt of resistance,” Pellegrino, who was a Bernie Sanders delegate at the Democratic National Convention, told Newsday. “This is for all the supporters and voters who understand a strong progressive agenda is the way forward in New York.” Pellegrino’s campaign was aided by hundreds of progressive volunteers and, according to the New York Times, “may embolden Democrats in New York to put more money and resources in races across the board, or possibly to encourage neophytes to run”. Fight for $15 team up with anti-Trumpers to target McDonalds Thousands of people marched in Chicago on Tuesday night ahead of McDonalds’ annual shareholders’ meeting, branding the company “the Donald Trump of corporations” as they sought to pressure the Trump administration to increase the federal minimum wage. The Fight for $15 campaign aims to more than double that wage from the current $7.25 minimum. Chicago alderman Carlos Ramirez Rosa told the crowd that taxpayers are forced to pick up the slack for McDonald’s low wages – as its workers often rely on food stamps and other services to supplement their income. “Every time McDonald’s fails to provide health care and child care, who do they turn to?” he asked. “You! McDonald’s, it’s time for you to pay your fair share.” New Jersey congressman who “outed” activist faces progressive challenger Rodney Frelinghuysen, the Republican congressman who wrote to an activist’s employer to identify her as a “ringleader” of protests against him, has his first 2018 Democratic challenger. Jack Gebbia, a former member of the US Army National Guard who the Daily Record reported would work “with Congress on a single-payer [healthcare] system”, announced his campaign on Tuesday. Activists have been holding weekly “Fridays with Frelinghuysen” demonstrations outside the congressman’s office for months. Frelinghuysen, who has not held an in-person town hall in four years, voted in favor of the Republican healthcare bill that the Congressional Budget Office predicts would see 23m people lose medical coverage over 10 years.

Borosage says the American Health Care Act’s unpopularity – combined with polling that shows 60% of Americans think the government should be responsible for ensuring healthcare for all – presents Democrats with a rare opportunity to pursue a single payer system.

But now the paintings and photographs that have hung on the walls of Mario Testino’s house and studio – and shaped his artistic vision since the 1980s – are to be auctioned. Four hundred works by artists such as Wolfgang Tillmans, Gilbert &amp; George, Sterling Ruby and Nan Goldin, which Testino has collected for three decades, are to be sold to raise money for Museo Mate, the art gallery the fashion photographer set up in his native Lima. The collection offers an insight into the works that Testino chose to surround himself with as he started out as a photographer when he arrived in London in 1976 with a limited knowledge of art. Testino, 62, describes the collection as a “a document of my time, of my eye, of the people I believe in”. It also appears to reflect of the globetrotting nature of his career, with artists from across 45 different countries represented. Testino said he would make it his mission, whenever he traveled, to visit artists, studios and galleries to hunt out creativity in any form that caught his eye. He added that beauty had driven much of what he was drawn to buying, as well as works that changed the way he saw the world. “In the art world you probably can’t mention that word [beauty], because it’s not interesting or not deep enough,” said Testino. “But I’m just always amazed by it.” The first picture that he bought, which is included in the sale, was a portrait of the actor Vivien Leigh by the surrealist photographer Angus McBean. Testino’s collection boasts works from some of the biggest names in contemporary art, a testament not to deep pockets but to him buying works by artists such as Richard Prince, Tillmans and Ruby early in their careers, before they became commercially sought after. The work expected to fetch the highest price is Ruby’s SP114, a painting inspired by graffiti in Los Angeles. It estimated to sell for between £600,000 and £800,000. “I was so amazed that someone could be so random in his choice of materials, in his proportions, in his work, but that it still had such a power to draw me to it,” said Testino. The photographer has also collaborated with several of those he collected, including Cecily Brown, Paul McCarthy and Urs Fischer. Speaking about another key lot, Prince’s 1993 photograph Untitled (Girlfriend), which depicts a naked woman splayed out suggestively on a motorcycle, Testino said: “Richard Prince is somebody who has influenced me a lot. The idea of appropriation for me was a very new thing, because I’ve always been quite respectful about other people’s property, but what I’ve realised is that he made us look at things that we weren’t looking at properly and challenging us to look at things differently.” Oliver Barker of the auction house Sotheby’s described it as a “really vibrant collection”. He added: “It’s one that is punctuated with inspirational works but equally inspirational friendships with the artists who created them as well, so that’s the special element for me. His eye as a collector is as dynamic and ultimately natural as it is with him as a photographer.” Testino hung the works in his west London studio as well as his homes in London and Los Angeles. “Look at the Wolfgang Tillmans photographs, some of them can be very edgy but also exquisitely beautiful, and there are elements of that which have clearly seeped into Testino’s work,” said Barker. While Testino admitted it was heartbreaking to part with many of these images, he said his determination to develop Museo Mate was now his priority. He is hoping the auction will raise £8m towards the project, which he set up in 2012 as a space to bring Peruvian artists and culture to worldwide attention."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/may/27/observer-sudoku","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2017-05-27T23:01:40Z","webTitle":"Observer sudoku","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/may/27/observer-sudoku","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/may/27/observer-sudoku","fields":{"headline":"Observer sudoku","bodyText":"Fill the grid using the numbers 1 to 9.

Roddy and Marion MacLeod said Eilidh had been a loving sister, without whom their family was at a loss. “Eilidh loved nothing more than spending time with those she loved, both family and friends alike,” they said in a statement released on Friday night. “She loved socialising, whether through social media or down on the beaches of both Barra and Vatersay. Her love of music was unsurpassed and she enjoyed her time playing, travelling and competing in the Pipe Bands immensely.” Their daughter and her friend Laura MacIntyre, 15, travelled to Monday night’s concert together from the island of Barra, in the Outer Hebrides. Their families made desperate appeals when the girls failed to get in touch after the explosion at Manchester Arena, which left 22 dead and dozens injured. Eilidh’s parents said the pair were “so excited” about the trip. “But, what should have been the perfect ending to a fantastic trip, ended so tragically. Laura was found in hospital with serious injuries while it was confirmed on Thursday that Eilidh was among the dead. The friends were pupils at Castlebay community school where pupils and staff have been left in shock. The MacLeods said they were thinking of Laura and her family and were praying that she makes a full recovery. “As a family, we would also like to offer our support and condolences to all the other innocent victims who have been needlessly killed in this attack; and to the survivors in hospitals around Manchester,” they said “Losing Eilidh is undoubtedly the most difficult time of our lives and we ask that the media please respect our privacy during this time.” Laura’s family described the 15-year-old as “strong-willed and a fighter” and said she was receiving the best care in hospital in Manchester. Both families thanked emergency services for their work and expressed their gratitude for the many messages of support they have had from around the world. In a police statement on Thursday, the MacIntyre family added: “Our hearts and minds have been with Eilidh’s family since we heard their news.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"fashion/2017/may/27/millenial-influencers-new-stars-web-advertising-marketing-luxury-brands","type":"article","sectionId":"fashion","sectionName":"Fashion","webPublicationDate":"2017-05-27T23:05:41Z","webTitle":"Millennial ‘influencers’ who are the new stars of web advertising","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2017/may/27/millenial-influencers-new-stars-web-advertising-marketing-luxury-brands","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/fashion/2017/may/27/millenial-influencers-new-stars-web-advertising-marketing-luxury-brands","fields":{"headline":"Millennial ‘influencers’ who are the new stars of web advertising","bodyText":"Seven years ago, Chiara Ferragni was a fledgling 23-year-old fashion blogger, studying law at university in Milan. She never finished her degree, but now lives in a $3.5m Los Angeles mansion packed with antiques, and spends her days travelling the world in midriff-revealing tops, Gucci sweatshirts, cut-off jeans and a collection of Louis Vuitton. How do we know this? Every day, the “Blonde Salad” shares images of her gilded lifestyle with her 9.6 million followers on Instagram, making her one of the cult celebrities of the social media world. Unlike Taylor Swift, Beyoncé et al, who have all made their names elsewhere and maintain fanbases on the photo-sharing platform, Ferragni has found fame and fortune solely by publishing photographs of herself wearing a variety of designer ensembles in a range of glamorous locations. Now worth a reputed $12m, with a line of branded shoes selling at up to $500 a pair, and a contract with Pantene as a global ambassador, Ferragni is a role model to a generation of digital natives who have established a viable career as social media “influencers”. On her 30th birthday earlier this month, her boyfriend, Italian rapper Fedez, proposed on stage in Verona, singing a song dedicated to her at a concert broadcast live to their home nation. Almost one million fans “liked” the Instagram video of the moment. That same day, almost half a million clicked the heart symbol below an image of her in a black mini dress, featuring the hashtag #ysl, while 700,000 followers “liked” another image Ferragni shared, showing her next to a vast 30th birthday cake emblazoned with the Leading Hotels of the World logo, with the hashtags #leadinghotelsoftheworld, #LHWtraveler and #kempinskivenice. To those unfamiliar with the machinations of social media, it is highly likely Ferragni had a commercial arrangement with these luxury brands, keen to tap into an audience that wants to emulate her lifestyle. She is not alone in utilising her position as a social media star with a loyal and highly engaged following. Earlier this month, 17-year-old Amanda Steele shared images of herself on the red carpet at the Cannes film festival, hanging out with Hollywood A-listers Jake Gyllenhaal and Tilda Swinton. The YouTube beauty vlogger, who shares make-up tips under the “MakeupbyMandy24” handle, was flown out to the French Riviera, dressed and made up, and given tickets to the premiere of Okja courtesy of Christian Dior – all in return for a caption shared with her 2.8 million followers that read: “Thank you sooooo much @diormakeup for treating me like a princess!!” In just a few years, the power of blogs and platforms such as Instagram has created a new marketing genre that has seen brands investing heavily in collaborations with the big names in the online space. Beca Alexander, founder and president of the social media casting and management agency Socialyte Collective, represents about 100 influencers, each with between 30,000 and 2 million followers. “One of our top influencers did about $1m last year and the average for those on our books is around $200,000 a year,” says the digital entrepreneur from her New York office. “There are a variety of ways they earn that revenue and we work on strategies that best suit the individual style and audience of each one. Some might focus on promoting as many brands and products as possible – but always being aware of the natural synergy with their own ‘brand’, so it feels authentic – while others have contracts with a curated range of brands to work on exclusive long-term campaigns.” Alexander, a former fashion news blogger who takes 10% commission from her portfolio of clients, founded her business seven years ago and has seen double-digit annual growth and a predicted 2.5 times rise in turnover this year. While women dominate the influencer space, she has also established a reputation for nurturing a number of male stars, such as her most successful client, Adam Gallagher, whose elegant, well-travelled lifestyle has won him a lucrative long-term contract with Armani fragrance. When you get to the top tier of influencers, they go to great lengths to portray the perfect image online, often recruiting a retinue of still-life and style photographers, make-up artists, stylists, assistants and editors to support the burgeoning business of being a brand in their own right. Many have a signature style to their posts, using specific filters or a trademark pose, but the key, says Alexander, is to remember who your audience is and retain an authenticity that means they remain engaged with your output. And you don’t have to have a mega-following to earn money from social media: companies are spending up to $1.5bn on Instagram marketing, says Thomas Rankin of Dash Hudson, who matches influencers with brands. Even users with 5,000 followers can attract $250 for a product post or endorsement if they have the right audience. Alexander developed a programme two years ago known as “product bombing”, whereby a co-ordinated campaign saw numerous, carefully selected micro-influencers paid to talk about a new product at a specified time, thus saturating the social media space within the target demographic. “That worked really well, and created huge awareness and demand, seeing stock sellout rapidly,” she says. However, the speed of change within the tech world and the evolution of algorithms to change the user experience means this approach isn’t as effective today. Instagram has recently changed the way consumers see posts, from a simple chronological feed, guaranteeing a user would see all posts in the order they appear, to a more nebulous feed based on the user’s individual engagement with those they follow. Currently worth around $1.5m, Julia Engel’s pastel-tinted “Gal meets glam” feed is brimming with high fashion and has 1.1 million subscribers. She generates revenue using the popular app LIKEtoKNOW.it, which sends followers direct to websites selling the clothes: if they buy, she gets a commission. She has also collaborated with #AmExPlatinum in highly stylised posts that convey the perceived luxury lifestyle promoted by the financial services brand. Each one carries a carefully worded caption and the #ad tag, defining the post as a piece of paid-for advertising. This boundary between independent editorial posts and those that have been paid for in some way is one that is blurred in this new era of social media marketing. “We have no issue with social influencers working with brands, as long as consumers aren’t misled,” says Guy Parker, chief executive of the Advertising Standards Authority, which is working with the Federal Trade Commission in the US and the newly formed International Council of Advertising Self-Regulation to develop some kind of oversight of influencer marketing. “We define advertising as a tweet, vlog, blog or Instagram post where the influencer has been paid and there has been some control over the content. We therefore expect the post to have #ad on it in a prominent position, not buried in 30 other hashtags, but in the first three lines of the caption, so it isn’t hidden to followers. It’s not fair to consumers to expect them to play detective and deduce whether something is an ad or not. “Many millennials believe this isn’t necessary as they claim to be able to see whether content is ‘sponsored’, but we believe it is imperative to protect consumers who aren’t that savvy, and ensure they know.” Callum McCahon, strategy director at the social media agency Born Social, says the industry needs to be self-regulating, and that Instagram must take some responsibility for protecting consumers using their platform. “Users scroll through feeds fast and are trained to skip past hashtags. I believe Instagram needs to have its own mandatory labelling system for a ‘paid-for’ post, which Facebook – which owns Instagram - has launched recently as branded content.” There is no doubt that a generation of style-conscious entrepreneurs are making a good living – in some cases a fortune – by building their own personal brands online with fan bases to rival many established global businesses. The challenge will be for newcomers to join a crowded market, and for those with a substantial following to keep them loyal. “The reason a brand is using an influencer is the trusting relationship they have with their followers,” says McCahon. “When it’s done properly it is a very effective method of building a brand and selling product.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"sport/2017/may/26/leeds-warrington-super-league-match-report","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-05-26T21:03:05Z","webTitle":"Matt Parcell shines as Leeds storm to clinical victory over Warrington","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/may/26/leeds-warrington-super-league-match-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/may/26/leeds-warrington-super-league-match-report","fields":{"headline":"Matt Parcell shines as Leeds storm to clinical victory over Warrington","bodyText":"There have been many moments already this season to suggest Leeds and Warrington are on different paths – this was perhaps the most conclusive of them all. A year ago, it was Leeds toiling at the wrong end of Super League while Warrington pressed ahead for major honours, finishing with the League Leaders’ Shield and appearances in both major finals. There is a way to go yet before Leeds can reach any of those milestones, but the annus horribilis that was 2016 is slowly being cast further into the back of everyone’s minds at the Rhinos. This year has been much more like the Leeds of old – and how fitting it was that in their biggest ever Super League victory against Warrington, some of their old guard stole the show. The captain, Danny McGuire, was magnificent and he was ably supported by fellow veterans Rob Burrow and Jamie Jones-Buchanan, both of whom scored tries in this comprehensive victory. But there is also a nod to the future in this Leeds team – Matt Parcell looks a fine acquisition since arriving from the NRL, to name but one example. “It was clinical and the further the game went on, the better we got,” said the Leeds coach Brian McDermott, whose side moved up to third following Hull’s defeat to Leigh. “We need to take a lot of credit for the second half, I’m really pleased.” Warrington, who remain in the top eight, had started to piece their season together of late but this felt like a major step backwards. They actually dominated possession early in the contest but came away with nothing to show for it – and Leeds ultimately made them pay. By half-time the Rhinos were 12-0 ahead when tries from Parcell – who finished with a hat-trick – and Liam Sutcliffe put Leeds in control. Any suggestion of a Warrington fightback was quelled with Parcell’s second shortly after the break, and from there, Leeds began to cut loose. There were four more tries – including the one which completed Parcell’s hat-trick late on. B ut when Burrow broke through to score Leeds’ seventh and final try, Stefan Ratchford lay crestfallen on the floor. It was a moment which succinctly summed up just how far apart these two teams are as the regular season rolls on.

Armitage also said that despite coming close to a move back to Bath before the 2015 World Cup, and Wasps last summer, he has had no contact from Eddie Jones; the England head coach recently admitted he has only ever been turned down by one player, who is based in France. The RFU has never invoked the “exceptional circumstances” clause of its policy of not picking players based outside England – not even for Armitage, who was named European player of the year in 2014 and won three consecutive European titles with Toulon. More recently, though, the governing body has bent its rule – Piers Francis played Super Rugby for the Blues on Friday but will join up with England in Argentina before starting his Northampton career, while Sam Underhill is yet to arrive at Bath but is also going to South America. The RFU has defended both selections by saying both players are committed to joining English sides while the overseas rule is also a key part of its cooperation with the Premiership clubs. “I just don’t see how it’s right that you are stopping someone from becoming a better player,” said Armitage, who lines up for the Barbarians against England at Twickenham on Sunday. “There are a few guys in that situation – Carl Fearns, Nick Abendanon, David Strettle, they are playing their best rugby against international players each week. “Players need to feel like they’ve got a right to achieve. Rugby careers are really short and you’re taking that right away from them. Quite a lot are going to look back and say ‘what if’ and you should never have that throughout your career. “Most of those guys believe that they are taking a massive risk. They are taking their whole family and are moving to a different country. That’s showing those guys have got some guts and they want to become better players. France is just an hour-and-a half flight. It is quicker to get from Toulon to London than from Exeter to London. I’m for the guys being available, wherever they want to play “In France it is cut-throat – [the clubs] have so much money that if you don’t perform they will just get rid of you and get someone else. You might have 50 caps but you’re not guaranteed anything. You have to improve – you have got no choice. Look at Jonny [Wilkinson] – when he came to Toulon after all his injuries we thought he’d be a little bit [on the slide] but he played like he was 20 again.” Armitage was visited in Toulon by Stuart Lancaster before the 2015 World Cup but a return to England did not materialise and while he left the Côte d’Azur last summer he stayed in France, joining Pau. With two years left on his contract, the 31-year-old has no regrets. “I truly believe me staying in France was a better option to become a better player. Playing in France I have improved every day, so I felt that was the place to be,” he added. “I didn’t do it for [Jones], for anyone, I did it for my personal thing. It is my career, not the newspapers’, not the coaches’, it was my career so my decision. It was a difficult decision but sometimes you have to go with your gut. I have achieved everything I want to achieve – I might [also] have won a World Cup, but hey, you can’t have everything.” Armitage is also adamant he has no point to prove on Sunday when he faces a youthful England side who have been urged to make a statement before touring Argentina. Jones said: “Their expectation has got to be to get out there and do the job because this is England and that is the mindset we want to create.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2017/may/26/marco-silva-watford-hull-city-crystal-palace-sean-dyche-burnley","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-05-26T20:06:05Z","webTitle":"Watford close in on Marco Silva as Crystal Palace weigh up Sean Dyche","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/may/26/marco-silva-watford-hull-city-crystal-palace-sean-dyche-burnley","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/may/26/marco-silva-watford-hull-city-crystal-palace-sean-dyche-burnley","fields":{"headline":"Watford close in on Marco Silva as Crystal Palace weigh up Sean Dyche","bodyText":"Watford are closing in on their No1 managerial target after holding talks with the former Hull City head coach Marco Silva. Silva, who has also been linked with a move to Porto and Crystal Palace, is understood to be close to agreeing a deal with the Vicarage Road club, who are looking for a swift replacement for the departed Walter Mazzarri. The Portuguese coach, who won six of 18 league games in his 139-day spell in charge of Hull, will be joined by his assistant head coach João Pedro Sousa, his first-team coach Goncalo Pedro and his goalkeeping coach Hugo Oliveira at Watford if a deal can be struck. Silva, who left Hull following their relegation from the Premier League, said: “Everyone knows when you have the chance to work in the Premier League, you don’t want to work in Championship. It’s normal.” Watford made Silva their preferred choice to replace Mazzarri, whom they sacked earlier this month after a disappointing 17th-place finish. However, they had also sounded out Roger Schmidt if Silva decided on a return to his homeland with Porto. Schmidt won the Austrian double with Red Bull Salzburg in 2014 before moving to Bayer Leverkusen, guiding them to fourth- and third-placed finishes and established them in the Champions League. The German, however, was dismissed by Leverkusen in March but has made it clear he would like to manage in England. The 50-year-old, who speaks fluent English, could now be of interest to Palace should they fail to tempt Sean Dyche to Selhurst Park. Palace, buoyed by Wilfried Zaha’s decision to sign a new five-year contract this week, are prepared to offer Burnley a seven-figure compensation package to lure the 45-year-old, who is believed to be receptive to a new challenge. Burnley have made it clear they are determined to hold on to Dyche. The former England manager Roy Hodgson, a former Palace youth-team player, is also interested in the position vacated by Sam Allardyce this week."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/2017/may/27/sean-oloughlin-wigan-retain-super-league-title-losses","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-05-27T21:00:38Z","webTitle":"Sean O’Loughlin believes Wigan can retain Super League title despite losses","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/may/27/sean-oloughlin-wigan-retain-super-league-title-losses","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/may/27/sean-oloughlin-wigan-retain-super-league-title-losses","fields":{"headline":"Sean O’Loughlin believes Wigan can retain Super League title despite defeats","bodyText":"Sean O’Loughlin insists Wigan remain capable of retaining their Super League title despite a run of form that appears to suggest Monday’s game against Wakefield is arguably their most important of the season. The reigning champions are without a win in their past four games and despite a relatively strong start to the season they now find themselves in mid-table as the regular season enters its final stretch. Defeat to Trinity could leave them as many as five points adrift of the top four come Monday night, but O’Loughlin said: “The majority of boys wouldn’t even know where we are in the league – we just keep approaching games wanting to win,” he says. “We’ve not won a few now but eventually we will do and we’ll climb up that table. We’ve got every confidence that we’ll be up at the right end and there or thereabouts come the end of the year.” Wigan’s problems have not been helped by injuries, with the champions without more than a dozen first-team players on several occasions this year. They will be without a similar number at the DW Stadium, but O’Loughlin believes the pain the club are experiencing will benefit them in the long-term. “We’re down to the bare bones: we’ve had players missing and kids coming in,” he says. “But this will pay dividends come the back end of the year when hopefully we get a load of troops back. “There’s a lot of competition and some of these kids will probably hold on to their places. At the minute it’s tough, but for the back end of the year, next year and the year after that, it’s going to be great for us.” However, despite such defiance from the Wigan and England captain, he does concede their form has to improve soon to avoid their season petering out. “In the past we’ve had injuries but managed to pick up wins, and that’s probably one thing we’ve not done as much as last year. We had a good spell at the start but we’re on a bit of a run now where we’ve not picked up points. We’ve got to address that and start winning games, but if we continue to approach matches like we have done, then we’ll eventually start picking up wins.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"business/2017/may/27/labour-hope-doesnt-play-well-age-of-anxiety","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-05-27T16:00:32Z","webTitle":"Labour’s hope doesn’t usually play well in an age of anxiety","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/may/27/labour-hope-doesnt-play-well-age-of-anxiety","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2017/may/27/labour-hope-doesnt-play-well-age-of-anxiety","fields":{"headline":"Labour’s hope doesn’t usually play well in an age of anxiety","bodyText":"It seems crazy to argue that the election will be determined by the economy when events have focused the electorate’s attention on national security and the judgment of the main political leaders. Last year’s Brexit vote illustrated many things, among them the propensity of voters to disregard short-term effects on their personal finances in favour of high ideals for a better world, whatever they felt that to be. Yet the economy looms large in the background of this election and could still play a major role in determining the outcome. And fortunately for Theresa May, the trends of the last few months play into her party’s hands. For Labour, jitters over Britain’s economic outlook only makes the mountain harder to climb. In the postwar era, Labour has tended to gain power in times of hope and confidence, especially the votes in 1966 and 1997. It might be pointed out that Harold Wilson’s two victories in 1974 were narrow and came against a backdrop of steeply rising inflation, strikes and bank collapses, which ostensibly disproves the trend. That would be true if it weren’t for the broader factors that meant the 1970s were Britain’s happiest decade, characterised by low levels of inequality and technological advancements that only seemed to enhance living standards. Fast forward to 2017 and voters appear to be in a more downbeat mood. The latest surveys of household attitudes show that their finances are in a state not seen since the summer of 2014. Three years ago, oil prices were still high and the jobs boom of 2015 and 2016 had yet to arrive. The then chancellor, George Osborne, had already relaxed his tough post-crash austerity measures, but a slowdown in the pace of cuts had yet to take effect. Workers were gloomy. Figures covering the month of May show a return to this state of mind. On balance, more people believe that sluggish wage rises and soaring inflation mean their own personal finances will be worse in a year than those who think they will be better. There will be other factors playing on people’s minds. The prospect of higher interest rates (which won’t happen, despite the Bank of England governor Mark Carney threatening them) will suggest a further squeeze on incomes, as will five more years of austerity under a Tory government. Then there are the long-term threats to many people’s jobs, such as the much-discussed rise of the robots. Looking back over the last seven years, it is easy to see that the feelgood days that came after the summer of 2014 were generated by a sugar rush of low oil prices, low-cost imports and plentiful cheap labour. The gloomy outlook from the high street contrasts with the view from corporate Britain and the City. Business leaders are full of trepidation about the outcome of Brexit talks and the potential impact on friendly relations with trading partners, it’s true. But the main surveys of business opinion show they are optimistic about their prospects in the meantime, by which they mean the next 18 months. The recent downgrade of UK GDP growth would appear to say the opposite. The Office for National Statistics said growth in the first quarter was only 0.2% and not the 0.3% previously estimated after a fall in net trade. A deeper look into the figures shows that much of the deterioration in the UK’s net trade position was down to higher import costs, mostly in response to the declining value of sterling – not a fall in exports. Also, business investment rose on an annual basis for the first time in over a year, and the second quarter began with a bit more momentum than previously believed. But the conclusion remains that consumers are less confident about the future even if their bosses are chipper. The anxiety that gripped voters after the 2008 crash is reasserting itself. In this atmosphere it will be even more difficult for Jeremy Corbyn to convince floating voters that now is the time to increase the size of the state and do it with a calculated gamble on future tax receipts. Consumers need to feel in expansive mood and believe that things can only get better to vote Labour. Or at least they need to be convinced that a competent Labour leadership, armed with a coherent set of policies, can make their lives better. The Institute for Fiscal Studies was not kind to Labour following its assessment of the main political party manifestos. It said many of its numbers failed to add up. There was also criticism of the Tory plan, but Labour came in for the most criticism. Across the Atlantic in another time, WH Auden summed up a growing mood of popular disquiet in 1948 when he wrote: “We would rather be ruined than changed We would rather die in our dread Than climb the cross of the moment And let our illusions die.” His poem, The Age of Anxiety, won the Pulitzer prize and was a telling insight into the anxieties of the postwar world. Back in Britain, Labour went on to lose the 1951 election partly because it failed to overcome a sense of gloom about the nation’s prospects. Today we face another age of anxiety and it’s difficult to see how Labour overcomes this hurdle."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"education/2017/may/27/pupils-clean-classrooms-tory-funding-cuts-bite","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2017-05-27T21:28:58Z","webTitle":"Pupils at London school asked to clean their classroom as cuts bite","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2017/may/27/pupils-clean-classrooms-tory-funding-cuts-bite","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/education/2017/may/27/pupils-clean-classrooms-tory-funding-cuts-bite","fields":{"headline":"Pupils at London school asked to clean their classroom as cuts bite","bodyText":"A cash-strapped primary school is asking pupils to vacuum classrooms at the end of the day because it cannot afford to replace the cleaner, while the headteacher’s husband is doing the plumbing for free. In a stark example of how the government’s funding cuts are hitting schools across the country, Furzedown primary school, in the London borough of Wandsworth, has been forced to make cutbacks to try to balance the books. It is one of thousands of schools struggling to make ends meet during the funding crisis. Thousands of parents, teachers and governors held local events as part of a national day of action to protest against the cuts, which will see schools in England face a real-terms reduction of £3bn once inflation is taken into account. Furzedown headteacher Monica Kitchlew-Wilson has had to ask older pupils to clean classrooms after one of the school cleaners moved jobs and there was not enough money to replace her. Her husband Dave Wilson, a trained plumber, has been drafted in to tackle odd jobs, such as replacing grease traps in the kitchen, to save money. Parents are also contributing, replacing worn-out sports equipment and buying classroom materials. The school’s struggle to make ends meet is replicated in primaries and secondaries across England. While the absolute amount of money in the national pot for schools is at record levels, once rising pupil numbers, inflation and running costs, are factored in, schools will have to cut approximately 8% from budgets by 2020. Many schools also fear the introduction of a new funding formula that ministers argue will be a fairer way of allocating cash. Under current plans, almost 11,000 schools stand to gain but around 9,000 will see significant budget cuts on top of those they already face. Headteachers want the funding crisis to top the political agenda in the run-up to the general election, warning that it risks bringing the education system to its knees. Thousands of headteachers in 14 local authority areas wrote to parents this month asking them to consider funding cuts when voting. Schools across the country are asking parents to contribute everything from paper to toilet roll. Some have requested that parents set up direct debit payments to the school or make contributions as high as £600 per family. Kitchlew-Wilson said that as a result of a combination of cuts, she was “looking at being down by £100,000. It’s a huge amount for a two-form entry primary. I’ve never had a minus in my life and I’ve been here 30 years but there are minus figures at the bottom of every column and we are looking to save money any way we can.” Five members of staff are due to leave by the beginning of the next academic year – two are moving to better funded independent schools – and will not be replaced. The school is being forced to buy fewer books and reduce IT investment, along with the amount spent on essential services for children with behavioural and learning difficulties. If the new funding formula is introduced, the future looks even bleaker. “We will have fewer teachers to support those who need extra help,” said Kitchlew-Wilson. “There will be children who need extra support who will not get it – they will get less teacher time and less quality teaching as a result of these cuts.” In a bid to save money, parents have come in to the school to paint the ceilings and do the gardening, as well as donating equipment. “We are getting boxes of stuff from Amazon that parents are buying for us but it’s not right that families have to buy resources for the school. State schools should be funded by the state and that is what it’s about,” she said. Treasury data shows that cash for schools has fallen from 5.9% of the nation’s wealth in 2010 and is headed towards 4% in 2020, the lowest level in 60 years. Russell Hobby, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, said: “This election is a make-or-break moment. School budgets are at breaking point right now. More money for schools is absolutely vital. Whoever forms the next government needs to fund education fully and fairly.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"news/2017/may/28/corrections-and-clarifications","type":"article","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webPublicationDate":"2017-05-28T20:00:05Z","webTitle":"Corrections and clarifications","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2017/may/28/corrections-and-clarifications","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/2017/may/28/corrections-and-clarifications","fields":{"headline":"Corrections and clarifications","bodyText":"• An article about Hisham Matar’s memoir The Return said that his father was kidnapped in 1979.

The era has provided plenty of inspiration for contemporary artists – the work of Jacob Burckhardt, for example – but still, the old master might have been taken aback that the reinterpreter is a street artist living in New York who has reassembled his image with cardboard. The original painting, Portrait of a Boy, by the master painter and draughtsman whose full name is Agnolo di Domenico del Mazziere (formerly known as the Master of Santo Spirito), is just one of several Renaissance works that have been reinterpreted in a collaboration between Sotheby’s auctioneers and the street art gallery Fat Free Art, based in New York’s Lower East Side. The Street Masters exhibition, starting on Friday, includes work by a host of internationally renowned street artists, while the masters that inspired them will be auctioned by Sotheby’s on 8 June. Those taking part include Japanese street artist Lady Aiko, who is based in Brooklyn; UK artists Nick Walker, Fanakapan and Zeus; Spanish artist Belin and others. Jon Satin, co-owner of Fat Free Art, said he had approached Sotheby’s about the idea when they had visited one of their street art exhibitions and found them receptive. “Their masters auctions on the high end sell for hundreds of thousands and millions,” said Satin, and the hope was the collaboration could help widen the audiences of both genres of art. Satin said Sotheby’s had suggested the urban artists could add “their own spin” to the works, which didn’t need to be a literal interpretation. “And the street artists loved it,” said Satin, whose gallery was helped by the independent urban art network @wherethereswalls to bring so many international artists together. “They jumped at it ... There’s long been this interest. It’s the kind of thing Banksy did with the Girl with the Pearl Earring,” said Satin, referring to Banksy’s Girl with the Pierced Eardrum in Bristol from several years ago. Satin said: “Everybody is now embracing street art, even those on the sidelines who may have been naysayers can’t deny it after the [Jean-Michel] Basquiat sale the other week,” when one of his skull paintings sold for $110.5m at auction in New York. David Pollack, a specialist in old master paintings at Sotheby’s said it was their goal to “introduce a new generation of art lovers to the rich and fascinating visual history of painting”. Pollack said: “When seen through the lens of street art and artists, our paintings take on a fresh energy, and this collaboration is a physical interpretation of that dynamism. “In this new context, old masters suddenly appear new again, much in the way I imagine they looked and felt to viewers when they were first created centuries ago. The people who traditionally visit our respective spaces rarely interact, so we’re excited to mix things up and facilitate new ways of looking at art.” Satin said one of the most popular images with the urban artists to reinterpret was a painting Sotheby’s is auctioning called Lucretia, by Workshop of Lucas Cranach the Elder, a 16th-century German Renaissance painter. Among those inspired by Lucretia was Spanish street artist Miguel Angel Belinchon Bujes, known as Belin, who has described his work as “post-neocubism” and cited Picasso as an inspiration. Of his piece for the project, he said: “I kept using vivid colors and a mix in textures,” and that with a combination of techniques he hoped to bring a “new dynamic” to the work. Other reinterpretations include the Portrait of a Boy in cardboard by Thomas Albertini, who was born in Milan and now lives in New York. Fat Free Art opened last year and has had previous shows including the New York street artist Dain’s first solo gallery show and the exhibition Fem-in-ism, celebrating the current wave of woman-led activism.

But, like Lancashire, Warwickshire and Middlesex before them, Essex met Kumar Sangakkara. They were undone by something old and something new. There was a 61st first-class century for Sangakkara and almost a first for Sam Curran, 21 years his junior. Sangakkara’s was his third in eight days, the biggest and, given the circumstances, the best of five in five first-class innings (the first man to do so for Surrey and the equal of a championship record); only CB Fry, Mike Procter and Don Bradman have scored six on the spin. When he retires at summer’s end he will leave as big a hole in Surrey’s batting lineup as he will in the game at large: cherish him. He reached his ton with another perfect straight drive, his 13th four from his 174th ball. All the hallmarks of last week’s Lord’s masterpiece were on show here – the stroked pull, the cover drive on one knee, the achingly elegant cuts. There was one half-chance, to reach 50, as a sharp edge off Wagner – whom he pumped down the ground twice late in the day – was dropped high to first slip’s left. Fortunately we have plenty longer watching Curran, and will not wait ages to see him make it beyond the nineties. Surrey picked a debutant, the offspinner Amar Virdi, because Gareth Batty has injured a toe. He is so fresh that cricinfo were unaware of his birthdate (18 July 1998, to make you feel ancient), and yet he’s only a month older than Curran. Curran was watchful early, and was hit on the hand by Porter before lunch; as a result, he had to endure some leg theory from Wagner. Having survived that, he cashed in, pulling and swatting down the ground for six and cutting fiercely. Eventually, he danced down to Simon Harmer and missed. James Foster, back in the side, did the rest. The stand was worth 191, a mighty effort after Surrey’s start. Quinn did for the left-handers, with Mark Stoneman edging to second slip, captain Rory Burns brilliantly taken at gully, and Scott Borthwick caught behind, then Porter dealt with the righties: Dom Sibley was bowled by a beauty and Ben Foakes played on pulling. They enjoyed less success with the second new ball as Stuart Meaker (43no) shared 95 with Sangakkara – who finished the day unbeaten on 177. Even batting this beautifully, you could forgive Essex for being sick of the sight of him."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/may/29/english-and-welsh-wine","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"2017-05-29T06:01:18Z","webTitle":"Record number of English and Welsh wine companies launched in 2016","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/may/29/english-and-welsh-wine","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/may/29/english-and-welsh-wine","fields":{"headline":"Record number of English and Welsh wine companies launched in 2016","bodyText":"A record number of English wine companies were launched last year, as new vineyard owners sought to capitalise on a growing taste for their products. Sixty-four new wine businesses put down roots in England and Wales during 2016, up 73% on the previous year, according to HM Revenue and Customs. Industry experts put the rise down to factors including demand from abroad as a result of the weak pound and growing recognition around the world that English wine is not to be scoffed at. The success of existing producers has also encouraged entrepreneurs to try their hand at making English wine – not to be confused with British wine, which is made from imported grapes and generally considered of lower quality. Kent-based Chapel Down, England’s leading winemaker, reported wine sales up 22% to £6.8m last year. Norfolk’s Winbirri Vineyards was named the surprise winner of the world’s best value single-variety still white wine in the prestigious Decanter World Wine Awards earlier this month. While the UK’s climate makes it tough to produce quality red wine, the south of England has developed a reputation for whites – in particular sparkling wines. The area has even attracted investment from French champagne house Taittinger, which recently planted a vineyard near the Kent village of Chilham. Taittinger’s move is the first time a grande marque champagne house has grown vines in the UK, with the aim of producing a top-quality English sparkling wine. Its first bottles should be ready in 2023. “Word has spread of the world-class wines being made by the pioneers in the English wine industry,” said Miles Beale, the chief executive of the Wine and Spirit Trade Association. This has attracted investors who have shown the foresight to see English wine’s potential and who are prepared to be patient. “The new problem facing UK winemakers is that there are not enough grapes to meet demand. With the number of awards for English wine piling up year-on-year, planting more vineyards to meet that demand makes good economic sense.” The weather has been a problem this year after hard frosts prompted English winemakers to say in April that at least half of the year’s grape harvest had been wiped out. The fact that English vineyards are winning global acclaim is encouraging budding winemakers into the industry, according to James Simmonds, a partner at accountancy firm UHY Hacker Young. “English wine production – in particular English sparkling wine – is now being taken seriously on both a local and global platform which has enabled the industry to thrive,” he said. Simmonds said the slump in the pound since the Brexit vote had also made English wine more attractive, both for foreign buyers and British oenophiles who are paying more for imported bottles. “As the cost of exporting to Europe falls and imports are rising, English sparkling wine has an opportunity to become a real contender for prosecco and champagne in the global market. With Brexit now on the horizon, it is more important than ever to support local industry and to cement the UK as a globally recognised exporter of high-quality goods.” There are 502 vineyards in England and Wales, as well as 133 producers making wine from other people’s grapes, according to English Wine Producers, with production reaching 5m bottles a year. About 1m vines will be planted in the next year, which will result in 2m more bottles of English wine a year, according to the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2017/may/29/handmaids-tale-review-best-thing-youll-watch-all-year","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2017-05-29T05:00:17Z","webTitle":"The Handmaid’s Tale review – the best thing you’ll watch all year","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/may/29/handmaids-tale-review-best-thing-youll-watch-all-year","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2017/may/29/handmaids-tale-review-best-thing-youll-watch-all-year","fields":{"headline":"The Handmaid’s Tale review – the best thing you’ll watch all year","bodyText":"‘Blessed are the meek, dear,” says Aunt Lydia to a young woman called Janine in the extraordinary, affecting new TV adaptation of The Handmaid’s Tale (Channel 4, Sunday). Then she Tasers her for insubordination, before Janine is taken away to have her right eye plucked out. They are in the Rachel and Leah Centre, also known as the Red Centre, where handmaids are instructed in the ways and belief system of the Republic of Gilead, and in their role as servile surrogate breeders. “Ordinary is just what you’re used to,” continues Aunt Lydia (a terrifying Ann Dowd) to the now fully attentive handmaids, including Offred (Elisabeth Moss). “This might not seem ordinary right now, but after a time it will. This will become ordinary.” There has been a lot of talk about new resonance for The Handmaid’s Tale since the election of You Know Who; fear of freedoms, rights and long-established orders disappearing overnight. That line, especially, about the not-ordinary becoming ordinary, rings chillingly loud and true today, when “normalisation” is a word you hear so often in connection with the current US administration. Apposite timing for the adaptation, or prophetic by Margaret Atwood. She wrote her dystopian novel in Berlin, in 1985. The wall was still up; on the other side was the eastern bloc and the Soviet Union, a powerful influence. And, famously, she didn’t put anything in that hadn’t happened, somewhere, some time. As much history fiction as science fiction, then, even if the history was cherry-picked, from early American Puritans to cold war commies. If you think about the 32 years since publication, she could have easily expanded her orchard to include any number of extremist regimes, anywhere religion has been used as an excuse for terror, or where women have been repressed, wars in which rape has been used as a weapon (so just about all of them), slumping fertility in developed countries, surrogacy in the developing world … and so on. What I’m saying is that it does not just have new resonance, it has never stopped resonating, unless you live in a peaceful, matriarchal, uncontacted, unreligious tribe in the Amazon. Maybe the adaption feels extra-poignant because the geography of fact and fiction are now in alignment in the US, even if in real life the constitution is just about hanging on, for now … The Red Centre would be the standout scene if there weren’t so many standout scenes: Offred’s brutal separation from her daughter in the woods; the mob execution of a man; “the ceremony”, which is Gilead-speak for Offred lying in the lap of Serena Joy (who is neither serene nor joyous, but is infertile) and being coldly, mechanically raped by Serena’s husband, the Commander, the man Offred has been assigned to for the purpose of procreation. That last is one of the most disturbing, horrible things I’ve ever seen on television. Moss, who has already been one of the best things about two great shows, Mad Men and Top of the Lake, is again utterly captivating. A brilliant performance – quiet, not giving anything away, because she can’t, and yet also saying so much, via inner voice but also with her face and her eyes. The Handmaid’s Tale looks extraordinary – stylised, choreographed almost, menacing. It sounds fabulous, too. An ominous, low note descends a semitone, lower still, dragging you down with it, into danger. Dogs bark in the distance. Some people are singing Onward Christian Soldiers. Even the flashbacks, so rarely totally successful, work here. Because they are back to pre-Gilead (possibly round about now?), it feels like a brief respite, being allowed up for air for a minute, before being pushed back down again with a boot on your head. And they act like warnings – to Offred, maybe to us, too – against normalisation. It wasn’t always like this, it’s not ordinary now: don’t let it become ordinary. It is a brilliant adaptation – some changes, but loyal in what it says and what it asks. Atwood clearly approves: not only was she a consulting producer, but she’s in it, a Red Centre cameo as a slapping Aunt. And it’s brilliant television; I doubt there will be anything better this year. Resonant now, yes, but it will go on being so, ringing in your ears, and your head."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"uk-news/2017/may/29/crossrail-2-hits-buffers-uncertainties-brexit-election-london","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2017-05-29T14:21:39Z","webTitle":"Crossrail 2 hits buffers as uncertainties over Brexit and election take hold","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/may/29/crossrail-2-hits-buffers-uncertainties-brexit-election-london","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2017/may/29/crossrail-2-hits-buffers-uncertainties-brexit-election-london","fields":{"headline":"Crossrail 2 hits buffers as uncertainties over Brexit and election take hold","bodyText":"A year ago, the progress of Crossrail 2 seemed assured. A political consensus was forming that a second mass-transit line across London should be built from north to south, its urgency underpinned by the verdict of the National Infrastructure Commission (NIC) that this was the most important single project for Britain and work needed to start now. The then chancellor George Osborne duly doled out £80m to get the ball rolling, expecting a hybrid bill in the same parliament. Now, with its champions having gone after the EU referendum, the project’s prospects look bleak. While City firms discuss relocating offices and staff, any assumption that higher business rates and commuter revenues would pay the £32bn construction bill is on shakier ground. The omission of Crossrail 2 from the Conservative manifesto, in which other infrastructure projects were listed, was the clearest sign yet that there is little appetite in a Theresa May government for another London-based scheme. Although official reaction appears muted, constrained by the purdah rules of the pre-election period, insiders at Transport for London (TfL) fear that a cherished – and for them, critical – scheme is on the rocks. The arguments for the north-south line, which would be tunnelled from New Southgate and Tottenham Hale to Wimbledon and link up with commuter rail services in Hertfordshire and Surrey, boil down to capacity. The arteries of the growing capital can only be temporarily unclogged through improving present lines. On the underground, the Victoria line has been upgraded and the Northern line is following, while an upgraded Thameslink service will also move extra passengers more swiftly through the centre of the capital. With such upgrades and the imminent completion of the original Crossrail as the east-west Elizabeth line, some may think Londoners should shut up and be grateful. But the case for a new, faster service on this alignment was first made when the city was in relative decline: the Chelsea-Hackney line’s underground route has been safeguarded for decades. And now, with London’s population forecast to rise to 10 million by 2030, the picture is further complicated by the building of HS2, the high-speed rail network linking London to Birmingham and the north. The previous London transport commissioner Peter Hendy warned for years of the mayhem to be expected at Euston when thousands of HS2 passengers pour into an already overcrowded rail terminus. More recently, London’s mayor, Sadiq Khan, said the city would “grind to a halt” without Crossrail 2. The scheme is seen by transport planners as vital to relieve the pressure on South West Trains, with its Waterloo terminus already the busiest station in the country. Some renewed political impetus is expected after the election, when the NIC chairman, Andrew Adonis, a prominent champion of the scheme, is expected to return to public life and push its claims. But since Lord Adonis’s commission pinned its colours to the mast, the Brexit vote has reinforced political wariness of looking London-centric. David Leam, the infrastructure director at business group London First, said: “The key thing this project needs is a comparable one to start in the north. Crossrail 2 has a great case, but what the government also wants to do is to be seen to be investing in projects in the rest of the country.” That equivalence is underlined by Labour’s commitment to building a “Crossrail of the north”. But even the nomenclature in the various manifestos is telling, Leam said: “It’s indicative of how ill-formed those ideas are that the [northern] scheme doesn’t really have a name: the Lib Dems talked about HS3 and the Tories talk about northern powerhouse rail.” The politics are sticky. TfL has submitted a business plan for a scheme that had the full backing of the previous London mayor and transport secretary. But the antipathy between Khan and Chris Grayling has already emerged, with the latter rebuffing TfL’s business case for taking over inner London rail services on Southeastern, and at least part of the hold-up on Crossrail 2 appears to be TfL’s plan lingering in Grayling’s intray. A government response was expected in early spring, but now autumn appears to be the earliest time for an announcement. Publication of the response may ease worries in Chelsea, west London, where many residents have opposed the building of a Kings Road station. With TfL looking to rein in costs to persuade the government, the station is strongly tipped to be excluded from the next iteration of the scheme. Funding is also a stumbling block, because the capital will again be expected to meet at least half the costs, although business rates will remain elevated for years just to pay for the first Crossrail. Proponents of Crossrail 2 argue that revenue is guaranteed: this is a scheme to cope with demand, not one to stimulate economic growth, although it would also expect to fuel development, growth and housing further out on regional branches south and north. “It’s not a build it and hope they come project. It’s as close to a sure thing as you can get in infrastructure,” Leam said. The original Crossrail is scheduled to come into full operation within two years: its tunnels are built and the first trains will soon enter service on eastern and above-ground routes. Crossrail’s protracted genesis shows the £14.8bn project was far from inevitable: first outlined in the 1970s, it was backed in the 1990s by the government, before being scrapped, and was put under review by the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition as late as 2010, when construction had started. Leam said: “We’re stuck at a red light, not shunted into the sidings. But we could be stuck there for five or 10 years. The risk is that we repeat the Crossrail experience of endless prevarication, while congestion gets worse and the cost goes up.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2017/may/26/frankie-dettori-derby-boost-cracksman-khalidi-victory-goodwood-horse-racing","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-05-26T16:53:17Z","webTitle":"Frankie Dettori gets Derby boost from Khalidi victory at Goodwood","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/may/26/frankie-dettori-derby-boost-cracksman-khalidi-victory-goodwood-horse-racing","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/may/26/frankie-dettori-derby-boost-cracksman-khalidi-victory-goodwood-horse-racing","fields":{"headline":"Frankie Dettori gets Derby boost from Khalidi victory at Goodwood","bodyText":"Thirty years ago next month a 16-year-old apprentice called Frankie Dettori rode his first winner at this breathtaking downland track and, if Ascot is the racecourse most readily associated with his long career, Goodwood cannot be far behind. Dettori has long since mastered its contours and quirks and he was impeccable again aboard Khalidi on Friday as the colt took the Cocked Hat Stakes in course-record time. Monarchs Glen, a stable companion of Khalidi at the John Gosden yard, flew out of the stalls and raced freely through the first mile, extending his lead to about 10 lengths at one stage. He started to come back to the field with a quarter of a mile to run, however, and Khalidi was soon in command, going on to cross the line five lengths in front of Fierce Impact. The last two winners of this race have gone on to run in the Derby, including Storm The Stars, who made the frame at Epsom two years ago. Khalidi is not up to that standard and is likely to run next in the King Edward VII Stakes at Royal Ascot but Dettori was satisfied with the compliment that the win paid to Permian, the Dante Stakes winner, and by extension Cracksman, Dettori’s mount in the Classic next weekend. “We don’t have many races here over a mile and three [furlongs],” Dettori said. “There’s only two a year, so on fast ground with the wind behind and a decent pace, I’m not surprised [about the record time]. “But it’s good, it all ties up with the Dante winner [who beat Khalidi at Newmarket earlier in the season] and the form looks solid. You can make a case for about 10 [in the Derby]. It’s whatever stays and whatever gets the best run because on ratings they’re much of a muchness. “[Monarchs Glen] has got a lot of talent and no one was going to take me there so I had to make the move. At the furlong pole I knew he was done but he’s the sort of horse that, if you give him too much rope, he could go.” Cracksman, who missed his intended prep run for Epsom in the Dante Stakes due to soft ground, remains joint-favourite for the Derby at a best price of 9-2, alongside Aidan O’Brien’s Cliffs Of Moher, the Dee Stakes winner. William Buick will be in the weighing room alongside Dettori at Epsom next week after he persuaded the British Horseracing Authority’s disciplinary committee to reduce a recent ban for careless riding, imposed by the stewards at York, from five days to four. The difference is crucial because Buick can apply to have a four-day ban deferred on days when there is Group One racing in Britain, freeing him to ride in both the Oaks and Coronation Cup next Friday and the Derby the following afternoon. He is expected to ride Jack Hobbs, the 2015 Irish Derby winner, in the Coronation Cup while Godolphin, his main employer, could have as many as five runners in the Derby and Buick is almost certain to pick up a useful ride. Aidan O’Brien took both the 1,000 Guineas and 2,000 Guineas at Newmarket with Winter and Churchill and they are odds-on to follow up in the Irish equivalents this weekend, but his team for the high-summer showpieces suffered a significant setback on Friday when Minding, the winner of seven Group One events in all, was ruled out by injury until at least the autumn. Minding had been expected to start at long odds-on for the Tattersalls Gold Cup at The Curragh on Sunday. In her absence Ryan Moore will switch to ride Deauville, a recent winner at Chester’s May meeting, while O’Brien is also represented by Johannes Vermeer and Somehow in a final field of eight runners.

The Unesco world heritage site at the Wadden Sea on the Dutch coast stretches over 10,000 sq km. Its saltmarshes, sandy shoals, dunes and mussel beds host millions of migratory birds every year, as well as thousands of basking seals. But the storm-weathered Frisian coastline may be living on borrowed time. One report this month predicted that it would be submerged by 2100 if current global warming trends and planned gas extractions continue. “It is more likely that the area will drown than that it will survive,” said Rolf Schuttenhelm, the paper’s author. “The equation is quite simple. If sea level rise and subsidence combined are larger than the maximum speed of sedimentation – and they are – then with time, the drowning of the tidal system becomes inevitable.” Geese, oystercatchers, spoonbills, pelicans and flamingoes would lose their havens if the flats disappeared. The loss would also sound a death knell for communities which have lived for millennia behind the dykes that dot the Friesland coast. Natural subsidence and gas drills are depressing the Frisian territory, which is mostly below sea level. The North Sea is also rising by 1.8mm a year, a rate likely to accelerate as climate change takes hold. NAM, a Shell-Exxon partnership, plans to start a gas drilling operation next year and three other wells could soon follow. Local people from 14 villages have formed a movement to resist them. “It’s all about money,” said Willem Schoorstra, an award-winning Frisian novelist from the group. “We had one talk with NAM and they constantly repeated that they would help us make the clean energy transition. But it’s crap. We don’t buy it. They only want to invest in it when they are drilling. They hold on to their old ways and destroy everything for the sake of money.” Beneath such talk is an attachment to the low-lying, ancient ground on which Romans, Vikings and Franks have trodden. “It’s the quietness, the view, the smell,” says Schoorstra, “the birds, the starry skies, the little whispers from the cockles, mudworms and mussels. You can go there twice and the whole landscape has changed. It is where the kids have their first love affairs.” The Wadden Sea tide ebbs and flows twice a day, bringing sand, silt and nutrients which blanket the mud flats in algae. This holds the sand banks together and provides food for the shellfish and smaller creatures that feed the birds and make the ecosystem’s life cycle turn. Johan Rispens, a local shrimp fisher, asks: “What will happen to our dykes when they drill for gas under the Wadden Sea? Will they crack? Will there be earthquakes? Why is it even necessary to take the gas from under the sea?” Campaigners say some local house prices have fallen by as much as €50,000 (£44,000) each in the last five years due to fears of subsidence and the drilling-related earthquakes that have damaged an estimated 100,000 homes in neighbouring Groningen province. Michiel Schrier, the Socialist governor of Friesland’s provincial capital Leeuwarden, says: “After the earthquakes in Groningen, people woke up and now every time a contractor wants to take gas from the ground, the communities are revolting and coming together in protest. These movements are getting bigger.” Gas has been drilled on Ameland island off the Wadden Sea coast since 2006, and Schrier has himself taken part in many of the anti-drill demonstrations. NAM argues that it can contain subsidence by keeping “a hand on the tap” – to turn their operations off if geological monitoring shows cavities appearing which might not be filled by sedimentation. But the geological processes at work can take years to become apparent, and NAM’s technical blueprint was dismissed by the government’s mines supervisory board last week for a second time. NAM now has until November to address their report’s shortcomings, after which it could face fines of €500,000 a week. “We need a proper study and that’s what is not happening at the moment,” said Wouter Van der Zee, the manager of the mines supervision board. “The predicted amount of subsidence and the uncertainty band were just unrealistic.” If Shell does not correct inadequacies in its methodology, “we may have to advise our minister to reassess the gas production [plans] under the Wadden Sea,” Van der Zee said. Jeroen Jansen, a senior ecologist for Shell and NAM stressed that boreholes would be drilled from just outside the world heritage site to extract gas from the 200 billion cubic metre field that is directly underneath the mudflats. The drill was needed “so we can secure a safe, reliable and affordable energy supply in the future,” he said. “We are aware that the Wadden Sea is of high ecological value. If there would be a risk [of collapse], we would not do it.” Subsidence of 1mm a year under the flats and 3-4mm a year under the salt marshes had taken place since 2006, he said, as a result of the 25 wells drilled in the Wadden Sea area since 1985. A spokesman for the Dutch government said: “In the transition period towards a fossil fuel-free society, natural gas still has an important role to play. Whether we will eventually extract gas from the Wadden Sea is a different matter. We are still in the midst of a review procedure.” Gas is seen in the Netherlands as a bridging fuel to a low-carbon future, because it emits just over half as much CO2 as coal. This is still 18 times higher than concentrated solar power and 40 times higher than onshore wind. In Friesland, the widespread suspicion is that their government listens most attentively when money talks. “The Netherlands is a small country but we are very far from the Hague,” Schrier said. “They have a contract to deliver gas to other countries and it’s a big income for them.” The issue reached boardroom level earlier this year when Rabobank announced an embargo on new finance for gas exploitation under the Wadden Sea. The bank is a major mortgage provider in the area. ING and ABN Amro, two other major Dutch banks, quickly followed their lead. However, campaigners say that Barclays, Royal Bank of Canada and the ABP and Delta Lloyd pension funds are still keeping their investment options open. Candice Macdonald, a spokeswoman for Barclays, said that day-to-day interaction with one of the drilling firms, Tulip Oil, was now being undertaken by Global Natural Resources Investments (GNRI) after a management buy-out of the bank’s natural resources equity office. “Barclays retains a minority [30%] stake in Tulip,” Macdonald said. “Tulip has ceased all development activities on the Wadden Sea project and has no intention to restart at the current time.” GNRI did not respond to calls for clarification but the firm’s environmental policy says that they will not back projects that break local laws. In a report on the financing of the gas projects, Barclays did not rule out work on the project resuming, subject to a “clarification of the Dutch mining law”. Back at the Wadden Sea, Renate de Backere, a world heritage site guide surveys the remote muddy wilderness and sighs when asked about the inevitability of subsidence. “It’s a naturally occurring process but now we humans have created a situation where it’s hardly in control anymore,” she said. “The Wadden Sea is in danger because if there are no mudflats anymore, there will be no places for the seals to rest, the birds will not be able to access food any more, and the ecosystem will become a sea.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2017/may/26/roger-moore-worked-to-protect-animals-his-campaigns-must-live-on","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2017-05-26T17:40:38Z","webTitle":"Roger Moore worked to protect animals.

Only Labour will change this","bodyText":"Few aspects of employment have generated more buzz recently than the “gig economy”. This sector is characterised by companies cloaking themselves in the aura of innovation and hiding behind a facade of technological ingenuity, while classing their workers as “independent contractors” in order to avoid providing them with the most basic of employment rights, such as paid holidays and the minimum wage. A spate of recent employment tribunal claims – the majority of which were brought by the Independent Workers Union of Great Britain (IWGB) – have shown these practices to be unlawful. Although rights for these workers could certainly be improved, the fundamental problem of employment rights in the gig economy is the lack of enforcement of existing law. For this reason the IWGB, of which I am general secretary, has three main policy proposals: 1) introduce government enforcement of employment law; 2) eliminate employment tribunal fees; and 3) increase employment rights for “workers” so they enjoy more of the same rights as employees. So how have the three main political parties done on the subject? The Tories are the party that has overseen the rise of bogus employment classifications, introduced employment tribunal fees, refused to enforce employment law, and has a consistent track record of reducing employment rights. Unsurprisingly, they tend to also be quite chummy with “gig economy” employers: secretly lobbying the mayor of London for Uber and a revolving door of PR and communications officials with Deliveroo being just two examples. The Tories nevertheless have the gall to tell manifesto readers that they “will make sure that people working in the ‘gig’ economy are properly protected”. They promise to do this off the back of the Taylor review, which Theresa May commissioned to look at employment practices in the “modern economy”. The recent reincarnation of May as a champion of workers’ rights, engineered for electoral purposes, is hardly credible. The Liberal Democrats’ solution – building on the recommendations of the Taylor review – is quite similar to the Conservatives’. This is unsurprising as their contribution to the problem was quite similar to the Tories’ as well. One key difference is that the Lib Dems are calling for the elimination of employment tribunal fees. Putting aside for the moment the fact that the party’s leader voted to introduce the fees just a few years ago, this policy is of course most welcome and would help hold to account employers who bogusly class their workers as independent contractors. The Lib Dems also say they will “strengthen enforcement of employment rights, including by bringing together relevant enforcement agencies”. The devil of this will certainly be in the details: the result will need to be greater than the sum of its parts as the relevant enforcement agencies have been extremely limited in both their scope and impact. Unlike the Tories and Lib Dems, who apparently depend on the Taylor review to tell them what the employment rights problems of the gig economy are, Labour has identified them and is proposing concrete solutions. The party would create an adequately resourced ministry of labour to be responsible for enforcing employment law. That would include putting the burden on employers to demonstrate that their workers are not in fact employees, and imposing punitive fines on employers that used bogus employment status. Labour would also extend all rights enjoyed by employees to workers, eliminate tribunal fees, and set up a commission to review and modernise employment status definitions. Unlike the Taylor review, which has repeatedly mischaracterised the current state of the law and has no trade union representation, Labour’s commission would be “led by legal and academic experts with representation from industry and trade unions”. One might also want to consider that while the coalition government – in which Theresa May was home secretary and Tim Farron party president of the junior partner – was making it harder for employees to claim unfair dismissal and nearly impossible for them to go to tribunal, John McDonnell and Jeremy Corbyn were on the picket lines supporting low-paid workers. In the intervening period it has become fashionable to promise workers’ rights and government intervention. But voting Tory or Lib Dem in the hope they will deliver on those pledges might put one at risk of falling within one definition of insanity: doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results.

This was a week to choose British values","bodyText":"From all I have read about the luminous-sounding Martyn Hett since he was murdered at the Manchester Arena on Monday night, he sounds like he would have relished his brother’s jaw-droppingly brave stewardship of his memory in the days since. When Martyn’s name began trending on Twitter, Dan Hett’s response was a masterclass in sombre seemliness: “He would, I think it’s safe to say, be fucking loving this.” The next day, Mariah Carey had posted a picture of Martyn in a Mariah Carey T-shirt, accompanied by a devastated quote about the death of a member of her fandom. His brother’s response was one of those jokes that makes you gasp and laugh at the same time: “I was a little dubious about Martyn’s recent bold social media move,” he deadpanned. “But it worked.” God, the sheer balls of that. How on earth can he manage to be properly funny at such an unimaginably awful time? Properly, involuntary laugh-inducingly, heartbreakingly, inspiringly, tragically hilarious? Their mother, Figen Murray – previously the beneficiary of one of Martyn’s genuine social media moves, when he managed to sell out her under-appreciated knitting craft stall – clearly raised some extraordinarily spirited children. “Martyn’s life was not wasted,” she said in the most noble and dignified of interviews, as she held a clutch of knitted teddies. I must say I kept thinking of them as our old friend Abu Hopkins continued to preach hate on Twitter all week. Occasionally there are cultural moments where it seems right to pick a direction – to turn towards those who offer an ideal of who we as people might wish to be, and turn away from those who offer nothing, and do even that artlessly. The horror of Manchester is one of those moments. Whatever our idealised “British values” are – and codifying them would obviously be appallingly against British values – they feel to me better embodied in the heroically black humour of Dan Hett in the days after his brother’s murder than in anything Katie Hopkins has said or written, ever. In fact, were television’s Vernon Kay to host an episode of the ITV show Family Fortunes in which 100 people were asked to name British values, humour would probably rank at number two, after democracy and before regarding 40 minutes of unpleasantries about the weather as our birthright. Without wishing to go out on a limb, any Family Fortunes contestant who answered, “Calling for a final solution?” would probably earn their place in the quiz show hall of shame. And yet, this was what Hopkins did call for, the very morning after the bombing. As she put it: “We need a final solution.” The bigger the horror, the smaller Katie has always seemed, and this week she appeared vanishingly so. Indeed, one of her employers – LBC radio – has decided this is the moment to vanish her entirely. This morning it was announced that madam was to leave the station by the exit marked “mutual consent”. No doubt, no doubt. Either way, there is no need to offer a syllable of congratulation to LBC, which went ahead and hired Hopkins even after she’d written a column describing migrants as cockroaches. Although I suppose it’s possible that they’re watching the last five years on tape delay, and are only up to 2013. They’ll be really kicking themselves when they finally get up to speed. Clearly, Katie’s departure from the airwaves is hard lines for those who trade in fake Churchill quotes and the like, who have just discovered that free speech is the right to say what you like within the law, and not the right to have a boringly repetitive radio show. Who knew? For those catching up on this incredibly subtle distinction, and there do seem to be a few, Katie can still say whatever she likes on social media – and in the Daily Mail, for as long as Paul Dacre will retain her services. But LBC seems to have decided, to adapt the senior officer in Top Gun, that Katie’s ego was writing cheques her body couldn’t cash. Then again, it is reported she has cost the Mail group at least £474,000 in libel damages and costs thus far, while she was found personally liable for £131,000 of the same after losing a case to the writer Jack Monroe. So it is possible that – how to put this? – Katie’s hand may soon be writing cheques her bank account can’t cash. Still, this latest unemployment development is all exactly as predicted in the Book of Hopkins. As she explained portentously last year: “One day I will say something that takes it so far over the line I will have to go and I accept that too. I think that is part of the condition of living your life on the line.” Living your life on the line … I do like how Katie makes “being a twat on the radio” sound like fighting in ’Nam. Even so, I’m afraid our contestant doesn’t get to take a lot home with her. We must relieve her of her favourite poses, with this week’s “suffer the children to come to me” a case in point. Never forget that Katie Hopkins gives so much of a toss about the children affected by an extremist murder that she has pursued a relentless online vendetta against Brendan Cox, who has the temerity to have been widowed by a rightwing extremist last year. Similarly, you never heard her say anything about the horrific murder of schoolchildren at Sandy Hook, or any of the other school shootings in the United States. Being furious about that isn’t going to get her booked on Fox News, and consequently it wouldn’t get a run-out in one of her 3,000-word, five-verb columns. Perhaps the only thing Katie does get to take home is her antipathy to laughter. But then, the defining characteristic of self-styled “voices of the people” is their total and utter humourlessness, which has its roots in a terror of being undermined. Katie’s spiritual analogue is Roderick Spode, PG Wodehouse’s piss-take of Oswald Mosley, and a chap to whom Bertie Wooster is moved to remark: “The trouble with you, Spode, is that just because you have succeeded in inducing a handful of half-wits to disfigure the London scene by going about in black shorts, you think you’re someone. You hear them shouting ‘Heil, Spode!’ and you imagine it is the Voice of the People. That is where you make your bloomer. What the Voice of the People is saying is: ‘Look at that frightful ass Spode swanking about in footer bags! Did you ever in your puff see such a perfect perisher?’” Well, did you? Certainly, Katie has her followers. They always have their followers: horrendous, needy bores who, had they been born under other stars, might have found themselves drawn into the orbit of alternative preachers of hate. But their cause is not – to borrow an insult they can understand – true Britishness. It is a perverted form of Britishness, because it has no jokes. Ever. At all. If I may be so presumptuously bold, Martyn Hett’s brother contains more Britishness in his typing thumb than Ms Hopkins contains in her entire output. His spirit will remain something to which we can truly aspire, long after hers has gone the way of all Spodes."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/jun/03/modern-tribes-sports-day-parent-catherine-bennett","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2017-06-03T07:00:47Z","webTitle":"Modern tribes: the sports day parent","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/jun/03/modern-tribes-sports-day-parent-catherine-bennett","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/jun/03/modern-tribes-sports-day-parent-catherine-bennett","fields":{"headline":"Modern tribes: the sports day parent","bodyText":"Oh my goodness, me?

So who won?","bodyText":"While Rodrigo Duterte was campaigning to be elected president of the Philippines last year, he said on many occasions that he would arrange, if elected, for people who sold or used drugs to be killed. Extrajudicial killings began even before his inauguration, with victims usually shot and then drugs and guns planted to make it look like the assailants had acted in self-defence. A 77-page application last month by a lawyer, Jude Sabio – requesting the international criminal court to commence a preliminary investigation – estimated that at least 9,400 people have already been killed by police and vigilantes. According to Sabio, most of the victims were “poor young men, but also bystanders, children and political opponents”. The killings were briefly halted in January after police killed a South Korean businessman, but have since restarted. Governments in many countries carry out extrajudicial killings, almost always for military or national security reasons and rarely targeting people who use or sell drugs. An exception is what happened in Thailand in 2003, when Thaksin Shinawatra was prime minister, and an estimated 3,000 people accused of using or selling drugs were murdered without legal process. More than a decade later, under the current rule of a military junta, the legal and military elite is slowly reforming Thailand’s drug laws. The painful memories of the extrajudicial killings of 2003 are a major factor in the drug law reform now taking place in Thailand. So far, with the exception of praise from the US president, Donald Trump, there has been strong international condemnation of the extrajudicial killings in the Philippines, including from Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch. The United Nations human rights council voted 45-1 to urge the Philippines to desist. Yet while extrajudicial killings have received international attention, the extremism of Duterte’s other drug policies – measures including the reinstatement of the death penalty for drug offences, the lowering of the age of criminal responsibility to as low as 10, and mandatory drug testing in schools and workplaces – have been largely ignored. The unpalatable fact for policymakers everywhere is that extrajudicial killings of people who use drugs would never occur without the sanction of a global drug prohibition, a system that started with an international meeting convened by the US in Shanghai in 1909. A series of such meetings culminated in three international drug treaties (in 1961, 1971 and 1988) approved by almost every nation. The US president Richard Nixon intensified what he called the “war on drugs” in 1971 to help him win re-election in 1972 despite the deeply unpopular Vietnam war. Global drug prohibition was expected to reduce the international drug market and make it less dangerous. But this is the opposite of what happened. Instead, production and consumption of drugs such as heroin and cocaine increased and their price fell by 80% over a quarter of a century. More than 100 new psychoactive drugs are identified within the EU every year, some of them much more dangerous than older drugs. Drug prohibition was also supposed to protect the health and wellbeing of communities. But drug-related deaths, disease, violence and corruption have in many places increased rather than decreased. In Australia, where I spent three decades providing alcohol and drug treatment and advocating public health and human rights , while based in a Sydney teaching hospital, the rate of heroin overdose deaths – allowing for the growth in the population over time – increased 55-fold between 1964 and 1997. In most western countries, property crime – taking money or property without threat – has skyrocketed from the 1960s to the present day. Drug prohibition is not the only factor, but it’s certainly a major one. The number of homicides has also increased in many countries, and this too is linked to the prohibition of drugs and the market this creates for organised crime. But the effects on producer countries and trafficking countries such as Mexico are far worse than anything experienced in rich countries. When Felipe Calderón became president of Mexico in 2006 he declared a “war on drugs”. By the time he left office six years later, drug traffickers, the army or police had killed at least 80,000 Mexicans. In some countries drug prohibition has encouraged rampant corruption in policing, courts and up to the highest levels of government. Major drug producing or transit countries – such as Afghanistan, Pakistan, Myanmar, Bolivia, Peru, Colombia and Mexico – have risked becoming unstable failed states, even posing threats to the national security of some other countries. It isn’t that the world has not implemented its war on drugs the right way. A war on drugs will always fail. When correctional authorities can’t keep drugs out of prisons, how can we expect drugs to be kept out of our cities and suburbs? When 1kg of heroin or cocaine multiplies in price several hundred-fold from its country of origin to its city of destination, how can we stop it from being transported? When drug traffickers are better resourced than police, how can we expect our authorities to stop drugs being trafficked? In the past few years, former world leaders – and even some in office – have started calling for drug law reform. The essential elements are clear. First, redefine drugs as primarily a health and social issue. Second, improve treatment. Third, start reducing and, where possible, eliminating sanctions for drug use and drug possession. Fourth, regulate as much of the drug market as possible, starting with recreational cannabis. And fifth, shrink extreme poverty, which exacerbates drug problems. Countries implementing at least some of these measures have seen a decrease in deaths, disease, crime and violence. In Switzerland, illicit drug seizures fell in the 1990s, suggesting that the drug black market may have contracted. And like Switzerland, the Netherlands in the 1970s and Portugal in 2001 benefited from redefining drugs as primarily a health issue. Now some countries are starting to try to regulate parts of their drug market. Eight states in the US, A encompassing 20% of the population, have approved the taxation and regulation of recreational cannabis. Uruguay was the first nation to regulate recreational cannabis. And in July 2018 Canada should become the first G7 nation to do so. Clearly, global drug prohibition is starting to unravel. But there is a significant risk that Duterte’s campaign of extrajudicial killings and the lack of any serious international response may encourage other countries to instead follow his example. Duterte, who declared martial law in parts of the Philippines last week following gun battles between security forces and Islamic State militants, was recently quoted as saying: “Hitler massacred 3 million Jews. Now, there is [sic] 3 million drug addicts. I’d be happy to slaughter them.” Hitler noted the lack of an international response to the Ottoman government’s genocide of 1.5 million Armenians between 1915 and 1917 and that emboldened him to proceed to his own Holocaust of six million Jews, Gypsies and homosexuals. It would be ironic as well as tragic if the extrajudicial killings of people who use drugs started to spread just when the international drug control system has started collapsing. It should not take extrajudicial killings in the Philippines in 2017 to make the world realise that global drug prohibition has turned out to be an expensive way of making a bad problem much worse. When Mikhail Gorbachev realised in the 1980s that communism in the USSR had failed, he called for glasnost (openness) and perestroika (restructuring). We now need more openness about drug policy, along with a major restructuring of our response to drugs. The only winners so far have been drug traffickers and the many politicians who found that bad policy made good politics. The longer change is delayed, the more difficult the transition will be."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"society/2017/may/26/prison-officer-risks-endangering-lives-of-inmates-says-coroner-inquest-death-hmp-foston-hall-","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2017-05-26T16:58:13Z","webTitle":"Prison officer risks endangering lives of inmates, says coroner","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/may/26/prison-officer-risks-endangering-lives-of-inmates-says-coroner-inquest-death-hmp-foston-hall-","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2017/may/26/prison-officer-risks-endangering-lives-of-inmates-says-coroner-inquest-death-hmp-foston-hall-","fields":{"headline":"Prison officer risks endangering lives of inmates, says coroner","bodyText":"A coroner has taken the unusual step of writing to a prison governor to warn that a prison officer who gave evidence at an inquest risked endangering the lives of current prisoners. The senior coroner for Derbyshire, Dr Robert Hunter, issued a prevention of future deaths report – usually sent after an inquest has concluded – during an inquest into the death of a female prisoner. The coroner issued the report after hearing evidence from the prison officer. He wrote that if the officer remained working at the prison she would be “endangering the lives of current prisoners”. The inquest into the death of Caroline Ann Hunt concluded on Thursday, but Hunter issued the report on 19 May while hearing evidence. Hunt, 53, killed herself on 29 September 2015at HMP Foston Hall, Derbyshire. She was the fourth woman to die at the prison that year. After one of the prison officers involved in the case gave evidence, the coroner said he had “grave concerns about her understanding of safety procedures” and that “should she remain operational”, she endangered the lives of inmates. The inquest heard that Hunt had been a remand prisoner at Foston Hall for two weeks. During that time she was distressed and anxious and had made repeated threats to kill herself. She made statements to that effect and other prisoners reported her suicidal intentions. The night before she died, she attempted to kill herself and her cell mate twice warned staff of the danger. Despite these warnings, a decision was made to place Hunt in a cell by herself. The inquest heard that the most senior prison officer on duty the day before Hunt died was suspended after her death. He faced disciplinary proceedings, but he resigned before any hearing took place. The jury gave a narrative verdict at the inquest which found that: • Staff had not been effectively trained. • Hunt should have been referred for a psychiatric assessment. • Staff response to her cell mate’s concern about her attempted suicide was not appropriate. • She should not have been placed in a single cell. Hunt’s daughter said her mother had mental health issues which led to her committing the offence that resulted in her being put on remand. It was her first offence. Hunt felt hopeless and frightened about her future, her daughter said. She said there were many missed opportunities to protect her mother from risk and she was saddened to hear that a further two women had died at the jail last year. “I had hoped my mother’s death would be the last and no other family should suffer as I have. The deaths leave families with endless pain and countless what ifs?”Deborah Coles, director of the charity Inquest, said it was shocking that 18 months after Hunt’s death a key staff member had a lamentable lack of understanding of suicide prevention policies. “This begs questions about the state of governance at a prison where four women died in 2015.” Coles added. The staff member whom the coroner criticised has been removed from prisoner-facing duties while she undertakes urgent training. A spokesman for the Ministry of Justice said: “This is a tragic case and our thoughts are with Caroline Ann Hunt’s family and friends. We recognise that there were failings in her care, and HMP Foston Hall has already put in place a number of measures to better support offenders following the PPO investigation. We will now carefully consider the findings of the inquest.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2017/may/27/talking-horses-saturdays-best-bets-for-goodwood-haydock-and-york","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-05-26T23:01:11Z","webTitle":"Talking Horses: Saturday's best bets for Goodwood, Haydock and York","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/may/27/talking-horses-saturdays-best-bets-for-goodwood-haydock-and-york","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/may/27/talking-horses-saturdays-best-bets-for-goodwood-haydock-and-york","fields":{"headline":"Talking Horses: Saturday's best bets for Goodwood, Haydock and York","bodyText":"Today’s ITV4 races Connections of the speedy, mudloving Quiet Reflection have been pinning their hopes on forecasts of significant rain at Haydock on Saturday morning. But those same forecasts deterred course officials from watering the track and, now that so much less rain seems to be expected, the result will surely be a fast surface at the Merseyside track today. I imagine Quiet Reflection will eventually be a non-runner in today’s Temple Stakes, leaving Washington DC as a strong favourite. He seems classy and consistent but might again find one too good in Kachy (4.05), from the Tom Dascombe yard that gets so many winners at this local track. Kachy loves a bit of fast ground and may have turned in a career best in the Palace House last time, but for making an unusually slow start, possibly because of another rival crossing him. Even so, he travelled kindly and ran on well. There may be more to come. 2.00 Goodwood Mount Logan might be the pick of these but had to work hard to scramble home in this race last year and it could be worth taking him on for this seasonal reappearance. Abdon needs to build on his reappearance fourth in the Earl Of Sefton but it was interesting to see his stablemate Autocratic, sixth in that race, come out and win the Brigadier Gerard on Thursday. 2.20 Haydock Having started last season strongly, Parliamentarian became slightly disappointing but is entitled, on breeding, to take another step forward this year. He comes from a hot yard and should appreciate the extra distance. 2.40 York Dal Harraild improved nicely through last season, finishing with a win at this level at Newmarket in September. He needed his reappearance run last season, however, and it may be the same this time round, as he was a modest fourth in the John Porter last month. William Haggas’s gelding can resume his progress here. 2.55 Haydock This track was riding fast yesterday and, with the rain disappearing out of the forecast, front-runners might prove hard to peg back if they go a sensible pace. This may work out well for Rusumaat, who tried to make all at Ascot last time but ran into a promising rival. He’s been showing a useful level of form in defeat. 3.10 Goodwood Horroob looks one to stick with on the back of two wins on Lingfield’s Polytrack, quickening nicely to take advantage of a gap on the most recent occasion. He seems to have a good reputation at Roger Varian’s yard and is still fairly treated, though this is a tricky track for a 7lb claiming jockey. 3.30 Haydock Clive Cox has another flashy sprinter in Harry Angel, who was beaten only by the top-class Blue Point at Ascot last time, giving that rival 4lb. The yard has not been in brilliant form but a couple of recent winners restores confidence. 3.50 York The safety blanket in this tricky sprint handicap is Out Do, twice a course and distance winner in 2015. He didn’t do much last year but descended to a beatable rating as a result and showed renewed promise when third on his reappearance. Meanwhile in Ireland ... 4.10 The Curragh The Irish 2,000 Guineas will not, alas, be shown on British terrestrial TV today, though you can watch it on At The Races. Churchill’s dominance of the three-year-old mile division might not survive beyond June but, for now, he is the unbeatable power and should follow up his Newmarket success, with two of his five rivals here being stablemates. Irishcorrespondent is unbeaten but takes a huge step up in class and his pedigree hints at limitations. Thunder Snow is a more plausible danger and only has two lengths to make on Churchill from their Dewhurst form but his abortive trip to Kentucky cannot have been the ideal preparation.

This week was no exception. But before the FA Cup final against Chelsea on Saturday, the manager brought some extra ingredients – exasperation, defiance and a series of digs; some veiled, others the equivalent of going in two-footed. Take the one that related to Tony Adams. The club’s former captain has a new book out, which led to one headline about how Wenger “couldn’t coach his way out of a paper bag”. Understandably, it went down badly with him. Adams also writes about the FA Cup final in 2001, when Arsenal lost to Liverpool and, according to him, Wenger threw his runners-up medal into a bin in the dressing room. “I don’t remember [that],” Wenger said. “Don’t trust too much to what Tony Adams says.” Wenger reheated another recent bug-bear when he segued into an apocalyptic vision for football in the coming decades. “Maybe we’ll have a robot on the bench who will make the decisions and the computer will analyse exactly what decisions he makes during the game,” he said. “You might not even have human beings on the bench anymore.” On 9 May, Wenger had talked for the first time about how computers could come to replace managers. “Maybe we will have enough computers around the manager to analyse the game and, straightaway, he pushes on the button and, after the game, comes out the team for the next game,” he said. Arsenal have come to rely, increasingly, on analytics – an approach driven by the chief executive, Ivan Gazidis – and it is not something that sits easily with Wenger, who has come to look more and more old school. At the heart of everything for Wenger is the notion of control, and at the end of surely the most divisive season of his career it is not difficult to paint him as being embattled to the point of paranoia. The issue of whether he stays or goes next month, after the expiry of his contract, has been allowed to cast long shadows over the campaign and drive the supporters to distraction. But Wenger was not about to put anyone out of their misery before the Cup final. There was one last dodge of the question and yet more reiterations of how he had always fought until the final day of his contracts. “This is not about me,” he said, sighing and, yet again, he made plain his incredulity that the subject should even be up for discussion which, in itself, was incredible. “I focus on football,” he said. “One of the big problems in the modern society is that the big companies sit there not any more to make the decisions that are good for the company but is it popular or not? I don’t care about that. I just want to always make a decision – is it right or is it wrong, is it good or not? All the rest for me is artificial debate.” Wenger believes that he has done enough to merit the new two-year deal that has been on the table since the early months of the season. He talked about how the Cup final would have zero bearing on the decision and of his intention to carry on as a manager next season, either at Arsenal or elsewhere. Wenger is addicted to the job. To his mind, 75 points is a respectable tally with which to finish the Premier League season and it has just been Arsenal’s misfortune that, for the first time, there have been four clubs who have collected more. And they could yet finish with a trophy. “Believe me, the 18 other managers in the league would like to be in our position on Saturday,” Wenger said. The omerta on Wenger’s position has, unsurprisingly, extended to the dressing room. Danny Welbeck, Per Mertesacker and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain were asked about it during the week and they said, variously, that they had no idea or they did not want to comment. Mertesacker had a typically strident view. “You cannot let yourself down or use excuses about the environment or the manager’s future,” he said. “This is not my approach and it is not the team’s approach. This is not our excuse. We have to look at ourselves in the mirror and see what’s next for us.” Welbeck and Oxlade-Chamberlain made it clear that although they were determined to win the Cup, it would go only a short way to making up for the failure to secure a top-four finish and Champions League football for next season. But they will carry hope to Wembley, largely because of the stability they have shown since Wenger’s switch to a 3-4-2-1 formation at Middlesbrough on 17 April. They have won eight of their nine matches with the system – the lone reverse being in the derby at Tottenham Hotspur. The Cup final is likely to be decided by how Wenger’s patched-up rearguard contend with Diego Costa, Eden Hazard &amp; Co. “Over the years, we have always played in a certain formation and I think teams get better at learning how to deal with us,” Oxlade-Chamberlain said. “When we changed the formation, that gave them something new to think about and the results have started coming.” Mertesacker said: “We feel more compact and accepting [of the need] sometimes to just defend. With a back four, we felt that we have to get the ball, we have to play, we have to press. But especially against Man City [in the Cup semi-final], we allowed ourselves just to defend from the box and not even open up too much. You have to adjust. Whatever is necessary for Arsenal, we do it.” The summer is certain to bring further challenges and the impression is of a club being buffeted by uncertainty. Alexis Sánchez, Mesut Özil and Oxlade-Chamberlain are among the players who are poised to enter the final year on their contracts and others, such as Héctor Bellerín, would be receptive to moves away. Sánchez is a prime target for Chelsea. Against it all, Wenger endures. He denies chucking medals in the bin but he has no time for trinkets and sentimentality. “You come to my house and you will be surprised,” he said. “I have no medals, no trophies, nothing. You would not even guess I am a football manager, apart from the fact that a game is on. “I always give my medals out. There is always a guy at the club who did not get one and I give mine to him.” Wenger describes himself as a person who is “not a back-looker, only forward”. At long last, the future is set to become clearer."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"education/2017/may/30/tef-uk-university-rankings-teaching-execellence-framework","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2017-05-30T06:00:00Z","webTitle":"TEF: big upsets expected in official UK university rankings","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2017/may/30/tef-uk-university-rankings-teaching-execellence-framework","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/education/2017/may/30/tef-uk-university-rankings-teaching-execellence-framework","fields":{"headline":"TEF: big upsets expected in official UK university rankings","bodyText":"Universities are preparing themselves for a shock in the government’s new official “gold, silver and bronze” league table, which will be published a week after the election, on 14 June. The new rankings, known as the Teaching Excellence Framework (TEF), will award grades based on factors including graduate employability and student satisfaction. There are expected to be some high-profile casualties. World-renowned universities including Bristol, the London School of Economics, King’s College London, Liverpool, Soas University of London and Goldsmiths are thought to be at risk of being awarded a bronze, which would mean they are unable to raise their fees in line with inflation after 2020. Fees and reputations are at stake, and while some university chiefs are preparing the public for a disappointing outcome by rubbishing the rankings, there are also fears that behind the scenes many are planning to purge academic staff in less successful departments in an attempt to do better next time. Sally Hunt, general secretary of the University and College Union, says: “We are expecting letters from universities saying that every single one is reorganising because of the TEF. They will call it prioritising successful departments, but it will mean narrowing the curriculum.” She adds: “There are some very successful teaching staff who have suddenly been told they need a PhD because of the TEF. I can’t honestly say anyone is safe.” The new rankings come at a time of upheaval in the sector. Manchester University, Manchester Metropolitan, Herriot-Watt, Southampton Solent and the University of South Wales have all announced large numbers of redundancies for financial reasons, or citing the government’s higher education bill – and Brexit. One university head, who does not want to be named, says: “The TEF is going to put the cat among the pigeons. And I doubt there is a university in the country that isn’t thinking about how to use it as a management tool.” Nick Hillman, director of the Higher Education Policy Institute thinktank, says universities have been looking much more closely at how their departments perform. “If there are two departments that bring you down low, that will surely lead to job losses,” he says. “There is a lot of money riding on being a silver institution rather than bronze.” There is even speculation that at least one big-name university is considering seeking an injunction against the Higher Education Funding Council for England, which implements the TEF, arguing it has reached an unreasonable conclusion using flawed data and with unfair consideration of the university’s submission. “I suspect it would be hard to win an action over data sets that already exist,” says Hillman. “But some people are saying you could use the threat of legal action to stop your damaging results being published, and then three months later you withdraw the case and sneak your results out quietly.” Many universities will push for the results of this first assessment, which they argue is blunt around the edges in terms of the data it is using, to be treated with scepticism by students and parents. Others, however, are going to revel in good news. Prof Dominic Shellard, vice-chancellor of De Montfort University, which is expected to net a gold ranking, says: “Those who seek to talk down these ratings publicly will struggle, because the metrics chosen are actually highlighting things that parents, applicants and students deeply care about when formulating their choice of university. They care about the percentage of graduates who have gone on to get a good job and how satisfied students are with their university.” London institutions, where student satisfaction and retention are generally lower, are expected to fare badly. Prof Ed Byrne, vice-chancellor of King’s College London, is hoping his university’s written submission to the TEF – which included an explanation of why they believed the data didn’t give a fair picture – will pull King’s up from a bronze ranking. He has already published the submission. “There is always room for improvement, but for the world-class institutions to be classed as bronze is ridiculous,” he says. “The TEF is a work in progress, and I think people are treating the first tranche as something you take with a pinch of salt. But the idea is a good one – universities are about education as well as research.” Dr Deborah Johnston, pro-director of learning and teaching at Soas University of London, says: “What we are concerned about is the bluntness of the labels. We view ourselves as a world-leading institution for the study of Asia, the Middle East and Africa. We are very well known as a leading institution, especially outside the UK.” She says, though, that Soas doesn’t fit neatly into the standard benchmarks the TEF uses. “Retention rates for students in London may not compare well with the national average. In our case some of our students are living at home and juggling family responsibilities, they might have financial issues caused by living costs in London, and it is frustrating that although up to a quarter of the students who leave their course actually come back into HE again, there is no room in the metrics to show that.” Prof Jane Powell, vice-provost for education at Surrey University, which is expected to get a gold rating, warns that parents and students should not base their choice of university solely on the new medals. “One of the potential risks of the TEF is that students and parents might be overly distracted by the medals from looking in depth at more detailed information relating to the course they want to study,” she says. But a survey published by international student recruitment firm Hobsons in April found that 22% of overseas students already view a gold rating in the TEF as the best way to judge quality in a UK institution. Like many academics Powell is worried about perceptions abroad. “The message to students in other countries has always been straightforward, that the UK offers an excellent education. Now, even though all the medals are intended to indicate excellence, the inference drawn by overseas applicants may be that this is not really the case,” she says."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"news/2017/may/26/corrections-and-clarifications","type":"article","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webPublicationDate":"2017-05-26T20:00:08Z","webTitle":"Corrections and clarifications","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2017/may/26/corrections-and-clarifications","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/2017/may/26/corrections-and-clarifications","fields":{"headline":"Corrections and clarifications","bodyText":"• The headline on a report about a retrospective exhibition of the American fashion designer Anna Sui’s work suggested incorrectly that it is at the Victoria and Albert Museum (Mix and mismatch: genius of Sui on display at the V&amp;A, 26 May, page 11).

What made that happen? In this extraordinary survey of the science of human behaviour, the biologist Robert Sapolsky takes the reader on an epic journey backwards through time, and through different scientific disciplines. His governing question is: what explains the fact that humans can massacre one another but also perform spectacular acts of altruistic kindness? Is one side of our nature destined to win out over the other? The backwards time-travel is an excellent organising principle. Seconds before our action, it is neuroscience that investigates what is going on in the brain; minutes to days before is the domain of endocrinology (hormonal fluctuations). Days to months before, we focus on the brain’s ability to learn and rewire itself. Sapolsky goes back through adolescence, childhood and gestation (including genetics), and, beyond the birth of the individual, to more distant causes still – those found in culture, evolutionary psychology, game theory and comparative zoology. He makes the book consistently entertaining, with an infectious excitement at the puzzles he explains, and wry dude-ish asides. (Humans, he notes, can “delay gratification for insanely long times” compared with other animals. “No warthog restricts calories to look good in a bathing suit next summer.”) He likes to call certain facts “boggling” when he is personally amazed by them; it’s charmingly infectious. This book is a miraculous synthesis of scholarly domains, and at the same time laudably careful in its determination to point out at every step the limits of our knowledge. Sapolsky offers a vivid account of a standard view before lining up complications or objections to it from other research, particularly in brain science. (Testosterone, for example, does not cause aggression but amplifies pre-existing tendencies for or against it. The actions of such molecules in general “depend dramatically on context”). In a phrase that has unfortunately become associated with the dishonest attempts to smuggle creationism into American schools, he is adept at “teaching the controversy”, often providing anecdotes of scientists with battling views from decades ago. Throughout, he insists on how much individual variability there is hidden beneath the statistical averages of studies, and how the explanation of nearly every human phenomenon is going to be “multifactorial”: dependent on many causes. The literature on one scientific question, he notes comfortingly, is “majorly messy”. Along the way there are many counterintuitive ideas and stern lessons. Empathy – feeling someone’s pain – is not as likely to lead to useful action as dispassionate sympathy, or “cold-blooded kindness”. Income inequality is concretely causally bad for the health of the poorer. There is a well-established link between rightwing authoritarianism and lower IQ. Genes are not destiny, and they are not “selfish” a la Dawkins; “we haven’t evolved to be ‘selfish’ or ‘altruistic’ or anything else – we’ve evolved to be particular ways in particular settings”. (According to one astonishing survey, 46% of women would save their own dog rather than a foreign tourist if both were menaced by a runaway bus. The evolutionary explanation is that they feel more “kinship” with the dog.) In general, if our worst behaviours are “the product of our biology”, so are our best ones. That Sapolsky’s heart is evidently in the right place makes it easy to discount certain hippyish outbursts such as that the invention of agriculture “was one of the all-time human blunders”, since it led to sedentary living and social hierarchy. Sure, but it also led to wine, science and books, which I’d suggest on balance makes it rather a good thing. More thorny is the point at which he comes to address the question of individual choice and responsibility. For nearly 600 pages, barring the odd mention of the “cognitive” aspects of human action, Sapolsky sidelines the question of what place conscious reasoning has in determining behaviour, among all the neurochemical, hormonal, developmental and evolutionary factors he has been discussing. Indeed, sometimes he writes as though it has no place at all, as when he asks what sensory input “triggered the nervous system to produce that behaviour”. He eventually nails his colours to the mast of strict determinism: every human action is inescapably caused by preceding events in the world, including events in the brain. So there can be no such thing as free will. (It follows, of course, that social systems such as that of criminal justice must be completely overhauled, as philosophers such as Ted Honderich have long suggested.) You think you can freely choose to do one thing or another? Forget it, Sapolsky says. It’s a common view, though by no means the overwhelming philosophical consensus. Notably, he prefers to cite mainly neuroscientists and legal scholars. Sapolsky ends the chapter with a display of his pleasingly undogmatic spirit, confessing that he finds it impossible actually to live his life as though he does not have free will. It’s perhaps worth noting, too, that one study he does not mention here (by Kathleen Vohs and Jonathan Schooler in 2008) implies that the idea we have free will, whether true or not, is a crucial placebo idea for a well-functioning society: in the experiment, subjects convinced they didn’t have free will were more likely to act unethically. But Sapolsky’s insistence on the truth of strict determinism poses wider problems for the way he frames the rest of his book. One thing he refreshingly emphasises is that reason and emotion (“cognition and affect”) always interact, and that there are advantages to “combining reason with intuition”. This is a welcome counterbalance to the recent misanthropic strain of psychology that seeks to downgrade rationality altogether, but it is not clear that, on Sapolsky’s own view, conscious reasoning can accomplish anything at all if decisions are inexorably determined by the laws of nature. Which poses a challenge to his own humanistic optimism. We are not at the mercy of our amygdala’s fearful response to human faces of a different race, he argues; we can dampen and overcome such prejudice through reflection. Yet on his own view, we cannot freely decide to do so. For the same reasons, it is unclear how much value there is in the author’s uplifting exhortations to think more carefully about our actions, and even to imbue politics with a new kind of science-based “peaceology”. Perhaps the idea is that such encouragement will be a new part of the causal chain affecting each individual’s behaviour, so compelling his readers to act more sociably. In which case I hope this book sells several billion copies. It remains debatable, though, whether strict determinism is compatible with Sapolsky’s final message of hope for humanity, as he tells inspiring stories about moral heroism in history – the helicopter officer who stopped the My Lai massacre, the Christmas Day football match during the first world war. Sapolsky is on the side of Steven Pinker’s argument, in The Better Angels of Our Nature, that humanity is overall getting less violent and nasty, and points to some lessons from the “social plasticity” demonstrated in troops of baboons, one of Sapolsky’s own specialities. He thus sets himself against conservative pessimism about brutish human nature. “Anyone who says that our worst behaviours are inevitable knows too little about primates, including us.” Yet the question remains: if human beings are simply reactive robots, slaves to natural law who are causally buffeted by a zillion factors of biology and circumstance, why would we have any say in whether things get better? Either they will or they won’t, but on this magisterial account it seems that we can’t really choose to do anything about it. • Behave is published by Penguin.

Nearly 10 minutes up the road Mikel Landa, Team Sky’s Spanish climber, stormed away from his fellow breakaway riders on the final ascent to win an absorbing 191km stage at Piancavallo. Quintana, the 2014 Giro winner, leads the overall standings by 38 seconds but with an individual time trial to come on the final day, which strongly favours Dumoulin’s talents, the Colombian will almost certainly need to increase his advantage in Saturday’s penultimate stage. Italy’s Vincenzo Nibali, the Giro winner in 2013 and 2016, remains third, 43sec from the lead, with the French rider Thibaut Pinot a further 10sec behind. An early breakaway was allowed to go nearly 10 minutes clear by the main contenders. A series of attacks by Luis León Sánchez and Rui Costa splintered the lead group as they began the long climb to the finish but it was Landa’s drive 10km from home which proved decisive. The Team Sky rider had come close to stage wins on two occasions already on this tour, including Thursday’s stage 18 when Tejay van Garderen beat Landa in a dash to the line. This time Landa left nothing to chance, chipping out a lead over Costa to claim the stage by 1 minute and 49 seconds from Costa, with French rider Pierre Rolland third. With the end of a long tour in sight, frustrations boiled over in the pack in the closing stages when Trek-Segafredo’s Eugenio Alafaci was cut up by Rory Sutherland. Enraged, Alafaci threw his bidon at the Movistar rider’s back. Sutherland immediately turned around and apologised but Alafaci could yet face punishment for the incident. Behind them raged the battle for the pink jersey, stoked by Dumoulin’s criticism on Thursday of his rivals’ tactics and Nibali’s response that the leader was getting “cocky”. On the final descent Movistar increased the pace, catching Dumoulin off guard, and when he tried to keep pace as the road steepened again he began to slide away from the main group. Dumoulin had only one Sunweb team-mate, Simon Geschke, to tow, and when Geschke blew out with 5km to go Dumoulin appeared in danger of losing major time. He managed to remain in relative contact and although Quintana took the lead, the advantage remains with Dumoulin. The question now facing the 28-year-old is whether he can keep in touch on Sunday’s mountain stage following another exhausting day in the saddle. “I made a rookie mistake in the beginning to sit at the back of the bunch when we went into the downhill,” Dumoulin said after the race. “With my bad legs [after Thursday’s tough stage] I needed to work hard to come back and that was unnecessary. I tried to limit my losses and I did that really well. Luckily my team were really strong today, they really saved me, otherwise it would have been a really bad day.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/may/27/libya-fallout-theresa-may-failed-terror","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-05-27T05:00:19Z","webTitle":"The Libya fallout shows how Theresa May has failed on terror | Paul Mason","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/may/27/libya-fallout-theresa-may-failed-terror","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/may/27/libya-fallout-theresa-may-failed-terror","fields":{"headline":"The Libya fallout shows how Theresa May has failed on terror","bodyText":"Salman Abedi was British by birth, Libyan by background, a radical Islamist by identity, loyal to a “caliphate” based in Raqqa, Syria. These facts should be the starting point of our response to the atrocity he perpetrated: the threat is global, yet our state is national, and our communities local. Our state and our communities were not strong enough to stop him. The time to discuss why is not after the election, but now. The “blowback theory”, which blames Islamist terrorism directly on western expeditionary warfare, is both facile and irrelevant in this case. By bombing Libya we did not enrage or radicalise young Muslims such as Abedi: we simply gave them space to operate in. And then, whatever the intelligence services were doing, the politicians took their eye off the ball. David Cameron was right to take military action to stop Gaddafi massacring his own people during the Libyan uprising of 2011: the action was sanctioned by the UN, proportionate, had no chance of escalating into an occupation. And Cameron and Nicolas Sarkozy had a stabilisation plan. The problem is they had no plan for what to do if their plan went wrong. Nor, it appears, did Cameron’s ministers concern themselves about how a failed state in Libya might affect the growth of global jihadism, and the domestic terror threat in the UK. In January 2016, in evidence to the foreign affairs committee, Liam Fox, defence secretary in 2011, was asked if the government had made an assessment of the threat of Islamic extremism among anti-Gaddafi rebels. Fox replied: “I do not recall reading anything of that nature. That is not to say it would not have been done, but I don’t recall reading such material … I do not recall reading any reports that set out the background of any Islamist activity to specific rebel groups.” It is an astonishing failure. Because, as the committee report makes clear, from February 2011 Islamist rebels detached themselves from the main rebel militia, refused to take orders from it and killed its main commander. By October, the situation was out of control. Theresa May, as home secretary, sat through 55 national security council meetings on Libya between March and November 2011. The national security adviser’s “lessons learned” report makes no mention of any Home Office contribution to that body’s decisions, nor any mention of the implications for domestic terror. It is now reported that MI5 was facilitating the travel of non-jihadi British Libyans to fight in Tripoli. The minister responsible for that decision would have been May. Did she ask about the impact of the Libyan fighting on the terror threat here? That would be something the newspapers, if they did their job, would be shouting at her today, instead of hurling insults at Jeremy Corbyn. In July 2011, as the fighting raged, May did warn that al-Qaida was seizing arms in Libya. However, she concluded, because of the Arab spring, “al-Qaida is failing”. Unfortunately it was the Arab spring that failed, and the rise of Islamic State was one of the results. In January this year May pulled the plug on any future strategy of regime change and foreign intervention, implicitly criticising Cameron’s Libya strategy. Speaking in Philadelphia, she decried “the failed policies of the past”. But it is the job of a government to do more than decry things. It has to deal with the mess created. And to do that, it has to ask a question May never bothered with: are cuts to the police and defence budgets sustainable in the context of the increased terror threat? May’s response, to the rooms full of police federation reps who did raise it, year after year, was to reject the premise of the question. Now, with the terror threat at critical, she has had to deploy troops to guard key installations. No matter by how much the budgets of GCHQ and MI5 have been boosted, in an attack such as this – and the threat is ongoing – it is the resilience of police, fire and A&amp;E departments that is tested. The troop deployment is a tacit admission that this resilience is under strain. Reversing police budget cuts now, as Labour has promised, should be mandatory. If anything, the recent spate of attacks – both failed and successful – shows the need for a more strategic rethink. Britain needs the equivalent of the French GIGN, the full-time paramilitary force deployed to deal with the Bataclan attack. Such a force would need a new legal framework and heavy investment in extra resources – not, as now, resources borrowed from frontline police and special forces. But above all Britain needs to be in active collaboration with security services across Europe. Reports suggest the explosives used by Abedi, the bomb design and the networks utilised were those of radicalised north Africans living in European cities. As they constructed their Brexit strategy, senior civil servants briefed journalists that May was prepared to threaten the EU with withdrawal of security and intelligence co-operation. May stupidly included the threat in her article 50 letter, later claiming it was not a threat at all. How hollow and foolish that all sounds now. The Manchester massacre should be a wake-up call. This is a government of amateurs; Fox didn’t bother to ask about the terror implications when we bombed Libya; May lost 19,000 police in the face of reasoned warnings. Unfortunately the enemy we are fighting are professionals. Jeremy Corbyn has, ignored by the commentators, repeatedly used prime minister’s questions to warn about the impact of police cuts on our security. He has – at every point – done what May and Fox did not: asked the right questions. Laugh, if you want, at Diane Abbott’s failure to answer the question: how much would 10,000 extra police cost? But it was the wrong question. With the Isis caliphate about to collapse in Raqqa and Mosul, spreading its survivors into the refugee trails of Europe, I don’t care how much 10,000 new officers cost. The right question is: how soon can they start?"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/2017/may/27/how-libyan-crises-could-fuel-islamic-extremism","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-05-27T05:00:19Z","webTitle":"How Libyan reality could pave way for more extremism | Jason Burke","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/may/27/how-libyan-crises-could-fuel-islamic-extremism","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/may/27/how-libyan-crises-could-fuel-islamic-extremism","fields":{"headline":"How Libyan crises could fuel Islamic extremism","bodyText":"The visit of Peter Millett, the British ambassador to Tripoli, was eventful. From early Friday morning, parts of the capital had echoed to exchanges of gunfire between two of the armed factions fighting for control of the city. At around 10am, Millett took to Twitter to report hearing “explosions and artillery fire”. The ambassador’s inadvertent venture into frontline reporting underlined the gulf between today’s reality and the hopes for Libya in 2011 when Colonel Muammar Gaddafi – who had ruled since 1969 – was ousted by rebels with the support of Nato airpower. Libya is now central to the investigation into Salman Abedi, the 22-year-old who bombed Manchester Arena earlier this week. Abedi’s parents left Libya a year before his birth in the UK in 1992, and are thought to have returned to Tripoli around five years ago. Abedi himself is thought to have spent time in Libya in recent years, and was in Tripoli a week before his attack. His father, Ramadan, and brother Hashem were detained in Tripoli by a local militia shortly after the attack, responsibility for which was claimed by Islamic State. The link has prompted headlines describing Libya as a “hotbed” of jihadi activism. Experts, however, say the situation is more complicated and warn against exaggerating the strength of Islamic militant groups there. Isis has been forced out of the two cities on the Mediterranean coast it once controlled and, though it still has a presence in Tripoli and elsewhere, has scattered into shifting desert camps. Its propaganda now rarely mentions Libya, which United Nations experts once mooted as a possible alternative base for the group if it was expelled from its strongholds in Syria and Iraq. Al-Qaida uses the remote south of Libya as a rear base for planning and logistics but has no territorial control and does not seem to be seeking to expand. Local groups, such as Ansar al-Sharia, are fragmented and weak. Aaron Zelin, a senior fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, said “Libya is relevant but not at the forefront” of Islamic extremist activity across the region. The suggestion that Abedi was radicalised or trained in the country and was dispatched to the UK by a Libyan network, possibly linked to Isis, remains plausible. The country has a long history of exporting extremists. Libyans fought in Afghanistan against Soviet forces in the 1980s, with several veterans taking up key roles in al-Qaida in the 1990s. Others returned home to form the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group, which led a campaign of violence against Gaddafi’s regime. Documents compiled by Gaddafi’s intelligence services have apparently backed up the charge that Abedi’s father was linked to the group, although former members in Libya deny the connection. Hundreds more travelled to Iraq to fight alongside insurgents in the aftermath of the US-led invasion of 2003. More recently, up to 2,000 made their way to Syria to join Isis and other extremist groups, while the gunmen who killed 38 tourists in Sousse, Tunisia, reportedly trained at an Isis base in the west of Libya. There is also evidence that groups in Libya have sought to attack Europe. German investigators believe Anis Amri, who drove a truck into a crowded Christmas market in Berlin last year, had contacts there. And US officials said airstrikes in January that killed 80-100 people in Isis camps in the west of the country were carried out to eliminate a threat to Europe. But if Islamic militant groups in Libya are fragmented and scattered, they are still able to exploit the deepening economic, social and political crisis in the country, blamed by some on the 2011 intervention by western forces. Last year, the UK’s foreign affairs select committee delivered a scathing report accusing David Cameron of launching the 2011 intervention without thorough intelligence analysis and of shirking a moral responsibility to help reconstruct the country. The result of French, British and US intervention, the report found, “was political and economic collapse ... humanitarian and migrant crises, widespread human rights violations and the spread of Gaddafi regime weapons across the region”. Successive efforts to negotiate a political deal among rival factions have failed. Since 2014, Libya has been divided, with the authority of the 17-month-old internationally-backed Government of National Accord barely extending beyond Tripoli. “It all comes back to a functional and sustainable political settlement … but we don’t see the international interest and investment necessary,” said Tim Eaton, a Middle East specialist at London’s Chatham House. The youth unemployment rate is close to 40%, while inflation tops 30%. There are rolling electricity outages and a severe lack of hard currency. Low oil prices and instability have hampered crucial oil production. Italy is currently the only western nation with a full-time diplomatic presence in Tripoli. With an ongoing low-level civil war and a deep rivalry between key political players splitting the leadership of key institutions, the chances of economic improvement in the near future are slim. One recent report spoke of the creation of a series of “city states” across much of the country. Elsewhere, tribes – the basic political unit in Libya – are increasingly powerful, with relations evolving in an ever-changing matrix of alliances and feuds. Senior British diplomats have raised the prospect of Libya becoming “Somalia on the Mediterranean”. This risks greater problems in the future, experts say. “Isis in Libya is a symptom, not a cause, of what is happening in the country,” said Mary Fitzgerald, a researcher specialising in the country. “The danger is that the continuing security and political vacuum recreates the environment that Isis saw as an opportunity and then exploited to go from a toehold to a foothold and then some. New groups might be able to do the same in the future.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/may/26/election-social-care-theresa-may-dementia-tax","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-05-26T15:52:03Z","webTitle":"It’s a snap election.

But let’s not make snap decisions on social care","bodyText":"After the Manchester attack it is only natural that the public will be looking to political parties to set out how they will deal with terrorist threats and radicalisation. However, when we cast our ballots on 8 June, most of us will be thinking of the vast array of challenges we will face over the next five years. From the NHS and schools to jobs and climate change, and of course Brexit – this country is at a historic turning point. Yet we have just 12 days to debate and digest the ideas being put forward by the parties to address these challenges. Today we are seeing some of the broader issues creep back on the agenda, but there is one that is yet to resurface – social care. On Monday evening Theresa May was reeling after her humiliating manifesto U-turn and an excruciating BBC interview with Andrew Neil. Her decision to introduce a cap had raised futher questions not only about the policy and May’s leadership style, but about the cost to the exchequer. Yet at the Institute of Fiscal Studies’ (IFS) presentation of its analysis of the financial implications of the party manifestos this morning, not one journalist asked about the Conservatives’ social care policy. Of course, the Tories will be keen to erase all this from our memories, but we must not draw a line under the issue. Right now, four in five councils can’t cope with demand for elderly care. Social care took a £4.6bn cut between 2010 and 2015. With demographic changes in the UK population, funding for social care is going to become an even bigger issue over the next few years. The Office for National Statistics has projected that one in five of the people in Britain will be over 65 by 2035, rising to almost one in four by 2045. A survey by LSE’s Personal Social Services Research Unit found that social care costs for older people are projected to reach £17.5bn by 2035 – up from £6.9bn in 2015. Clearly, business as usual will not solve this problem. The Conservatives’ proposal on social care fails on principles of fairness because it does not consider the lottery of illness, in particular long-term conditions such as dementia. Policies that make individuals personally liable for the potentially devastating financial costs of their own illness break with the postwar consensus to share the risk across the whole population. Second, while the policy was sold as a way to address inequality between generations, because it is not coupled with ways to address high debt, low pay and high housing costs among younger people, it only equalises misery across generations. And third, it is likely to fail in practice because many older people will just sign their houses over to their children in a similar way to how most currently avoid an inheritance tax. Watching my own mother have to fight harder and harder for appropriate care over the last decade was heartbreaking. So too was observing increasingly stressed care workers, often migrants on zero-hour contracts and on minimum wages. Not only do we need to get back to talking about how we pay for social care: we also need talk about linked issues of immigration and workers’ rights. This isn’t just a theoretical exercise – these are real lives, with real implications for our wellbeing, whether we are those who need care, those who depend on it to keep our loved ones properly looked after, or those working in the sector. Today, the IFS found that under current Conservative proposals we will face another five years of public spending cuts. That’s huge news. Snap election results should not be based on snap decisions from voters. We have to give such crucial issues as social care a proper airing."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/may/27/doctor-in-sudan-foreign-aid-saves-lives","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-05-27T23:05:41Z","webTitle":"As a doctor in Sudan, let me tell you: foreign aid saves lives | Tom Catena","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/may/27/doctor-in-sudan-foreign-aid-saves-lives","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/may/27/doctor-in-sudan-foreign-aid-saves-lives","fields":{"headline":"As a doctor in Sudan, let me tell you: foreign aid saves lives","bodyText":"My heart sank last week when President Trump announced proposed cuts in the diplomatic and foreign aid budget. The budget suggests cuts in aid to international organisations by 44%, humanitarian assistance funding would drop by 31% and global health programmes would be cut by 25%. While many people think the budget has little chance of passing in Congress, it does, however, provide an alarming sense of the Trump administration’s priorities. But its not just a US concern. Earlier this month, the Australian government announced it will cut $303m from the foreign aid budget over two years. In the UK, Theresa May’s pledge to continue meeting the UN’s 0.7% aid target was a great relief, although this good news has since been tarnished by the claim that poverty reduction in the world’s poorest countries risks being diluted by the UK government devoting a bigger share of its aid budget to pursuing the national interest. This comes at a time when the world faces its worst humanitarian crisis since 1945, according to the UN. Twenty million people face starvation without an immediate injection of funds in Yemen, South Sudan, Somalia and Nigeria. I keenly observe these developments, not as part of the international aid community but as someone who sees the desperate need for aid every waking hour of the day. Since 2007, I have been the only doctor permanently based in Sudan’s Nuba Mountains, home to 750,000 people. It is also a conflict zone. War has raged since 2011 between the Government of Sudan, and the Sudanese People’s Liberation Movement. The people of this region have suffered beyond belief, with aerial bombardments a daily occurrence for years. Villages and farms have been targeted, forcing the population to flee into the mountains, where they have little or no food. I have experienced the atrocities and hardships of this war, firsthand. I regularly treat up to 400 people a day. Adults and children with horrific burns across their bodies, toddlers with lost limbs due to shrapnel wounds and people suffering from leprosy or malnutrition. We don’t have access to medical technology. Supplies are limited. We use decades-old treatments and often don’t have electricity or running water. We don’t even have reliable telephones. But I’m always on call, delivering babies, treating cancer, training my staff and, all too often, repairing the wounds inflicted by war, using what few resources we have, and with support from my incredible team. The bombardments have stopped for now, but the suffering of the people remains. The biggest problem is a severe shortage of food. We are on the border with South Sudan and we suffer the same famine conditions and government forces have blocked the routes for food and aid. It is a truly desperate situation. The sad truth is that most world leaders and humanitarian organisations have virtually abandoned the people of the Nuba Mountains. Most types of foreign aid are non-existent. I am needed here just as much, if not more so, as I was when I came here in 2007; so is the support of the international community. Only seven countries meet the 0.7% of global national income target for aid. Countries that should be at the forefront of efforts to prevent catastrophes such as famine and to relieve the effects of drought on some of the world’s poorest people are turning a blind eye. This sends a worrying message that leading economies are no longer interested in being part of efforts to mitigate suffering. Part of the problem is that the narrative needs to change. Foreign aid has become a politically divisive issue. People assume the money is misspent, wasted on bureaucracy or that foreign aid just doesn’t work. Of course, the system is far from perfect. In an ideal world, it would not just be about how much is spent to fix the immediate problems, but, rather, about the impact aid has on sustaining stable governments, tackling corruption, protecting human rights and the rule of law. Nonetheless, in the short term, I see what a positive impact humanitarian aid can have. It can literally make the difference between life and death. There are people doing incredible work around the world every day to help preserve human life. These are not people tied to the international aid system, but people who independently tackle the needs of the most helpless and destitute and do so at great risk. But individuals cannot tend to the world’s afflicted alone. The international community must provide the resources to help us better serve the people who need our services. At a time when famine is reaching a crisis point in parts of Africa, and countless children are dying of starvation, the need for support from the world’s richest nations is even more critical.

After months of threats and harassment from corrupt police officers, which forced him to abandon his job and family in Acapulco, Méndez sought asylum in the US. The 26-year-old reporter thought the US would protect him, given the unprecedented wave of deadly violence against the press in Mexico, which the country’s government seems unable or unwilling to curtail. He was wrong. Méndez was detained for more than a hundred days in overcrowded custody centres, shackled like a criminal and subjected to hateful taunts from security guards. Eventually, he abandoned his asylum claim and returned to Mexico after he was twice denied bail in the US and told that he faced at least another year held in grim conditions. “The guards didn’t care why I was there, what I was running from, they treat everyone like criminals. I couldn’t take it,” Méndez told the Guardian. “Of course I was scared [to return], but believe me, it was unbearable.” He was right to be scared. Méndez was dropped off on Mexican soil less than 24 hours after veteran journalist Javier Valdez was gunned down in broad daylight in Culiacan, Sinaloa. Valdez, 50, was an award winning journalist who fearlessly reported on Mexico’s drug wars from the home turf of one of its most powerful groups: Joaquin “El Chapo” Guzman’s Sinaloa cartel. Valdez was the sixth journalist murdered in Mexico this year, confirming its inglorious ranking as the most dangerous country in the western hemisphere for press. More than 100 journalists have been killed in the country since 2000, and 20 others have disappeared. At least 10 have claimed asylum in the US over the past decade, according to Reporters Without Borders (RWB). But Méndez is the first to be refused bail in what campaigners fear could set a dangerous precedent amid America’s increasingly hostile stance against migrants and refugees. “Refusing Martín bail marks a new political position under the new president. It’s very regrettable and worrying because this should be a question of human rights and humanitarian support, not the politics of Trump,” said Balbina Flores of RWB, which campaigned for Méndez’s release. Mendez’s hometown, Acapulco – in the southern state of Guerrero – once attracted Hollywood’s most glittering stars to its casinos and beaches. Now it’s ranked one of the most violent cities in Mexico. Méndez worked on the local daily Novedad Acapulco, covering breaking news and the police. His ordeal was triggered not by a corruption exposé or reports on the drug war, but a seemingly ordinary traffic incident. On the 22 February 2016, he went to the scene of an accident involving a police truck. “Instead of helping the injured passengers, the police were abusing them,” said Méndez. “I started taking photographs when they grabbed a wounded man and pushed him against the wall. That’s when the problem began.” Officers took his camera and ID card, before roughing him up and ordering him to leave. The police were part of paramilitary squadron inaugurated by president Enrique Peña Nieto in 2014. Méndez was shaken up but published the story the following day,on the police abuse he had witnessed. The threatening phone calls started immediately, followed by harassment in the streets. He was told to take down the article, or suffer the consequences. A couple of weeks later several armed men came to his home, pointed a gun at his face, and warned him to be quiet. By now terrified, Méndez moved to another city in Guerrero, but the intimidating calls continued. He changed his number and moved to across country finding odd jobs to keep afloat, but the assailants kept phoning him. “I realized there was no place in Mexico where they wouldn’t find me. That’s why I decided to seek asylum in the US,” said Méndez. Méndez was held in three different detention centres over four months including the West Texas Detention Facility one in Sierra Blanca – known by detainees as el gallinero (the chicken coop). There, about 100 men – including Africans, Iraqis, Central Americans and Mexicans – were crammed into quarters designed to hold 60. According to Méndez, it was infested with mold, rats and snakes, and the food – typically oat gruel with soya pellets – was inedible. On one occasion, during a move, Méndez was shackled with a chain fastened tightly around his midriff for 26 hours. “The guards screamed at us with disgust, they treated us like rubbish. You don’t know how much the people are suffering in there,” he said. US immigration courts are buckling amid a backlog of 600,000 cases nationwide. Meanwhile more than 400 undocumented migrants are being detained every day – 38% higher than last year. When Méndez finally appeared before a judge in early May, he was told the next hearing wouldn’t be until August. He broke down. “I couldn’t take it, I agreed to be repatriated.” Méndez cannot go home to Acapulco and the Guardian is withholding his current whereabouts for protection. “I don’t think I can ever go back, or at least not for years. Right now I just need a job, any job; I’ll probably end up in a clothes store.” He wants to get back to reporting but without local contacts, it’s a struggle. Amid mounting international condemnation about the killing of journalists with impunity, Peña Nieto was stirred to condemn the murder of Valdez and promised to improve press protection. But like many journalists, Méndez is skeptical anything will change. “It’s a total lie, it’s what the government says every time a journalist is murdered but nothing ever changes,” said Méndez. When he was threatened, he said, he reported the intimidation to a human rights group but not the Mexican authorities. “Why would I? Those who go to the authorities are the first ones to die.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"global-development/2017/jun/05/take-a-stand-indian-families-returning-dowries-dahez-roko-abhiyan-campaign","type":"article","sectionId":"global-development","sectionName":"Global development","webPublicationDate":"2017-06-05T09:00:00Z","webTitle":"'We decided to take a stand': why some Indian families are returning dowries","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2017/jun/05/take-a-stand-indian-families-returning-dowries-dahez-roko-abhiyan-campaign","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2017/jun/05/take-a-stand-indian-families-returning-dowries-dahez-roko-abhiyan-campaign","fields":{"headline":"'We decided to take a stand': why some Indian families are returning dowries","bodyText":"When Safik Ansari decided to marry off his daughter, he told the village chief that his paltry income from pulling a rickshaw meant he was unable to pay the groom an appropriate dowry. Although India banned dowry payments in 1961, the custom remains widespread and Ansari was preparing to go door-to-door seeking money from wealthier villagers. To his surprise, however, the chief said he would not have to pay one. The local Dahez Roko Abhiyan (DRA), or stop dowry campaign, would help him with the wedding arrangements, explained the chief. The DRA is an initiative to tackle the dowry problem in Muslim areas, but its creators hope it will spread to the Hindu community and other religious groups. Ansari explained the benefits to him. “Members of the DRA put me in contact with a boy in a nearby village and, as they directed, I sent a marriage proposal to his family,” he said. “They accepted the proposal and the family has not demanded any dowry. And next week my daughter is going to get married to that boy. “The boy earns well. It’s a very big relief that I don’t have to pay any dowry,” said Ansari, who lives in Neura village, in the Palamu district of Jharkhand state. Ansari earns less than £3 a day, and in many areas of India it is common for a groom to demand a dowry of 100,000 to 150,000 rupees (£1,550-£2,320). “Families from his income group often go begging in order to give marriageable daughters a dowry,” said Haji Mumtaz Ali, who heads the DRA campaign. “Other parents sell their farmland to come up with a dowry. And some parents take out high-interest loans from money lenders and get trapped with huge debts. “The plight of many families with daughters in our region made us decide to take a stand against paying dowries.” The practice elicits extreme responses. Some women have committed suicide after being harassed over paying a dowry. Others have been murdered by their husbands or in-laws for not meeting the demands of a groom’s family. India’s National Crime Records Bureau counts as many as 8,000 dowry deaths annually. Last year Ali, a businessman from the Latehar district, convened a meeting of Muslim community leaders, imams and qazis, or Muslim marriage registrars, to discuss the problem. The participants, who came from the Latehar, Palamu and Garhwa districts, called for a region-wide anti-dowry campaign. The DRA was born. “We travelled to different Muslim areas and held seminars and meetings and explained to people how the practice of dowry goes against the teachings of Islam. We have involved imams, qazis and community leaders in all Muslim villages in the three districts,” Ali said. He has been amazed by the support for the campaign.Thousands of volunteers across the district have been recruited to tell a DRA member when they hear about a dowry. DRA teams contact the families of the bride and groom to counsel them against giving or demanding a dowry. In most cases, they are successful. “Before we started this campaign, the prevalence of dowry among Muslims in our region was as high as 95%. Now it has come down to around 5%,” said DRA member Shamim Rizwi. “It’s a matter of time, but we are sure we will one day succeed to make Muslim marriages in this region completely free from dowry.” Qazis in the three districts have pledged not to solemnise a marriage if the bridegroom has taken a dowry. About 800 families from the three Jharkhand districts have collectively returned more than 60 million rupees to brides’ families in the past year. In one case, a family returned 7,000 rupees they had taken when a son had marriage 19 years earlier. The campaign has won praise from local officials. Ameet Kumar, deputy commissioner of Palamu district, said that, inspired by the DRA campaign, Hindu leaders in at least one area have launched a similar initiative. “I think in the coming days we will see the rise of such anti-dowry campaigns across more Hindu villages in the region,” said Kumar. “I have asked our social welfare officers and other community leaders to help spread the DRA campaign.” Researchers have blamed the practice of giving dowries for the abortion of girls. “Female foeticide is rare among Muslims, but, it is rampant in Hindu society, especially in urban areas,” said journalist and activist Santosh Prasad. “If a powerful DRA-like campaign became widespread, I am sure the rate of foeticide will drop.” Ali explained that he launched his DRA hoping it would spread across all religions. “Our DRA came up as an experiment among Muslims. The campaign has met with massive success. Now, we will be happier if we see it spread among Hindus as well,” he said. “We know parents of girls in Hindu society also suffer because of the pressure of dowry. How happy they would be if the practice were abolished.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2017/may/27/extremism-terrorism-far-right-neo-nazi-devon-arthurs","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-05-27T09:00:24Z","webTitle":"Pathway to extremism: what neo-Nazis and jihadis have in common","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/may/27/extremism-terrorism-far-right-neo-nazi-devon-arthurs","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/may/27/extremism-terrorism-far-right-neo-nazi-devon-arthurs","fields":{"headline":"Pathway to extremism: what neo-Nazis and jihadis have in common","bodyText":"When 18-year-old Devon Arthurs burst into a Florida smoke shop with a pistol and took customers and an employee hostage, he told them that he was upset about America bombing Muslim countries. After Tampa police officers talked him into releasing his hostages and got him in handcuffs, Arthurs made references to “Allah Mohammed” and told the officers: “This wouldn’t have had to happen if your country didn’t bomb my country.” He said he had already killed several people. Arthurs directed police to an apartment, where two men he described as his friends were found dead, both of them shot multiple times in the head and upper body. A third friend, Brandon Russell, was standing outside the apartment in army camouflage, weeping, according to court documents. The path to radicalisation Arthurs described to the police after his arrest last Friday was an unexpected one. Originally, he said, he and his three friends had all been neo-Nazis. But at some stage, Arthurs had converted to Islam. According to police and court documents, he told officers that he killed his friends for disrespecting his new religion. His behavior had a dual motivation, Arthurs explained, according to an affidavit from Tampa police: to raise awareness about anti-Muslim sentiment and “to take some of the neo-Nazis with him”. Terrorists motivated by far-right extremism and by Islamist extremism share similar tactics, a similar brutality, and a similar desire to remake the global democratic order. But they are usually considered enemies at opposite ends of the political spectrum. Far right terror attacks in Europe have been motivated by opposition to Muslim immigration. But Arthur’s switch in allegiance raises a key question for analysts looking at the process of radicalisation: to what extent the factors that attract people to extremism are specific to a particular ideology at all. At least two neo-Nazi sites denounced the murders, mourned the victims, and described Arthurs as a former commenter who had eventually been banned for his comments about Islam and terrorism. Both sites described the murders as “a Muslim terror plot” against a neo-Nazi group. However, officials at the FBI and at the UK’s domestic intelligence agency, MI5, say little distinguishes the “pathways to violence” taken by extremists following different ideologies. One UK official said “the mechanics of radicalisation” were broadly similar in all cases. “Our studies on both jihadis and rightwingers, and also school shooters and such like, found very little difference in terms of … pathways. It’s like when your immune system is down. You can guess you’ll get sick, but what sickness you contract depends on what you are exposed to,” said Paul Gill, an expert in extremism at the University College London. Though it is almost impossible to create a typical terrorist profile, some research shows that “seekers” who are looking for a particular form of “brotherhood” or cause that can give their lives meaning are particularly prone to radicalisation. There is also evidence that a sudden destabilising event – or even a minor incident that has a powerful emotional impact – can make an individual vulnerable. But ideology can be secondary to a “propensity for violence”. “This guy [Arthur] has only changed the T-shirt [of] what his violence is about,” Gill said. Arthurs also accused Russell, his surviving friend and a member of the army national guard, of visiting online neo-Nazi chat rooms, where he discussed killing people and bombing infrastructure, according to an FBI complaint. Russell confirmed to police that he had neo-Nazi beliefs and said he was part of a group called AtomWaffen, according to the FBI complaint against him. But he said the explosive materials in his apartment had been used for a university engineering club, according to the complaint. AtomWaffen, according to a thread on the online fascist forum Iron March, claimed about 40 members across the country, and had gained publicity in the past year for posting racist and neo-Nazi recruitment posters on university campuses – a tactic common in recent months among several American extremist youth groups, including Identity Evropa and Vanguard America. On Tuesday, Iron March posted a statement mourning Arthurs’ alleged victims, Jeremy Himmelman, 22, and Andrew Oneschuk, 18, and offering support for Russell, who they said was being unfairly targeted by law enforcement and the media. They described the attack as a “Muslim terror plot” and said Arthurs’ three friends were “completely innocent of any accusation that the group conducted or advocated, or planned for terrorist acts”. Alyssa Himmelman, the sister of Jeremy, told the Associated Press her brother had been staying with a neo-Nazi because he needed a cheap place to live, not because he shared those beliefs. Russell’s lawyer Ian Goldstein declined to answer specific questions about the case, but in an email said: “There is a large amount of misinformation being circulated about my client right now.” Although neo-Nazis and Islamist militants may follow similar paths to extremism, studies have revealed significant differences in their behavior once radicalised. Recent research has showed Islamic militant attackers are more likely to tell friends or family or other associates about their plans of violence: 71% of jihadis “leak” such information, compared with 53% of rightwing extremists. Experts said that while there were obvious ideological elements that both neo-Nazi and radical Islamic extremism shared – such as a virulent antisemitism – there were also clear differences. “If you are looking at racist extremists and religious extremists, one thing that is striking is that religions allow entry and exit from the group – through conversion or apostasy – but you can’t change what the extremists consider as your ‘race’. They offer competing absolute visions,” said JM Berger, author of Jihad Joe, a study of Islamic extremists in America. Berger has also studied rightwing militancy. “If someone has a profound identity crisis, you can see how they might not find the certainty they are looking for with neo-Nazism and look to the Islamic State for something even more absolute,” Berger said. Such cases are rare, but they do occur. Joseph Jeffrey Brice once idolized Timothy McVeigh – who killed 168 people with a truck bomb in Oklahoma City in 1995 and was “a self-declared, conservative, rightwing Christian”– but became interested in radical Islamic extremism after a homemade bomb nearly killed him in 2010. He was later jailed for terrorist offences including sending detailed instructions for “open source” bombmaking to an undercover FBI agent who he thought was an Islamic militant. In February, a 26-year-old suspected Islamic militant was arrested in Germany on suspicion of planning a terrorist act, storing “items and chemicals” for manufacturing explosives and spreading Isis propaganda online. Local media reported that “Sascha L” supported a neo-Nazi group, called Muslims “cockroaches” and posted videos calling for attacks on immigrants in Germany before his conversion to Islam some time in 2014. A disproportionately high number of militants involved in plots in the west have been converts. In the UK between 2001 and 2013, 12% of “homegrown jihadis” were converts, but less than 4% of the overall Muslim population were. Meanwhile, as many as 41% of US-born alleged militants are converts, while just 23% of the Muslim population as a whole are converts. “With lone actors, they tend to jump around,” said Gill. “They are often looking for something to give their lives meaning. Many are converts [who are] looking for identity and answers.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"stage/2017/may/28/mark-morris-pepperland-sgt-peppers-royal-court-liverpool-review-beatles","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2017-05-28T07:00:04Z","webTitle":"Mark Morris: Pepperland review – Beatles with a touch of Broadway shuffle","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/may/28/mark-morris-pepperland-sgt-peppers-royal-court-liverpool-review-beatles","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2017/may/28/mark-morris-pepperland-sgt-peppers-royal-court-liverpool-review-beatles","fields":{"headline":"Mark Morris: Pepperland review – Beatles with a touch of Broadway shuffle","bodyText":"In May 1967, 50 years ago last Friday, the Beatles released their eighth studio album, Sgt Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band. Technically and musically innovative, the LP’s 13 tracks wove together the absurd, the surreal and the poignant to mesmerising effect, while at the same time remaining imaginatively rooted in the lives of the working-class people of Liverpool. The album would prove to be one of the most influential art-pop creations of the late 20th century, and today Liverpool remains a place of cultural pilgrimage, with the Beatles “industry” contributing more than £80m annually to the city’s coffers. Sgt Pepper at 50 was conceived as a celebration of the Beatles’ legacy. The festival, which brings together artists as disparate as Jeremy Deller, Judy Chicago and DJ Spooky, all of them inspired by the album’s songs, opened on Thursday night with the premiere of Mark Morris’s Pepperland. The American choreographer is based in Brooklyn, and his response to the album has been to take half a dozen tracks, relocate them somewhere not too far off Broadway, and reinvent them as jazzy show tunes for the 15 dancers of his company. He accomplishes this with the help of composer Ethan Iverson, who subjects the songs to playful but respectful deconstruction. There’s even a theremin player (Rob Schwimmer) making strange electronic magic. The choreography is deft and nuanced, at times skimming across the music’s bright surface, at times dipping deeper. In With a Little Help from My Friends, Morris gives us a noodling diagonal which fractures into spritzy petits jetés, splashing the stage with the cerise, turquoise and hot orange of Elizabeth Kurtzman’s cool-cat costumes. An Iverson adagio sees three couples, two of them same-sex, drifting in tenderly absorbed circles; and then, in When I’m Sixty-Four, Morris introduces a kick-line, undercutting the perkiness of Lennon and McCartney’s melody with skittering dashes of percussion and quickfire switches of rhythm. Like so much of Morris’s work, the number combines cheery wit with a sly subversiveness. The final image is of a woman throwing her male partner over her shoulder and carrying him off stage. “Will you still need me, will you still feed me... ?” the music asks. Well, maybe. For the most part Morris is more interested in the fun he can have with the music than in providing a commentary on its much-explored themes. There are nods to the text: dancers mime to the actions described in A Day in the Life (“dragged a comb across my head”), and leopard-crawl downstage to the words “the English Army had just won the war”, but he’s primarily concerned with mood rather than with meaning. There’s a perfect moment when the vocal fades from “I went into a dream” a sustained, lyrical passage, which is performed by a choir on the album, and here by the dancers, who raise their arms in quiet rhapsody as they sing. Like all the best tributes, Pepperland sends you back to the original, determined to listen anew."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"media/2017/may/26/sean-hannity-advertiser-boycott-fox-news-seth-rich","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"2017-05-26T19:07:23Z","webTitle":"Sean Hannity hit by advertiser exodus in wake of bogus Seth Rich story","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/may/26/sean-hannity-advertiser-boycott-fox-news-seth-rich","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2017/may/26/sean-hannity-advertiser-boycott-fox-news-seth-rich","fields":{"headline":"Sean Hannity hit by advertiser exodus in wake of bogus Seth Rich story","bodyText":"Seven companies have stopped advertising on Sean Hannity’s Fox News show after he continued to promote a conspiracy theory about the death of Democratic National Committee staffer Seth Rich. USAA, an insurance company which caters specifically to veterans, automobile listing website Cars.com and mattress companies Casper and Leesa Sleep all dropped Hannity on Thursday, Buzzfeed reported. Hannity, who is currently absent on what Fox News said was a planned vacation, has been heavily criticized for pursuing a disproven theory that Seth Rich, who was shot dead in Washington DC last July, had provided DNC emails to WikiLeaks. Conspiracy theorists have suggested Rich was killed as a result. Fox News retracted an article on Rich on Tuesday, saying the piece “was not initially subjected to the high degree of editorial scrutiny we require for all our reporting”. Cars.com told Buzzfeed it does not “have the ability to influence content at the time we make our advertising purchase. In this case, we’ve been watching closely and have recently made the decision to pull our advertising from Hannity.” USAA sent more than 30 tweets on Wednesday responding to complaints over its Hannity advertising. “We are no longer advertising in relation to Hannity. Thank you!” one reply said. In a series of other messages USAA said “advertising on opinion shows is not in accordance with our policy and we’ve since corrected it.” Bill O’Reilly left Fox News in April after allegations of sexual harassment against him led to 50 different companies to pull advertising from his show. Fox News did not respond to questions earlier this week about Hannity’s future. Spinning studio company Peloton, security company Ring and Crowne Plaza Hotels have also stopped advertising on Hannity’s Fox News show. In a statement to Buzzfeed Crowne Plaza Hotels said its policy was not to advertise on “Fox News, Hannity or any political commentary show.” “Unfortunately, our expectation to adhere to this list was not met by a third-party agency. Since we learned of the airings, we addressed the issue immediately and terminated our relationship with the agency. We have no plans to advertise on Fox News for the foreseeable future,” Crowne Plaza Hotels said. Hannity has accused Media Matters, a not-for-profit organization that monitors rightwing publications, of trying to get him fired. Media Matters published a list of Hannity’s advertisers on Tuesday, although the organization’s president, Angelo Carusone, told the Guardian it had not launched a campaign against the Fox News host. “It says a lot about how he perceives himself,” Carusone said of Hannity’s angry reaction to Media Matters publishing the list. “He understands that there’s an embarrassment in being associated with him. If somebody posted a list of my friends, I’m not going to be embarrassed, and neither would they. And it’s the same thing here.” He continued: “If someone posts a list of your associations, and your immediate response is, ‘That’s going to embarrass and humiliate them, you’re attacking them,’ it’s because he recognizes that he himself has become toxic.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/live/2017/may/28/french-open-2017-petra-kvitova-angelique-kerber-action-day-one-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-05-28T16:42:20Z","webTitle":"French Open 2017: Tommy Robredo v Dan Evans and more – day one as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2017/may/28/french-open-2017-petra-kvitova-angelique-kerber-action-day-one-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/live/2017/may/28/french-open-2017-petra-kvitova-angelique-kerber-action-day-one-live","fields":{"headline":"French Open 2017: Tommy Robredo v Dan Evans and more – day one as it happened","bodyText":"Thanks all for your company and comments; enjoy what’s left of the weekend. So, that’s us for today; we’ll be back tomorrow, with Muguruza getting her defence underway, Djokovic in action too, and plenty more. Haase is a set up on Minaur. Elsewhere, Benneteau is a break up on Pouille; they’re 1-1 in sets. He beats Evans 5-7, 6-4, 6-3, 6-1; not bad for 35. Mats reckons Evans has a stomach upset, and also that he played well to lead a set and a break, but lost concentration and allowed the big moments to get away from him. The more brutal this match has got the more Robredo has enjoyed it; and it’s instructive that 13 shots is the longest rally in the match. Evans hasn’t trusted himself to let the winners come, and he’s now matchpoint down... Robredo then uncorks a monstrous topspin forehand and pulls Evans all over the court next point; he’s 5-1 ahead and needs one more game to move on. Lovely from Evans, a backhand slice down the line on the backhand side that totally gulls Robredo; break point; deuce. Oh dear - Evans, who is bravely going for everything, has finally ceded the double-break. 4-2 Robredo, and impossible to fathom a way back for yerman. Venus has won the first set against Wang, 6-4. In any case, the winner of this match plays Dimitrov, so, well, y’know. Buyukakcay is now a set and a break up on Lucic-Baroni. Evans is going for everything but isn’t hitting his straps at the moment. But he averts a first double-break point with a drop-shot, then another with a service winner. Halys and Trungelliti are now playing a decider. “It’s now a lesson in good body-language,” says Mats of Robredo’s lead - he’s broken Evans in the first game of the fifth set, and this could be very over very soon. And it’s now level at a set apiece. Benneteau, who lost the first set to 16th seed Pouille, is a break up in the second. An ace sliced towards the far corner does it - Evans barely attempts pursuit - and I’d not be remotely surprised to see him romp through the fourth. Anyway, another break on Court 2 which means that Robredo is serving for the third set at 5-3. I said earlier that perhaps Dimitrov was the best men’s tenniser after the big four and Wawrinka. I’ve since been informed by a tennis coach buddy that Thiem, Delpo and Zverev are all better. Obviously I’m right. Lajovic has taken the first set off Bellucci, 6-4; Belluci has a break in the second. Oh me! Oh My! Robredo is wet and sheeny like a baby seal, and Evans, struggling as I said, breaks him to love! He’s showing proper moxie here. Buyukakcay of Turkey has taken the first set against Lucic-Baroni of Croatia; she’s the 22nd seed. But not for long! Evans looks in trouble physically - he put a lot into that last game - and now trails 2-4. Hello! Evans steps it up, really taking it to Robredo at 1-3 down - this is a real effort game. And he hollers loud when Robredo nets a forehand; he’s broken back! Robredo is serving and volleying a lot here; it’s working really well. Still, he’s on the board in this set now, 1-3 behind. Mats explains that Evans is clearly suffering and doesn’t think he can win, but needs to hide that fact from his opponents. Evans spends changeover with his head between his knees. He’s had more enjoyable afternoons. Evans fights his way to 30-all and is right in another punishing rally, so Robredo simply crashes a one-handed backhand low over the net cross-court, and polishes off the game immediately thereafter. On Chatrier, Puille has taken the first set off Benneteau in a tie-break; on Lenglen, Venus has just started against Wang. Brilliant from Robredo, winning a long rally with a slam before zoning a backhand return low over the net. He leads 2-0 in the third and it’s hard to plot a way back for Evans. Tsurenko has beaten Kozlova 6-4, 6-0. She’ll play Makarova in the next round. Evans went to a lot of trouble in that second set to then lose it being careless, but that’s what he did. Can he respond? Pouille and Benneteau are playing a first-set tie-break. Oh, this rig. He chucks everything at a forehand return, and though Evans is there for it, he goes long. Robredo looks much fresher, and unlikely to lose from here. Loose play from Evans, a misjudged volley haring into the net giving Robredo two set-points... Dominic Thiem has dealt with Bernard Tomic 4,0 and 2. That’s a serious performance from him, that will have surprised no one. He’s a contender. The sun’s gone in but it’s still hot as you like - or don’t like in the case of Evans. Serving at 3-4, he allows Robredo in for a volley that gives him 15-30, but then plays a very good point to right matters. Next comes an ace, then a serve out wide to the backhand; Robredo nets, and that’s 4-4. Thiem is 4-1 ahead in the third set; he’s making a tricky-looking draw look absolutely pips. Dans la maison. Robredo has clambered back into things, breaking Evans back, and he’s really hitting a heavy ball now, trying to break Evans physically. The thing with Evans is that he has the weapons to seize a game at any point. Incidentally, Thiem is in Mats’ top four, with Djokovic and Nadal. He’s reserving judgment on Murray until he’s played his first-round match. Thiem has raced through the second set against Tomic, taking it 6-0. This one might soon be done. Quentin Halys, aged 20, leads Marco Trungelliti by two sets to love, but looks about to lose the third. Evans does consolidate, with a dematerialising backhand. Evans is on one here - he’s broken Robredo in the first game of the second set, and if he can just consolidate, he’ll be in a commanding position. A surface-to-air forehand scuds into the backhand corner, and Evans likes it a lot. That’s a really wise, composed set from him - he played his own game, and took the big chance when it materialised. Evans brings up two set-points, but with both players at the net bunts a drop-shot when a lob was required and Robredo doesn’t need to be asked twice. Thiem has won the first set against Tomic, 6-4. He’s looking strong. Evans climbs into a mahoosive forehand to set-up a break-point, and then another one persuades Robredo to go wide! He’ll serve for the first set after change of ends! I say that about Evans, but perhaps I was being harsh. He’s trying to play short points, which is what suits him best, but also what Robredo doesn’t want. Evans is looking more comfy now - I’m not certain he has a plan to beat Robredo, but his game is holding together nicely. In commentary, Mats reckons that Evans needs to win the first set to have a chance. By the look of things, it’ll take a tie-break - it’s now 5-4 Robredo. Kukushkin of Kazakhstan has beaten Sandgren of USA, 2,1 and 4. Well whaddaya know, eh? Karlovic has only gone and broken serve, to lead Tsitsipas 7-6, 7-5. Robredo is starting to find his range, while Evans is clearly hating the heat. It’s that top I was on about earlier, looks thicker than the Yellow Pages. Oh look, Ivo Karlovic is on the verge of another tie-break. The Wimbledon of tennis. Robredo is looking pretty smart, incidentally - blue Tacchini top, red shoulders. Sadly, he’s teamed it with tight shortshorts and Bono sunnies. Robredo has broken Evans back, so we’re at 2-2 now. Next on Chatrier, by the way: Pouille-Benneteau. Chatrier/by the way is going in my book of rhymes. Just call me Nas. He beats Robert 2,3 and 4, looking serious in so doing. I know the rankings say differently but he might be the best after Federer at 5. Evans is grooving his forehand and goes to 30-15 with a beaut, whipped from low by his ankles onto the edge of Robredo’s forehand tramline. That gets him 30-all, two quick points follow, and the break is consolidated. Evans is exceedingly poorly-attired in an Elesse top of predominant sky blue, with navy on top and white shoulders and armpits. Someone’s been to Cromwell’s. But he breaks Robredo in the opening game, which has stopped anyone from noticing. It’s 32 degrees on court; it’s not far off where I am, thanks to my smart as heated clothes horse. Thiem-Tomic is underway on Lenglen. That could be good, or Thiem could just breeze through it. Dan Evans is feeling “pretty good”. He thinks he’s been handed a difficult draw, and still doesn’t like the clay, though is more comfy on it than once. Eurosport have moved us over to Evans-Robredo which will start shortly. Can’t believe they’ve robbed us of the thrilling denouement. Dimitrov just won’t let Robert alone, forcing him to play six or seven shots to stay in every rally. Obviously Dimitrov saved those break points, then won the next two too. 4-0, by two sets to love. “Oh good, Ivo Karlovic is a a set up,” said no one ever, but he is. 7-6, natch. It’s on serve in the second - he’s playing Stefanos Tsitsipas. He’s 6/6 on break points today - not bad at all. But now he’s facing three; the fightback starts here! Double-break for Dimitrov. This is exceedingly competent work. A game effort from McHale, but the number eight seed and many’s favourite for the title is through. Me, I think that sooner or later she’ll run into a player with more devastating weapons having a good day. Dimitrov has broken and consolidated. He’ll have his feet up in no time. Kuznetsova has broken back the breakback. She’s now serving for the match. Ah - Medvedev has retired at two sets and a break down to Bonzi. Next on Court 2: Dan Evans v Tommy Robredo. It’s only just occurred to me what a weird nickname Babyfed is. Click, bump, thud: Dimitrov wins the aforementioned second set with an ace down the middle. Robert is game as, and has a lovely eye and touch, but Babyfed is just too much. Well-in McHale! She’s broken Kuznetsova back, so they’re now 4-4 in yon second set. FYI A brilliant backhand winner followed by a net-cord means that Dimitrov will have to serve for this second set. He looks in no mood to mess around. Over on Court 2, Bonzi has just taken the third set against Medvedev - he leads 2-1, and has just broken in the first game of the third. It seems unlikely that on clay, there’s anything anyone can do to stop Nadal, but once we move to the grass, Dimitrov has the game to cleanse anyone. Dimitrov is purring now - he’s 4-1 ahead in the second set, and looks keen to get out of this as quickly as possible. And we’ve got a good game coming up on on Lenglen, once Kuznetsova, a set and a break up, has disposed of McHale: Tomic v Thiem. Carreno Buster leads Mayer by a set and a break... Good hold for Dimitrov, who now leads 2-1 in the second set. Robert shmices a backhand down the line which gives him two break points. A service winner ruins one and a long forehand another. “Whilst we feasted on Stephane Robert and Grigor Dimitrov, of what did you partake?” asks Andrew Benton. “Trust it hasn’t sated your tennis appetite, whatever it was.” I am now going to embarrass myself. We had visitors for Friday night dinner, so leftovers of spicy lamb cutlets, burgers (homemade) and spicy noodles, with brownie for afters. I’m not amped for more tennis, though am enduring something of a carb/greed comedown. So, Grigor Dimitrov, then. Will he ever be good enough to compete the best while they’re still the best? Or is he hoping that the big four move on soon and he’s the best of the rest? Daniel of Japan leads Janowicz of Poland by two sets to love. After that coruscating start, Robert concedes tamely with a double-fault. Kuznetsova, the women’s number 17 seed, has a break in the second set; she already leads McHale 7-5. Another winner: Hello, hello, said it’s good to be back, good to be back. What a band they were in their prime. On Suzanne Lenglen, Kutnetsova is a set up on McHale, winning the first 7-5. It’s 1-1 in the second. On Philipppe Chatrier, Robert has woken up a bit. It’s a treat for fans of shot-making tennis this. It’s now 2-4, and I’ll hand you back to Daniel Harris. Right, so after that nine-minute opening match, Dimitrov is finding very little resistance from Robert. He wins the next game very comfortably indeed and leads 4-1 now. Dimitrov has the momentum now, working Robert around the court and breaking him to love. He shouldn’t really have won the last point after Robert chased down a drop shot, but thumped his return into the top of the net, from where it looped out. Dimitrov leads 3-1 in the first. Dimitrov holds serve more comfortably in the third game, romping to 40-0 before giving Robert a sniff. 2-1 Dimitrov. Robert eventually gets the best a of a fantastically fluent rally when he is 15-30 down, a sensational piece of sliding, clay court tennis played in 23 shots. It gives him the momentum to go on and win the game. 1-1. Dimitrov eventually wins the first game - after nine minutes and saving three break points. We could be here tomorrow if this carries on. Robert can play shots too, and does for Dimitrov with a beautiful drop shot that takes the scores back to deuce for the third (or is it fourth?) time. These two are going to be a good watch this afternoon. If they can get the first game out of the way. Dimitrov opens his French Open account this year with a double fault and, taking his time between serves, looks mildly perturbed as Robert takes him to deuce in the first game. Dimitrov is lovely to watch, making shots all round the court, but less successful on the defence front. At advantage, he then messes up his chance of winning the opening game by missing a very simple forehand. Back to deuce it goes. Brit watch: Dan Evans will be in action around about 2pm today, he’s taking on Tommy Robredo on Court Two. Next up on Court Philippe-Chatrier is Stephane Robert, the French 37-year-old who is ranked 113th in the world, against Grigor Dimitrov (No11). So, who wins the women’s tournament from here? Nobody has a clue any more. Svitolina, Kuznetsova, Halep, Muguruza, Konta, Venus Williams? To some extent, it may depend on who can handle the pressure the best. Anyway, I’m nipping off for dinner - Tom Bryant will coax you through the next little bit. This women’s draw is wide open. I’ve not the slightest idea who’ll be in the final. Makarova also says she wasn’t going to wait for Kerber’s errors - and that’s exactly how she played. “Unblievable” says Makarova. Makarova was brilliant today. She went for her shots even at crucial moments, her forehand boomed, and Kerber couldn’t cope. For the first time in the open era, the women’s number one seed is out in the first round! That’s twice in two years for Kerber! Makarova has now saved 7 [seven] break points in this game alone, and now has a matchpoint! Kerber has now frittered four break points but immediately arranges another - her 14th of the match, for only two conversions. But Makarova seizes on a short ball to whip it cross-court, and we’re back to deuce! Makarova is nervous. She finds herself 15-40 down, but a thunderous ace down the middle helps her out. Then, a murderous forehand does likewise, it’s deuce, and she’s two points away. Oh, Angelique! She hands Makarova two break points with a netted drop-shot, then cements it with a double-fault! Makarova will serve for the match after change of ends! Gah! Makarova cedes one of her breaks with a double-fault. She leads 6-2, 4-2. Ramos-Vinolas has won the third set; he now leads Copil 2-1. Makarova plays an absolutely terrific point to save her service. She gets towards the nets and sends Kerber scurrying to hither and yon before finally finishing things with a forehand volley. Gilles Muller has levelled matters against Guillermo Garcia-Lopez - it’s now one set-all. And there it is! Makarova breaks again to lead 6-2, 4-1! Oh yes! Makarova forces another break point, and Kerber plays a delicious drop-shot from the baseline! But, that said, Makarova is doing really well to keep on Kerber instead of just waiting for her serve. Kerber is getting a bit closer to the baseline now, and hitting more aggressively, getting low on her groundstrokes. Even so, she still finds herself two break-points down ... and kills both with fine shots! Well-in Angelique Kerber! A brilliant cross-court backhand claws back one of Makarova’s two breaks! She can, but Makarova quickly relieves her of it with a clean-up backhand. Bit of fight from Kerber, whose confidence looks shot - a forehand pass, down the line from out wide, gets her to 30-all on the Makarova serve. Can she force a chance? Elsewhere: Ramos-Vinolas is 5-1-up on Copil in the third set - he lost the first. Double-break Makarova! A tame backhand into the net, and by the look of things Kerber is going home tout de suite! This is great from Makarova, whose forehand is absolutely dominating this match. She quickly earns herself three break points, and though Kerber saves two, another booming forehand - inside-out - and Kerber is in all sorts! Imagine being called Horacio. You’d take it. Zeballos has beaten Mannarino 5,3 and 4. Nothing whatsoever to do with tennis, but wonderful nonetheless. Kerber needs to improve, and by a lot. Saved! Makarova plays a really good point here, moving Kerber side to side with punishing groundstrokes to elicit a long backhand. Oh Angelique! She earns a break point and a weak second serve arrives onto her backhand, only for her to tamely waft it wide! But she quickly racks up another... But a loopy backhand down the line goes long, and we’re at deuce. Makarova quickly takes 30-0, and when Kerber fights back to level, thuds an ace dahn the middle. Set point! Right then, here’s Makarova, 5-2-up, looking to serve out the first set. Ramos-Vinolas has taken the second set against Copil 6-1, levelling the match. I’d expect him to stretch clear now. The harder Makarova pushes, the more Kerber will doubt herself - she’s horribly out of form and she knows it. Mannarino isn’t long for this tournament - Zeballos now leads him 7-5, 6-3, 4-1. An unforced error from Kerber - is there ever such a thing? - and Makarova has the double-break! Makarova is looking really strong - she intends to win this, evidenced by her vex when she allows Kerber to lead 40-30. But then a forehand down the line forces a floaty response, and a forehand volley is duly punished for deuce. And what’s this?! Makarova is 30-0-up on the Kerber serve... Kerber, on the board now, is starting to address her forehand properly, whamming it early and deep. But Makarova responds and it’s now 3-1. This is shaping up to be an excellent tussle. Ramos-Vinolas is roaring back against Copil, 4-1-up in the second set after losing the first. “Kerber looks a little flat to me,” says Mary Pierce - and Makarova leads 2-0 in the first set. Zeballos now leads Mannarino by two sets to love; Guillermo Garcia-Lopez leads Gilles Muller, the number 26 seed, by one set to love. Angelique Kerber has just started against Ekaterina Makarova. It’s rare to see two lefties play, and this is a tricky start for the world number 1 - a big swinging serve is not really what you need first up. Excellent game going on on Court 2 - Puig is now a break up in the decider. Email! “Enough of this gushing, Guardian Kvitova love-in, let’s talk Britain,” says Andrew Benton. Murray simply can’t cut la moutarde at the moment, so the only hope for a UK semi-finalist is Konta. Can she do it? Could she get past Kvitova, if needed? There seem to be a lot of viable contenders this year, especially now that Serena isn’t playing.” It’s never enough. But Murray could still do it - it doesn’t take that long to find the groove, and he’s in the right half of the draw. As for Konta, she can beat anyone, but needs to convince herself that she’s capable of it on the clay. See Kevin Mitchell, here: Greg Rusedski says Kvitova has done a lot of work in the gym and on her movement in the time she’s been out. Vinci has taken that second set against Puig. Copil has taken the first set against 19th seeded Ramos-Vinolas. So Angelique Kerber is next. Follow that... “Petra Kvitova, you’re such an inspiration” - well said Marion Bartoli. “I tried. I didn’t have time to practice, we practised two or three weeks maximum ... It doesn’t matter how I played, just that I won and I’m happy for that.” Her family are wearing t-shirts with “Courage” and “Belief” on them. “With the heart, it’s everything possible.” Kvitova: “It’s a pleasure to be here, I’m glad made the decision to play here ... thank you for everything, you helped me through this difficult time.” The crowd clap as Kvitova prepares to serve at 40-15 ... fault. But then she gets the second one in, dominates the rally, and Boserup nets a forehand! Kvitova’s eyes are moist ... I’ve got something in my eye. What a woman! Zeballos, already a set up, now has a break in the second - he leads Mannarino 7-5, 3-0. Talking of, it’s now 5-2 in the second set - Kvitova is flowing, and has a second break. She’ll be back shortly to serve for the match. “Totally agree with you about having a pint with Petra,” tweets John McEnerney, “though she may drink you under the table. Total warrioress! She could win this French Open!” Do we know each other? Where have you seen me embarrassing myself? And yep, she could - it’d be incredible. Vinci is fighting back hard on Court 2 - she leads Puig 4-1 in the second set. On Lenglen, Zeballos has taken the first set 7-5 against Mannarino, and is also called Horacio, not Adrian. Kvitova has already served eight aces. She’ll be pretty nifty when she’s fit and grooved. 3-1 to her in the second set, first set 6-3. Apparently Kvitova’s surgeon says she’s not at 100% yet, but he realises he’s dealing with a very motivated athlete who just wants to get on with things. Elsewhere, Monica Puig, the unseeded Olympic champion, has taken the first set against Roberta Vinca [31]. ...the sun’s out! Hopefully this won’t be for too long... Rain stopped play. They’re carrying on for the now - no one expected this, so hopefully it’ll be over presently. It’s raining.... Petra Kvitova is brilliant, incidentally. Obviously there’s the fact that she’s left-handed, but there’s more to it than that, even. She plays properly fierce tennis, competes in similar vein, and you’d have a pint with her. She’s really starting to open her shoulders now, a break up in the second set. On Lenglen, Zeballos and Mannarino are 5-5 in the first. Things to which we can look forward: Dan Evans is playing Tommy Robredo, Dominic Thiem is playing Bernard Tomic, and Angelique Kerber gets her go underway against the handy Ekaterina Makarova. It’s beautiful thing. Apologies, Julia. So, let’s begin on Philippe-Chatrier, where the returning Petra Kvitova has just had a serve thrashed back past here by Julia Boserup; that’s the second of two set-points saved. Bonjour mesdames et monsieurs, pour aller à la gare? Je fais la spéléologie. De toute façon, qui veut du tennis? Très bien.

He says al-Qaida is increasing its presence in Afghanistan, Islamic State is playing a role, the country is experiencing an insurgency, and “we can’t afford to see Afghanistan lost”. Marles said Labor had asked for a briefing from the government regarding last week’s request from US Pentagon officials for the Australian defence force to commit more troops to the troubled country. The US request followed a recent Nato call for an increased contribution from Australia as part of a possible allied surge in Afghanistan, the Australian reported. “The starting point here is that Afghanistan matters,” Marles told Sky News on Sunday. “A number of the Bali bombers received training in Afghanistan leading up to the Bali bombing in 2002, so we’ve got a direct interest in that country in ensuring that it is denied terrorist activities in the future. “We can’t afford to see Afghanistan lost and it is important that we focus on that.” In April, as many as a dozen militants stormed the largest army base in northern Afghanistan, killing at least 140 soldiers, many of them unarmed, in what was the largest Taliban attack on security forces since 2001. Earlier this month, Malcolm Turnbull confirmed he had been asked by Nato for additional personnel to help deal with a resurgent Taliban and the continuing threat from Islamic State fighters. Marles said on Sunday Labor hoped to be briefed by the Turnbull government this week on last week’s request from Pentagon officials. He said Labor would look at that request “very carefully” and act “in a really constructive way here with the government”. “As I indicated in my Press Club speech [last] week, bipartisanship is where we ought to be aiming in terms of questions of this kind,” he said. He said Australia would make the best contribution by providing personnel who could train local forces, rather than supplying extra combat troops. “I think the lesson from the Iraq invasion in 2003 is that we really need to be building the capacity of these countries themselves to deal with the challenges that they face,” he said. “We’re doing a lot of training in Afghanistan, specifically in terms of officer training. It’s really well received, we are making a difference there, and I think that’s partly why there is a request specifically in relation to Australia because of the really positive impact we’re having.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2017/may/28/he-will-remain-a-hero-families-and-friends-mourn-victims-of-portland-stabbing","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-05-28T01:52:22Z","webTitle":"'He will remain a hero': families and friends mourn victims of Portland stabbing","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/may/28/he-will-remain-a-hero-families-and-friends-mourn-victims-of-portland-stabbing","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/may/28/he-will-remain-a-hero-families-and-friends-mourn-victims-of-portland-stabbing","fields":{"headline":"'He will remain a hero': families and friends mourn victims of Portland stabbing","bodyText":"The families, friends and colleagues of two men murdered while trying to stop a racist attack on two young Muslim girls on a train in Portland have paid tribute to them as heroes. Taliesin Myrddin Namkai-Meche, 23, and Rick Best, 53, were fatally stabbed after intervening when suspected white supremacist began yelling “hate speech”, police said A third man, Micah David-Cole Fletcher, 21, was treated for injuries that police said were not expected to be life-threatening. Jeremy Joseph Christian, 35, was being held in the Multnomah county jail on suspicion of aggravated murder, attempted murder, intimidation and being a felon in possession of a weapon. He was arrested a short time after the attack on Friday. Asha Deliverance, the mother of Namkai-Meche, confirmed his death in a post on Facebook, in which she wrote that her “dear baby boy passed on yesterday while protecting two young Muslim girls from a racist man on the train”. “Shining bright star I love you forever.” In a separate statement his family said he “lived a joyous and full life”. “In his final act of bravery he held true to what he believed is the way forward. He will live in our hearts forever as the just, brave, loving, hilarious and beautiful soul he was. We ask that in honor of his memory, we use this tragedy as an opportunity for reflection and change. We choose love. Safe journey Taliesin. We love you.” Reed College in Portland, where Namkai-Meche studied an economics degree, also posted a tribute to him on its Facebook page. In the post, Professor Kambiz Ghanea-Bassiri said he was an extraordinary person. “I still remember where he sat in conference and the types of probing, intelligent questions I could anticipate him asking. He was thoughtful, humble, smart, inquisitive, and compassionate. He was a wonderful human being. As good as they come. And now he is a hero to me.” Rick Best, a father of four and army veteran, was remembered by colleagues who said “it’s just like Rick to step in and help somebody out”. Speaking to the Orgeonian, his supervisor at the Bureau of Development Services, Kareen Perkins, said “he was always the first person you would go to for help”. City commissioner Chloe Eudaly, who until recently oversaw the bureau, released a statement, paying tribute to his bravery. “He stood up for two young women and others he didn’t even know — all because he wanted to help,” she said. Portland mayor Ted Wheeler said both men “died heroes as a result of a horrific act of racist violence”. Tributes were posted to them on Twitter. A memorial to the men was set up where the stabbing took place. At the memorial eight-year-old Coco Douglas left a sign and some rocks she had painted with rainbow colours. Her stepmother, Angel Sauls, said the attack had been particularly hard on their family because Sauls is black and Coco and her father are white. “I had hoped that it was Portland, Maine, and not Portland, Oregon,” Sauls said, after choking back tears. “I’m scared that this is going to make people afraid to stand up for other people … I’m just really sorry that their acts of kindness were repaid in such a horrible way.” With Associated Press"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2017/may/27/white-house-photo-caption-same-sex-spouse-luxembourg-pm","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-05-27T22:34:40Z","webTitle":"White House photo caption omits husband of Luxembourg's gay PM","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/may/27/white-house-photo-caption-same-sex-spouse-luxembourg-pm","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/may/27/white-house-photo-caption-same-sex-spouse-luxembourg-pm","fields":{"headline":"White House photo caption omits husband of Luxembourg's gay PM","bodyText":"The Trump White House on Saturday omitted Gauthier Destenay, the husband of Luxembourg prime minister Xavier Bettel, from the caption for an official photograph of the spouses of Nato leaders, which was taken at this week’s summit in Brussels. Destenay, a Belgian architect, married Bettel in 2015, becoming the first same-sex spouse of a leader of a European Union member state. American first lady Melania Trump was identified twice in the original caption for the official White House photograph, which was taken by Andrea Hanks and posted to Facebook in a collection of pictures from Trump’s nine-day international tour. Destenay’s name later appeared in an edited version of the caption. The original caption read: “First Lady Melania Trump poses with Belgium’s Queen Mathilde, center, and other spouses of Nato leaders: First Lady Emine Erdoğan of Turkey; Iceland’s Thora Margret Baldvinsdottir; the First Lady of France Brigitte Trogneux; First Lady Melania Trump; Slovenia’s Mojca Stropnik; Bulgaria’s Desislava Radeva; Belgium’s Amélie Derbaudrenghien, and Norway’s Ingrid Schulerud, during their visit Thursday 25 May 2917 [sic], at the Royal Palace in Brussels.” Destenay, smiling and wearing a dark suit, white shirt and light blue tie, is clearly visible in the picture, behind Melania Trump’s right shoulder. His appearance in photographs of the group of leaders’ spouses taken in Brussels this week caused widespread comment in the media and online. Prior to the edited caption appearing online, the White House did not return a request for comment. Unlike other parts of the legacy of Barack Obama, same-sex marriage rights have not come under scrutiny during Trump’s presidency. In November, Trump said questions on the subject were “irrelevant because it was already settled. It’s law. It was settled in the supreme court. I mean it’s done”. The ruling in question, Obergefell v Hodges, was passed down in June 2015. Vice-president Mike Pence, former governor of Indiana, has taken hardline stances against the extension of rights, including those concerning marriage, to LGBTQ people. Destenay and Bettel’s marriage is not the first same-sex union at the highest levels of world politics. In 2010, Johanna Siguroardottir, then prime minister of Iceland, became the first serving leader in the world to marry a same-sex partner."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2017/may/28/labour-must-fill-pro-eu-chasm-says-blairs-former-chief-of-staff","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-05-27T23:05:41Z","webTitle":"Labour must fill pro-EU chasm, says Blair’s former chief of staff","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/may/28/labour-must-fill-pro-eu-chasm-says-blairs-former-chief-of-staff","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/may/28/labour-must-fill-pro-eu-chasm-says-blairs-former-chief-of-staff","fields":{"headline":"Labour must fill pro-EU chasm, says Blair’s former chief of staff","bodyText":"The Labour party will face competition from a more pro-European, progressive rival unless it fills the “yawning chasm” in the political centre ground after the election, Tony Blair’s former chief of staff has said. Jonathan Powell, the former prime minister’s most trusted adviser, said that there was no pro-European party capable of commanding significant support and that “a different party” could fill the vacuum if Labour opted not to do so. It comes after former Labour donors suggested that they may be willing to fund a new party should a group of MPs opt to create one. Blair has also said he has re-entered the political arena “to make the case for building a new coalition out from the centre”. Powell said that there was no party representing people on the progressive, centre-left which was pro-European and opposed to Brexit. “Whether there will be one in the future is another matter,” he said. “After the election I think people will look at what happened. Maybe Jeremy Corbyn will have a massive triumph, win lots of seats and people will reconsider the position. “But say the opinion polls turn out to be right and the result is very bad, then I think there will have to be a postmortem where people will look at who is actually representing this space in the middle where the Labour party has gone left and a Tory party that has gone right. There is a great big gaping hole and someone is going to fill that space. Nature abhors a vacuum – who is it going to be? “We will wait to see what happens in the election, but … there is a yawning chasm in the middle of politics at the moment that is not represented and the [Lib Dems] are incapable of filling that space. At some stage, someone is going to fill it. Whether it is the Labour party after the election or a different party, who knows?” It comes with speculation already rife within the Labour party over what will happen in the immediate aftermath of an election defeat. Some critics of Corbyn are already preparing to accept the fact that he will remain leader, but most anticipate a huge outpouring of anger once polls close at 10pm on 8 June. There are already senior figures who have been vocal in wanting the party to move into a more pro-EU position. Powell, who is overseeing the Brexit Exchange project designed to give businesses a voice in the Brexit talks, warned that German companies would not be lobbying on behalf of Britain against the will of chancellor Merkel. He said the idea pushed by some Brexiters that Germany’s big manufacturers would push for the status quo in a future UK-EU trade deal was “complete nonsense”. “German business will be very solid with Merkel,” he said. “You will not have BMW or others breaking ranks. In Germany, it is a much more corporatist country. It is such a successful, industrial selling machine that you won’t see a glimmer of light between them.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2017/may/30/texas-donald-trump-frontline-white-house","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-05-30T14:44:44Z","webTitle":"'A good friend in the White House': how Texas became Trump's frontline","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/may/30/texas-donald-trump-frontline-white-house","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/may/30/texas-donald-trump-frontline-white-house","fields":{"headline":"'A good friend in the White House': how Texas became Trump's frontline","bodyText":"Like many other teenagers, Karla Perez eagerly awaited her 16th birthday and the chance to pass her driving test. The driving school told her to bring her social security card to class, so she asked her mother for it. “She said I didn’t have one, and that’s when she explained it to me,” Perez recalled. She was not a US citizen but an undocumented immigrant. Her parents, seeking a better life, brought her to Houston from Mexico City when she was two. They never discussed her status, thinking that by her mid-teens she would have a green card through an American grandparent. Perez gave up on the idea of driving – quite a hardship in such a car-centric city. But as she pursued her ambition of going to law school, she was grateful for a benefit unusual in such a deep-red state: the right to pay tuition at the same rate charged to legal Texas residents. Without it, her degree might have been unaffordable. Then came the election of Donald Trump last November and the start of the Texas legislature’s 2017 session two months later. The same state that introduced the tuition law 16 years earlier, the place with an estimated 1.7m unauthorised immigrants, passed a hardline measure known as SB4 that compels local law enforcement to work with federal immigration authorities to hand over migrants for potential deportation, in effect banning “sanctuary cities”. The White House would like to do the same nationwide. “It was definitely not a surprise to see after the elections how the Republican party has been emboldened to take extreme measures to vilify and criminalise immigrants,” Perez said last week. “They are very much emboldened by what’s happening at the national level. They’re carrying out Trump’s deportation agenda.” Perez was one of hundreds who protested against SB4 at the Texas statehouse in Austin on Monday, amid scenes of mayhem on the floor of the house of representatives. Matt Rinaldi, a Republican, said he called Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) in response to the presence of demonstrators holding “I am illegal and here to stay” signs. Ramon Romero, a Democratic representative, reportedly quoted Rinaldi as saying: “Fuck them, I called Ice.” Rinaldi claimed he was threatened by Democratic representatives and assaulted by Romero, who denied the accusation. Rinaldi said he asserted that if a Democratic member, Alfonso “Poncho” Nevarez, made good on a pledge to “get him” when he left the chamber: “I would shoot him in self-defence.” Nevarez said on Twitter that Rinaldi was “a liar and hateful man”. The loss of decorum in a hyper-partisan atmosphere recalled the excesses of Trump’s anything-goes presidential campaign. At a gun range on Friday, the Republican governor, Greg Abbott signed a bill into law that reduces the cost of a handgun license. With a Trumpesque level of regard for the media, he joked about shooting reporters. ‘Texas was ahead of the curve’ There are similarities in policy-making as well as posturing. The country’s most populous Republican-led state is a laboratory for the kind of extreme rightwing positions on cultural touchstones that helped propel Trump to power. “Whatever direction you see the curve bending, Texas was ahead of the curve,” said Jim Henson, director of the Texas Politics Project at the University of Texas. “Trumpism is, to some degree, Texas Republicanism gone national. [Lieutenant Governor] Dan Patrick was kind of where Trump was before Trump was there, in terms of thinking about conservative populism built around nativism and catering to Republican primary voters’ preoccupation with immigration and border security.” Patrick is a radio show host who became lieutenant governor in 2015. He was also the state chairman of the 2016 Trump campaign. “We have a good friend in the White House,” he declared on election night. Monday was the last scheduled day of the Texas legislative session. But Patrick forced a stand-off over his demand to pass a “bathroom bill” limiting access for transgender people that may yet see a special session called by Abbott. A compromise measure applying only to public schools was set to pass earlier this month – but to the frustration of the dwindling number of GOP moderates, it was too diluted for Patrick’s taste. “It’s absurd that bathroom bills have taken on greater urgency than fixing our school finance system,” Joe Straus, the speaker of the house, told reporters. What remaining middle ground there was has crumbled. When SB4 was debated on the house floor, Republicans refused to accept amendments offered by Democrats to limit its scope, instead making it tougher by allowing officers to check the immigration status of anyone they merely detain, as well as arrest. The first line of the bill notes that it applies to agencies including “campus police departments”. Places of learning are not safe havens. One of the most passionate voices against the bill belonged to Gene Wu, a Democratic representative from Houston who was born in China. “I think having Trump in the White House made a big difference,” Wu said. “I think the anti-immigrant wing of the Republican party has been emboldened, the racists and the bigots have sort of been given free rein to do and say what they want and push their agenda harder. “Some of it is that in Texas, it never went away. The problem is that now it’s come … to a head as an issue among the Republican party that is harder and harder for those moderates and people that are rational to basically hold it back.” Statewide elections in Texas are so uncompetitive – Democrats last won one in 1994 – that Republican primaries are all-important. Long before Trump’s ascent, that resulted in bombastic rhetoric and ideological law-making to appeal to a relatively small base with a strong Tea Party inflection. Like the president, the Texas GOP is feeding a sense of grievance. Polls last June for the Texas Politics Project showed many Republican respondents felt Christians endure more discrimination than Muslim, African American, Hispanic, transgender, gay or lesbian people, and believe white people are among society’s most victimised groups. Despite the political and economic fallout endured by North Carolina when it passed a “bathroom bill” limiting access for transgender people last year, Patrick made a similar law one of his top priorities, over the objections of state business boosters. Proponents were given a lift in February when the Trump administration rescinded federal guidelines telling schools students should use facilities corresponding with their gender identity. The “bathroom bill” is not the only proposal that has alarmed LGBTQ advocates. Andy Delony and his husband, Brendan Robert, live in Austin. They married in Massachusetts in 2005 and formally adopted four children from troubled backgrounds in 2010, in a relatively smooth process. “They’ve gone from barely functional to absolutely brilliant, all of them,” Delony said. But he and Robert now worry that gay Texans, among others, could find it harder to adopt after state lawmakers passed a so-called religious freedom bill that supporters say provides valuable legal protection but critics argue will make it easier for agencies to reject potential parents based on “sincerely held religious beliefs”. “This bill will restrict the number of homes available to children and it will definitely restrict the number of agencies that will serve children who are non-traditional in either religion or gender or sexuality,” Delony said. His eldest son, Andy Delony-Robert, 19, who is bisexual, is preparing to attend New York University. He said his adoptive family was “one of the best things that could have come my way.” He believes the presidential executive order “promoting free speech and religious liberty” that Trump signed on 4 May encouraged Texas to pass the foster care and adoption law. “That opened the door,” he said. “If I were to enter into a same-sex relationship and go to adopt, this law would have a chance of preventing me from doing so … The idea that I could just be rejected for who I am is appalling and terrifying to me.” ‘The antithesis of the Obama model’ If Trump’s ascent has afforded rightwingers increased license to pass conservative laws, it is also forcing a strategic adjustment. Abbott, the governor, described his previous job as attorney general as: “I go into the office, I sue the federal government, and I go home.” “There was a very active effort among many Republican legislators to locate Texas as the antithesis of the Obama model,” said Mark Jones, a political science professor at Rice University. “And so if the Obama administration did one thing, you were trying to pass legislation or a resolution that did the opposite.” In contrast, Jones said: “Trump poses some difficulties for Republicans since while they agree with him more in policy than President Obama, they also have lost one of their best foils to use to campaign against Democratic candidates here in Texas.” Instead of aiming at Washington, such candidates have turned their sights inwards, to the state’s biggest cities. Houston, Dallas, San Antonio and Austin all lean Democratic. The original “bathroom bill” proposal would have superseded local non-discrimination ordinances. And when the Austin-area sheriff, Sally Hernandez, said in January that she would pursue only limited co-operation with federal immigration officers, Abbott went on the offensive, threatening to oust her and cutting $1.5m in grant money to Travis County. The obsession with immigration is so pronounced that amid a budget squeeze because of a downturn in the oil industry, and facing a number of pressing social problems, the Texas legislature still voted to put its money where Trump’s mouth is and allocate $800m in funding for border security, which is a federal responsibility. It did the same in 2015, citing the Obama administration’s supposed fecklessness on the issue. The fresh money comes even though Trump has, of course, pledged to build a wall along the southern border and massively increase funding for the Department of Homeland Security. But $3m was not forthcoming to help victims of sex trafficking, the Texas Tribune reported. As for clearing the state’s backlog of thousands of rape kits? The legislature is happy to pay – via crowdfunding, that is. The pushback As at the national level, Texas liberals are retaliating via the courts. The state that relished suing the federal government is set to be on the receiving end of a deluge of litigation: abortion rights groups are expected to battle efforts to curtail access and several lawsuits have already been filed against SB4. Now 24, Perez, the student, is a member of United We Dream, an immigrant youth rights group. She has one more year of law school at the University of Houston and aims to become an immigration attorney representing women and children survivors of crimes. She is also a Dreamer, a beneficiary of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (Daca), the Obama-era deportation deferral programme with an uncertain future that gives her a precarious legal status – and the right to get behind the wheel. She is worried nonetheless that under SB4, if she is ever stopped by police she could be detained as they examine her background. Perez is fighting for a more compassionate climate. On Monday’s evidence, there is a long way to go. “Those of us who benefited [from Daca] will refuse to be forced back to … a place of shame and fear that I used to have,” she said. “Can’t go back.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2017/may/28/race-to-find-manchester-terrorist-network","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2017-05-28T06:00:02Z","webTitle":"The race to find the Manchester terrorist network","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/may/28/race-to-find-manchester-terrorist-network","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2017/may/28/race-to-find-manchester-terrorist-network","fields":{"headline":"The race to find the Manchester terrorist network","bodyText":"Shortly before 11am on Saturday, military bomb disposal experts swooped on a terraced house in Manchester. Such sights are the new reality, as the city begins adjusting to life on the front line of the war on terror. Even as daylight broke over Manchester Arena on Tuesday following the attack, investigators had concluded that the suicide bomber, Salman Abedi, was no solitary actor, no lone wolf. The 22-year-old required considerable support in carrying out the arena attack, which was timed to cause carnage during the heady moments when the pop star Ariana Grande finished her encore. The first clue came in the device itself. Forensic analysts realised it had been crafted with cunning. The shrapnel was evenly spaced to inflict maximum damage and it had a back-up detonation system. Building an effective bomb is tricky. The Manchester attack was the first time Islamist terrorists have successfully used explosives in Britain since 2005. The second clue emerged less than 24 hours after Abedi killed 22 people and injured 116. Intelligence from the Joint Terrorism Analysis Centre confirmed that there was the risk of a follow-up attack. Theresa May announced the threat level was being raised to critical, its highest, signalling that another terrorist atrocity was expected imminently. Put simply, the bomb maker was either still at large or Abedi had distributed more devices to his co-conspirators. The race to trace the terror network had begun. Six days after the attack, it is a race the police feel they are winning. Manchester’s chief constable Ian Hopkins confirmed the investigation had made “significant progress” dismantling the network behind Britain’s worst terror attack in more than a decade. Hours earlier, just before midday, the threat level had been downgraded to severe. Even so, Britain’s most senior counter-terrorism officer, Mark Rowley – the Met’s assistant commissioner for specialist operations – said more arrests will follow. Police held two more suspects in dawn raids on Saturday, with 11 men now being questioned. The true size and scope of Abedi’s network has still been not fully established. So far, 14 locations across Greater Manchester have been searched. One Cheetham Hill home raided on Saturday had its doors blown off before being stormed by police. Another key building is Granby House, a 1908 red-brick building close to the city’s Piccadilly station. Here, last weekend, inside a one-bedroom apartment, investigators believe Abedi may have helped to assemble the bomb’s chief components. The sharp end of the inquiry is focused on Manchester, but even as the net draws tighter on Abedi’s cell, the investigation’s tentacles are stretching further. Away from the red-brick streets of England’s north-west, it has moved to Abedi’s Libyan connections and on to the streets of Tripoli and its mishmash of jihadist militias. Islamic State’s claim of responsibility for the attack has prompted the intelligence agencies to scour the identities of senior Isis operatives and foreign fighters holed up in the Syrian and Iraqi cities of Raqqa and Mosul. Abedi’s links to Europe are slowly emerging. German officials are investigating a possible connection to Frankfurt, the largest financial centre on the continent. In the aftermath of the attack, officials in Brussels, an established jihadi hotspot, said there was no link, but that position has since begun to alter. A paradox of complex counter-terrorism investigations is that the more progress made, the slower and more cumbersome the inquiry can become. Every house raided, each individual arrested creates more leads, and more blind alleys that must be investigated. Every telephone, handset and computer has now to be meticulously examined by the North West Counter Terrorism Unit, each a potentially gigantic source of data. Sources close to the investigation reveal they have approached technology firms to help access machines, saying they expect to “amass hundreds of electronic devices” during the investigation into Abedi’s terror cell. Greater Manchester Police said they were pursuing 1,500 “actions”. “The further it progresses, the more work, the more phones to search through. Investigations can be peculiar things; after the arrest phase is when the real work begins,” said a source. Adding to the information flow is the granting of IoC (interception of communications) powers that enable the security services to listen to calls and read emails. A 1,000-strong investigations team, working 14-hour shifts 24/7 has been formed to chase leads and evaluate data. A primary focus of the investigation for several days has been tracking the forensic footprint of the bomb itself. A team of Metropolitan Police officers has mounted a large-scale financial investigation into where, how and by whom the device’s chemicals were acquired, as well as ascertaining if the men who are in custody can be linked to such transactions. The bomb contained TATP – triacetone triperoxide – the same explosive as was used in the November 2015 attacks in Paris, the Brussels attack in March 2016 and the July 2005 London attacks, and a high explosive frequently favoured by terrorists because its ingredients are readily found at chemists or hardware stores. Detectives are also analysing database algorithms designed to spot terrorist tradecraft and terabytes of chatter that record the various aliases and movements of “subjects of interest”. Much of this requires UK officials liaising bilaterally with European police forces or issuing requests to Europol, Interpol and American officials in relation to Libya. Europe’s colossal databases are pivotal, principally the Schengen Information System, which includes details of criminals along with 8,000 terror suspects and which last year was used by UK police 58,694 times an hour. As police close in on Abedi’s network, its international reach means that other characters have emerged that may be of interest. Among these is a shadowy logistics expert based in Brussels known only as Obaida and who, it is believed, may have acted as a crucial cog in the support network of an active Manchester cell over several years, enabling terrorists to flit through European capitals and on to Libya and Syria and back. Greater Manchester police have been cooperating with forces and secret services in Belgium, and US security officials have said Abedi’s bomb suggested a “level of sophistication” that implied its maker had foreign training. Immediately after the Manchester attack, Belgium’s Threat Analysis Co-ordination Body said that, after an initial intelligence analysis, a link between Belgium and the Manchester bombing had not been found. But by Friday a spokesman for OCAM was unwilling to repeat that position and declined to explain. Obaida first came to the attention of the British security services during an investigation into a friend of Abedi’s, Abdalraouf Abdallah, 23. Twelve months ago, Abdallah, a Libyan refugee who lived 15 minutes’ walk from Abedi in Manchester, was sentenced to five and a half years for terrorism offences. During the trial, Obaida was named as a key figure “facilitating the movements of terrorists across mainland Europe”. In a pre-sentencing hearing judgment, Lord Justice Treacy described Abdallah as being “active in a terrorist group based in Manchester in 2014”. Treacy’s judgment added: “Abdallah organised the terrorist activities of the Manchester group. The group used shared contacts to facilitate movement through Europe to the Syrian border. It was also involved in arrangements for the purchase and supply of weapons.” A second leg of the Brussels investigation is examining whether Abedi had links to the so-called “man in the hat” caught on cameras at Brussels airport shortly before it was bombed, believed to be the Belgian Mohamed Abrini. Abrini visited Manchester in 2015 and has since been charged with involvement in the Paris terrorist attacks. In Germany, separate investigations into Abedi are also ongoing. The Bundeskriminalamt (BKA) of North Rhein-Westphalia is scouring CCTV footage from Dusseldorf airport where Abedi, on his way back from Libya to Manchester, spent four hours just days before his attack. German authorities describe their investigation as “intensive and urgent” after it emerged that Abedi had visited the country in 2015, spending time in Frankfurt. Both Frankfurt and Dusseldorf are home to more than a thousand suspected Islamists, and counter-intelligence experts from the police and BKA are looking into any potential contacts Abedi may have had with radical German Islamists. Dusseldorf is just 150 miles from Brussels, where Obaida was last known to be based. A possible German chapter of the Abedi network may yet surface. Eleven days before a general election it was highly likely that the fallout from the atrocity would become politicised. There have been accusations that budget cuts to community policing had left Manchester without the intelligence needed to keep it safe. Manchester’s mayor, Andy Burnham, waded into the debate on Saturday, suggesting the public would be prepared to pay more to bolster police numbers. The city has lost 2,000 officers since 2010. Resources also determine the efficacy of the security services. The home secretary Amber Rudd has admitted Abedi was known to intelligence agencies “up to a point” but following a single terror suspect covertly 24 hours a day requires a huge team of up to 36 intelligence officers. Tough decisions are required over who gets the full surveillance treatment. Wherever Abedi started in the prioritisation system, he ended up at the bottom of the list, and the security services are looking into whether there was “actionable” intelligence that may have been ignored. Various calls have also been made to review Britain’s entire counter-terror infrastructure, even including demands for the reintroduction of internment. Predictably, yet more scrutiny has fallen on Prevent, the government’s counter-radicalisation strategy. Prevent has been dogged with claims that its activities are sowing mistrust and fear in the Muslim community. Abedi was reported to Prevent following concerns over his radical views long before his attack. Fiyaz Mughal, founder of the anti-extremist organisation Faith Matters, said that the episode further exposed failures of officials to act on indicators of radicalisation. “Assessments by skilled professionals should show up which individuals may be at risk of extremism and violent extremism. It is an exact trajectory that I have seen in cases before. This is a well worn path, sadly.” Fresh twists lie ahead but the immediate risk of another attack in Manchester appears to have been neutralised, the central protagonists rounded up and detectives increasingly emboldened by the investigation’s success. Steadily, police are learning how the device was made. On Saturday, Rowley, who is also anti-terrorism policy lead for the National Police Chiefs’ Council, implied the initial phase of the investigation was nearing its endgame, yet was canny enough to make room for any unexpected development. “We are getting a greater understanding of the preparation of the bomb. There is still much more to do.” • This article was amended on 29 May 2017. An earlier version said Theresa May was raising the threat level to critical. This has been corrected to say May announced the threat level was being raised to critical."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"global-development-professionals-network/2017/may/30/acceso-al-agua-rural-paraguay-un-ejemplo-para-los-demas-paises","type":"article","sectionId":"global-development-professionals-network","sectionName":"Global Development Professionals Network","webPublicationDate":"2017-05-30T09:21:27Z","webTitle":"Acceso al agua rural: Paraguay un ejemplo para los demás países","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2017/may/30/acceso-al-agua-rural-paraguay-un-ejemplo-para-los-demas-paises","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development-professionals-network/2017/may/30/acceso-al-agua-rural-paraguay-un-ejemplo-para-los-demas-paises","fields":{"headline":"Acceso al agua rural: Paraguay un ejemplo para los demás países","bodyText":"En la pequeña comunidad de Juan Augusto Saldívar, más o menos a una hora fuera de la capital de Paraguay, Julián Marecos es presidente de la junta de agua local. Junto con otros cuatro, participa como voluntario para supervisar el servicio de agua de la comunidad, que fue fundado en 1993 y abastece a más de 3,800 usuarios, incluyendo la escuela, centro de salud, iglesia, y otras personas en las áreas colindantes. Marecos nació y creció en la localidad, y todavía recuerda las dificultades sufridas en cuanto el acceso al agua potable. “Tradicionalmente, las familias sacaban agua de los pozos que tenían en sus hogares, pero muchas veces, en especial durante las temporadas muy calurosas, esos pozos se secaban” dice. “Gracias a la junta, ya no tenemos esas dificultades y tenemos agua potable disponible, que nos ayuda a prevenir muchas enfermedades.” A lo largo de Latinoamérica, 30 millones de personas no cuentan con acceso al agua potable, y 100 millones todavía carecen de acceso al saneamiento. Ésto es a pesar de que la región cuenta con un tercio de los recursos mundiales de agua dulce. Al problema se le dio prioridad en los objetivos de desarrollo del milenio (ODM), que establecieron la meta, para el 2015, de reducir por la mitad la proporción de la población sin acceso sostenible al agua potable segura y saneamiento básico. Sólo un país lo logró en áreas rurales: Paraguay. De hecho, rebasó la meta; más del 94% de su población rural ahora cuenta con acceso al agua potable, comparado con 51.6% en 2000, logrando un mayor progreso comparado con todos los demás países. Los nuevos objetivos de desarrollo sostenible dan aún más importancia al agua limpia y saneamiento. Los países deberán asegurar la disponibilidad y administración sostenible del agua y saneamiento para todos, y los expertos aseguran que sin este progreso no será posible lograr otros objetivos y metas. Por lo tanto, ¿qué pueden aprender los otros países latinoamericanos del éxito de Paraguay? El agua como prioridad en salud pública Una manera en que Paraguay abordó el problema del acceso al agua en zonas rurales fue colocar a la entidad de saneamiento y agua – SENASA (Servicio Nacional de Saneamiento Ambiental) dentro del departamento de salud, ayudando a asegurar su tratamiento como prioridad en materia de salud pública. “Aunque aún hay muchos desafíos, en verdad ha habido mucho progreso en los últimos 25 años, aproximadamente, por la manera en que Paraguay configuró las cosas,” afirma Germán Sturzenegger, especialista superior en agua y saneamiento del Banco Inter-Americano del Desarrollo (BID). En 2007, Paraguay también reconoció en la ley el acceso al agua suficiente y de calidad como derecho humano, tres años antes de que el derecho al agua y saneamiento fuera reconocido por la ONU. Se establecieron ambiciosas metas para incrementar el abastecimiento del agua por cañerías en zonas urbanas y rurales. Se implementaron innovadores esquemas, como el modelo de servicio comunitario del cual Marecos forma parte, con subsidios para comunidades de menos de 150 personas. En comunidades rurales, el modelo funciona al darle responsabilidad en materia del agua y saneamiento a las Juntas de Saneamiento, que son operadas por voluntarios. Hay más de 2,500 de estas asociaciones comunitarias en áreas rurales y pequeñas comunidades en las periferias urbanas a lo largo de Paraguay, uno de los primeros países que promocionaron este tipo de modelo. Los consejos no sólo recuperan los costos del mantenimiento y operación mediante la implementación de tarifas de agua, sino que también pagan una porción de los costos del capital – utilizados inicialmente para construir la infraestructura – a la tesorería nacional. Una familia rural paga $3–$5 al mes por su servicio de agua, que típicamente se paga en efectivo a los miembros del consejo. “El gobierno paraguayo, principalmente por medio de SENASA, ha creado un buen modelo para trabajar con pequeñas comunidades, creando consejos y entrenándolos para operar, mantener y gestionar el sistema a nivel administrativo,” dice Sturzenegger. “Ellos continúan obteniendo asistencia técnica, que no siempre es el caso en otros países. Este modelo es una de las razones por las cuales el sistema ha sido sostenible en su totalidad.” Este modelo de gestión de servicio inicialmente fue promocionado y financiado con un préstamo inicial de $6 millones del Banco Mundial en 1977. En los últimos 20 años, el banco, el BID y el gobierno español han ayudado a ampliarlo. El BID ha invertido $64 millones y el gobierno español $60 millones desde el 2009 mediante el Fondo de Cooperación para el Agua y Saneamiento. En conjunto, el Banco Mundial ha proporcionado $150 millones en préstamos a Paraguay para proyectos de agua desde 1977. “Hay algunas ONGs que invierten y subsidian, pero principalmente ha sido el gobierno nacional quien impulsa las mejoras con financiamiento externo,” dice Sturzenegger. Hacer las preguntas correctas Paraguay está enfocado en la sostenibilidad, o “ayuda basada en los resultados” dice María Angélica Sotomayor, administradora de la unidad de programas globales del Banco Mundial. “Muchas cosas que hace el Banco Mundial ahora en un inicio fueron piloteadas en Paraguay porque esa era la forma en que querían hacerlo,” dice. En la década de 1990, además de trabajar con Paraguay, su equipo trabajaba con Perú en proyectos similares. “La diferencia entre Paraguay y otros países de Latinoamérica fue que pusieron mucho énfasis en la sostenibilidad … Paraguay es uno de los países más pobres de Sudamérica, mientras que Perú es uno de los más ricos. En ese entonces, el objetivo y deseo político en Perú era ‘construír, construír, construír’, mientras que Paraguay se estaba enfocando en lo que ahora definimos como sostenibilidad,” dice Sotomayor. Aún hay muchos retos para garantizar el acceso al agua potable y servicios de saneamiento en todo Paraguay, dice Sturzenegger, entre ellos el proporcionar mejores servicios en áreas rurales, llegar a las poblaciones indígenas, asegurar la adecuada vigilancia de la calidad del agua, e incrementar los fondos para alcanzar las metas nacionales. Pero desde el principio, la clave para la estrategia de Paraguay fue el enfoque en la sostenibilidad. Afirma Sotomayor: “Le dieron mucha atención, pensando en cómo puedes construír un sistema, pero, ¿quién lo operará y cómo lo gestionarás? ¿Quién es responsable en un área rural si se rompe una bomba manual? Estaban haciendo las preguntas correctas.” Únete a nuestra comunidad de profesionales del desarrollo y humanitarios.

I wanted to discover how and why three brothers, Abdullah, Jaffa and Amer Deghayes, chose to join Jabhat al-Nusra, the Syrian affiliate of al-Qaida, once the most powerful Islamist group fighting the forces of Bashar al-Assad. The project soon became my first exposure to the world of Libyan extremist politics and the influence it exerted over young men growing up in places such as Brighton and Manchester. The remarkable narrative that unfolded through detailed testimony from family, friends, police, social services and counterterrorism officials seemed to offer a sequence of facts that would probably never be repeated. That was until Manchester. It should be said that while the Deghayes brothers opted for al-Qaida’s branch of extremism and detested Islamic State, where Salman Abedi’s allegiance appeared to lie, they never displayed any intention to attack the west. But the similarities, including a shared Libyan axis, angst over the killing of Muslim children in Syria, issues with identity and a wayward hedonistic adolescence that became an increasingly pious outlook undoubtedly suggest a pattern. Abedi and the Deghayes brothers had Libyan parents with strong connections to the capital Tripoli. Both families had fled persecution by the dictator Colonel Gaddafi. The father of Abedi, Ramadan, fought with the Libyan Islamic Fighting Froup (LIFG) against the Gaddafi regime during the Libyan revolution in 2011. The uncle of the Deghayes boys, Omer, was also linked to LIFG, an outlawed group that the US state department says has links with al-Qaida. Omer would be detained at Guantánamo Bay from 2002-2007 and interrogated over “general-to-specific information on LIFG personalities and activities” within the UK. Abedi also had a Guantánamo connection and is understood to have known former detainee Ronald Fiddler, 50, alias Jamal al-Harith, who lived nearby in south Manchester. In February this year he detonated a suicide truck in Mosul, Iraq The Deghayes brothers frequently went to Libya. British police found a Facebook account registered in Libya, linked to Jaffar Deghayes and which contained an image of men in balaclavas on horseback in a desert in front of jihad’s “black flag”. Four months after the discovery, Jaffar headed to Syria. Abedi, who some sources say also travelled to Syria, returned from Libya days before the attack. On Wednesday Abedi’s father and brother Hashem were arrested in Tripoli by counterterrorism forces. A third brother, Ismail, has been arrested in the UK, raising, superfically at least, the latest instance of radicalised siblings. Two of the Deghayes brothers who went to Syria had a history of delinquency, smoking cannabis and repeated low-level crime. Abedi, too, smoked cannabis, drank and, according to at least one source, was known to the authorities for antisocial behaviour. Both Abedi and Jaffar Deghayes – the youngest British jihadist thought to have died in Syria – came to the attention of Prevent, the government’s anti-radicalisation programme, but no action was taken. Even though both Abedi and the Deghayes brothers were on the radar of counter-terrorism officials, they were able to travel abroad. It is a cliche of the globalised era to say that conflicts in faraway countries can affect our own lives. In the jihadi era, we are only now coming to realise the toxic British legacy of the dysfunctional, violent world of Gaddafi’s Libya."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2017/may/27/arsenal-chelsea-fa-cup-final-match-report","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-05-27T18:33:44Z","webTitle":"Aaron Ramsey fires Arsenal to FA Cup final win over 10-man Chelsea","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/may/27/arsenal-chelsea-fa-cup-final-match-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/may/27/arsenal-chelsea-fa-cup-final-match-report","fields":{"headline":"Aaron Ramsey fires Arsenal to FA Cup final win over 10-man Chelsea","bodyText":"Amid all the euphoria for Arsenal, there are bound to be people who wonder if these might also have been the ideal circumstances for Arsène Wenger to announce he was stepping aside and assure himself of a happy ending. His team had won, thrillingly, against the champions of England, making Wenger the most successful manager in the history of this competition. It was his seventh victory and, whatever his faults, a man with that record of achievement surely warrants the opportunity to go out on a high. Equally, these are the moments when Wenger must be reminded what it is about football that makes it so addictive. It is not easy kicking the habit, particularly on the days when everything falls into place and this for Arsenal was undoubtedly one of them. They picked a good time to put in their best performance of the season, denying Chelsea the double on a day when Victor Moses joined the list of players to suffer the indignity of being shown a red card in an FA Cup final. Moses had collected two second-half bookings and the fact the second one came from a choreographed attempt to win a penalty probably summed up the state to which Arsenal reduced their opponents. The only question for Wenger’s men is this: why can they not reach these heights more often? Arsenal were quick to the ball, strong in the tackle and, defensively, they played as though utterly determined not to let the fact they were missing key personnel influence the outcome. More than anything, they were free of the self-doubt that has often infiltrated their performances against Chelsea. Mesut Özil, for instance, seemed absolutely determined to leave his imprint on the final. Alexis Sánchez, possibly making his last appearance in Arsenal’s colours, shimmered with menace and now has 30 goals for the season. Danny Welbeck brought a mix of speed and directness and when Olivier Giroud came on as a substitute, just after Diego Costa’s equaliser, it was his first touch that set up Aaron Ramsey for the game’s decisive moment. The cross was delivered so expertly it would have been almost impolite for Ramsey, with a stooping header, not to accept the chance. By the end, it was starting to feel like a trick of the mind that the winning team had actually finished 18 points behind Chelsea in the league. Costa’s bouncing shot did briefly conjure up the possibility of an improbable comeback for the team with 10 men. But this was a poor day for Chelsea and it was rare to see N’Golo Kanté, for instance, finding it so difficult to keep up. Ramsey’s winner arrived within two minutes of Costa’s equaliser and when it comes to the first half it began with possibly the most torrid 30-minute spell Chelsea have endured all season. All of which was some achievement for Arsenal, bearing in mind the issues Wenger had approaching this final and the list of absentees that meant this was Per Mertesacker’s first start for more than a year (and his first appearance in a three-man defence). Wenger experimented with Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, with lingering questions about his fitness, on the left. And then there was the perplexing choice of David Ospina, with Wenger deciding his loyalty should go towards a second-choice goalkeeper who will leave this summer while leaving out the one, Petr Cech, who will stay. Unfortunately for Ospina, it was a weak attempt to keep out Costa’s goal, though he did make amends later on with a splendid save to prevent the same player taking the game into extra time. A goal at that stage would have been a reminder of Chelsea’s power of endurance but it would also have been largely unwarranted and Wenger was not exaggerating when he said his team should really have won by more. As it was, their first-half superiority brought only one goal and Chelsea are entitled to question whether it ought to have stood, not because of the argument about whether it was offside but more for the handball from Sánchez before he was in a position to shoot. There was no doubt Ramsey was in an offside position as Sánchez charged the ball down. Yet the Welshman had the presence of mind to step aside as the Chilean ran on to the loose ball, firing past Thibaut Courtois with the outside of his boot, and if the argument was purely about offside the referee, Anthony Taylor, and his assistant, Gary Beswick, did eventually get it right. The handball had not been noticed, however, and scoring so early, with only five minutes played, undoubtedly helped Arsenal settle more quickly than their opponents. Chelsea’s struggles in the first half were epitomised by their carelessness in the buildup to the goal, when Costa managed to get in the way of Kanté and the ball was lost. Arsenal, in contrast, used the ball effectively and it needed a brilliant clearance from Gary Cahill to prevent Özil from doubling the lead after Sánchez led one of their quick, incisive counterattacks. Four minutes later, Welbeck’s header from an Özil corner came back off a post, struck Ramsey in the chest and ricocheted back against the woodwork before going out for a goalkick. Later, Özil hit a post himself. Arsenal could conceivably have made it a far more resounding win. Chelsea did not lack adventure but it was not until the start of the second half that they seemed to remember they were supposed to be the best team in the country and, to be fair to Ospina, he made a fine one-handed save in that period to keep out Moses. Costa was a challenging opponent for Rob Holding, eluding him for the equaliser, but Moses deserved to go for his deception and Chelsea’s defence was strangely dishevelled as Giroud crossed from the left, Ramsey headed in and the most difficult, acrimonious season of Wenger’s managerial career ended happily."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/blog/2017/may/27/exeter-wasps-premiership-final-thriller-best-english-club-rugby","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-05-27T16:51:41Z","webTitle":"Exeter and Wasps serve up final thriller to show best of English club rugby | Michael Aylwin","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2017/may/27/exeter-wasps-premiership-final-thriller-best-english-club-rugby","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/blog/2017/may/27/exeter-wasps-premiership-final-thriller-best-english-club-rugby","fields":{"headline":"Exeter and Wasps serve up final thriller to show best of English club rugby","bodyText":"What a final, they kept saying, and they were right, but these finals always are. Folk have of late noted that we will not need play-offs any more, when they stretch the domestic season to 10 months, smoothing out those crinkly weekends which overlap with the international game. Yes we will. This is addictive. To be at Twickenham in high May is to see English club rugby at its best, and there is no reason to think it will be any different in high June. This time, as apparently every time, two superb, attack-minded teams cut each other up in their differing ways, Exeter by thumping Wasps through the guts, Wasps by unpicking the Exeter muscle. Twenty-two rounds could scarcely separate the two during the regular season, so 80 minutes had no chance. For the second time in four finals, we had to go to extra-time. Had to? It was a pleasure. In the end, the relentless pressure of Exeter prevailed over the pressure-point stings of Wasps. One of those cruel penalties at a scrum, albeit yielded after wave after wave of Exeter attack, allowed Gareth Steenson to convert the winning penalty in the 98th minute, two shy of the full, extra-time-fuelled 100. The identity of the winners, though, is but a detail on an occasion such as this. In time, we will celebrate the achievements of Exeter, from Championship to Champions in seven years, but for now we should celebrate the day. English rugby must be in rude health. Eighty thousand at Twickenham is one thing, but the deafening noise was tribal, the now-famous Tomahawk Chop lent an edge of omen in an arena like this, while Wasps’ single-syllable reply was reminiscent of the Iceland war chant popularised at the football World Cup, albeit on speed. And then there was the speed on the field, Wasps’ so deadly, Exeter’s so relentless. But, if Wasps are obviously lacking in any department it is physicality in the backs. Exeter’s heavy-duty three-quarters, particularly the centres, were constantly on the lookout for chances to run at smaller men, and there was never one very far away. Both sides made their errors in a match as pacy and entertaining as we had dared hope. Wasps, though, were noticeably the nervier for most of that first half. Exeter capitalised on their early dominance, although not as handsomely as they might have liked. When Jack Nowell was worked clean through off a lineout, we knew long before he touched down that he was not going to be stopped. Then Ollie Devoto, the biggest three-quarter of the lot, steamed through Wasps’ midfield to feed Phil Dollman, who steamed through the wide defence to the line. Exeter know only too well what big-stage nerves can do a rookie team’s first half, having been that side in last year’s final. They recovered well enough in the second half then only to fall short, so they knew to expect a Wasps comeback in the second half. It came even sooner than that, when Jimmy Gopperth streaked through on the stroke of half-time with a Wasps classic. The phenomenal Nathan Hughes, the one Wasps player whose physicality Exeter struggled to contain, had paved the way for that one, and he did the same just after the break, brushing off Exeter defenders as if they were merely irritating. Then it was over to those deadly little weapons in Wasps’ armoury, Christian Wade off down the right, the bounce of his kick favouring Elliot Daly. Tries either side of half-time – very All Blacks, very the stuff of champions. For 20 minutes, it seemed Exeter would finish this final as they had started last year’s – as a bag of nerves – but they steeled themselves as the clock wound up. An extraordinary 34-phase passage ought to have yielded points with 10 minutes of normal time remaining, but they had to wait until there was only one before Hughes, of all people, offered up to Steenson the chance to show how nerveless he can be. He took it to draw Exeter level at the death. The Chiefs’ physicality now started to tell. Wasps’ props were labouring, Matt Mullan having to come back on for the stricken Marty Moore, then suffering himself. The thought occurred they should give in to it and accept uncontested scrums, even if it meant going down to 14 men, as the regulations now decree. But they chose to soldier on, in the noblest tradition. It was to cost them. Their pain must now be indescribable, Exeter’s euphoria likewise, but that is the corollary of any final and not the point. The final itself is the thing. To win one, a side must show the nerve of champions, no matter where they finish in the league. And the rest of us can relish an occasion for kings. Long may they reign."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/live/2017/may/28/county-cricket-essex-v-surrey-somerset-v-hants-and-more-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-05-28T17:50:10Z","webTitle":"County cricket: Essex v Surrey, Hampshire beat Somerset and more – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2017/may/28/county-cricket-essex-v-surrey-somerset-v-hants-and-more-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/live/2017/may/28/county-cricket-essex-v-surrey-somerset-v-hants-and-more-live","fields":{"headline":"County cricket: Essex v Surrey, Hampshire beat Somerset and more – as it happened","bodyText":"Well, that’s the end of another fine day of action.

And that’s stumps at Tunbridge Wells, where Sussex are six down requiring heaps to beat Kent. I’ve just got to do some writing, so will leave the blog open for you to chat for a wee while. Mitchell goes four, six, four, four off Crook to finish with a run-a-ball 78 and earn a maximum point win for Worcestershire! Just 15 now required by Worcs, who are strolling home. Four from four. Ignore than last update - they obviously think they can get a result tonight at Northants and are charging on! Worcester now need just 32 to win... They are done for the day at Northampton too. Worcestershire will return tomorrow with eight wickets in hand, requiring 43 more to win to secure a fourth victory in four games. News: We are done for the day at Chelmsford! Umps inspecting at Chelmsford... Rain has stopped but should be damp enough for no more play. Sussex gets six down, as Denly gets Jordan... The Surrey players are involved in an elaborate game of boulle that involves them chucking tennis balls from the balcony towards a square on the outfield. Scurran sent out to inspect who wins. Puddles on the outfield here. Big wicket at Tunbridge Wells! Van Zyl goes to Denly and it’s 158 for five. Kent are going to win. Kleinveldt fells Fell and Worcestershire are two down chasing 148 at Northants. 94 still needed. Off for bad light at Swansea! Almost definitely all over for the day at Chelmsford. It’s hammering it down. And Durham are building a decent lead at Swansea, with Collingwood on 40 and Clark on 63 in a stand of 83. The lead is 147. Worcestershire need another 97 to beat Northants. They are 51 for one, after B-Dolly went caught and bowled to Rory K. Sussex digging in at Tunbridge Wells as van Zyl and Burgess have shared 56 in 23 overs. To absolutely no one’s surprise. Hello. You have my sincere apologies for my absence - an interview dragged on a little long. So the news here is that Surrey batted for an hour, and we are off for rain. Mark Stoneman got out, caught brilliantly at first slip off Wagner, and Surrey are 55 for one. The rain looks terminal... Wicket! Meaker returns and bowls Quinn first ball. The lead is 14. And that’s tea here. Kleinveldt gone at Northants! Lyon does the trick. With Levi retired hurt, Northants are 295 for seven and their lead is 99. Wicket! Rampaul’s toil is rewarded as Wagner guides him into the hands of Sanga at a wide-ish slip. 383 for nine. Rory Kleinveldt is being Rory Kleinveldt at Northampton! Worcestershire are 100-odd behind and there will be a tricky chase for them. 50 for Neil Wagner! 383 for eight now. Frustrating for Surrey. Wagner’s got really stuck into Virdi down the ground and the scores are level! Essex 369 for eight. Steve Mullaney has his maiden five-wicket haul as he gets Matt Taylor lbw and it’s all over in two-and-a-half days at Trent Bridge. Notts lead at the top of Division Two continues to grow. Two humps down the ground from Wagner off Virdi (Verdi) and he has 25. Essex 355 for eight. Gloucestershire are nine down as Mullaney gets Miles. Notts will win by an innings pretty soon, I’d say. High end wicket at Northants: Crook c Leach b Shantry. Wicket! Virdi has three! Bowling round the wicket, he’s pitched one on middle to Tendo and turned it back, pinning him in front. He’s gone for 53, and Essex are 344 for eight, behind by 25. Joverton struggling here. Neat bit of bowling and keeping, mind. Gloucestershire lose their eighth! Mustard made 49 but he’s been caught at second slip off Mullaney. Notts two wickets from victory. Tendo has a fifty! Crane gets Joverton and Hampshire win by 90 runs at Taunton! Crane ended with five wickets to Dawson’s four, which is encouraging. Hampshire, for now, go top of the table. Sussex two down ... Wells caught and bowled by Coles for 0. Could that be over today? Ahh Gregory goes to Dawson and Somerset are nine down. The end is nigh. Good recovery from Hampshire after that awful defeat to Essex last weekend... Crane has four! Leach gone, Somerset eight down and still need 93. Lewis Gregory the last hope... Coles has got Finch at TW and Sussex are in early trouble at five for one. An utterly pointless wicket at Derby, where Tom Taylor has got Paul Horton for 56. Leicestershire are 125 for one and the draw is on the way. Adam Rossington is gone at Northampton, who lead Worcestershire by 23 runs. They have five (maybe four, given Levi retired hurt) wickets in hand. Wicket at Taunton! Three for Crane! Craig Overton’s veen caught at second slip. 146 for seven. Sussex need 504 to win. Seems unlikely. Glamorgan are on the move! De Lange gets Cook, and Durham are five for one. Northamptonshire are in the lead against Worcestershire! Good wholesome cricket. Wicket! Well, well, well. Another wicket for Virdi! He needs to finish his over and Grievous Bodily Harmer was a bit confused by him. The final ball of the over he had a huge swing, missed, and was stumped very, very smartly by Ben Foakes! 305 for seven. Here’s the first: So, a few bits and pieces going on during the break. Glamorgan were finally bowled out for 353, a lead of 11, with ... They’ve also had an ambulance down to Wantage Road because Richard Levi was hit on the head by Josh Tongue. Hope he’s ok. Games are moving on fast, apart from here... Division One: Essex 305-6 v Surrey 369 Somerset 197 &amp; 126-6 v Hampshire 162 &amp; 293 Division Two: Leicestershire 619 &amp; 97-0 v Derbyshire 533 Kent 369 &amp; 258-2 v Sussex 164 Northants 238 &amp; 181-4 v Worcs 434 Glos 149 &amp; 124-6 v Notts 430-9d Glamorgan 343-9 v Durham 342 (extra half-hour etc) Enjoy your sarnies! Wicket! Amar Virdi has a maiden first-class wicket and it’s a beauty and he’s gone bananas! He’s given it some flight outside off, Foster’s gone to drive, it’s turned big and bowled him through the gate! He’s run off to point like a madman. Scenes. 305 for six and, seeing as that was the customary over of spin before the break, that’ll be lunch. Last wicket’s put on 43 for Glamorgan, which is very frustrating for Durham. And here it is. 300 up for Essex, and Foster and Tendo are going along nicely. Some untidy fielding from Surrey and the bowling hasn’t been great since the wicket of Lawrence. Extra half-hour before lunch at Trent Bridge? Oh my word. Strife. Hampshire have Somerset five down and Trego has gone! He’s been run out, which really isn’t ideal. They still need 158 more. Gregory joins the man who’ll need to get many of them, Dean Elgar, who is on 58. 111 for five. Dutch Timm gone to George Harding at Swansea and Glamorgan are nine down against Durham. A second wicket at Tunbridge Wells as van Zyl bowls Bell-Drummond, who really is a bit too good for that division, for 90. Kent’s lead is humungous. A couple of Division Two wickets to tell you about! At Trent Bridge, Broad has got Tavare (how England opening in the 80s), while the new ball has done the trick at Swansea. Rushworth has got MdL and Glamorgan are 278 for eight. Sussex finally got a Kent wicket! They are 178 for one with Dickson the man to go. Their lead is a whopping 383. Somerset are now four down and in quite deep trouble. Liam Dawson has got Steven Davies, whose tough patch continues. 100 for four, and they still need 159 to win. Glos now four down, as Broad gets George Hankins for a duck! James Foster in for his first Champo knock of the summer. And now Notts have another! Mullaney gets van Buuren for a second-ball duck! Wicket! Lawrence is gone for 107. He stepped across to Meaker and, as he likes to, tried to flick him to leg. But he missed, it hit his pad and the finger had to go up. it’s 256 for five. Gloucestershire have been frustrating Notts at Trent Bridge, and Bancroft made a 50, but now he’s gone to Mullaney! 98 for two. Duckett goes lbw to Nathan Lyon and Northants are in trouble! 124 for four, still 72 behind. Somerset are three down, as Crane bowls Hildreth in his first over! 74 for three, and trouble... It’s been a really lovely knock. He gets there with a single through backward point off CurranT, and it’s very warmly received indeed. 199 balls, 15 fours. Somerset 70 for two as Dawson gets Abell! Dawson will bowl all day, you’d think... Consecutive legside boundaries for Dan Lawrence – the second going straight through Tom Curran at mid-on – takes him to 98 ... Not good fielding, that. A half-century for Ben Duckett at Northants! Serious delivery. CurranT’s just had Lawrence edging short of first slip. Wicket! And an absolute beauty for CurranT! He’s got one to jag back miles at Ravi, who has left it and been bowled spectacularly! Off-stump pinned back. Ends a stand of 106, the score is 232 for four. Morning Stuie! Gloucestershire have a challenge on their hands today, but Glamorgan – who defied Notts for two days last weekend – have shown them the way. They have not lost a wicket yet this morning. A wicket for Shantry! The nightwatchman Buck goes, and Worcestershire need seven more. A podcast with Shantry! Well Essex have got through the first half hour against the new ball. Surrey have offered them plenty that they can leave, and the only moment of alarm came when Ravi B edged Ravi R through the vacant third slip area. 232 for three, and Lawrence has 89. Hampshire are on the move! Dawson gets Trescothick caught behind! 58 for one. Durham have a seventh at Swansea, as Paul Coughlin gets Chris Cooke caught and bowled! 233 for seven, 109 behind. Dougie Broon’s got the UAE gig full time. Best of luck. Very odd that Sean Ervine is bowling at Taunton. I’ve seen his offies - they are rank. 50 up for Somerset! They need 202 to win. Hampshire need wickets, and sharpish. Couple of early wickets at Derby and the hosts are BUNDLED out for 533. They trail by 86. Could something be contrived? Probably not, to be honest. They might as well call it all off. I mean, no one’s there ... Here’s the live-stream from Trent Bridge! Vic’s written a Champions Trophy preview! Surrey have taken the new ball. First nut, bowled by Tom Curran, is on Lawrence’s hip, so he just glances it fine for four. He has 82. Ravi Rampaul to Ravi Bopara at the other end. Very generous guard of honour! Good crowd at the Oval where there’s international cricket - live! How many results are we going to get today, then? I’m saying four: Derby (obviously, because it’s the final day; could they contrive something there?), Northampton, Trent Bridge and Taunton. This looks nice. Happy Sunday! Hope you’re well. I’m back at Chelsmford, where the weather is fine (for now). Essex batted slowly yesterday, but have ground out a decent position. Can Dan Lawrence get a ton? The new ball is due! Elsewhere, a thrilling third (and surely final) day of action at Taunton, where all four results are possible. In Div Two, the interminable game at Derby will finally end today, while results seem likely at Northampton and Trent Bridge too. Kent are in a strong position at Tunbridge Wells and things are pretty even at Glamorgan against Durham. Division One: Essex 215-3 v Surrey 369 Somerset 197 &amp; 39-0 v Hampshire 162 &amp; 293 Division Two: Derbyshire 532-8 v Leicestershire 619 Kent 369 &amp; 116-0 v Sussex 164 Northants 238 &amp; 53-2 v Worcs 434 Glos 149 &amp; 37-1 v Notts 430-9d Glamorgan 225-6 v Durham 342 Here’s my report and roundup from yesterday.

A meeting of more than 250 delegates at Uluru last week rejected the idea of constitutional recognition, saying instead they wanted a constitutionally enshrined Indigenous voice in parliament and a commission that would work on securing a treaty. They rejected the word “recognition” outright, calling the proposed changes a reform. Di Natale has called on the Turnbull government to listen to the calls for structural reform, saying real changes meant a treaty with Australia’s First Nations people. “It means ensuring that Aboriginal people have a strong voice and a strong representative body, and the Greens stand with them,” Di Natale said. “Malcolm Turnbull now has an opportunity to listen and act, to bring the country together, and he can do that if he’s prepared to finally give Indigenous people the voice they so desperately need in the nation’s parliament through a representative body and start making progress towards a treaty. “If constitutional recognition is a step on the pathway to achieving those things it will be a great thing for the nation. “If on the other hand Malcolm Turnbull thinks that simply making a few changes to the constitution without deep structural change, like an Indigenous representative body and ensuring that we have a treaty with our First Nations people, then he will be continuing the huge disadvantage that we see right now.” Turnbull warned on the weekend that the last “controversial” amendment to the constitution was approved in 1946, demonstrating that the majority of Australians were conservative on questions of constitutional reform. “History would indicate that to succeed not only must there be overwhelming support, but minimal, or at least tepid, opposition,” he told the National Reconciliation Week lunch in Melbourne. “No political deal, no cross-party compromise, no leaders’ handshake can deliver constitutional change. “To do that, a constitutionally conservative nation must be persuaded that the proposed amendments respect the fundamental values of the constitution and will deliver precise changes, clearly understood, that benefit all Australians.” The Labor leader, Bill Shorten, did not publicly back the Uluru statement either, saying only that Labor would now look at the recommendations. “We owe them an open mind on the big questions – the form recognition takes, on treaties, on changes required to the constitution, and on the best way to fulfil the legitimate and long-held aspiration of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people for a meaningful, equal place in our democratic system,” he said on the weekend. “It is important that we combine government and opposition to try to work cooperatively, I’m sure we will have further dialogue, both of us will need to think hard, talk to colleagues and the Referendum Council and broadly with the community,” he said. The Referendum Council will provide details of the new proposal from Indigenous leaders in its final report to the Coalition and Labor on 30 June."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/live/2017/may/28/general-election-2017-tories-set-to-relaunch-campaign-amid-fall-in-poll-lead","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-05-28T11:08:21Z","webTitle":"General election 2017:  Corbyn, Abbott and Rudd clash over security after Manchester attack - live","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2017/may/28/general-election-2017-tories-set-to-relaunch-campaign-amid-fall-in-poll-lead","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/live/2017/may/28/general-election-2017-tories-set-to-relaunch-campaign-amid-fall-in-poll-lead","fields":{"headline":"General election 2017:  Corbyn, Abbott and Rudd clash over security after Manchester attack - as it happened","bodyText":"Thank you for following the blog today. Here is a summary of the main developments: The shadow home secretary, Diane Abbott, has compared her previous support for the defeat of the British army in Northern Ireland to a haircut that is no longer in fashion. Asked on BBC1’s Andrew Marr show about her 1984 comments that “every defeat is a victory for all of us”, Abbott said: “I had an afro. It was 34 years ago. The hairstyle has gone and some of the views have gone.” She also said she no longer supported previous calls for the abolition of MI5 because it has “reformed”. Jeremy Corbyn declined to comment directly on Abbott’s comments but defended his own record of voting against some anti-terror legislation as him being “assiduous in his scrutiny of anti-terror laws”. He also pointed out that David Davis and Theresa May had voted with him on occasions. Both the defence secretary, Michael Fallon, and the home secretary, Amber Rudd, claimed more lives would be lost to terrorism if Jeremy Corbyn were to be prime minister. Fallon said Corbyn would “presumably” revoke some of the terror legislation he does not like, although the Labour leader has never said that. Fallon denied there was a rift within the Conservative party about the social care U-turn and the recent dip in their poll lead, describing the report as “tittle-tattle”. He also denied that the Tories were exclusively concentrating on negative campaigning against Corbyn, while failing to present their own positive vision for the future. In interviews this morning, both Fallon and Rudd were keen to present Jeremy Corbyn as having “justified” terrorism by talking about the impact of Britain’s foreign policy. In response, Corbyn said that Theresa May and David Davis had joined him in voting against aspects of anti-terrorism legislation in the past. Labour peer Stewart Wood has dug out a quote by Davis, illustrating the point: During his interview with Peston, the defence secretary, Michael Fallon, dismissed reports that the Tories were in disarray over the controversial social care plans as “Westminster tittle tattle”. No, this is Theresa May leading our party. We’ve put into the policy now some additional reassurance because of the scaremongering of Labour after the manifesto was published, further reassurance that people will not lose their home, they will not lose all of their savings. But yes, some people will be asked to make a contribution to raising the quality of social care. The Lib Dems have criticised Amber Rudd’s refusal to spell out the social care cap when asked about it on the Andrew Marr Show. Their health spokesman, Norman Lamb, said: The refusal of the Conservatives to tell us what the cap on social care costs will be shows they are holding the public in contempt. Theresa May must stop flip-flopping and do what her party had committed to, implement a £72,000 cap on care. Conservative plans for a dementia tax are cruel and not properly thought through. It shows Theresa May is taking people for granted. The Liberal Democrats will keep campaigning to scrap the dementia tax and ensure no one has to face catastrophic costs to pay for their care. The defence secretary, Michael Fallon, is on Peston. He says: We would certainly be less safe if Jeremy Corbyn was prime minister. Fallon says Corbyn would “presumably” revoke some of the terror legislation he does not like, claiming he is “soft on terrorism”. Peston points out that Corbyn has not made any suggestion that he would water down terror legislation. There is a lot of toing and froing about Boris Johnson’s comments on how the Iraq war impacted the UK with respect to the terror threat. Fallon claims Corbyn has justified terrorist attacks based on the UK’s foreign policy. Peston responds by saying Corbyn said no such thing. Peston suggests negative campaigning is going to lose the Tories like it lost Zac Golsmith the London mayoral election. Fallon says the PM has set out her view for positive Brexit negotiations. Peston asks Fallon about the IFS saying reducing immigration to tens of thousands would cost money. Fallon says there are benefits as well. This was Corbyn’s response when confronted about Abbott’s comments on the IRA/her hairstyle: Next up on Peston is Ukip leader Paul Nuttall. Peston says you’re a party that says it believes in freedom but seems to want a return to a police state. Nuttall says more bobbies on the beat will mean people talking to them about potential threats. He is asked how Ukip can get the integration they want if they have policies targeting Muslims, such as the burqa ban. Nuttall repeats previous Ukip claims that part of the reason for the ban is that it causes vitamin D deficiencies. He says he would ban all face coverings - not just Muslim ones - but there would be “special dispensation” for masks at carnivals, as in other countries. Peston says reducing immigration to zero would harm the economy in the views of every economist he has spoken to. Nuttall says that is “debatable”. Were we right to allow Salman Abedi’s parents, who were Libyan refugees, into the country, Corbyn is asked by Peston. He says we have a clear obligation to take people who are under serious threat but that does not preclude monitoring people where appropriate. Which of Britain’s wars since the end of the second world war have been appropriate Corbyn is asked. He says when Britain has participated in UN operations and brought about peace. Helping bringing ceasefires in Zimbabwe, East Timor. He says bombing in Kosovo went too far. A viewer question asks Corbyn what would happen if companies leave Britain as a result of corporation tax rising. The Labour leader says they would still be doing business in the UK. People are worried increasing the minimum wage will mean people don’t want to employ young people, Peston suggests. Corbyn says he recognises it could be a problem for small businesses, suggests there could be subsidies. Corbyn says: The cuts in police numbers have led to some very dangerous situations emerging. Peston asks if the Labour leader regrets having referred to terrorists as “freedom fighters”. Corbyn denies he has done that and says he condemns individual acts of terrorism. Asked to clarify whether he met members of the IRA. I’ve met former prisoners who have told me they are not in the IRA. After the Paris attacks, Corbyn called for a negotiated settlement in Syria, which Peston puts to him suggested that he would talk to Isis. The Labour leader rejects that interpretation. Asked about Diane Abbot’s comments on Marr about her hair style changing with her views, Corbyn looks uncomfortable. He says with a straight face that her hair style is a matter for her and does not answer Peston’s question as to whether her comments are “trivialising” terror. Will Abbott be home secretary in a Labour government? Corbyn: She is our home affairs spokeswoman. Jeremy Corbyn is on Peston on Sunday now. After talking about Arsenal’s FA Cup final victory (they are both Gunners fans), Peston says Corbyn voted 17 times “against laws designed to keep us safe”. The Labour leader says he has been “assiduous in his scrutiny of anti-terror laws” and yes voted against them but so did David Davis and Theresa May in some instances. He says he represents a constituency with a lot of Irish people who were detained in the 1970s without independent judicial oversight. He says you must have independent judicial oversight. Caroline Lucas has clarified her comments to Andrew Marr about encryption earlier. Rudd is asked by Marr about the abolition of control orders, “which seemed to be effective”. He says if Abedi was subject to one he would not have been able to commit the Manchester atrocity. Rudd says terrorism prevention and investigation measures (Tpims) are more effective. Asked about the low number of Tpims, she says it is up to the security services to request them. On end-to-end encryption, Rudd says she is making “good progress” with a number of companies. Marr says banning end-to-end encryption would “devastate the internet economy”, banking etc. Rudd says she never suggested that. The home secretary says Jeremy Corbyn, Abbott and John McDonnell all have a history of voting against anti-terrorism legislation and taking a dig at Abbott’s earlier comment to Marr, says: I have changed my hair style too in 34 years but I have not changed my view on how to keep the British people safe. It’s Amber Rudd’s turn now. Asked if some of the Manchester network are still at large, she says “potentially”. She will not answer “what the security services did or did not know [about Salman Abedi]” at this stage. Abbott says she is in favour of a DNA database but not in favour of keeping the DNA of children on the DNA database. Asked about end-to-end encryption, Abbot says we have to work with WhatsApp to access messages and would hope companies would want to work with us. A difficult interview ends with Abbot pledging: I will run the best Home Office I can. Diane Abbott is up now and asked about the perception by some people that she cannot be trusted. Abbott says she worked in the home office as a graduate trainee for three years so understands it. She also has worked with diverse communities, she says. Marr asks about an early-day motion signed by Abbott calling for the abolition of MI5. Abbot says MI5 has reformed since then and she supports it now. Asked about her voting against anti-terrorism legislation on a number of occasions, she says lots of Tories voted against them, including Theresa May and David Davis. Abbott also says that courts later effectively upheld some of the decisions she took in her voting. Next, Marr asks about her voting against al-Qaida being proscribed prior to 9/11. Abbott says it was not just al-Qaida on the list. Marr reads out the names of the other organisations and says they were all terrible organisations. Abbott says the issue with some of the groups was whether they were dissidents in their country. Next Marr asks about a statement of support Abbott made for the IRA 34 years ago. She replies: I had a rather splendid afro at the time ...The hair style has gone and some of the views have gone. Caroline Lucas also said she would like to see end-to-end encryption, where only the communicating parties can read the messages, ended. She said she would do what the security services deemed necessary. The Green party co-leader, Caroline Lucas, is on now speaking to Marr and - echoing Wood – says that targeted surveillance works, not mass surveillance. People like myself are on the domestic extremist list. She is asked about her description of the Prevent anti-extremism scheme as “xenophobic”. Lucas says it must be “broad and exclusive”, but it is viewed by Muslims as toxic. The Plaid Cymru leader, Leanne Wood, is speaking to Andrew Marr. She says it makes “no sense” for the emergency services that rushed to help in the aftermath of the Manchester Arena attack to have their budgets cut. We wouldn’t need troops on the street if there were enough police officers on the street. Wood says her party remains opposed to mass surveillance. It’s better that they watch those people at most risk ... rather than the entire population. Talking about the forthcoming Champions League football final in Cardiff, Wood says people should not be put off coming and should be reassured by the extra security presence. Good morning. Welcome to the Guardian’s continuing coverage of the general election campaigning. The home secretary, Amber Rudd, and the shadow home secretary, Diane Abbott, will be on BBC1’s Andrew Marr Show from 9am talking about how to keep Britain safe in the wake of the terrorist outrage in Manchester. Peston on Sunday, on ITV at 10am, features the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, defence secretary Michael Fallon, Ukip leader Paul Nuttall, Vince Cable from the Lib Dems, and the SNP’s Tasmina Sheikh. The awful events in Manchester obviously remain at the forefront of everyone’s mind. But as the parties get back to campaigning in earnest, the narrowing of the gap between the Conservatives and Labour in the opinion polls is likely to be a major talking point. The Sunday Times reports that the Tories will relaunch their campaign after it was pushed off course by “their manifesto mess” and events in Manchester. It says this will mean a return to the core message: “Only Theresa May can be trusted to negotiate Brexit.” It reports divisions within the Conservative camp over who is to blame for a two-thirds fall in the Tory lead since the launch of the election campaign. The Observer reports that Corbyn has dramatically cut Theresa May’s previously commanding lead in approval ratings among voters, according to its latest poll, carried out by Opinium: More than a third of voters (37%) say their opinion of the prime minister is more negative than at the start of the campaign, against 25% who say it is more positive. The opposite is true of the Labour leader, with 39% saying they have a more positive view of Corbyn compared with 14% who now have a more negative view."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/may/30/when-politicians-bully-judges-and-journalists-they-need-to-stand-firm","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-05-30T06:44:20Z","webTitle":"When politicians bully, judges and journalists need to stand firm | Richard Ackland","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/may/30/when-politicians-bully-judges-and-journalists-they-need-to-stand-firm","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/may/30/when-politicians-bully-judges-and-journalists-they-need-to-stand-firm","fields":{"headline":"When politicians bully, judges and journalists need to stand firm","bodyText":"“We had a very smooth roll out of the travel ban, but we had a bad court. We’ve had a bad decision.” That was Donald Trump at his White House press conference after the ninth circuit court of appeals restrained his executive order affecting seven Muslim countries. For good measure, the president added that the ninth circuit “is in chaos ... that circuit is frankly in turmoil”. When federal “so-called” Judge James Robart made the initial order to block Trump’s executive ban, the president tweeted: “Just cannot believe a judge would put our country in such peril. If something happens blame him and court system. People pouring in. Bad!” On Thursday, an appeals court refused to reinstate Trump’s travel ban. When another judge blocked the president’s order to withhold funding from cities and towns that refuse to cooperate with immigration authorities, the White House put out a statement that read: The San Francisco judge’s erroneous ruling is a gift to the criminal gang and cartel element in our country ... This case is yet one more example of egregious overreach by a single, unelected district judge. Judges get no respect from this president, unless they are a hand-picked “originalist” like Neil Gorsuch, his supreme court appointment. The White House ceremony announcing his nominee to a bunch of claqueurs was a sight for sore eyes. Like a sideshow barker, Trump introduced Gorsuch and “his wonderful wife Louise ... Here they come. So was that a surprise – was it?” This was the appointment that had been stolen from the Democrats because the Senate refused to consider President Obama’s nominee, Merrick Garland, to replace the recently departed Antonin Scalia. The New York Times commented: “The presumption should be that Gorsuch does not deserve confirmation, because the process that led to his nomination was illegitimate.” Judges who don’t toe the line are bad judges in bad courts. Illegitimate appointments of judges who are died-in-the-wool conservatives are “brilliant”. This is the world of a president who has a distorted grasp of the constitutional construct and his place in it. Little wonder that he wants to be judge and executioner. One of his many obsessions during the election campaign was the US soldier Sgt Bowe Bergdhal who went missing from his unit in Afghanistan and was captured by the Taliban, until released in a swap with Guantanamo prisoners. Bergdhal now faces a court martial, but as far as Trump is concerned he’s already been found guilty. He told a slathering mod of supporters: “He deserted. Remember the old days? A deserter, what happened? Bang. Twenty years ago it was bang,” and just to ram it home he gave us a rifle-shooting gesture. We also saw this failure to grasp constitutional niceties and the separation of powers when he sought to fix the FBI’s investigation into the role Russia played in the US elections. Maybe it also slipped his mind that the first article of Richard Nixon’s impeachment was “obstruction of justice”. We saw it too with his less than perfect grasp of the first amendment: “I’m going to open up our libel laws so when they write purposely negative and horrible and false articles, we can sue them and win lots of money.” Clearly, he hadn’t factored in whether the supreme court might have other ideas about the freedom of the press and how much money could be won. Then we have Article 1, section 9, clause 8 of the US Constitution, about which Trump seems quite oblivious. This is the “emoluments” clause, which Harvard law professors believe the president is violating, largely because he is a beneficiary of potentates, diplomats and other foreign emissaries paying to stay at his over-gilded hotels and clubs. Quite apart from constitutional requirements there is his flagrant breach of decency by retaining ownership of the Trump organisation, now run by his gormless sons. The potential for corruption is also ably assisted by the fact the the log book of visitors to the White House is now under lock and key or has disappeared entirely. It is evident that great danger is posed to our powerful ally by a president who doesn’t understand his constitutional duty, the separation of powers and and the limits of his remit. It’s as though he’s still running his companies, where he can bark orders at people and they jump. You wonder how long it takes to sink in that barking orders at Congress, the courts and the media does not produce the same response. No wonder people have unearthed the 25th amendment to the US constitution and are examining it with fresh eyes. It deals with “presidential vacancy, disability and inability”. Where a president is emotionally and intellectually ill-equipped for the job and raddled by delusions, the courts and a truth-seeking media become even more important. In Australia, the immigration minister, Peter Dutton, who carries a field marshal’s baton in his knapsack, is on a mission to bring the courts and the media into line. The ABC’s Q&amp;A program is never far from the top of the minister’s pet obsessions. Last week’s instalment of the program got right up his nostril, apparently because physicist Lawrence Krauss said Americans and others are more likely to be killed by a falling refrigerator than a terrorist. Dutton declared the ABC has a “cultural problem”, Q&amp;A is a “waste of taxpayers’ money” and the board “needs to deal with it”. He didn’t cite any statistics to rebut Krauss’s assertion about fridges, but maybe he’d be happier if the fridge-to-terror death ratio was a little less uneven. He was beating the same drum following Zaky Mallah’s appearance on the program almost two years ago. Q&amp;A had “lost the plot, ABC journalists are running a “protection racket”, etc, etc. If the minister as editor-in-chief is not daunting enough he also seeks to set the agenda for judges and magistrates. He’s ably assisted in his mission of whack-a-judge by the Murdoch press and, because judges are not permitted to speak up for themselves, the Judicial Conference of Australia has to do it for them. Most recently he turned on Justice Duncan Kerr, the president of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and a former Labor minister for justice. Without being troubled by the notions like the separation of powers, Dutton weighed in: When you look at some of the judgments that are made, the sentences that are handed down ... [it’s] always interesting to go back and look at the appointment of the particular Labor government of the day. The minister provided no evidence about decisions of Justice Kerr that had been infected by Labor party policies while the Judicial Conference of Australia had to point out that the president of the tribunal cannot direct the findings and decisions of other members and in any event the AAT does not hand down “sentences”. As it’s name suggests, it reviews “administrative” decisions. In February, in the wake of a bail decision that saw a killer released from custody, Dutton declared that Queensland magistrates were “leftwing softies ... [and] hopeless”. “If you appoint civil libertarians to court benches ... you will get soft sentences and that’s exactly what’s happened here.” We are living in troubled times. When politicians with a imperfect grasp of propriety are bullying the judiciary and the media, more than ever those two institutions need to hold their ground."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"sport/2017/may/27/eoin-morgan-england-south-africa-unbelievable-win-ben-stokes","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-05-27T19:46:22Z","webTitle":"Eoin Morgan describes England’s win over South Africa as ‘unbelievable’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/may/27/eoin-morgan-england-south-africa-unbelievable-win-ben-stokes","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/may/27/eoin-morgan-england-south-africa-unbelievable-win-ben-stokes","fields":{"headline":"Eoin Morgan describes England’s win over South Africa as ‘unbelievable’","bodyText":"“Unbelievable,” said Eoin Morgan and he does not usually do hyperbole. Teams seldom win when the opposition needs 10 runs from 10 balls with five wickets in hand but that is what his England side managed. “We decided we needed wickets [before the final over from Mark Wood] and to make them hit the ball in the air,” explained Morgan. “But we didn’t take any wickets and still managed to win. Unbelievable. Wood’s yorkers are usually good at the end but we decided to go with his raw pace. We thought a few bouncers was our best chance of taking those wickets. Maybe we bluffed them.” Morgan’s smile suggested he was not so sure about that. It was the best kind of victory since it was so unlikely with 10 balls to go. Sides cherish those wins the most. Ben Stokes’s century was obviously significant but there remain concerns for his captain about the fitness of his gun all-rounder. “We are monitoring him,” said Morgan, “and managing him the best we can with the Champions Trophy in mind. He is certainly good to play as a batsman at Lord’s [on Monday]. It depends how he pulls up. But he wants to play. I think that unless he’s injured or a risk he will play.” If that is the case he will not be bowling his full quota of overs since that is the process which currently gives Stokes pain. At the Ageas Bowl he was restricted to just three overs. “Before the end I’d already decided that was enough,” said Morgan, who also has to keep an eye on Chris Woakes’ fitness as well. “His absence was more precautionary but we don’t want to take any risks with him.” Morgan’s opposite number, AB de Villiers, did his best to hide his disappointment. “We got a bit excited at the end,” he said before applauding how David Miller and Chris Morris had almost taken his side to victory. De Villiers was more cheerful about his side’s performance than his conversation with the umpires, Rob Bailey and Chris Gaffaney, midway through England’s innings. De Villiers was candid and serious when explaining how the umpires felt that the condition of one of the balls had changed. “I was upset by that. I had the feeling that they felt we were responsible for that. It felt as if we were being accused of ball‑tampering.” He then added that no further steps were taken and the ball was not changed. “I think it was just a bad ball. That happens sometimes.” De Villiers’ sensitivity on this issue can be explained by South Africa’s experiences in the winter when there were accusations of ball‑tampering, most notably against Faf du Plessis after the Hobart Test against in Australia as well as during the one-day series against New Zealand. Du Plessis was heavily fined and extremely grumpy about that.

Under the 1998 Data Protection Act, it can be illegal to process ‘sensitive’ data – a category that includes ‘political opinions’ – without explicit consent from the individuals concerned, although consent is only one of a number of conditions under which sensitive personal data may be legally processed. But despite numerous attempts by the Observer to contact Conservative HQ last week, the party refused to say if it is using any data, modelling or insight gathered during the referendum campaigns for use in the current general election. Kinnock, the Labour candidate for Aberavon, who has filed complaints with the CPS and Metropolitan Police regarding what he believes are breaches of the law by the Leave campaigns – claims which they deny – said the refusal to give clear answers about the possible use of that data in this election raised urgent new questions. “The Tories need to urgently disclose exactly what data they have and what they are doing with it. It’s illegal to collect sensitive political data for one purpose and then use it for another. The Data Protection Act clearly states that. “You can’t have a functioning democracy without transparency. It’s clearly in the public interest to have this information. This must now be referred to the Information Commissioner’s Office, which needs to give this their urgent attention. The election is less than two weeks away, and the authorities have an obligation to defend our democracy.” Earlier this month, the information commissioner, Elizabeth Denham, announced that the office would be “deepening our current activity to explore practices deployed during the UK’s EU referendum campaign” and had opened “a formal investigation into the use of data analytics for political purposes”. She also said she would “remind all relevant organisations of the need to comply with the law. I have written to all major political parties with our updated guidance on campaigning.” Will Straw, the head of the Stronger In campaign, echoed Kinnock’s call, saying: “The Information Commissioner’s Office should launch an urgent investigation.” He said it was a matter of urgency given the election is only two weeks away. He added: “Since the Conservative party was neutral in the referendum, the public have a right to know if they are now benefiting from data or insights gathered from the Leave campaign.” Martin Moore, director of the Centre for the Study of Media, Communication and Power at King’s College London, who has studied the rapid and radical changes that digital campaigning has brought to the political landscape in Britain, said there were “urgent questions to be answered about Vote Leave’s data”. He has been searching for answers about use of data during the referendum, and contributed to an LSE report published in April that called for “an urgent review” of UK electoral law. On 8 June 2107 this article was amended to make clear that express consent is not the only condition which allows for sensitive personal data to be processed. Other conditions for processing are set out in Schedule 3 of Data Protection Act 1998 and explained in ICO guidance."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2017/may/27/celtic-aberdeen-scottish-cup-final-match-report","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-05-27T16:16:17Z","webTitle":"Celtic strike at the last to beat Aberdeen in Scottish Cup final and win treble","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/may/27/celtic-aberdeen-scottish-cup-final-match-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/may/27/celtic-aberdeen-scottish-cup-final-match-report","fields":{"headline":"Celtic strike at the last to beat Aberdeen in Scottish Cup final and win treble","bodyText":"If anyone claims winning trophies in Scotland is akin to defeating a hamster at chess, this Scottish Cup final should be used as the perfect counter-point. The scale of Celtic’s celebrations as Tom Rogic guided the club, and Brendan Rodgers, into uncharted territory told a story of what toil had come before. Rodgers and Celtic, this now-famous Celtic side, have completed an unbeaten domestic season. It took a titanic battle with Aberdeen for Celtic to complete a clean sweep of domestic trophies. Rodgers is the third manager in the club’s illustrious history to win a treble. It was, though, impossible not to feel sorry for Derek McInnes and Aberdeen, who contributed so much to this final before quality – and fitness – told. Rogic strode forward from midfield in stoppage time in what proved the last act of this campaign, the Australian’s low finish at Joe Lewis’s near post the precursor for outright delirium as the Aberdeen contingent sank to their knees en masse in dismay. “This is a great day for the club,” said Rodgers. “I’m elated, this is an incredible feeling. Maybe the stars were aligned for Celtic this season, but don’t get me wrong: we have earned it.” McInnes, the Aberdeen manager, did nothing to hide his upset. “We put so much into it that I’m gutted for the players and supporters,” he said. “We played our part in a great final.” Jayden Stockley displayed the robust approach that surprisingly earned him an Aberdeen starting berth on 21 minutes. His arm caught Kieran Tierney in the mouth in front of the technical area, with the young Celtic full-back immediately in distress. After a lengthy delay, and on account of considerable bleeding, Tierney’s game was over. Replays were inconclusive regarding whether what Stockley did was illegal – his elbow certainly was not flailing – with only the player himself knowing about any element of intent. Tierney returned to raise the Scottish Cup alongside his team-mates, to a rousing ovation. By the point of Tierney’s exit the teams had already traded goals. This was breathless, brilliantly entertaining stuff, with Aberdeen using the early stages to demonstrate they would not be cowed by Celtic’s lofty status. The Premiership champions were more rattled during the first half than at any juncture in their domestic season. The last 12 teams to score first in the Scottish Cup final ultimately won the game. Jonny Hayes provided the men from the north-east that hope, having raced on to a Niall McGinn corner to send a first-time shot past the despairing Tierney on the line and into the Celtic net. Leigh Griffiths had been woefully lazy in allowing Hayes to beat him to the ball; a matter for which the Celtic striker visibly apologised to his goalkeeper, Craig Gordon, in the aftermath. Celtic’s response was instant. Aberdeen did not properly halt a Callum McGregor run, with the ball breaking to Stuart Armstrong 22 yards from goal. The midfielder took a couple of steps forward before taking advantage of sluggish Shay Logan defending when picking his spot. Aberdeen’s confidence was not blunted by Celtic’s intervention and they remained the better team until the interval. Gordon batted away efforts from McGinn and Ryan Jack before doing likewise to a net-bound Andy Considine header. Yet, curiously, it was Celtic who rued the worst miss of the opening 45 minutes, by Scott Sinclair after a tremendous Griffiths cross found him three yards from goal. Sinclair, who has been prolific during his first season in Scotland, somehow scooped the ball over the crossbar. Griffiths’s shot was deflected narrowly wide, five minutes after the restart, as Celtic looked to assert their superior talent. That was not yet the signal for an onslaught, though; Aberdeen passed up a glorious opportunity as Hayes agonisingly failed to find the onrushing and free Kenny McLean with a cut-back. With 15 minutes to play, fatigue set in for Aberdeen. Celtic spent the closing stages laying siege to their opponents’ goal. Sinclair again fluffed his lines when handed a simple chance to put his team in front. Strangely, with the match edging towards extra time and potency required, Rodgers resisted any temptation to introduce the fit again Moussa Dembélé from among his replacements. As with virtually everything that has happened since he arrived in Glasgow, Rodgers was proven right. Rogic, himself a substitute, left Aberdeen’s defenders in his slipstream. Celtic have long since done exactly the same to the rest of Scottish football."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"environment/2017/may/30/robert-llewellyns-quest-to-spur-a-green-energy-revolution-in-his-village","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-05-30T14:55:45Z","webTitle":"Robert Llewellyn's quest to spur a green energy revolution in his village","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/may/30/robert-llewellyns-quest-to-spur-a-green-energy-revolution-in-his-village","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/may/30/robert-llewellyns-quest-to-spur-a-green-energy-revolution-in-his-village","fields":{"headline":"Robert Llewellyn's quest to spur a green energy revolution in his village","bodyText":"Robert Llewellyn is not a typical eco-activist. “Oh, I’m absolutely un-green,” says the actor and TV presenter. “I’m as un-green as a corporate exec. I fly a lot. Though I have hugged a tree. Actually, I’ve lent against one while I was having a wee in the woods, I’m not sure if that counts?” You don’t need to wear an environmental hairshirt, however, to believe it’s possible to live in a different, more sustainable way. For the actor, who presented Scrapheap Challenge on Channel 4 and is best known for playing Kryten on BBC2’s Red Dwarf, that belief stemmed from a longstanding passion for new technologies, particularly renewable energy. Why, he wondered, were we all powering our cars, cities and homes with carbon-based energy, shipped hundreds of miles or more from big, polluting power plants? Surely technological advances meant we could be generating our power in different ways, and much closer to home? Even, perhaps, if you lived in a tiny clutch of houses in the Cotswolds countryside? So Llewellyn set out to test his thesis in his home village in Gloucestershire. The result is The Great Village Green Crusade, to be screened on Thursday on BBC4, which captures Llewellyn’s quest to persuade Temple Guiting, a community that has been around since the Domesday Book, that it could generate its own electricity and find itself at the cutting edge of the green energy revolution. That, at least, was the plan. The year-long quest was in fact filmed over two and a half, owing to the daunting and occasionally insurmountable hurdles that Llewellyn and a small band of heroically enthusiastic neighbours encountered almost every step of the way. “We didn’t have to fake any jeopardy, that’s for sure,” he says. The biggest problem, to Llewellyn’s surprise, was not convincing residents of the village where he has lived for 25 years (“another 25 and you’ll almost be local,” according to a local farmer). His pitch to the community was not moral but economic, highlighting the fact that the village could make money from the scheme. “But what was interesting was a lot of people saying: ‘We can’t treat the planet the way we have been, we have to change.’ Particularly the older members of the village, who you would think might be the most dismissive of it, were really keen.” Temple Guiting sits on a small tributary of the Thames, near pleasingly blustery low hills and under as much sun as any other spot in the south-west of England. But Llewellyn’s hopes that hydroelectric, wind or solar power would prove an easy solution to the village’s energy needs and allow them to feed a surplus to the national grid, generating income for the village, were rapidly dashed. The stream in Temple Guiting did not have enough force to make hydroelectric power feasible. The options for solar energy were also limited – not, as one might think, because of the British weather, but thanks to tree cover (“the village is built in a wood, basically”) and, inevitably, listing restrictions. But the biggest problem emerged when Llewellyn started looking into wind energy and was told he could generate all the power he liked, but because of the ageing infrastructure of their local branch of the national grid there was no practical way to upload it to the network. “That was genuinely really depressing, because it just felt like – there’s no way round this.” A solution – or a start, at least – was eventually found. Within a few months, the villagers hope, they will install their first solar panels on the roof of a farmer’s barn; he will pay them for the energy, generating a small income (“more than a jumble sale but it’s not a vast amount of money”) for the village. It is, insists Llewellyn, only the beginning. The National Grid may not be able to take their power, but huge leaps forward in battery technology mean Temple Guiting should be able to generate more energy – from a range of sources that could include small-scale domestic solar or wind generators – and store it in the village. “That’s the next phase, and that’s what I would love to do here – that we all buy electricity off each other.” Within five years, he hopes, Temple Guiting could be in a position to run its own small power company. Which might be fine in a tiny community where a local enthusiast knows everyone, but is this replicable in bigger towns and cities? “Oh it’s certainly replicable, simply because a lot of other communities have already done it,” he says. The actor cites schemes in Oxford, Brixton and even on Orkney, and the film shows Llewellyn travelling to Las Vegas, which meets all of its municipal power needs through renewable energy, leading Llewellyn to jokingly attempt to twin Temple Guiting with Sin City. “If we were genuinely the first people to try this then you could say: ‘God, it’s crazy, don’t even try.’ But there are an enormous number of examples of other communities who have done this on a much bigger scale, and it’s very successful. So yes, this is very, very doable.” After putting so much personal energy into the project, he must be looking forward to seeing the panels finally going up on the farmer’s roof? “It will be nice when it’s on there,” he says. “Though it’s been such a hard slog that rather than cheering, I might just have a long sleep.” • This article was amended on 2 June 2017 to use lower case in a reference to the national grid to differentiate the country’s electricity transmission network from National Grid, an international energy company based in the UK and US."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/may/27/observer-view-on-the-manchester-bombing","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-05-27T23:05:41Z","webTitle":"The Observer view on the Manchester bombing | Observer editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/may/27/observer-view-on-the-manchester-bombing","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/may/27/observer-view-on-the-manchester-bombing","fields":{"headline":"The Observer view on the Manchester bombing","bodyText":"Last week’s terrorist attack at the Manchester Arena has left the country reeling. The days that followed have been rightly reserved for grieving for the victims, so many of them children, for reflection and tribute and for a coming together in a city that has displayed resilience, strength and compassion in the face of tragedy. But it is also right that, as the election campaign shifts into gear again, there is proper scrutiny of the effectiveness of the government’s approach to counter-terrorism. In the wake of any terrorist incident, the most immediate questions raised are about surveillance: was the perpetrator known to the security services? If so, why were they not under the kind of surveillance that could have prevented the attack? In the weeks to come, our security services will face difficult questions as to why Salman Abedi, the Manchester bomber, was not a current focus of investigation, given that he was known to them. Was it a decision justified on the basis of intelligence? It is important to acknowledge, however, that it would be impossible for the security services to keep everyone who poses a threat under surveillance, given how resource-intensive this would be. It has emerged that the security services have more than 20,000 people associated with Islamic extremism on their radar, with 3,000 under surveillance or investigation. Many will have been born in Britain, lured by the marked increase in the volume and accessibility of extremist propaganda we have seen. Labour has been right to warn in recent months that public spending cuts have affected the robustness of counter-terrorism operations. While funding for counter-terrorism policing has increased, community policing has suffered significant cuts: there are almost 20,000 fewer police officers in England and Wales than there were in 2009. The police inspectorate has reported that cuts have left the police force in a “potentially perilous state”. Ministers have disingenuously claimed that cuts to frontline policing are irrelevant to counter-terrorism, but community police officers, who can build trusted relationships with local communities, are a vital part of any intelligence-gathering operation. Last year, an independent report into extremism in the prison system found a growing problem with radicalisation, but no adequate strategy to combat it. Cuts to the prison estate mean the number of prison officers has fallen by a third, making prison a far more dangerous place. Labour has provided robust opposition in both these areas. But boosting community policing or the prison service is not enough to counter extremism. The most controversial part of the government’s counter-terrorism strategy is its Prevent strand, which aims to stop people from being radicalised in the first place. Those believed to be at risk of being drawn into terrorism can be referred – by parents, teachers or community groups – to multi-agency panels, who can put in place a tailored package of support for that young person. There are a number of issues with the government’s approach: there is little transparency about criteria for success or the programme’s effectiveness and no effort is being made to build knowledge about what works, given the lack of evidence. It is right that schools have a statutory safeguarding duty in relation to grooming for terrorism, in the same way as they do for child sex abuse, but there has been far too little training of teachers on how to exercise it. However, much of the critique levelled at Prevent by some on the liberal left and in some Muslim communities is unfair. Those calling for it to be scrapped never say what should replace it. Those calling for it to be rebranded fail to understand its perceived toxicity stems less from its brand and more from opposition to the very concept of preventing terrorism by targeting those in the early stages of radicalisation. Those who argue that it is an Orwellian spying programme ignore the fact that participation is voluntary and requires parental consent. Those who say it unfairly targets Muslims fail to acknowledge that any programme aimed at preventing radicalisation will, by its very nature, include a disproportionate number of referrals associated with Islamic extremism, given the scale of the issue in the UK. This is not the only issue with the left’s response to terrorism. Jeremy Corbyn’s decision to put British foreign policy at the heart of his speech on countering terrorism was unsurprising, given the positions he has taken in the past. The argument he advanced, that there is a connection between British intervention in the Middle East and the terrorism of Islamic State, is undeniable. However, Corbyn’s critics are also right when they point out that Islamist fundamentalism predates western intervention in Iraq and that the unspeakable evils of Isis are felt most not in the west but by its victims in the Middle East, unassociated with western intervention. But, as many have acknowledged, there is a connection between the overthrow of Saddam Hussein and the fomenting of Isis: in the words of the foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, writing in 2005: “The Iraq war did not introduce the poison into our bloodstream but, yes, the war did help to potentiate that poison.” The hysterical over-reaction to Corbyn’s speech (“monstrous”, according to Johnson) thus looks undignified and politically opportune. The fundamental problem with Corbyn’s intervention is not what he said, but what he didn’t say. Military interventions in regions where there is religious fundamentalism will carry the risk of terrorist blowback. Does that mean that intervention is never the right course of action? The tests that Corbyn has set for military intervention in recent months – it would need to be backed by a paralysed UN and come with a worked-out plan for lasting peace – effectively rule it out in any conceivable situation. It is disingenuous to pretend that this formula constitutes either an ethical foreign policy or one that might promote global stability. Both main parties have something to answer for over national security. Theresa May for failing to admit that public spending cuts have affected counter-terrorist operations; Jeremy Corbyn in avoiding the hard questions about what follows – the harsh consequences on the ground – from a non-interventionist foreign policy.

The days when she was so gripped by anxiety that she smothered her talent near to the point of disintegration are so distant it is hard to believe it is the same person who now strides into the locker room at Roland Garros as a respected contender. This is her second slam as a top‑10 player, although it is on her least favourite surface. Nevertheless, in the absence of Serena Williams, no wildcard for Maria Sharapova and with the interim world No1, Angelique Kerber, still prone to the jitters, Konta has mainly herself and the clay underfoot to worry about. To do otherwise would be to slip into the debilitating habits that consumed her when she was struggling to make a living or add even a meagre collection of points to her ranking total. It took her six years to break into the top 100, in June 2014, but just another two months to make the top 50. Once she struck a winning rhythm, her self-belief soared. After moving inside the world’s top 30, in January last year, she blossomed. She was top 20 by mid-summer and cracked the top 10 for the first time last October. Three weeks ago, she hit a career-high No 6, although she has slipped two places since. Most of her success has come on hard courts and while clay would not be her chosen surface she does not fear it. As she said after being drawn to play Taiwan’s Hsieh Su-wei in the first round: “A big part of the challenge is the time I spend on the surface, compared to the other ones.” Elite athletes love the comfort of familiarity. They fear and abhor change. But Konta is learning to adapt. “It’s not just that I haven’t played much on the clay,” she says. “Obviously I have in the past – but it’s the level of players that I’m playing on the surface, which I haven’t had experience in. That’s a time factor. “However, as a game style, it’s more of an adaptation process. Noticing how, for example, on the hard court, the movement side of it and then the way you’re able to take the ball early. Your general movement around the ball is slightly more straightforward than it is on the clay. “I just need to keep adapting well, movement-wise around the ball. Also, being patient enough to build. The points are a bit longer here. The balls play differently off the court.” Technically dry, perhaps, but toweringly important at the highest level. Konta is not a machine, though. She talks as animatedly about gelato in Rome as the terre battue of Paris. She loves her food, music and driving her new sponsored car. But she keeps an eye on all around her on one of the most competitive circuits there has been in many years. Everyone is dangerous. Everyone is vulnerable. Nerves abound. When the world No4, Simona Halep, was asked in Rome whom she regarded as the favourite for the French Open, she replied: “About 15 players.” As it happens, Betfair have listed that number of contenders on a single‑figure percentage chance to win the title. Kerber, who ought to be the logical pick but isn’t – partly because she does not like clay, mainly because her form is as reliable as an opinion poll – said she felt “not bad”. Having endured the humiliation of a bagel recently, she added: “It’s always different in grand slams. Always. The first rounds are always tough. Everything is possible. Always.” However, this fortnight more than for a long time uncertainty stalks the locker room. Against all expectations but her own in her darkest times, Konta can be numbered among Halep’s notional 15."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/may/27/ignore-donald-trump-iran-has-something-to-celebrate","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-05-27T23:05:40Z","webTitle":"Ignore Trump, Iran has something to celebrate | Emma Graham-Harrison","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/may/27/ignore-donald-trump-iran-has-something-to-celebrate","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/may/27/ignore-donald-trump-iran-has-something-to-celebrate","fields":{"headline":"Ignore Trump, Iran has something to celebrate","bodyText":"As President Donald Trump rocked from foot to foot at the edge of a sedate, highly choreographed sword ceremony in Riyadh last week, 800 miles away, thousands of young people were streaming into the streets of Tehran for a wild, spontaneous dance of celebration. The Iranians were mostly marking reformist President Hassan Rouhani’s landslide victory in his re-election bid, a sweeping endorsement of his policy of ending international isolation while rolling out greater freedoms at home. They were also marking a win for democracy in a region where the right to a meaningful vote is in all too short supply. Iran’s supreme leader and powerful unelected bodies had left little doubt that they favoured his opponent, but Rouhani won anyway. Saudi Arabia is one of many countries in the Middle East that keeps its few periodic gestures towards democracy as closely choreographed as its welcoming ceremonies. The electorate is no more likely than the sword dancers to wrest power from its autocratic leaders. Yet the next day, when Trump took to the stage in Riyadh for a speech touted as a landmark policy address, he had nothing but menace for Iran, effectively lining up behind critics who dismiss its votes as sham propaganda shows. It was at best disingenuous, at worst an attempt to mislead, by misrepresenting Iran’s complicated and bizarre hybrid of democracy and theocracy. It is true that the president is not the ultimate ruler, a position held by supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, appointed for life and the unelected bodies that answer to him, such as the Revolutionary Guards Corps and the judiciary, wield immense power. But the president can exert a powerful influence on the economy, international relations and internal norms. Anyone who disputes the significance of the elections should consider the difference between the Iran governed by Holocaust-denying hardliner Mahmoud Ahmadinejad between 2005 and 2013 and Iran under Rouhani. “Dismissing the ballots of 41 million Iranians as irrelevant or fake – as the Trump administration and some of its supporters were quick to do – represents a dangerous miscalculation in a region that can ill afford more American delusions,” said Suzanne Maloney, analyst with the Brookings Institution. “Multibillion dollar arms sales and gilded conclaves of octogenarian autocrats will not beget the ‘better future’ that Trump’s Riyadh speech rightly challenged the region to build.” The joy on the streets of Tehran, where police stood by as young people broke rules on the mixing of genders, was mostly driven by that hope, in a country where unemployment and inflation are still rampant. Although Rouhani’s landmark nuclear deal was welcomed by Iranians tired of isolation, it has yet to unleash the hoped-for economic benefits. Unilateral US sanctions remained in place even after international bans were lifted. The economy was at the heart of the campaign and perhaps Rouhani’s weakest point; he will be under greater pressure to deliver growth. He will need foreign investment and further engagement from governments willing to ignore Trump’s message. If western nations that worked so hard with Rouhani to craft the nuclear deal want to see Iran’s reformers prosper, they should think what they will have to offer the electorate when it returns to the polls in four years’ time."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"uk-news/2017/may/28/barra-eilidh-macleod-laura-mcintyre-manchester-attack-no-one-untouched-western-isles","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2017-05-28T14:28:05Z","webTitle":"‘On Barra, in the Western Isles, no one has been untouched by Eilidh’s death’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/may/28/barra-eilidh-macleod-laura-mcintyre-manchester-attack-no-one-untouched-western-isles","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2017/may/28/barra-eilidh-macleod-laura-mcintyre-manchester-attack-no-one-untouched-western-isles","fields":{"headline":"‘On Barra, in the Western Isles, no one has been untouched by Eilidh’s death’","bodyText":"In a dark week, a small symbol of light and hope twinkles defiantly in the west. It’s to be found in Barra, in the Outer Hebrides, where a continent ends and an ocean begins. The light is from a single candle and it gently illuminates a framed picture of Eilidh MacLeod and Laura McIntyre, two young local girls who travelled south to Manchester last week to see a pop concert. Laura, 15, remains there still, her injuries from the bomb attack in the Manchester Arena keeping her in an intensive care ward. Her friend Eilidh died in the blast, and the small island community is waiting to bring both of them home. Their photograph sits in the lobby of the Isle of Barra Beach Hotel. Proprietor Guy Evans, who runs it with his wife Teresa, says: “We’ll keep the picture up and the candle burning until they are both ready to come home, though we know that in Eilidh’s case it’s to then say farewell to her. “On Barra no one has been untouched by Eilidh’s death; there is an interconnectedness here that binds everyone together and we will all gather round Eilidh’s family and Laura’s too and love and support them.” Two miles further along a largely single-track road that circumnavigates Barra is the village of Castlebay, where the girls went to school. This little 14-mile road demands and expects courtesy from its users; the process of giving way to others or acknowledging civility is endless. As you approach Castlebay you experience your first stab of emotion as you watch schoolgirls wending their way home over grass and streams after a day of lessons. And you realise only a few days ago Eilidh MacLeod and Laura McIntyre would have been with them. In Castlebay history both ancient and merely old stoops to greet you around every corner. Here’s the pub where the locals drank in the making of Whisky Galore; and across the street an ancient drystane dyke which, according to local legend, described the bounds of the first ever croft. The bay has a medieval castle in the middle of it. And there, perched on a hill overseeing all is the church of Our Lady Star of the Sea. It’s at the centre of this community, both physically and spiritually; its setting between hill and sea lending it an ethereal beauty unequalled beyond these shores. Life in the Western Isles of Scotland proceeds and is formed by the rhythms of the seasons. When death has occurred at sea or by the side of a cliff perhaps there is an acknowledgment that this is part of the natural cycle of life here; a benediction for the gifts of the land and the sea. The memories of those who have been lost like this can be carried on the winds that roar in from the Atlantic. But there can be no consolation or sentiment about young lives extinguished in Manchester by an act of pure evil, made more terrifying by its banal wickedness. Roman Catholic parish priest Father John Paul Mackinnon is talking quietly in his small visitors’ room, a kindly man with a gentle voice and a quiet wisdom that will be needed in the weeks and months ahead. Last Wednesday he and the Church of Scotland minister, the Rev Dr Lindsay Schluter, conducted a joint service. More than a third of the population of Barra and Vatersay (the even tinier island south of Barra) attended, a figure that would have been higher but for shift patterns and the other demands of industry. “Barra and Vatersay is a community steeped in its faith,” says Mackinnon. “It’s a gentle community and it asks only to be treated gently in return. These islands though are not immune from death and tragedy, how can they not be, surrounded by water and bounded by mountains? “But this is something else again,” he says, his voice conveying bewilderment and grief. “This is an encounter with evil. On Barra there is no sense of fear for our children. Parents let their children play freely here knowing that everyone feels a sense of responsibility for them. What happened to our two girls in Manchester is just inconceivable and evil has come to our doorstep. “The island though, has been touched by the messages of support from every corner of the world. People who have stayed in guest houses and hotels and been to church here remember it fondly and so little messages have been sent and emailed all through the week. We have all drawn strength from this. “We are accustomed to being outside looking in on a world on which we are at the edge of things. It can be a little disconcerting to find ourselves being looked at from outside. But this is a very resilient community and we’ll come through this. The families are being surrounded by love and in their own time we’ll welcome them home with open arms and be there for them.” Schluter is minister of the Barra and South Uist Church of Scotland parishes, which have a close bond with their Catholic neighbours. She has been on the island for barely a year but has already been affected by the reserves of resilience and fortitude which these islands possess. “They have a spiritual and emotional strength which has probably evolved over generations of dealing with hardship,” she says. “And while at times like this they draw closer and put feuds and disagreements away these people are not the sentimental and emotional figures that exist in the imaginations of Hollywood scriptwriters. Not many who live here haven’t also travelled widely and lived in other places.” She points again to the resilience of a community which in the midst of this tragedy nevertheless knows that many people will visit these islands for a holiday and a break. “The island has to continue to function and the islanders have not and will not impose their grief on them, but they have been touched by the kindness of strangers too.” When Laura returns home to continue her recovery from her injuries and when Eilidh returns for her final farewell, the grieving will start all over again. “In this place the custom is to hold a funeral within 24 or 48 hours of death so we must wait, and that is after the wait to discover Eilidh’s fate. But you learn to wait and be patient in these places because the uncertain weather dictates that you must,” she says. In time, Laura will return to her school in Castlebay where a year group may only consist of a handful of children. In this place too the absence of her friend will be felt keenly, but here too she will be helped in her own recovery. At Saturday morning mass at Our Lady Star of the Sea, a group of the faithful gathered to worship and to pray for the families of Eilidh and Laura. In the visitors book messages have been left over these last few days from Argentina, Poland, Wales, Yorkshire and California, expressing love and promising prayers. “Thoughts and prayers will be with you all in the difficult days that lie ahead. May you sense God’s presence upholding you. Holding you all in our prayers,” wrote one. Mackinnon is waiting for the day when both families will read these messages and that they may yet provide them with a little strength."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2017/may/27/steve-cooper-england-u17-coach-optimism","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-05-27T21:30:38Z","webTitle":"England coach Steve Cooper sees hope in painfully familiar defeat to Spain","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/may/27/steve-cooper-england-u17-coach-optimism","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/may/27/steve-cooper-england-u17-coach-optimism","fields":{"headline":"England coach Steve Cooper sees hope in painfully familiar defeat to Spain","bodyText":"It may seem strange to hear an England coach talking about his players changing perceptions in the wake of a penalty shootout defeat that followed a familiar script, yet Steve Cooper has good reason to think the mood is shifting when it comes to how the country’s next generation of footballers are viewed. The man in charge of the under-17 team who lost against Spain in gut-wrenching fashion eight days ago, when they conceded an injury-time equaliser before being beaten on spot-kicks in the European Championship final in Croatia, is not alone in believing England are starting to see the fruits of their labour after launching their DNA blueprint two and a half years ago. “What was really rewarding from Croatia was what some of the other coaches were saying publicly and privately around the hotel,” Cooper says. “Also, there’s a Uefa technical team observing, with quite a few English speakers in there, and some of the remarks we were getting from them – and they’re comparing us with everyone – were very positive. “Most rewarding is that they were saying things that we were intending to do, like playing with a clear identity, playing attractive football, and playing with really good organisation and structure. So that’s where ‘changing perceptions’ comes from. Because there’s no doubt – and this is recognition of the work that’s going in the clubs – that the talent is there and that we can be competitive against anyone in Europe.” Cooper is certainly not getting carried away and knows there is still a long journey ahead for England’s coaches and players. Yet the Welshman, who spent five years working at Liverpool’s academy, where his whole approach to coaching changed under the influence of José “Pep” Segura, the highly respected Catalan who has since returned to Barcelona’s youth setup, feels England are getting a lot of things right. As well as introducing a style of football that runs through all the age groups, England have been encouraging their young players to open their minds off the field by self-analysing much more and speaking up in front of their peers as part of “a big drive on leadership”. One of the other things that shines through while talking to Cooper is that England seem to be adopting a much more collaborative approach to international football, where staff and players across different levels interact in what feels almost like a club environment. “There were a few things like that in Croatia,” Cooper says. “Harry Kane sent us a video message, he was speaking from his experience of being in development teams. Jack Butland, who won the Under-17 European Championship and captained the under-21s, did a FaceTime call with the three keepers that lasted about an hour. Gareth Southgate sent a clear and powerful video message just before the semi-final – he knows the boys and they know him because he has worked with development teams for a few years and has a genuine interest in their progress. Jamie Carragher did a video from the Monday Night Football studio and we also had videos from Freddie Woodman, who is now with the under-20s, and Josh Onomah, who played in the under-17s in 2014, and got them to share their experiences.” While there are clearly some extremely talented individuals in an England Under-17 team who scored 13 times and conceded twice en route to the final – Chelsea’s Callum Hudson-Odoi and Manchester City’s Jadon Sancho and Phil Foden were among those to catch the eye – an obvious concern is whether the pathways exist at club level. A glance through the England Under-17 squad who triumphed at the European Championship finals in 2014 reveals that Lewis Cook, who is now at Bournemouth, is the only player to have made a Premier League start this season. “I don’t think there’s anyone that doesn’t want homegrown players to come through,” Cooper says. “And it is getting addressed by the clubs, but it will look different at each club.” Cooper comes across as the sort of person whose glass is always half full in relation to youth development. Released by Wrexham after a couple of years as a professional, he was offered a job working with the club’s under-11s. In between driving the minibus and marking the pitches at a club where everyone pulled together, Cooper discovered his vocation in life. “I just fell in love with coaching,” he says. Following in the footsteps of his father, Keith, who had a distinguished career as a top-flight referee, was not quite so appealing. “I thought about the stick I used to get on a Monday morning,” Cooper says, laughing. “No, I’m joking. Dad was right at the top, he did 70-odd Uefa games, every derby, and it’s nice to look back on that. When you see the stuff on Football Gold, he’s always there.” Cooper’s thirst for learning meant he raced through his coaching badges and passed the pro licence course at the age of 26, leaving Wrexham for Anfield a couple of years later. Rafael Benítez was manager at the time and within months of Cooper’s arrival the Spaniard brought in two former Barcelona staff – Rodolfo Borrell, who is now Pep Guardiola’s assistant coach at Manchester City, and Segura – to take up senior positions in Liverpool’s youth setup. “I thought I was in a decent place with my coaching before I met Pep [Segura], but then I realised that I had a load of work to do,” Cooper says. “From a coaching point of view, he has been the biggest influence on me. He just showed me the way – a different way. The biggest message that Pep gave me was that you’ve got to know what you want your team to look like at the end – close your eyes and imagine what is happening. “But it’s one thing knowing what it looks like, it’s also how you get there. That’s what I pride myself on now, having a clear view of when the team is getting it right and where I want them to go, but also the bits to get there. So how do you train the game-model, for example? Pep taught me to create a vision and build back up to it. More than anything, once you’ve got your vision, once you’ve got your steps to get there, with your periodisation of training, the type of practices that you use, the individual profiling of players, then stick to it. You need to have belief in it.” Asked to provide a bit of detail, Cooper says: “It was about criteria in all areas of the pitch. It wasn’t just a case where he’d say: ‘We’re going to play out from the back and the back four are going to split, we’ll get out there, there and there, and when we get up the pitch just play what you see.’ There’s always an element of that because players need to make decisions. However, if we’re going to have criteria when we play out from the back, then we’ll have criteria in midfield as well and at the top of the pitch.” Fascinated by tactics and formations, the 37-year-old gives the impression that he could talk for hours on the subject and that he likes nothing more than being on the training field. He is excited about the future and is already looking forward to the Under-17 World Cup in India in October as well as being part of the European Championship finals next summer, which England are hosting. As for the bigger picture, Cooper sees real progress. “There’s always going to be a cynical or judgmental view until the senior team wins something – Gareth, I’m sure, would be the first to say that,” he says. “But all we can do is put together a plan that will serve the players and the teams well and stick to it. We’ve done that and although nobody wanted to lose that final against Spain, if losing helps us win in the long term, then we’ve got to live with that.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"books/2017/may/28/jeremy-paxman-at-hay-festival-media-must-stop-sneering-at-trump","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2017-05-28T12:21:54Z","webTitle":"Jeremy Paxman at Hay festival: 'Media must stop sneering at Trump'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/may/28/jeremy-paxman-at-hay-festival-media-must-stop-sneering-at-trump","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2017/may/28/jeremy-paxman-at-hay-festival-media-must-stop-sneering-at-trump","fields":{"headline":"Jeremy Paxman at Hay festival: 'Media must stop sneering at Trump'","bodyText":"Jeremy Paxman has said the media must stop “sneering” at Donald Trump’s presidency, suggesting the Republican had done “rather better than many people had expected” in his first months in office. Speaking at the Hay literary festival in Wales on Saturday, the broadcaster said he would like to interview Trump and encouraged the media to respect his position in the White House. “I don’t like these media class sneerings about Trump,” Paxman said. “I don’t share his politics on many things, but he was elected on that cockamamie system that they’ve got. He was elected president. And we should respect that.” Responding to a question from the audience about whether his views on Trump had changed since presenting the Panorama special 100 Days of Trump, Paxman said: “In some respects, he has done rather better than many people had expected.” Paxman was on stage with the comedian Marcus Brigstocke, who laughed at that comment. Paxman retorted: “Well, it won’t satisfy you sneery media types.” Paxman said he strongly believed people have to vote “to be able to express an opinion” about politics. “The extraordinary thing is the number of people who talk about this being an abomination who didn’t bother to vote,” he said, referring to Trump’s election in November. “Of course, Hilary Clinton was a terrible candidate, but the fact of not voting disqualifies you, or it seems to me ought to disenfranchise you from passing any comment at all.” Paxman, who once upbraided Russell Brand for not voting because he “can’t be arsed”, said he would make sure to cast his ballot in the general election on 8 June – despite living “in an era of pretty stunted politicians”. “There have been elections I haven’t voted in,” Paxman told the Hay audience. “The last time I didn’t vote, I was quite comfortable with my decision until about 7 ’o clock at night when I was at work and it was too late to do anything about it. And I felt more and more uncomfortable. “We’re not given a great choice. But in the end, making decisions is very difficult. To be forced to make a decision every few years in order to put someone there who will make your decisions for you seems not to be a bad thing to do.” Often referred to as a “rottweiler” for his combative interview technique and history of grilling public figures on television, Paxman’s abrasive character was on full display at Hay. He laid into journalists, whom he called “a ridiculous, vain-glorious bunch of clowns”, and said he “very much” dislikes the mannerisms of British politicians. “I think there is a deformación profesional that affects a lot of them that makes it difficult for them to have an unencumbered relationship with the truth,” he said. “However, let’s face it, it is an important job.” Paxman also told the audience that he would like to interview Pope Francis. “The pope would be great,” he said. “I’d like to challenge him on the question of contraception, abortion. I’d like to talk about papal authority, population control, migration. I think that it would be fascinating. I think he’d be more interesting than most and I think you’d probably get pretty straight answers, as far as he saw them.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"sport/live/2017/may/27/england-v-south-africa-second-odi-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-05-27T17:53:49Z","webTitle":"England v South Africa: second ODI – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2017/may/27/england-v-south-africa-second-odi-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/live/2017/may/27/england-v-south-africa-second-odi-live","fields":{"headline":"England v South Africa: second ODI – as it happened","bodyText":"Here’s Vic Marks’s report from Southampton: That was a spectacular heist from England. South Africa were in control almost throughout the run-chase. They needed 10 from 10 balls yet they could only get seven singles. Eoin Morgan controlled the game with persuasive certainty, and Ball and especially Wood produced some hugely effective bowling. The upshot is that England have won the series with a match to spare, against the world’s No1 side. Tremendous stuff, and the manner of this victory bodes well for the Champions Trophy. Thanks for your company, night! Wood has another chat with Morgan, skips in to Morris, who can only slice a single! What a brilliant win for England in a wonderful game! 49.5 overs: South Africa 327-5 (need 4 from 1 ball) A dot ball! Morris tries to pull Wood and is beaten for pace. England appeal for caught behind; that’s turned down but they will take the dot ball. South Africa need four off the last ball. They’ve scored only six from the last nine deliveries. Brilliant stuff from England. 49.4 overs: South Africa 327-5 (need 4 from 2 balls) Win or lose, this is great captaincy from Morgan. He looks so calm and in control, even though his team clearly aren’t. Wood bowls to Miller, who pulls fiercely but only for a single. Four from two needed! 49.3 overs: South Africa 326-5 (need 5 from 3 balls) Morgan is taking his time between deliveries and looks very calm as he moves his field and chats to Wood. Miller is beaten, backing away to a short one. Dot ball. 49.2 overs: South Africa 326-5 (need 5 from 4 balls) This would be a handy time for Wood to ram a yorker through Morris. Instead he bowls short and is pulled again for one. 49.1 overs: South Africa 325-5 (need 6 from 5 balls) Mark Wood will bowl the last over. Miller pulls the first ball for one. 49th over: South Africa 324-5 (target: 331; Miller 69, Morris 34) South Africa are romping to victory now. Miller smokes a length ball from Ball back over his head for six - DON’T BOWL EFFING LENGTH - and hammers a cut for four. Ten from the first two balls of the over leave South Africa needing another ten from the last ten deliveries. They take singles from the first three of those, including a futile, tactical review from England for LBW against Miller. That means they need seven from the last over to win. 48th over: South Africa 311-5 (target: 331; Miller 58, Morris 33) Morris is completely beaten for pace and top-edges his pull for four. Wood produces another terrific over, mixing short balls and a wide yorker - but then he bowls a length ball to end the over, and Morris inevitably mauls it over mid-on for six. He is vicious when it comes to punishing good length, and that blow has made South Africa favourites again. 47th over: South Africa 298-5 (target: 331; Miller 57, Morris 23) Jake Ball is on, which suggests we won’t see Stokes again. He’s bowled just three overs in the innings, though he is struggling with his knee. Ball’s excellent over goes for nine, including a no-nonsense clump back over the bowler’s head for four by Morris. South Africa need 33 from three overs. 46th over: South Africa 289-5 (target: 331; Miller 55, Morris 16) Morris belts Plunkett between mid-off and extra cover for four, an emphatic shot from a poor delivery. He muscles the next ball high over the head of midwicket, where it teases two fielders before landing between them - and then he monsters Plunkett over midwicket for a huge six. Bloody hell, he nailed that. A bad last over for Plunkett - 14 from it - though he has had an excellent day. 45th over: South Africa 275-5 (target: 331; Miller 54, Morris 3) Mark Wood returns, and will probably bowl out from this end. It’s a superb over, full of pace and variety, and South Africa can take only four singles. 44th over: South Africa 271-5 (target: 331; Miller 52, Morris 1) The new batsman is Chris Morris, who gives it considerable humpty. Consecutive wides from Plunkett leave South Africa needing 60 from the last six overs. I’m not sure whether this is good news for England or not. Behardien mishits Plunkett to mid-off, where Moeen takes a jaunty leaping catch. That was a real struggle for Behardien, 17 from 25 balls with no boundaries. 43rd over: South Africa 262-4 (target: 331; Miller 49, Behardien 14) Moeen has switched ends. Morgan really does trust his spinners at key moments; he could easily bowl out with Wood, Plunkett, Stokes and Ball here. It’s a very good over, too, with no boundaries and just six from it. 42nd over: South Africa 256-4 (target: 331; Miller 45, Behardien 12) Ball replaces Moeen, not in a nasty way. Miller drags a pull round the corner for four, another clever shot in what is becoming a gem of an innings. South Africa need 75 fae 48 balls. 41st over: South Africa 246-4 (target: 331; Miller 39, Behardien 9) Root continues. He is racing through his overs, the old Combined Universities trick from 1989, and it’s working well against Behardien in particular. He has nine from 17; it could be a match-losing innings. Or Miller could play a match-winning one: he reaches a long way to sweep Root hard for four and move to 39 from 27. 40th over: South Africa 238-4 (target: 331; Miller 32, Behardien 8) Miller charges Moeen, gets an inside edge and is happy to see it deflect past both the stumps and Jos Buttler. South Africa have no choice to take such risks now - they need 93 from the last 10 overs. 39th over: South Africa 231-4 (target: 331; Miller 27, Behardien 5) Miller sweeps Root hard for four, an excellent shot. Behardien is nowhere near as fluent, at least not yet, and England are doing everything they can to keep him on stroke. He has five from 11 balls, Miller 28 from 21. 38th over: South Africa 224-4 (target: 331; Miller 23, Behardien 3) Miller is an excellent finisher and the key man for South Africa now, perhaps along with Chris Morris. He shows his class with a stunning six over extra cover off Moeen. What a shot that was! Ten from the over, a good one for South Africa. 37th over: South Africa 214-4 (Miller 15, Behardien 1) Joe Root comes on for a bowl. Behardien gets off the mark with a dicey single, one of only three from the over. England will take that all day. 36th over: South Africa 211-4 (Miller 13, Behardien 0) That was the last ball over the over. South Africa need 120 from 14 overs. Quinton de Kock falls two short of a hundred! He pushed almost quizzically at a slower delivery from Moeen that turned to take a thin edge before it was smartly caught by Buttler. That’s another extremely timely wicket for England. de Kock played beautifully and deserved a hundred. 35th over: South Africa 204-3 (de Kock 97, Miller 6) Miller edges Plunkett fractionally short of Root at slip. Another good over from Plunkett, whose spell has given England a puncher’s chance of winning the match. South Africa need 127 from 90 balls. 34th over: South Africa 199-3 (de Kock 96, Miller 3) Moeen returns in place of Jake Ball. De Kock, who was relatively quiet while de Villiers was at the crease, takes charge again with a lofted straight drive for four. 33rd over: South Africa 191-3 (de Kock 89, Miller 1) Plunkett is having a fine year in ODI cricket, with 19 wickets at an average of 19. Rory Bremner would surely approve. Brilliant bowling from Liam Plunkett! He rammed in a short ball that followed de Villiers as he tried to limbo dance out of the way, and it kissed the glove on its way through to the keeper Buttler. A huge wicket, splendidly earned by the increasingly impressive Plunkett. 32nd over: South Africa 187-2 (de Kock 88, de Villiers 52) A shortish delivery from Ball is flashed majestically over midwicket for four by de Villiers. That’s awesome batting. A single takes him to a marvellously accomplished 48-ball fifty. 31st over: South Africa 178-2 (de Kock 86, de Villiers 45) Plunkett on, Wood off. England have not bowled badly today, but this innings has shown the limitations of their attack. They have variety, which hasn’t always been the case with England, but they aren’t top-quality. They may still win this match, mind you; South Africa’s required rate is above eight an over now. 30th over: South Africa 174-2 (de Kock 85, de Villiers 42) De Kock misses an almighty yahoo across the line at Ball and is then hit on the glove by a good delivery that follows him. Only two from the over, Ball’s best of the innings. South Africa need 157 from the last 20 overs. 29th over: South Africa 172-2 (de Kock 84, de Villiers 41) South Africa are taking very few risks against Wood. They know that if they survive this spell without losing a wicket, they should win the match. Wood’s economy is excellent (7-0-29-0), but that alone won’t win this game. 28th over: South Africa 167-2 (de Kock 83, de Villiers 38) Ball replaces Rashid (6-0-41-0) and is flashed through backward point for four by the formidable de Villiers. He has 38 from 35 balls, de Kock 83 from 84. England are in trouble here. South Africa need 164 from 22 overs. 27th over: South Africa 160-2 (de Kock 81, de Villiers 33) With the game threatening to slip away, Eoin Morgan turns to Mark Wood. A wicket here would be so timely. He hurries one through de Villiers, who inside-edges an attempted clip for four. That could easily have been out. Another good over from Wood, who has been excellent today. 26th over: South Africa 155-2 (de Kock 81, de Villiers 29) 25th over: South Africa 147-2 (de Kock 75, de Villiers 27) De Kock swaggers down the track to clip Moeen wide of mid-on for four, a beautiful stroke. He is a serious player, this lad, as England know from the last series between the sides. AB de Villiers then skips back in his crease to flog Moeen over mid-off for four. That unusual and brilliant stroke brings up an extremely good fifty partnership. England need a wicket. 24th over: South Africa 136-2 (de Kock 70, de Villiers 21) De Villiers cracks Rashid just short of Morgan at extra cover before chipping delightfully over the same fielder for four. He is playing with ominous purpose. 23rd over: South Africa 131-2 (de Kock 70, de Villiers 16) De Kock runs down the track at Moeen, flicking him wide of short fine leg for two. This part have been really busy, with very few dot balls in their burgeoning partnership. 22nd over: South Africa 125-2 (de Kock 67, de Villiers 13) Nobody other than Virat Kohli and Sachin Tendulkar have scored more ODI hundreds before their 25th birthday than de Kock, who turns 25 in December. He has 12 and looks good for a 13th here. South Africa are going very well, though a lot depends on this pair and the next man David Miller - after that their batting is dangerous but not especially substantial. 21st over: South Africa 119-2 (de Kock 63, de Villiers 12) Moeen, who has had a tremendous series so far, replaces Plunkett. Five runs from a forgettable over. 20th over: South Africa 114-2 (de Kock 61, de Villiers 9) De Villiers makes room to steer Rashid for four. South Africa have played him well so far, taking him for seven an over without recourse to the long handle. I would actually make Rashid England’s Test spinner ahead of Moeen. That’s not going to happen, however, and with no subcontinent trips coming up he knows this format is his best chance of glory with England. 19th over: South Africa 107-2 (de Kock 59, de Villiers 4) De Kock pushes Plunkett down the ground for four; then he’s beaten by a good off-cutter. South Africa really need a partnership from these two. “Could we please have a shout-out for my step-grandad Norman who’s at the game today?” says Louis Osman. “He’s 92 and his last live international match was Bradman’s last Test in 1948!” Oh that’s tremendous. It’s almost as long as Martin Bicknell had to wait for an England recall. 18th over: South Africa 100-2 (de Kock 53, de Villiers 3) A quiet over from Rashid, with South Africa content to milk him for five singles. They need 231 from 32 overs. 17th over: South Africa 95-2 (de Kock 50, de Villiers 1) The new batsman is AB de Villiers. While we’re on the subject of good writing (the earlier Cricket Monthly tweet, not the previous, admittedly exhilarating sentence), this is a terrific piece from Pranay Sanklecha - and an extremely worth cause, too. Meanwhile, de Kock brings up an excellent, run-a-ball fifty. This is a really good wicket for England. du Plessis tries to steer Plunkett to third man and gets the thinnest edge through to Buttler. 16th over: South Africa 93-1 (de Kock 49, du Plessis 16) Rashid comes into the attack, a big moment in any match. His performance often influences the result: when England win an ODI he averages 26, when they lose he averages 52. His third ball is too short and cuffed over midwicket for four by du Plessis. 15th over: South Africa 84-1 (de Kock 47, du Plessis 9) A misfield from Hales at deep backward square leg gives de Kock a boundary off Plunkett. The required rate is above seven now; or rather it was, until de Kock timed another boundary through midwicket. He is some player. It’s not only Frank TJ Mackie’s disciples who respect de Kock. Sorry. “That England kit is truly ugly,” writes Jess Cartn- Dave Adams. “If you’re designing a new kit, how do you get to dark blue with a few pink bits and think to yourself, ‘Yep. Nailed it’? Worst England ODI kit ever. Still, at least the players wearing it are half decent.” Talking of England’s ODI kits, I’d love to have a transcript of the Gaffer’s internal monologue during this publicity stunt. Christ, who knew 1999 would look so quaint. 14th over: South Africa 76-1 (de Kock 39, du Plessis 9) De Kock crunches Stokes through midwicket for four, a very classy stroke that was edibly placed. Stokes continues to limp through his overs. “Delicious placement,” says Gary Naylor. Meanwhile, this is a lovely read, including a cracking piece from our old friend Lord Selvey. 13th over: South Africa 69-1 (de Kock 34, du Plessis 9) Plunkett surprises du Plessis with a good bouncer that beats his hook stroke. Du Plessis surprises nobody by timing Plunkett through mid-on, a lovely stroke that brings the first boundary in five overs. “Not wishing to kick a man when he is down (as I prefer to do that when he is not looking),” says Ian Copestake, “but Ball seems to have confirmed the suspicions of those who wonder why he is in contention.” I was a bit surprised he was chosen ahead of Finn, though I do think he’s an excellent bowler. He’ll be so chuffed about that. 12th over: South Africa 62-1 (de Kock 33, du Plessis 3) Stokes pins du Plessis in a place where no man should ever be pinned, box or no box. As ever he is making things happen, even though he is clearly not fully fit. England have put the brakes on here, with 12 runs and a wicket from the last four overs. It can’t be long before hipster cricket becomes a thing. People swanning around east London in original West Indies coral WSC kits, wearing WG beards and using a Stuart Surridge to play an impromptu air guitar set in the corner of their local, The Strokeless Tavare. 11th over; South Africa 60-1 (de Kock 32, du Plessis 2) Liam Plunkett replaces Mark Wood, who bowled a terrific spell of 5-0-19-0. A quiet over, four singles from it. “How can the placement of a ball on the cricket field be ‘literally delicious’?” says David Beckett. “Asking for a friend.” You’ve never had a placement jus before? I feel sorry for you. 10th over; South Africa 56-1 (de Kock 30, du Plessis 0) Stokes is still struggling with that knee, and the physio came on after the wicket. It does seem like a weird, unnecessary risk that England are taking so close to the Champions Trophy. “Are Jake Ball’s figures the result of some poor bowling or is that he is up against two quality batsmen and is getting a bit of tap?” asks Lee Smith. “Does he need some of Mark Wood’s wild horses?” Yeah he hasn’t bowled particularly badly – that kind of tap is inescapable these days. Ben Stokes, who was dropped first and second ball when he batted, now drops de Kock off his first ball. De Kock hammered a tennis shot back towards Stokes, who stuck out his right hand in his follow through but could not hold on to a very difficult chance. did well to get a hand on it, in truth. No matter, because Stokes strikes later in the over! Amla chases a wide one and blasts it low towards extra cover, where Morgan takes an excellent low catch. 9th over: South Africa 53-0 (de Kock 28, Amla 23) Wood zips another one through de Kock’s vigorous pull stroke. This has been an excellent spell from Wood, and the next ball rams into de Kock’s stomach as he again goes for the pull. Terrific over, that. 8th over: South Africa 50-0 (de Kock 27, Amla 22) Amla plays a beautiful stroke, working Ball through midwicket for four. The placement was literally delicious. He survives a run-out referral next ball, with Hales hitting direct from mid-off. Amla judged the run well and was home. A smooth pull for four by de Kock and a suicidal single - Amla would have been miles out had Morgan hit from cover instead of throwing miles wide of the stumps - makes it ten from the over. Ball’s figures are not the kind to boast about: 4-0-32-0. 7th over: South Africa 40-0 (de Kock 22, Amla 17) Wood is bowling nicely here. De Kock shows respect for Wood’s pace by aborting a hook stroke. Wood is the wildcard of this attack - both wild and a bit of a card, as students of imaginary horses will know. Five from the over. Both teams will be happy enough with their start, though England would not look a wicket maiden in the mouth. 6th over: South Africa 35-0 (de Kock 20, Amla 14) De Kock accepts a bit of width from Ball, muscling a cut stroke for four more. Ball replies with a good bouncer that hurries on to take the top edge of de Kock’s attempted pull stroke before flying over the keeper for another boundary. Both these openers know how to get big hundreds, and will be aiming to bat through for 170-odd not out. They really are a brilliant opening pair; indeed they are about to become the most productive opening partnership in South Africa’s history. 5th over: South Africa 24-0 (de Kock 12, Amla 12) A beautiful bouncer from Wood follows Amla and smashes into the grille as he tries to jerk his head out of the way like Robin Smith. He will need treatment, though he seems fine. Such aggressive bowling is good to see, and later in the over he beats de Kock outside off stump. As ODI scores get higher, so wickets become ever more important. Nip it in the bud, like Tony Soprano did with Feech. I suspect that, in the next few years, we will see more close catchers at key points in the innings. 4th over: South Africa 22-0 (de Kock 11, Amla 11) Amla keeps up the boundary-an-over pattern, drilling Ball down the ground in the languid style. “Who’s winning?” asks Gary Naylor. “Given their selection, I suspect the South Africans would have settled for chasing 331 - and I suspect England are pleased with their effort too. I have AB’s boys slight favourites at the moment - especially if the sun stays out.” Yep, I’d agree. This, I have concluded, is the best thing about cricket, especially Test cricket: half the time you don’t even know who’s winning. It’s interpretive sport. 3rd over: South Africa 16-0 (de Kock 10, Amla 6) Wood is bowling very straight to Amla, having dismissed him LBW on Wednesday. Amla takes a risky single to cover, with Morgan’s throw just missing the stumps. I think Amla would have been home anyway. The next ball is full, wide and driven sweetly to the cover boundary by de Kock. A good start for South Africa, with a boundary in each over. 2nd over: South Africa 11-0 (de Kock 6, Amla 5) Jake Ball, in for the injured Woakes, will share the new ball. It’s a glorious afternoon in Hampshire, perfect for batting. Ball is cut for four by de Kock - in the air but safe - and responds with a cracking lifter that beats de Kock’s flash outside off stump. Six from the over. 1st over: South Africa 5-0 (de Kock 1, Amla 4) South Africa have probably the best top four in world cricket - de Kock, Amla, du Plessis and de Villiers. The sooner England have them three down, the better. Amla tickles his first ball, from Wood, to fine leg for four. He has, in his usual quiet way, been one of the greatest ODI openers of all time. It took Ben Stokes a long time to work out how to bat in ODI cricket, but he’s sure done so now. When he returned to the side after injury last summer, he averaged 21 after five years in and out of the side. Since then he has an average of 57 and a strike rate of 109. Any player in history would be happy with those numbers. Hello folks. England scored 330 in a one-day international today. Nobody will be holding page 47, never mind the front page; it’s just a normal day at the office for this formidable batting side. South Africa’s strength is also their batting, and they will have legitimate hopes of chasing 331 this afternoon. If they don’t, England will have won the series with a match to spare. A big score for an unbeaten Buttler, a century for an apparently injury-free Stokes: short of some more runs for Roy, England couldn’t have asked for much more. South Africa on the other hand could: their fielding was often slapdash, their catching clumsy, and they end up chasing a target just nine short of the one they missed by a distance at Headingley. Rob Smyth will be with you shortly for the tourists’ response. Now this is impressive: The first ball is straight into the Moeen’s hitting zone, and he barely has to move his feet before heaving it over extra cover. The next is swished over midwicket, bouncing once before reaching the rope. A slower ball though befuddles the batsman, who only gets a single. This brings Buttler onto strike, and he gets a massive top-edge to his attempted pull, De Kock sprinting back but not reaching it before it landed. So Buttler ends the innings on 65* and Moeen will face the final delivery, which he heaves it wildly into the sky, whence it drops into De Kock’s gloves for a last-ball WICKET! Ali c De Kock b Phehlukwayo 33 49th over: England 318-5 (Buttler 62, Moeen 24) Rabada’s final over brings perhaps the most eyecatching display of poor fielding from South Africa today, one of many. Moeen top-edges the ball towards Amla at fine leg, and he watches it, takes a few steps back, brings up his hands, and then falls over for no apparent reason, the ball bouncing off a hand, into the ground and over t he rope. Rabada has been the best bowler by a distance here, going for 50 runs despite misfields and somesuch. Moeen is on strike for the final over, which will be bowled by Phehlukwayo. 48th over: England 306-5 (Buttler 59, Moeen 16) Morris’s final over sees Buttler reach his half-century with a ramp, Rabada doing very well to stop it reaching the rope. Various cricket writers get quite excited by this development. Then England reach their collective triple-century, Buttler fetching a ball that was bouncing past his right shoulder and convincing it to go through midwicket instead, which really he had no right to do. There are decent patches of blue poking through the grey clouds now, and many spectators have donned sunglasses: it looks like the umpires will be leaving their supplementary second coats in the dressing rooms after lunch. 47th over: England 292-5 (Buttler 49, Moeen 13) So Buttler hit one boundary off his first 38 deliveries, and then four from his next five. Phehlukwayo and Pretorius - who only bowled two deliveries at Buttler today - look like South Africa’s middle-overs weak links. Rabada, though, is doing the hard work for them: that’s a fine over, and England add but three to their total. 46th over: England 289-5 (Buttler 48, Moeen 12) Phehlukwayo’s first ball is wide, a bit short, and thwumped over a leaping, grasping but distant fielder at point by Moeen. His third is short, straight and slow, and Buttler nails it through midwicket, and the next is wumped off his ankles. All reach the rope, and the best is still to come: Buttler’s reverse-swipe-cum-switch-hit scoop off the fifth, also for four. A wide later, Buttler hooks the final ball for another four, making that a 22-run over. Ouch. 45th over: England 267-5 (Buttler 32, Moeen 8) An over of nearlies and not-quites, but five from it. “Simon, You have to go carefully when discussing pies, because, like bread products, taste is so local,” notes John Starbuck. “I recall being very surprised at the quality of pies in Merseyside and South Lancashire (including white puddings), which i thought greatly inferior to those of the East Midlands. I got another shock on moving to Yorkshire and discovered the pork pies made locally, and sold by Morrisons, were labelled Vale of Mowbray. Talk about attempting to pass off! There actually is a place called Mowbray near Bradford, but the pies are rubbish compared to Pork Farms pies and the genuinely Melton Mowbray stuff. This is because the local water used to build the pastry differs so much across the country. The same applies to beer and cheese.” That is veering dangerously close to genuine pastry-connoisseurship. 44th over: England 261-5 (Buttler 30, Moeen 4) A fine diving stop from Morris turns a Buttler boundary into a two, and then a reverse sweep gets another fielder flinging himself about. Midway through the over Moeen gets his first taste of action, and he slaps his first ball through the covers for four. “We are getting dangerously near one of the most divisive of topics; whether those awful stews with a pastry top you get in pubs are counted as pies,” writes Dave Brown. “According to psychopaths they are.” Another heave from Stokes, but this time he gets nowhere near enough on it, and Miller at long off takes a straightforward catch, some way from the rope. 43rd over: England 251-4 (Stokes 101, Buttler 24) Morris returns, and Stokes welcomes him in brutal style, boshing the first delivery back over his head for six. A dot later he sends the ball to midwicket for a couple, thus completing his century, off 77 deliveries. He’s ridden his luck, edged a few, been dropped a couple of times (and that was just from the first couple of balls he faced), but it’s not so bad for a man with one leg. 42nd over: England 241-4 (Stokes 92, Buttler 23) Stokes is turning up the power now, absolutely smashing the ball over the covers for four. And that’s Pretorius’s 10th over completed, with no maidens, one wicket (and a run out) and 61 runs, which isn’t as bad as it threatened to be from a South African perspective. 41st over: England 231-4 (Stokes 85, Buttler 20) Buttler, after scooping the first ball of the over away for four, hits the second straight to De Villiers at cover, who dives, rises and flings at the bowler’s end, hitting the running Buttler in the calf. While he hops about in agony Phehlukwayo bowls again, Stokes slams through midwicket and the fielder at the rope lets it slip through his hands. “I’m not convinced that is a pizza pie; that looks like a quiche to me,” insists Tom Van der Gucht. “Surely a pie, technically speaking, needs a pastry roof? Otherwise it’s slipping into vol-au-vent territory? Not that I have any problems with quiches or val-au-vents - nor sausage rolls and pasties for that matter, as my my waistline silhouette would suggest.” A pie cannot be confused with a vol-au-vent unless it’s been miniaturised, surely? 40th over: England 219-4 (Stokes 79, Buttler 14) Pretorius returns, and Stokes leans back and improvises a reverse-thingamy. The ball loops into the air, but just over backward point and away for four. The next he chips towards mid off, again in the air, and he gets away with that one too. Into the final 10 overs, then. 39th over: England 210-4 (Stokes 71, Buttler 13) Phehlukwayo bowls and the batsmen take turns mistiming significant swings, and in the end score a couple of singles. Stokes decides it’s his bat’s fault, and calls for a bat doctor to bring out some tape. 38th over: England 208-4 (Stokes 70, Buttler 12) Maharaj bowls and England reach 200 with a couple of singles. They keep on going, scoring a three more singles and then a four off the last, bludgeoned down the ground by Stokes. 37th over: England 199-4 (Stokes 64, Buttler 9) Just the two singles from the over. If Root was unlucky to get out, Buttler’s just made the fluke score 1-1. It takes an absolute age to get ball tracker going, conjuring images of someone in the basement yanking on a pull cord and the motor refusing to start. Eventually it gets going, and we find out that the ball would have hit leg stump pretty emphatically, but not quite emphatically enough to overturn the on-field decision! South Africa think so, but the umpire did not. Up we go to the TV umpire... 36th over: England 197-4 (Stokes 63, Buttler 8) After a Buttler single, Stokes hits successive indentikit boundaries to cow corner, down on one knee and giving it the big heave. Then South Africa switch their fielders around and he has to stop. 35th over: England 185-4 (Stokes 53, Buttler 6) Three singles, a two and a wide, and a lot more grouching about the ball, during Rabada’s latest over. Meanwhile, I’ve now looked at a lot of Instagram pictures of pizzas and this is the only one that also looked like a pie: 34th over: England 179-4 (Stokes 52, Buttler 2) Since he scored three successive half-centuries last year, Buttler’s ODI efforts have brought 25, 31, 10, 11, 14, 0, 7 and 7. If there’s one man England will want to have fun in these last two Champions Trophy warm-ups, it is surely him. Before the over there’s a lengthy delay while the umpires examine the ball and have a chat with AB de Villiers, who doesn’t seem to be liking what he’s hearing, but they eventually play on with the same nugget. “Further to Tom’s pie confusion, I’ve always wondered why in Somewhere over the Rainbow, listeners are encouraged to ‘weigh a pie’,” muses Andrew Benton. “No details of the type of pie, nor the purpose of this process are given in the lyrics, though it must be related somehow to the blue skies that apparently exist beyond the rainbow. Perhaps pies are easier to weigh on sunny days?” 33rd over: England 175-4 (Stokes 50, Buttler 0) After a lengthy drinks break play resumes, Rabada bowls, Stokes edges and the ball flies over Amla at slip and away for four. The next is emphatically middled, boshed back down the ground for four more. A single then takes him to his half-century, and Morgan onto strike. England lose their captain, who top-edges the ball low into the keeper’s gloves! 32nd over: England 166-3 (Morgan 45, Stokes 41) Maharaj is back, and runs trickle in ones and twos. “I bet you can get a pizza pie in Wigan,” says Phil Sawyer. “Any town that invents the pie barm knows a thing or two about pastry products.” That raises the irresistible possibility of a pizza pie sandwich (OBOer drools onto keyboard). 31st over: England 160-3 (Morgan 40, Stokes 40) Rabada’s back. South Africa would have seen the morning rain, the lingering thick cloud and the breeze and been dreaming of wild swing, but they have hardly made the ball deviate at all. Rabada at least gives batsmen some fairly extreme pace to think about. Point of information from Iain Noble: “Americans, especially New Yorkers, commonly refer to a whole pizza, thick, thin or otherwise, as a ‘pie’ to distinguish it from a ‘slice’.” 30th over: England 154-3 (Morgan 38, Stokes 37) There have been a lot of not-quite-off-the-middle ball-on-bat noises today, but the way Stokes hits Morris’s first delivery absolutely makes it absolutely sing. Sadly it sings its way straight to a fielder, and he gets but a single. The next ball he faces however gets the full treatment, Stokes swinging straight through it and sending it screaming high into the stands. 29th over: England 145-3 (Morgan 37, Stokes 30) Another Morgan four, this one worked fine off his hip. 28th over: England 137-3 (Morgan 31, Stokes 29) Morris tries a slower ball, but Morgan spots it, waits and sends it away for four. “I’ve never been too sure of the lyrics of That’s Amore,” writes Tom. “Is it ‘big pizza pie’ or ‘big piece of pie’? I’ve bever had a pizza pie, although it sounds like the sort of thing Shane Warne used to enjoy in the days before Liz Hurley got him counting the calories.” I don’t think a pizza pie refers to an actual pizza in a pastry crust, but to an American-style thick and doughy-style creation. However, I think a pastry pizza pie would go down pretty well it certain parts of the country. After all, you can get occasionally find them battered and fried, which must rank roughly similarly on both nutritional and absolute-gastronomic-crime scales. 27th over: England 132-3 (Morgan 26, Stokes 29) There’s a short delay before Phehlukwayo bowls, because one of the umpires is a bit chilly and wants another coat. The batsmen are gradually warming up too: Stokes heaves the ball over midwicket and it lands a couple of feet over the rope for six! 26th over: England 124-3 (Morgan 25, Stokes 22) Chris Morris is back, and Morgan licks his lips and swings his bat at a wide one which he misses by some distance. Perhaps frustration at missing out there contributed to the batsmen taking a much-too-sharp single off the next delivery, from which Morgan would have been run out by a distance had Miller hit the stumps from not too far away. 25th over: England 120-3 (Morgan 23, Stokes 21) The gloves are off! I mean, De Kock’s glove is literally off, because he’s just been hit in the hand by a Morgan edge and it’s a bit sore. It counts as another drop, but there was no way he was catching that, given how close he is to the batsman and how fast the ball was travelling. “Don’t know about the title,” writes Damian Clarke, “but a line in That’s Amore goes ‘Hearts will play tippy-tippy-tay, tippy-tippy-tay/Like a gay tarantella’. Which on initial reading got me thinking about the sexuality of big hairy spiders.” 24th over: England 117-3 (Morgan 22, Stokes 19) An over bookended by boundaries from Stokes. The first is pretty smart, sent high and straight, the second is a pretty severe mishit. Still, they all count. 23rd over: England 109-3 (Morgan 22, Stokes 11) Phehlukwayo’s first delivery is send thundering wide of mid-off by Morgan for four, but after that it’s just a couple of singles. England are still pootering rather than full-throttle motoring, but are not far off where they were at this stage in the first ODI (13 runs short, to be precise). 22nd over: England 103-3 (Morgan 17, Stokes 10) Pretorius bowls his seventh over, and Morgan has a go at taking out another team-mate, hitting another straight drive that would probably have hit the stumps had the bowler just poked it rather than trying to stop it. It looked like Stokes had learned from Root’s misfortune, though, as he was still very much in home base. De Kock is standing up to the stumps both to Pretorius and Phehlukwayo. 21st over: England 101-3 (Morgan 16, Stokes 9) Andile Phehlukwayo bowls his first over, and it brings five dots and a leg bye. 20th over: England 100-3 (Morgan 16, Stokes 9) England reach triple figures in slightly uncertain style, Stokes having a heave at a ball that misses his bat and hits his front pad and his back pad on its way through. Pretorius appeals loudly, but the umpire has heard two sounds and assumes there was therefore some bat involved. England’s resulting run is therefore not a leg bye, but the bat wasn’t involved in any way. Still, ball tracking shows it would have missed the stumps anyway, so no harm. 19th over: England 98-3 (Morgan 15, Stokes 8) “It seems Pretorius can take wickets after all,” deduces John Starbuck. “Doesn’t matter how, so long as they go. Incidentally, the Dean Martin song That’s amore has lots of applications: pointing out a firth on the Scottish east coast; sighting a mighty specimen of an eel at the fishmonger; commenting on Bobby Zamora’s efforts at goal-scoring etc. OBO readers can probably think of more.” So you know what John wants from you, and that’s some more, eh? 18th over: England 93-3 (Morgan 11, Stokes 7) A relatively drama-free over from Pretorius, with a hint of a half-appeal for lbw against Stokes, which isn’t very confident and results in nothing but a couple of leg byes. 17th over: England 88-3 (Morgan 9, Stokes 6) Another drop! Maharaj bowls, Stokes edges it and the ball flies just high of the static hands of Amla at slip! And then he’s dropped again! Another edge, this one popping out of De Kock’s gloves! And then he edges another! This time it goes wide of both keeper and slip and brings a couple of runs. That’s fine bowling, and Stokes is pretty lucky to still be in the middle. 16th over: England 82-3 (Morgan 9, Stokes 0) Root was looking in fabulous shape and all set for some proper fun, but alas ‘twas not to be. Ben Stokes comes in and, about 30 seconds later, starts waving at the England balcony. Happily it’s not his knee that’s troubling him, it’s his gloves. He needs a new one already. What could possibly have gone wrong with his first pair so quickly? Morgan drives straight, Pretorius gets the finest fingertip on the ball and it clatters into the stumps at the bowler’s end with Root out of his crease and thus done for! That is just rum bad luck and should be excluded from his averages for the sake of fairness. 15th over: England 78-2 (Root 38, Morgan 6) In which Root paddles Maharaj’s first delivery gently over his shoulder for a single, with the fielder at backward square leg not far away from getting round to catch it. Some more singles follow. “In olden days a glimpse of stocking was looked on as something shocking,” notes Phil Sawyer. “Now, apparently, shoehorning references to old crooners into the OBO is acceptable. Anything goes, I guess. Incidentally 33-1 after nine overs? It’s just like watching, erm, England. Old England, obviously. Not All New All Different Exciting Brand Of Cricket England. I’m feeling all nostalgic.” 14th over: England 74-2 (Root 36, Morgan 4) Morgan takes a couple of deliveries to size up the sitguation, and then goes down on one knee to send the ball skimming through the covers for four, a lovely shot. Hales doesn’t make much use of his second chance, swiftly top-edging the ball into the keeper’s gloves. 13th over: England 69-1 (Hales 24, Root 35) Dropped! That is totally bizarre! Hales hits high but not quite hard enough, and it drops towards Rabada at long on. He raises his hands to collect the ball and ... it flies right between them! And over the rope for six! That’s just bizarre catchmanship. 12th over: England 58-1 (Hales 18, Root 30) De Kock comes up to the stumps, and Hales immediately pops the ball over his head and gets four for his pains. Another follows a couple of balls later, through midwicket this time. Pretorius is like a walking run-buffet here. 11th over: England 47-1 (Hales 16, Root 21) And another change, Keshav Maharaj slowing things down a bit. Englad take a few singles, hindered mainly because their batsmen are still salivating wildly and licking their lips at the thought of some more Pretorius bowling to tuck into. 10th over: England 43-1 (Hales 14, Root 19) A bowling change, with Dwaine Pretorius having a go, but the way Root reacts is as if they have just had “HIT ME” stitched into the ball. He goes after the bowler’s second delivery, dancing down the pitch and driving straight and low for four, and then smashes through midwicket for four more. 9th over: England 33-1 (Hales 13, Root 10) Root goes after a fast, wide delivery and misses it completely, earning a chorus of “oooh”s from the assembled masses. Rabada’s last delivery is short but this one Root does pick out - but then so is the fielder at deep midwicket, unfortunately. 8th over: England 33-1 (Hales 13, Root 10) No fireworks as of yet but there have been a couple of sparklers, in the shape of Rabada’s wicket-smacking yorker and Hales’s brawny heave. But England look ready now to light the touchpaper, Hales bashing towards point only for a diving fielder to stop well, and Root hooking a gentle delivery from Morris fine for four. 7th over: England 25-1 (Hales 12, Root 3) Good pace variation from Rabada, most of whose deliveries are in the high 80something mph, but who then sends one down at 75mph, which Hales anticipates, waits for and tickles away for a couple. 6th over: England 20-1 (Hales 9, Root 1) It may have taken 18 deliveries for England to score a single, but South Africa then bowled 19 deliveries before they scored anything else. That includes a couple of bonus deliveries, because the last couple of overs have both featured an overenthusiastic bumper, both signalled wide. Then from the last ball of Morris’s over Hales takes a big step to his left and heaves the ball over the covers from chest high for four. 5th over: England 13-1 (Hales 4, Root 0) The speed gun tells us that the wicket-taking delivery was going at 93mph, which goes some way to excusing Roy’s complete failure to make contact on his attempted leg-side flick. Three of Roy’s last four ODI innings have ended for less than 10 runs now, which was true of one of the previous 15. That’s really fast and full from Rabada, and Roy falls in single figures again! 4th over: England 12-0 (Roy 8, Hales 4) Roy tries to work the ball to mid on but fluffs the shot and edges, the ball flying at lovely catching height just wide of backward point. Another one-run over. 3rd over: England 11-0 (Roy 7, Hales 4) Rabada bounces one towards Roy’s head at 93mph, his fastest delivery of the day so far, and the batsman has a swing at it, edges it into his arm, and thence into the ground. Roy seems unbothered, but I’m scared for him. “AB knows South Africa doesn’t chase good, he just wants to prove a point, instead of putting the team first,” writes Werner Venter. “SA much better without him!” They have, however, won seven of their last nine games when batting second, against Australia, Sri Lanka and New Zealand (some of those games without AB, but still). Just a single off the over. 2nd over: England 10-0 (Roy 6, Hales 4) Chris Morris bowls, and Hales almost exactly replicates Roy’s lovely first-over boundary through midwicket, with identiacl aresults. 1st over: England 6-0 (Roy 6, Hales 0) After a few dots Roy works the ball square off his hip and gets a couple and, emboldened, works the next through midwicket for four. No immediate movement but the last bounces sharply over Roy’s right shoulder and is left well alone. Kagiso Rabada has the ball. This is happening. Jerusalem is being sung, and the players are coming out, to what sounds on TV like wildly enthusiastic applause. And there’s also this: This isn’t promising. Or it is promising, I suppose, depending. “Hope the weather is fine with you all,” writes Chris Drew. It’s certainly fine with me, thanks, despite some overnight rain. Anyway, continue. “It’s lovely here in Normandy. And you know that when the world seems to shine, like you’ve had too much wine, that’s amore! And don’t we all love cricket?” Hmmm, I’m not sure how the Dean Martinesque crooning came into it, but in the circumstances I’m willing to overlook it. So South Africa bring in Dwayne Pretorius, Farhaan Berhardien and Keshav Maharaj, the latter making his ODI debut. Here’s South Arica’s team sheet, courtesy of the TMS Twitter people. AB is “expecting a big improvement from all of us today”. Eoin Morgan says he too would have bowled first, but isn’t really bothered. Chris Woakes is out with a minor injury, and Jake Ball comes in. “The ball should be swinging a bit,” says AB. “Let’s hope we get a few wickets early on.” Live TV coverage has just started, and it’s cloudy and a bit breezy. A toss worth winning, then. Hello world! Welcome to The Further Adventures of Englishmen and South Africans Attempting to Hit Themselves Into Form by Next Week Sometime. The first attempt did the trick for some of them, and was for the most part rather stirring, though it fizzled out a bit towards the end. Surely the very worst case scenario when it comes to today’s action is that it will be broadly similar. We should be getting a 7/10 for sporting fun at the very minimum, which is not something that can be said with any great confidence of, say, the Cup final (just as well as cricket-watchers are likely to miss some or all of it). Weatherwatch: We’re set fair. A glance at the next two days’ forecasts for the Southampton area shows quite how fortunate we are: by Monday lunchtime the area will be extremely soggy. Today, though, is all about the sun and the sport. Simon will be here shortly. In the meantime, here’s our news-story-slash-preview with some glad tidings concerning Ben Stokes’ left knee: Ben Stokes will be fit to play against South Africa in the second ODI in Southampton on Saturday. It is an indication of Stokes’ status that a gaggle of newshounds kept a constant eye on him throughout a long training session, in which he did little bowling. At one point Stokes was batting right-handed and missing the ball on purpose in order to give Jos Buttler some wicketkeeping practice and we were all dutifully transfixed. Stokes is a totemic figure and England want him involved whenever possible. On Thursday night he had a scan which did not reveal any serious damage. On Friday morning with his knee carefully bandaged he spent a long time batting. Then we were informed he was fit, able to bowl and playing. So England have resisted the temptation to wrap him in cotton wool even though the Champions Trophy is just around the corner. The medics must be confident that he is fine and there is no doubt Stokes is eager for the fray.

Committees ponder, plans are made – but no one yet has a simple route through, as pensioners who are used to not paying suddenly face a new reality. The best scheme thus far – no free licences if you’re living with someone under 75 – involves much snooping and checking, guarantees of public outrage. But try this alternative on for size. The BBC is Britain’s core broadcaster. Its licence is effectively your entry fee to the world of broadcasting. So paying that money is a basic responsibility. If, therefore, you’re getting your fix via Sky or Virgin, if you’re supplementing your core by buying Netflix or Amazon Prime on top, then that should disqualify you from claiming a free licence: the needs of the BBC come first. It’s a technical question of collating subscription lists. You’re targeting 18m homes even before the Netflix equation kicks in. And what, pray, could be fairer? The voice and eyes of Britain take precedence.

In a joint statement on Friday evening, G7 leaders said they “condemn in the strongest possible terms terrorism in all its forms” as they moved to crack down on the financing and proliferation of extremism. Leading a discussion on counter-terrorism at a summit in Taormina, Italy, the prime minister said more had to be done to tackle the threat posed by people returning to Europe from countries such as Syria, Iraq and Libya. She set out steps that she claimed could improve “intelligence sharing, evidence gathering and bolstering countries’ police and legal processes”, helping avoid a repeat of the Manchester attack. It is believed that Salman Abedi, whose suicide mission took the lives of 22 people at an Ariana Grande concert on Monday night, had travelled to Libya, and may have taken up arms against Colonel Gaddafi. The prime minister said the investigation into the attack was ongoing, but that Abedi’s links with Libya “undoubtedly shine a spotlight on this largely ungoverned space on the edge of Europe”. “It is the case that we believe a number of foreign fighters who went to Syria have returned to the UK,” May said. “We took some extra powers in legislation when I was home secretary to manage the return of individuals, and those are looked at on a case-by-case basis.” May set out the case for greater international co-operation in a meeting with US president Donald Trump, newly-elected French president Emmanuel Macron, German chancellor Angela Merkel, Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe and Italian PM Paolo Gentiloni. She argued that one way to help reduce the risk was to share the identities of foreign fighters who may seek to pass through third countries on the way back to their western homes. According to a Downing Street spokesman, May raised the question of individuals going to fight for terrorist organisations in Iraq or Syria who may try to return owing to military changes on the ground. The G7 was called on to share its expertise with the destination countries of foreign fighters including training, police expertise, border security and border watch lists. There were also demands to provide resources to policymakers in countries such as Iraq to help them prosecute, extradite and deport captured fighters. May also demanded the group securely share data on foreign fighters’ names and nationalities within a clear legal framework. The PM had also argued that when allies found evidence of illegal activity – such as videos or documents – involving, for example, a Brit in a conflict zone, they should share it with UK authorities to help prosecute them when they return. G7 leaders also backed the prime minister’s call for internet companies such as Google, Facebook and Twitter to better target extremist messages online, including by developing technology which automatically identifies and removes messages that incite violence. “We agreed that the threat from Daesh [Isis] is evolving rather than disappearing. As they lose ground in Iraq and Syria, foreign fighters are returning and the group’s hateful ideology is spreading online,” the prime minister said. Describing the G7 joint statement as “a significant step forward”, May said she wanted to see terrorist material taken down “more urgently and more rapidly than it is at the moment”. “Make no mistake, the fight is moving from the battlefield to the internet. In the UK, we are already working with social media companies to halt the spread of extremist material and hateful propaganda that is warping young minds. I am clear that corporations can do more. Indeed they have a social responsibility to now step up their efforts to remove harmful content from their networks.” “Today, I called on leaders to do more. We agreed a range of steps the G7 could take to strengthen its work with tech companies on this vital agenda. We want companies to develop tools to identify and remove harmful materials automatically.” Asked whether Nato intervention in Libya in 2011 had proved in hindsight to be a success, the prime minister said focus must now fall on the UN to bring stability to the area. “We must redouble our support for a UN-led effort that brings all parties to the negotiating table and reduces the threat of terror from that region,” she said. In earlier meetings with leaders, the government gave the example of a recent prosecution of a British foreign fighter, Aine Davis from London. Davis was arrested in 2015 near Istanbul, found guilty of being a senior member of a terrorist organisation and jailed for seven-and-a-half years. He had been tracked by Turkish police and intelligence officials days after being smuggled out of Syria by Isis, according to evidence at his the trial. May cut short her attendance at the two-day G7 gathering and was scheduled to fly back to the UK at the end of Friday."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/may/29/help-mental-illness-easy-as-dentist","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-05-29T07:00:19Z","webTitle":"What if getting help for mental illness were as easy as going to the dentist? | Karl Mercer","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/may/29/help-mental-illness-easy-as-dentist","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/may/29/help-mental-illness-easy-as-dentist","fields":{"headline":"What if getting help for mental illness were as easy as going to the dentist?","bodyText":"Ignorance and a lack of empathy are responsible for most of the world’s ills, but they are at their most insidious when it comes to how we treat those with mental health issues. People get uncomfortable when I’m open about my bipolar , as though speaking candidly about my mental health was violating some unspoken pact. It’s a form of discrimination subtler than most. It presents itself in smiles and soft patronising voices, in stock phrases such as “Cheer up!”, and “It could be worse.” The truly sad thing, though, is that these reactions often come from a warped attempt at kindness – people earnestly trying to do the right thing but having no idea how to achieve it. The fact that Prince Harry was praised for seeking help for his own issues speaks volumes about how mental health is viewed in this country. It was a brave and generous thing for him to publicly admit, but it shouldn’t have to be. It should be something that is as routine as having any other illness, for which you would go to your GP for treatment. Accessing help should be as easy too. But it isn’t. I know from personal experience just how hard it can be to get help. It took me weeks of jumping through hoops simply to get on a waiting list for an assessment of whether I was suitable to go on a waiting list to receive help. If it sounds convoluted that’s because it is. The Kafkaesque nightmare of navigating bureaucracy when you are so ill that you’re thinking about killing yourself is a hell I wouldn’t wish on anyone – and yet it’s a hell many go through daily. In the last five years alone, mental health trusts in the UK have had £600m cut from their budgets while the number of people seeking help for mental health-related issues has leapt from 500,000 a year 2010 to 1.7 million. Instead of pumping billions into projects such as Trident we could redirect that money to help those most in need. What’s the point in weapons to deter attacks if our own people kill themselves anyway because they can’t get access to the help they need? We should have state-funded mental health clinics, in the same way and with the same everydayness, that dentist’s surgeries exist. We consider trips to the dentist to be part of our regular health routine, catching tooth decay early to curb further problems down the line. Yet we don’t have the same attitude or ease of access when it comes to our mental health – something that is, arguably, far more important. Imagine free counselling provided by trained specialists, actively encouraged by government initiatives. You could schedule “checkups”, with more frequent sessions before the age of 30 (your 20s being the period during which most mental health issues present themselves.) Not only would this mean catching potential problems before they had the chance to threaten an individual’s wellbeing. It would make getting counselling seem as mundane as brushing your teeth, and the stigma around mental health issues and seeking help for them would diminish. The issue of accessible care aside, it is that stigma that is one of the main challenges I and many others face day to day when it comes to mental health. It’s hard enough to deal with the anxieties, self-loathing and sense of worthlessness depression brings, let alone feeling that you have to face those problems alone for fear that your friends, family and employers won’t understand what you’re going through. As with many things, though, the route to understanding is through education. In March the government announced plans to trial mental health training in around 200 schools across the UK. But while this is a huge step in the right direction, it isn’t enough. For universal change, universal education is needed, so every school should teach a mental health class with its importance placed as highly as any of the core subjects. After all, knowing what a surd is has never at any point in my adult life been of even the vaguest use. However, had I been taught what bipolar was, I might have been able to recognise it in myself before I had my first breakdown. Classes in mental health would teach children about a multitude of illnesses – not just those that get media attention, such as depression and anxiety, but much misunderstood illnesses such as schizophrenia and borderline personality disorder. Being taught not only what these illnesses are but how they affect people, and their symptoms and potential triggers, would help children recognise warning signs in themselves and others. Couple this with classes in mindfulness, cognitive behavioural therapy and basic counselling skills (listening being the main focus), and you cultivate an environment in which having a mental illness is not stigmatised but normalised. Perhaps the most important aspect, though, is that children would be given a toolbox of techniques in which to aid their own mental wellbeing. When you suffer from an illness such as bipolar, unfortunately, you are your own primary care giver, and looking after yourself and having the courage to seek help when you need it is tremendously hard. I can’t think of anything more valuable than giving future generations an education and mindset that helps them not only battle their own demons but be better equipped to help others fight theirs."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"books/2017/jun/02/the-best-recent-thrillers-review-roundup","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2017-06-02T11:00:22Z","webTitle":"The best recent thrillers – review roundup","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/jun/02/the-best-recent-thrillers-review-roundup","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2017/jun/02/the-best-recent-thrillers-review-roundup","fields":{"headline":"The best recent thrillers – review roundup","bodyText":"The publishing world is no stranger to arguments, but few were as divisive as those prompted by Joël Dicker’s multi-award-winning The Truth About the Harry Quebert Affair two years ago. Admirers claimed it as a masterpiece, with eye-catching metafictional conceits, while detractors dismissed it as banal and overrated. The book sold 2m copies in a year. Its successor, The Baltimore Boys (MacLehose, £20, translated by Alison Anderson), is likely to create less of a stir, but may still cause puzzlement. Writer Marcus Goldman, the protagonist of the first book, reappears on a new search for inspiration. This time it takes him to Florida, where an encounter with an old girlfriend makes him look back at golden days with his cousins, the eponymous Baltimore Boys. But the glittering prizes they anticipated in their youth have turned to dust, and Marcus’s investigation of a legacy of betrayal and deceit is to have a profound impact on his own life. The new book’s continental sales have already been prodigious, but what’s most curious is how it replicates the dichotomy of Harry Quebert: the reader is never sure whether they are reading an ambitious literary novel or an overblown airport blockbuster in Jeffrey Archer style. Once again, Dicker’s astute observations (notably about class divides and politics in the US) coexist with curiously maladroit writing and guidance that seems to belong in a self‑help manual. Readers of Michael Ridpath’s corporate thrillers were nonplussed by a recent change of direction into impressive Iceland-set mysteries. Amnesia (Corvus, £12.99) demonstrates that Ridpath has itchy feet again. His latest offering is a stand-alone psychological thriller – and it suggests he may finally have found his metier. Curmudgeonly retired doctor Alistair Cunningham has had a fall that has damaged his memory and is recuperating in a cottage by a Scottish loch; he is reluctantly attended to by Clémence, the great-niece of a friend. She discovers a manuscript in which her patient appears to confess to killing a woman he once loved. But attempting to uncover the truth soon puts both Alistair and Clémence in peril. Using an expertly wrought book-within-a-book narrative and a variety of time shifts to address issues of ageing and memory, Ridpath is in full command of his material. Fasten your seatbelts: any time spent in the company of Steve Cavanagh’s tough-guy lawyer, Eddie Flynn, will guarantee a bumpy ride. The Liar (Orion, £17.99) is no exception. Eddie investigates the kidnapping of a rich businessman’s daughter. But there is a strange complication: Eddie’s client runs an organisation that handles kidnap negotiations with dangerous groups such as Al-Qaida. More might be going on than meets the eye ... Ian Fleming led a vicarious fantasy life through 007; is the unlikely superlawyer, as adept at physical violence as he is in the courtroom, a similar alter ego for Cavanagh, whose day job is practising civil rights law? With its bullet-riddled jacket and speeding car illustration, Road Kill by Hanna Jameson (Head of Zeus, £7.99) announces forcefully that this is no cosy home counties mystery; the author serves up caustic and energetic fare, with echoes of James Ellroy, in what is essentially a literary road movie smelling of hot American tarmac and cheap motels. Two violent British gangsters search for Trent, an ex-colleague who did the dirty on them. Through its high body count, all the way to a counterintuitively low-key ending, this is a fast‑moving narrative. The critical stock of Joseph Kanon is high, and Defectors (Simon &amp; Schuster, £14.99) will add further lustre to his reputation. The year is 1961. Ex-CIA operative and defector Frank Weeks is about to publish his memoirs; his betrayal had a seismic effect in Washington, destroying the career of his brother Simon. The latter’s journey to Moscow will unearth some Stygian secrets. There are pleasing echoes here of the “entertainments” of Graham Greene. Of late, Sherlock Holmes pastiches have had an air of desperation, with every character connected with 221B Baker Street dragooned for service, including the great detective’s landlady. But HB Lyle’s The Irregular (Hodder, £17.99) proves that this is still fecund territory, given an unorthodox approach. Wiggins, Holmesians will remember, was the sharpest member of the Baker Street irregulars, the ragamuffin street children enlisted by Holmes. But by 1909, Wiggins is a resourceful ex-soldier, recruited by intelligence man Captain Vernon Kell, who is convinced of a range of dangers facing London. A flavoursome smorgasbord that features not only Holmes but also Winston Churchill, this is irresistible stuff."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"money/2017/may/27/tax-britons-pay-europe-australia-us","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2017-05-27T06:00:20Z","webTitle":"Tax on test: do Britons pay more than most?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2017/may/27/tax-britons-pay-europe-australia-us","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2017/may/27/tax-britons-pay-europe-australia-us","fields":{"headline":"Tax on test: do Britons pay more than most?","bodyText":"Labour’s plan to tax incomes over £80,000 more heavily is a “massive tax hike for the middle classes” that will “take Britain back to the misery of the 1970s”, according to rightwing newspapers. But are British households that heavily taxed? A comparison of personal tax rates across Europe, Australia and the US by Guardian Money reveals how average earners in Britain on salaries of £25,000, or “middle-class” individuals on £40,000, enjoy among the lowest personal tax rates of the advanced countries, while high earners on £100,000 see less of their income taken in tax than almost anywhere else in Europe. Our survey found that someone earning £100,000 in the UK in effect loses about 34.3% of their pay to HM Revenue &amp; Customs once personal allowances, income tax and national insurance are taken into account. The one-third reduction is roughly the same as the US, Australia and Spain, but a long way behind the 38% in Germany, 41% in Ireland, 45% in Sweden and up to 59% in France (though the French figures include very large pension contributions). Note that these figures are a rough guide only. International tax comparisons are bedevilled by large numbers of factors. We compared rates for a single person with no children and with no special allowances. Most countries tax individuals rather than households, but France taxes couples, which has the impact of reducing the burden on a high earner with an at-home partner. Autonomous regions within countries impose their own varying taxes. We converted euros, dollars and krona into sterling at a time when the pound had fallen rapidly; some earnings might have translated into higher tax bands abroad before sterling plunged. Some countries, such as the US, raise relatively large revenues from property taxes. Others squeeze revenue from sales taxes – 25% in Sweden, 19% in Germany. While there is some harmonisation of income tax rates, social security varies dramatically. Australia imposes a small medical levy of 2%. France’s charges can be as high as 30%. One of the most striking facts to emerge is church taxes. In Germany, individuals are expected to give 8% of their income to the church. EU officials may look forward to the day when the single currency is teamed up with a single tax policy. But what emerges from our survey is how elaborate each country’s tax and social security systems are. Britain’s actually looks relatively simple compared with France’s. The Brexit negotiations will be a walk in the park compared with any attempt to harmonise the EU’s 27 national tax and social security systems. United Kingdom Gross salary £25,000 After tax £20,279 Tax rate 18.9% Gross salary £40,000 After tax £30,480 Tax rate 24.8% Gross salary £100,000 After tax £65,780 Tax rate 34.3% Britain’s tax system is made up of income tax bands at 20%, 40% and 45%, plus national insurance contributions of a further 12%, with low earners benefiting from a tax-free personal allowance at £11,500, which is higher than most other countries. Higher earners pay income and social security taxes that are on a par with the US, Australia and Spain, but which are much less than those in France, Sweden and Ireland. VAT, levied at a standard rate of 20%, is towards the lower end of sales tax rates across the EU, though council taxes are relatively high by comparison. Ireland Gross salary £25,000 After tax £21,183 Tax rate 15.3% Gross salary £40,000 After tax £29,624 Tax rate 26% Gross salary £100,000 After tax £59,000 Tax rate 41% While Ireland remains a low-tax haven for giant multinationals, its resident population has suffered steep tax increases after its banks collapsed and it was forced into a £57bn IMF-EU bailout. Its 20% and 40% standard tax bands are identical to Britain – but start at a much lower level. Unlike the UK’s £11,500 personal allowance, the Irish don’t have one in the same sense – rather a tax credit that reduces their bill by €3,300. After the financial crisis struck, the government brought in the emergency universal social charge, which starts at 2.5% on incomes over €13,000 but rises to 8% on incomes over €70,044. That means workers in Ireland in effect pay 48% tax on earnings above £60,000. The government also brought in a local property tax (equivalent to Britain’s council tax), plus hugely controversial water charges. VAT, at 23%, is also higher than in many other European countries. The Irish taxpayers don’t even get an equivalent to the UK’s National Health Service for all this tax, having to pay €50-€65 for each GP visit, and €2,000 a year for family health insurance policies. However, they enjoy a relatively high – at £192 a week – basic state pension. After the economy expanded by 5.2% in 2016 (Europe’s fastest growth rate) and with another 3.5% expected this year, there is widespread anticipation of personal tax cuts to come. The state’s coffers will also swell if Apple is forced to pay £11bn in back taxes demanded by the EU, which would payable to the Republic. Garry O’Rourke of TaxAssist in Dublin, who helped compile the figures for Guardian Money, says: “Though the Irish tax system is progressive earners hit the top rate of income tax very quickly, €33,800 per annum. Generally personal tax rates in Ireland are slightly higher than the UK and they have been since the financial crisis.” France Gross salary £25,000 After tax £17,050 Tax rate 31.8% Gross salary £40,000 After tax £23,520 Tax rate 41.2% Gross salary £100,000 After tax £40,600 Tax rate 59.4% What appear to be extraordinarily high tax rates should really be viewed as tax plus pension contributions. The French pay no income tax on the first €9,710 of their income, then 14% on sums up to €26,818. After that the rate is 30% through to €71,898. These rates are lower than the corresponding 20% and 40% rates in Britain, and the maximum rate – 45% – is the same as in the UK. The huge difference is in social security contributions, which are vastly higher and more complex than the UK’s, but that pay for vastly higher welfare benefits. Most taxpayers typically pay around 25% of their salary in social security, compared with 12% in the UK. But for this they receive arguably the world’s best health service, unemployment benefit typically at 65% of your former pay (up to a ceiling of about €6,000 a month, compared with £72.40 a week in the UK), and generous state pensions worth up to 50% of your former salary. If a £40,000-a-year worker in the UK wanted a state pension similar to that in France, he or she would likely be contributing similar amounts in tax as the worker in France. The French system, though, makes Britain’s look simple, and there is a range of individual circumstances that play a part in how much tax people pay. The Paris-based British financial journalist who helped compile the above figures for us said: “After 25 years in France I still don’t understand the payslip you get at the end of the month. But while it costs a lot to live in France, the benefits – especially health and unemployment – are very good.” Additional reporting by Judith Prescott Spain (Catalonia) Gross salary £25,000 After tax £20,812 Tax rate 16.7% Gross salary £40,000 After tax £31,000 Tax rate 22.1% Gross salary £100,000 After tax £65,700 Tax rate 34.3% Spain’s effective tax rates are surprisingly similar to the UK’s, and its relatively low rate of tax on higher earners may explain why Madrid has emerged as the surprise competitor to Paris, Frankfurt and Dublin for Brexit-fleeing banks. Each autonomous region of Spain has its own tax rates, with the figures above calculated for someone living in Barcelona. The highest combined state and regional tax rate is around 48%. Chris Burke of Spectrum IFA, who calculated the figures for us, says homeowners also pay an annual tax on the value of their property, currently around €900 on a home valued at €300,000, so slightly less than typical council tax rates in the UK. However, he says that inheritance tax has shifted enormously in recent years, having been raised to 19% during the financial crisis but now starting at just 1%. Germany Gross salary £25,000 After tax £18,923 Tax rate 24.3% Gross salary £40,000 After tax £27,256 Tax rate 31.8% Gross salary £100,000 After tax £61,740 Tax rate 38.3% Basic rates of tax are around the same as in Britain (ranging from 19% to a top rate of 45%), but workers have to pay an extra 10% for state pensions, 8% for health, 1.5% for unemployment cover and 1% for care insurance. That all adds up to a lot more than Britain’s 12% national insurance but, like France, Germany’s public services and welfare payouts are regarded as far superior. We used the brutto-netto-rechner.info site to calculate take-home pay. The “solidarity tax” of 5.5% of income tax paid (to pay for German reunification) “is due to be phased out soon, but the government is proving very reluctant to do so,” writes our Berlin correspondent, Kate Connolly. The big shock for British taxpayers is the country’s church tax, which is 8% or 9% of income tax paid, depending on which part of Germany you live in. Under German law, anyone who has been baptised is automatically a member of the church and obliged to pay the tax, irrespective of their beliefs or whether they attend church services. Individuals can formally renounce their church membership and stop paying the tax, but they may risk losing access to some of the country’s best schools and childcare facilities. The tax brings in around £10bn a year, split roughly half and half between the Protestant and Catholic church. Sweden Gross salary £25,000 After tax £19,500 Tax rate 22% Gross salary £40,000 After tax £30,000 Tax rate 25% Gross salary £100,000 After tax £55,000 Tax rate 45% The top rate of tax is 57%, but the tax agency is nearly as popular as Abba. Swedes have a small personal allowance then pay taxes averaging 32% on incomes up to £39,000, rising to 52% on incomes up to £57,000, with a top rate of 57%. VAT is nearly the highest in the EU at 25%. But there is broad support for a cradle-to-grave welfare system, with pensions that pay out about 60% of a person’s final salary. A church and burial tax is about another 1%-2% of income. United States Gross salary £25,000 After tax £19,925 Tax rate 20.3% Gross salary £40,000 After tax £30,280 Tax rate 24.3% Gross salary £100,000 After tax £65,800 Tax rate 34.2% Precise tax comparisons are difficult in the US because of the myriad federal, state and local tax rates, and an equally wide range of deductions and allowances. We chose New York state for our comparison, where the state taxes are relatively high. That might help to explain the surprising discovery that people on low earnings see more of their income disappear in tax than those in the UK, while high earners are taxed relatively lightly. State and local sales taxes in New York City, at 8.875%, are markedly lower than the 19%-25% VAT rates common in the EU. However, property taxes are relatively high in the US, with homeowners in the New York/New Jersey/Connecticut area, for example, typically having to pay upwards of $5,000-$7,000 a year. Australia Gross salary £25,000 After tax £21,275 Tax rate 14.9% Gross salary £40,000 After tax £31,080 Tax rate 22.3% Gross salary £100,000 After tax £66,900 Tax rate 33.1% Australia emerges as one of the lower tax countries in Guardian Money’s survey. Australians currently pay nothing on the first A$18,200 (£10,500) of their income, then 19% above that, with a top rate of 45% on incomes over £105,000 a year. An additional 2% medical levy (which is soon to rise to 2.5%) helps to pay for public health services, though many Australians also choose to buy private insurance. In general, Australians pay slightly more income tax than their equivalent earners in the UK, but the country’s medical levy is far lower than the UK’s national insurance contributions, leaving the total tax burden lower. Despite this, the Australian basic state pension is about £12,000 a year and unemployment benefit is £145 a week, depending on past contributions. • This article was amended on 7 June 2017. An earlier version said that Germans pay a church tax of 8% or 9% depending on location, and a solidarity tax of 5.5% to pay for German reunification. These rates are correct but are applied as a percentage of income tax paid, not as a percentage of someone’s gross income. This has the effect of significantly reducing the amount of tax paid. German citizens can also renounce their membership of a religion and therefore not pay church tax."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"football/blog/2017/may/26/arsenal-chelsea-diego-costa-ogre-of-stamford-bridge","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-05-26T12:21:00Z","webTitle":"Arsenal tiptoe into the Diego Zone: the ogre of Stamford Bridge awaits | Barney Ronay","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2017/may/26/arsenal-chelsea-diego-costa-ogre-of-stamford-bridge","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/blog/2017/may/26/arsenal-chelsea-diego-costa-ogre-of-stamford-bridge","fields":{"headline":"Arsenal tiptoe into the Diego Zone: the ogre of Stamford Bridge awaits","bodyText":"Arsenal fans riled by the Groundhog Day repetitions of the past few years have at least been treated to something more immediate before Saturday’s FA Cup final against Chelsea. Faced with the prospect of another tangle with Diego Costa, Arsenal’s centre-backs have been cutting straight to the chase. Shkodran Mustafi is concussed. Laurent Koscielny has been sent off and banned. Gabriel got in there early with his injured knee. Entering the Diego Zone? They are way ahead of you. Arsenal have generally seen the best and the worst of Costa during three seasons of mischief and fury in the Premier League, a centre-forward who does not so much play on the edge as appear at times to be completely unaware the edge exists in the first place. Even at full strength, successive Wenger-issue centre-halves have been bruised and bullied through a head-to-head record of three kidney-punching defeats and a single, ultimately fruitless, victory last September, the 3-0 win at the Emirates that acted as a spark for Chelsea’s title charge. Even when Costa does not score he has tended to dominate these occasions. As he did most memorably while reeling in Gabriel at Stamford Bridge last season, Arsenal’s Brazilian sent off for retaliating to provocation and left wandering off in tears, gulping for air, like a prize trout hooked, landed and ready to be put out of his misery against the harbour wall. Most recently Costa was involved in all three Chelsea goals in the 3-1 win at Stamford Bridge in February, the last of them a kind of “scare-assist”, as Costa ran towards Petr Cech more in hope then expectation. Spooked, Cech panicked and scuffed the ball straight to Cesc Fàbregas. Chuck in the chance this could yet turn into a bravura farewell for Chelsea’s chief goal-sicario, and it is hard not to fear for a slightly makeshift Arsenal backline. Per Mertesacker has made six starts in the league since he was traumatised by Costa at the Emirates a year and a half ago. Mertesacker could yet find himself wheeled out from the start at the heart of a four-man defence. Alongside him the promising Rob Holding will come into the game as yet unharmed by the ogre of Stamford Bridge. Holding made a fine show of keeping the similarly powerful Romelu Lukaku quiet last weekend. Costa, though, is a challenge unlike any other, the most brutally effective, emotionally and physically bruising forward player of the past three seasons. For how much longer though? Talk of a move to Tianjin Quanjian in the summer has eased off a little in the past week, with the Chinese club making a few pursed and pointed comments about not being asked to pay “premium prices” by European agents (China, meet Jorge. Jorge, China). Costa has seemed a little restless for a while. He is a high-mileage battering ram these days, those twanging hamstrings wrenched through four league title races across five hard seasons in Spain and England. Costa’s rise from Brazil’s small-town interior has its own improbable qualities. It is not hard to see how he might be tempted by the chance to enrich himself even further on another new frontier. One thing is certain. If Wembley really is the end for Costa after two league titles, 57 goals, almost 400 fouls and a relentlessly shrill concatenation of outrage, he could not have chosen a better opponent. For Arsenal Costa is not just a menace. He is also the one that got away, a failure of recruitment made all the more galling by the fact no player in the league embodies better what this mannered, orderly late-Wenger team have needed. Arsenal first tried to sign Costa in the summer of 2013. A £30m-plus buyout clause put them off. Yaya Sanogo arrived instead. Nicklas Bendtner was retained for another year. More recently Costa’s price tag has been spent on Danny Welbeck and Lucas Pérez combined, arguably the definition of a false economy. There is a fair chance Arsenal would have won the league at least once in the past three years had Costa come to the Emirates, bringing with him what this team have palpably lacked, a little raggedness, a little of that horrible, needling street-warrior spirit. And not just that either. One reason Chelsea may want to hang on to Costa is the difficulty of replacing his all-round game. For all his theatricality Costa is also a wonderful footballer. His movement is exceptional, not only in sniffing out the kind of goalscoring spaces that set Fàbregas’s radar twitching but in his ability to sprint long distances, carry the ball, hound defenders and generally pull his team forward in his wake. A feature of Chelsea in the Costa years has been the spectacle of their lone centre-forward scrabbling about surrounded with the ball at his feet, and scoring exactly the kind of breakaway goal that turned the 3-1 win at Manchester City last December, where Costa produced arguably the outstanding individual attacking performance of the domestic season. He is a gladiator in these moments and a relentless contributor to the cause. No other centre-forward has made anywhere near as many dribbles. No player at a top-six club has had as many crosses and shots or made anywhere near as many clearances, or laid on more assists than Costa’s seven while playing as a centre-forward. Plus there is the strange dark energy that distinguishes Costa not only from his more mannered opponents at Wembley but from your average home-reared Premier League player. This is a man who was not formally coached until he was 16, who learned to play on scrubland, who worked in his uncle’s shop into his late teens, and who was nicknamed “that fucking Brazilian” for his pranks, high spirits and all-round ragged behaviour as a young man at Albacete. Plenty of rough edges but there is no comfort zone here. Albeit, there is plenty that is undesirable too. “Diego likes to cheat a lot,” Kurt Zouma said on TV after that defeat of Arsenal at Stamford Bridge last year, a statement Zouma later clarified through club channels by pointing out what he really meant to say was: “Diego is a player who puts pressure on his opponents.” You can say that again, Kurt. Costa can be horrible, always seeking out the tender spot, play-acting, niggling and often crossing the line into gracelessness. At times this can distract his own team. At others it can be more controlled. It was Costa who led Chelsea to the 2-2 draw with Tottenham last summer that decided the title in a match marked out by Mark Clattenburg booking 12 players but not, incredibly, Costa, who had an unseen hand in at least five of those cards. As Chelsea’s master of unease prepares for what could be a valedictory Wembley final his value is clear enough, a player whose presence would surely have improved every other team in the league over the past three years. Not least his favourite opponents, a patched-up Arsenal backline who will once again gird themselves for entry into the Diego Zone."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/may/29/how-i-learned-to-love-my-walking-stick","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2017-05-29T05:00:16Z","webTitle":"How I learned to love my walking stick","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/may/29/how-i-learned-to-love-my-walking-stick","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/may/29/how-i-learned-to-love-my-walking-stick","fields":{"headline":"How I learned to love my walking stick","bodyText":"If you want to learn about life, get a walking stick. I did, when, after a period of denial, I reluctantly accepted that multiple sclerosis was causing me to become unsteady. I felt as if my legs were being operated by somebody else; somebody who wasn’t paying attention. My GP booked me an appointment with a physiotherapist, who observed me walking to assess what was required, suggested a simple stick, and guided me on its correct use. So as not to place undue strain on elbows and shoulders, the arm should be straight, the handle reaching the end of the arm. For me, an ergonomic handle (which lessens callouses) was the way to go. I was then given a lesson in stick wrangling. Users are advised to carry their stick when climbing stairs, relying on stable bannisters instead. So much for those “spot the fraud” exposés, where people spotted climbing flights of stairs, stick in hand, are deemed skivers. That is what you are supposed to do. I was then taught how to stand up properly (push yourself up without using your stick). Also, if you have one dodgy leg, the stick is held against the good leg. Those films where a disabled cop wobbles with one bad leg against a stick are just plain wrong. Maintenance, too, is important: a metal telescopic stick should make a pleasing hollow thud. If it doesn’t, it is wearing out and needs replacing. All this is free, locally provided by the NHS. It can take a while to get into your stride, but walking soon becomes natural – the knack is to treat your stick like an extra leg, rather like this scene from Delicatessen, albeit without maracas. It is also teaching me a lot about people. My walking stick is a visible declaration that I am weaker than others, which occasionally makes me feel vulnerable – but I also enjoy quiet fantasies of being a cyborg with an additional metal leg. The action of walking in public regularly reveals the unspoken hierarchy as we move along within that notional bubble of personal space that surrounds us all. If oncoming entwined couples threaten to sweep me aside, a pointed tap on the pavement usually alerts them. People with two sticks prevail, a wheelchair has right of way, a mobility scooter and everyone scatters. But I dread cyclists on pavements. Please don’t do this; you can’t see my limitations and I am slow to get out of your way. I have also encountered a fresh and dangerous level of manspreading. This simple neologism takes on a sinister meaning when your stick is knocked out from beneath you by a burly man striding proudly, wide and long. And no, he didn’t so much as look back, let alone apologise, despite my remonstrations (swearing). Then there are the people who wince with shame on realising they have just barged into a person with a walking stick. They shouldn’t be barging into, and potentially knocking over, anyone in the first place, let alone a woman with a visible disability. While happy to lose my debilitating wobble, I now struggle to hold a bag full of heavy shopping as well as a handbag, while reaching for keys, maybe pulling on gloves, answering my phone and maintaining an upright posture. Then down comes the rain and I scramble for an unwieldy umbrella. That stick is an additional complication. Mobility issues had already limited my choice of shoes. Never keen on vertiginous heels, I surrendered to flats some years back. I also had to re-evaluate my handbags. I was never fond of clutch bags; mercifully, as they are now utterly impractical. I need a bag directly on my shoulder, not low-slung as before. I have jettisoned bulkier bags so I can hold the stick properly, close to my side. I suppose the fact that my jaywalking days are over is a good thing: no more speedily scuttling across roads. Journeys will now always take longer. My nemesis are amber-light-gambling taxi drivers who deem my transit too slow, and drive menacingly towards me as a warning. But I have also learned that people are usually very kind. Drivers slow down to let me cross, people pick up my stick if I drop it, and also open gates. However, they are occasionally callous, slamming doors, glaring in an accusing fashion when I can’t reciprocate to hold the entrance open in return, or bumping in to me without looking, usually while texting. I am now obsessed with bespoke carved wooden sticks, currently on my wishlist. Regulation NHS sticks are uniform and grim. It is important to me as an individual to stamp my identity on to an item that is now an unalterable part of my life. So, bored of regulation black sticks, and encouraged by the physiotherapist, I decided to customise mine. Glitter paint was mentioned, but I’m not a nine-year old girl. Someone else suggested ribbons, which are bit too Morris-dancer. Fortunately, I know some very kind and talented artists, who spent time carefully decorating my black stick, creating excellent art using gold paint. Ross Sinclair spent hours painting his signature statement Real Life, Alan Campbell added a lovely abstract crow, Kate V Robertson provided a hand clutching the stick, and Fiona Wilson a tattoo-style skull and rose. I feel so much better about using a walking aid since it was so beautifully personalised. Now when I set out, I reach for my keys, phone and stick. I am still me, a person who uses a stick but is not defined by it. It just holds me upright. Which is all you can ask of a walking stick."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"uk-news/2017/may/26/celebrity-couple-seek-laura-lacole-eunan-okane-legal-recognition-humanist-wedding","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2017-05-26T12:38:53Z","webTitle":"Footballer and model seek legal humanist wedding","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/may/26/celebrity-couple-seek-laura-lacole-eunan-okane-legal-recognition-humanist-wedding","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2017/may/26/celebrity-couple-seek-laura-lacole-eunan-okane-legal-recognition-humanist-wedding","fields":{"headline":"Footballer and model seek legal humanist wedding","bodyText":"A footballer and a model are mounting a court challenge to have their upcoming humanist wedding recognised as legal, arguing that they are being denied the rights given to religious couples. Laura Lacole is marrying the Leeds United and Republic of Ireland midfielder Eunan O’Kane in Northern Ireland next month. The couple, both humanists, want a ceremony that reflects their beliefs, but the only legal options available to them are a religious or civil service. Lacole, 27, and O’Kane, 26, took their case to Belfast high court on Friday, arguing that they faced discrimination under European laws protecting freedom of belief. If they lose their case, the wedding will go ahead, but they will be obliged to have a separate civil registration in order to make their marriage legal. Under the law in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, non-religious weddings must be conducted at a local authority register office or an approved and licensed wedding venue. Any other non-religious ceremony is not legally recognised without an additional civil registration service. A humanist wedding is tailored to meet an individual couple’s requirements, beliefs and values, without a set script. It can take place at any venue. According to the charity Humanists UK, “many of us who aren’t religious are looking for a wedding that is more flexible and personal than a civil or register office ceremony”. In Scotland, humanist weddings have been legal since 2005. Eighty such weddings were conducted that year, but the number rose to almost 4,300 in a decade, exceeding those conducted by the Church of Scotland. Humanist weddings are also legally recognised in the Republic of Ireland, New Zealand, Canada, Australia and some US states. Before the hearing, Lacole said she and O’Kane “want to have an intimate marriage ceremony which is encompassing of who we are as individuals, the values we hold, how we go about life and our viewpoint on life. “We want it to be personal to us and the love we have for each other. So of course, not being able to have legal recognition for that ceremony is an issue for us, and we want to do something about that for ourselves and other people in our position.” In court, the couple’s lawyer, Steven McQuitty, said the case was of “huge public interest” as they wanted the same protection given to those of different belief systems. “Religious people from pagans to Free Presbyterians and everything in between enjoy a substantial legal privilege under law,” he said. “In a sense, the state gives its legal blessing to such marriages, [but] denies the same privilege to equally valid groups.” As the law stood in Northern Ireland, the couple’s wedding on 22 June would be “legally meaningless”, McQuitty said. Northern Ireland’s attorney general, John Larkin, argued that humanist elements could be incorporated into a civil ceremony. “That blunts and weakens the case for a separate ceremony,” he told the judge. The case is backed by Humanists UK, whose chief executive, Andrew Copson, said: “Religious people currently have the legal right to marry in a ceremony that reflects their most fundamental views of the world, but humanists cannot do likewise. “They are denied legal recognition for a bespoke personalised ceremony that reflects the values of the couple involved, that they share with the celebrant and that is built around them. “That is why there is a need for legal recognition to be extended to humanist marriages, so that couples can enjoy such a wonderful start to married life, free from discrimination while doing so.” Outside court, Lacole said: “We hope that we get a good verdict which means that we can have the wedding ceremony that we want to have. If we don’t get it, we want to appeal so we can give other people the opportunity to have the wedding ceremony that they want.” O’Kane and Lacole, a vice-chair of Atheists NI, have invited 250 guests to their wedding. “It will be a traditional wedding in a venue that has sentimental value for us. I’ll be wearing a white dress and there’ll be bridesmaids and a page boy,” Lacole told the Guardian. “It’s been a lot of stress to organise the wedding and take on a legal case at the same time. I’m optimistic, our case is solid, and I can’t see any just reason not to be given legal recognition. We don’t want to take rights away from anyone else, we just want our beliefs recognised. You hold your beliefs dear, it’s how you define and interpret your life. We just want a wedding that embodies our beliefs.” Judgment was reserved."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2017/may/26/green-party-election-campaign-john-crace-digested-week","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-05-26T15:01:27Z","webTitle":"In a difficult week, the Green party shows that all you need is love | John Crace","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/may/26/green-party-election-campaign-john-crace-digested-week","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/may/26/green-party-election-campaign-john-crace-digested-week","fields":{"headline":"In a difficult week, the Green party shows that all you need is love","bodyText":"Monday I almost didn’t make it to the launch of the Green party manifesto because, after negotiating a futuristic lift that seemed to decide my destination for me, I was tipped out on to the fourth floor of a swanky Soho office building and expected to negotiate a narrow walkway with a 50ft (15 metre) drop on either side. Not good for someone who suffers from vertigo. But after giving myself a stern talking to, I made it across and was glad I did. The launch couldn’t have been more different from those of the Conservatives and Labour. It took place in a tiny meeting space – the beanbags (this was Soho) had been stacked up by the window – that could only hold 10 Green activists along with the co-leaders, Caroline Lucas and Jonathan Bartley, and was relaxed and informal. Lucas spoke of “living in, learning from and loving the other 27 EU members”. She is the first politician I have heard use the word love throughout this election campaign. I may be going soft, but if I lived in the Brighton Pavilion constituency, I could vote for love. Tuesday One of the points of Ariana Grande is that people such as me shouldn’t have heard of her. She represents a rung on the transition towards adulthood, a symbol to young girls that they have lives and identities separate from their parents. My daughter has long since climbed that ladder, but I still remember taking her to a recording of a Saturday morning live TV show at which her favourite band, Steps, were miming to their latest hit. I found the whole thing excruciating – not the music, but watching my daughter wanting to dance with the other girls in the audience but being too shy and standing on her own near the back. A Kylie gig in Hammersmith some years later was far more successful, as my daughter stood on her seat and danced along along with hundreds of other teenage girls and almost as many gay men. It wasn’t such a good night for her younger brother, who had insisted he didn’t want to be left at home. After about half an hour, he curled up on the floor and went to sleep. Wednesday The Japanese island of Gunkanjima, near the coast of Nagasaki, was the world’s most densely inhabited place in the 1950s, with almost 6,000 people working in a single coal mine crammed on to a piece of rock measuring less than 1 sq km. Once the coal ran out and Mitsubishi closed the mine, everyone left and the island, known to locals as Midori nashi Shima (island without green), became a ghost town. Not any more. Although there is still no one living there and many of the concrete buildings have long since become rubble, there are signs of life. Bits of greenery that hadn’t seen the light of day for well over half a century have started to appear. Grass grows through the cracks and shrubs and trees have also managed to take root, having either lain dormant or been blown in by the wind. Two years ago, Gunkanjima was declared a Unesco world heritage site. At times such as these, it is good to remember that renewal is possible. Thursday Ever since my father died after failing to come round from a heart operation in 1999, I have read everything I can get my hands on about cardiac surgery. In part as a guilty pleasure, but also, if the genetics play out, as a window into my own mortality. This year, there have been particularly rich pickings. First was Stephen Westaby’s Fragile Lives, a heart surgeon’s candid account of the operations that defined his career, ones that went well and others that ended badly, and the patients he has been unable to forget. It made for a compelling read, if not always an easy one. Rather more upbeat, though equally gripping, was Thomas Morris’s The Matter of the Heart – A History of the Heart in Eleven Operations, which details the breathtaking advances that have been made in the past 100 years. Some conditions that were invariably fatal can now sometimes be treated as day cases. Often it has been a trial and error, numbers game, dependent on the brilliance and arrogance of a single surgeon. It’s possible even that my Dad died so I may not have to. No son could ask for more. Friday Politicians are often accused of lacking vision, but two readers have drawn my attention to the Ukip candidate Aidan Powlesland, who is standing in the South Suffolk constituency. Under the heading the Starry Firmament on his campaign leaflet, Powlesland calls for a “£40m interstellar, nano-probe fleet design (potential customer Yuri Milner)”, £60m to be spent on an “interstellar diasporanet” – me neither – £100m to fund an interstellar colony ship and £1bn for “the first company that can, by 2026, profitably mine the asteroid belt, Jovian or Saturnian moons for platinum and water”. I’m not sure whether these are official Ukip policy – although they are no weirder than some of the stuff in its manifesto – but no one can accuse the party of lacking blue skies thinking. Or even deep skies thinking.

Early in the book, Royle (the author, not the character) kills off the critic mid-sentence. Shortly afterwards, Royle (the character) has a threesome with Osmer’s beautiful girlfriend, Lily (“the dark-complexioned young beauty”) and his own (beautiful, obviously) wife, Portia, whose “still pert … breasts” are “full but small”. This all takes place at a literary party at Royle’s “fine and rambling 18th-century property” near Cuckmere Haven. And there’s more. In An English Guide to Birdwatching – as in real life – there are two writers called Nicholas Royle, their books mixed up together on Amazon as though they were one person (they seem, on at least one occasion, to have commented on one another’s books; the other Royle also contributed a key paragraph to this novel). Some of their books, and even their reviews, are mentioned in this novel, which also features several real‑life literary figures and books. The plot concerns the possible theft, by Royle, of a short story about gulls. Here, “Gulls” is written by a retired funeral director called Silas Woodlock, and appears, credited to Royle, in a book called Murmurations: An Anthology of Uncanny Stories About Birds. Woodlock happens upon a copy some months after having accidentally left his typescript in a pub, and sets out to walk to Royle’s house, intent on revenge. Murmurations actually exists in real life, and was edited by one of the two Royles. “My work is digressive, and it is progressive too – and at the same time,” wrote Laurence Sterne in Tristram Shandy, surely one of the models for this novel. The narrative spins off in all sorts of digressions, Royle giving us six pages on the moments between sitting down in a restaurant and ordering a meal. “We are icebergs. We never get the measure of others or ourselves,” the narrator interrupts his characters’ intricate thought processes to intone. “The sound we make as we collide we hardly start to hear. The speed at which we are melting we quite fail to see. And then, before the unfolding of a single napkin, the conversation … resumed.” An English Guide to Birdwatching is littered with the kind of infelicities Professor Nicholas Royle’s MA/PhD programme in creative and critical writing at the University of Sussex surely renders impossible to commit. The instability of that narratorial voice; the clumsy shifts in point of view; the decorative female characters; the exposition; the inelegant use of adjectives (“the vehicle crashed into the rocky shore”), the needless variation of pronouns (“the literary theorist”; “the younger man”). They can only be deliberate, yet another part of this novel’s elaborate game; nevertheless, they grate. “I dream about the idea of a hide,” the literary theorist Royle explains to the other Royle early on in this novel (though perhaps this has occurred in real life, too – who knows). “The idea of a text that would hide, that would be a hide, a place from which to look out and look in, a secret place… a kind of screened-off or embedded space within a novel.” He is referring to the 17 essays of varying length embedded in this novel, covering everything from the banking crisis to birdwatching etiquette; he’s also indicating that his book isn’t, as it might seem, a wish-fulfilment fantasy, a partial roman-à-clef, a (deliberately?) overwritten farce or a metafictional bagatelle. Greater forces are at work. But however unconventional An English Guide to Birdwatching may be, it must satisfy; to fail to do so, as this novel does, is to commit the cardinal sin of self-indulgence. “To write a book is for all the world like humming a song,” wrote Sterne. “Be but in tune with yourself … ’tis no matter how high or how low you take it.” Royle’s muddled novel hovers uncomfortably between arch postmodern exercise and mid-life fever dream, never striking a consistent note. Once more with feeling, this comparatively conventional novelist says. • Melissa Harrison is the author of At Hawthorn Time (Bloomsbury). An English Guide to Birdwatching is published by Myriad.

In 2011 14-year-old Wong and his Scholarism movement managed to defeat an effort to make China’s communist National Education curriculum mandatory in Hong Kong schools through the power of peaceful protest. It was the first victory an activist group managed in the territory since it came under Chinese rule in 1997, when Wong was a year old. If Wong had cashed his chips in there and then his story might have made for a pleasing if fairly minor documentary. But, as this absorbing new Netflix film shows, he instead got involved in a far more significant battle: over the democratic future of Hong Kong itself. In 2014 Scholarism became part of the wider Umbrella movement, the Occupy-style group set up to protest a refusal by China to allow Hong Kong to elect their own leaders. Officially the country is afforded a relaxed position within the One China policy, permitted to maintain its present capitalist form for 50 years as part of the handover deal made between China and the UK. Yet, there has been a perceived ratcheting up of influence by Beijing in recent times, prompting a more robust response from those opposed to China’s control, particularly from younger citizens like Wong who see Hong Kong’s semi-autonomy as central to their identity. Teenager vs Superpower does a solid job of contextualising this larger ideological battle, with talking heads and archive footage, but it’s always clear that the focus here is Wong. He’s a remarkable figure perhaps because, on the surface he seems so unremarkable - a gawky teen in oversized clothes from a lower-middle class background who nevertheless manages to rouse people with his energy and plain speaking. His ‘wunderkind’ status helps too of course – one commentator here compares him with Joan of Arc for his ability to enter a complex adult conflict and resolve it with youthful simplicity. While Teenager vs. Superpower is often as in thrall to Wong as his followers, director Joe Piscatella does also allow for some dissenting voices who see Wong’s celebrity presence as detrimental to the larger movement. One accuses him of hijacking the protests and there’s a sense that his adolescent impetuousness might cost him dearly in the end. Rallying cries like “it’s time for total war” are unlikely to be received warmly by those in Beijing, and Joshua is aware of the parlous situation he’s created for himself when, at one point in the documentary he notes, “I can’t ensure I will not be disappeared in the future.” For the time being China seem to be adopting a softly softly approach to Wong and indeed the larger protest movement inside Hong Kong. As the documentary progresses – and it’s worth issuing a spoiler warning here for those who don’t want to be broadsided by details of widely reported real-life events – we see the Umbrella Protests falter and ultimately fail, not because of a Tiananmen Square-style crackdown, but as a result of apathy and fatigue on the part of its participants. Even a hunger strike by Wong, when his camp is finally dismantled by police, isn’t enough to reinvigorate the movement. Ultimately, even Scholarism feels forced to call it a day. That would of course make for a pretty downbeat coda to an otherwise rousing documentary – not to mention wildly out of character from Wong – and encouragingly things end with him and several other members of Scholarism forming a new political entity, Demonsisto, and plotting to run for political office. The fight. for Hong Kong’s future is far from over, and it seems that Joshua is going to be a major player in it."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"film/2017/may/30/wonder-woman-review-gal-gadot-reduced-to-weaponised-smurfette","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2017-05-30T10:19:26Z","webTitle":"Wonder Woman review – glass ceiling still intact as Gal Gadot reduced to weaponised Smurfette","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/may/30/wonder-woman-review-gal-gadot-reduced-to-weaponised-smurfette","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2017/may/30/wonder-woman-review-gal-gadot-reduced-to-weaponised-smurfette","fields":{"headline":"Wonder Woman review – glass ceiling still intact as Gal Gadot reduced to weaponised Smurfette","bodyText":"Those hoping a shot of oestrogen would generate a new kind of comic-book movie – and revive DC’s faltering movie universe – might need to lower their expectations. Like many people out there, I had no shortage of excitement and goodwill towards this female-led superhero project, but in the event it’s plagued by the same problems that dragged down previous visits to the DC movie world: over-earnestness, bludgeoning special effects, and a messy, often wildly implausible plot. What promised to be a glass-ceiling-smashing blockbuster actually looks more like a future camp classic. Things begin well enough, as our heroine, Diana (nobody ever calls her Wonder Woman), casts her mind back to her childhood on Themyscira, the hidden island of the Amazons. This tribe of athletic, leather-clad female warriors live in a bubble of classical antiquity, oblivious to the opposite sex and the first world war that rages outside. Diana’s mother, Hippolyta (Connie Nielsen), explains the mythology to her with the aid of a sort of ancient Greek iPad: how the Amazons were created by Zeus to resist Ares, the god of war (who is still at large), and how she sculpted Diana from clay – which you can believe when she grows up to be statuesque Israeli actor Gal Gadot. Confusingly, Diana later explains that “men are essential for procreation but when it comes to pleasure, unnecessary”. Before we can ponder the finer details of this Sapphic utopia, though, the menfolk literally crash the party. A plane piloted by an American spy (Chris Pine) plunges into the sea, a flotilla of Germans close behind. After one of the most agreeably bizarre action scenes ever staged – a beachfront battle-of-the-sexes between men with guns and pirouetting women with bows and arrows – Diana is compelled to enter “the world of men” and stop the war, aided by her sword, shield and magic lasso. It really is the world of men. Arriving in London, Diana is bewildered by her sisters’ subjugation, not to mention their impractical attire. Lucy Davis provides some comic relief and female companionship, but moustaches bristle when Diana attempts to join in the men-only war meetings. What’s worse, Pine repeatedly sees fit to call the shots and boss her about, despite the fact that she’s clearly his physical and intellectual superior. This gender imbalance could have been the basis for some patriarchy-upending subversion, or at least some romcom sparks, but both avenues go unexplored. Instead, the film feels obliged to give Pine his own equally heroic story arc. Men might be unnecessary for pleasure, but they’re still essential for big-budget action movies, it seems. They pick up three more males on their way to the front: an Arab, a Scot and a Native American. If it feels like the setup to a joke, the punchline never arrives. By the time this ragtag league of nations reaches the trenches, poor Diana has been reduced to a weaponised Smurfette. The modish action sequences jerk between speeded-up and slowed-down to catch every detail of her defence-based fighting style and flawless, mud-free complexion. She fixes the war in a matter of minutes. Think what might have been avoided if she’d turned up a few years earlier! But there’s something rather distasteful about co-opting trench warfare as the backdrop to a sanitised, hyper-stylised fantasy. I couldn’t help thinking of Kendall Jenner’s disastrous “protest chic” Pepsi ad. And when Gadot is called upon to communicate the horrors of war moments later, reeling around dazed and confused in a haze of orange poison gas, it’s a moment of Zoolander-esque silliness that brings home how weightless the whole story has become. Gadot is entirely credible as the embodiment of Amazonian perfection, but there’s only so much emotion her concerted brow-furrowing can convey. Yes, yes, I know: “It’s only a comic-book movie.” And on the level of big-budget trash, Wonder Woman is great fun. But there were hopes for something more. Perhaps there were too many rewrites and personnel changes (director Patty Jenkins was drafted in after the first choice left; while all five credited writers and eight of the 10 producers are male). Perhaps DC struggled to find territory arch-rivals Marvel hadn’t already claimed. They covered the mythical-deity-out-of-water angle with Thor, and the superhero-joins-the-war-effort with Captain America. In Wonder Woman, they had something none of their rivals had – a bona-fide brand-name female superhero – but in trying to work out what to do with her, they seem to have lost their way. She journeys from a land without men and winds up stranded in no man’s land."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"business/2017/may/26/ifs-tells-uk-voters-choice-between-undeliverable-unworkable-conservatives-labour-","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-05-26T12:32:34Z","webTitle":"IFS to voters: you have a choice between the 'undeliverable' or 'unworkable'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/may/26/ifs-tells-uk-voters-choice-between-undeliverable-unworkable-conservatives-labour-","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2017/may/26/ifs-tells-uk-voters-choice-between-undeliverable-unworkable-conservatives-labour-","fields":{"headline":"IFS to voters: you have a choice between the 'undeliverable' or 'unworkable'","bodyText":"A plague on both your houses. That, put simply, is the considered view of the Institute for Fiscal Studies on the tax and spending pledges made by the Conservative and Labour parties in their election manifestos. There was, the IFS noted, a real choice for voters on 8 June, marking quite a change from recent elections. But it was a choice between the undeliverable on the part of the Tories and the unworkable from Labour. Even by the IFS’s exacting standards, it was a withering assessment. Theresa May’s pitch to the public is more of the same. More austerity, more welfare cuts and a balanced budget by the middle of the next decade – 10 years later than originally planned. If the idea behind providing few costed pledges in the Conservative manifesto was designed to provide the IFS with less to attack, the strategy didn’t work. The thinktank says May’s spending plans will put real pressure on public services, and in particular extend to 12 years what is comfortably the most severe squeeze on the NHS since it was founded in 1948. At a time when demographic and technological change is pushing up the cost of providing healthcare, the IFS says the average increase in the NHS budget between 2010 – when David Cameron became prime minister – and 2022-23 will be 1.4% a year on average, and just 1.2% a year from 2016-17 onwards. Hence the IFS’s concern that the Conservative plans are not deliverable. Labour is planning to be more generous, but not by much. Over the past 60 years, the NHS budget has increased in real (inflation-adjusted) terms by 4.1% a year. Labour’s proposed increase would be half that. The IFS gives the prime minister half a cheer for making an attempt to get to grip with the cost of an ageing population. But it notes that the scrapping of the triple lock on the state pension and the means-testing of the winter fuel allowance would make a trivial difference to spending. As for social care, the IFS’s deputy director, Carl Emmerson, said that they seemed to be in “a state of flux” following this week’s U-turn on capping costs. A state of flux is IFS-speak for complete shambles. Labour lost its hard-won economic credibility by virtue of being in power during the global financial crisis and has struggled to get it back. The latest attempt involves an increase of almost £50bn a year in day-to-day government spending paid for by equivalent increases in tax. Infrastructure spending would rise by £250bn over the next 10 years funded by higher borrowing. The IFS doesn’t have that much of a problem with borrowing for public investment when interest rates are historically low, noting that it could boost growth in the short- and the long-term if used wisely. The same, though, can’t be said of the plans for day-to-day spending, where the thinktank is clear that the plan for paying for an expansion in state activity “would not work”. Labour’s tax proposals would raise at most £40bn a year, the IFS said, and probably less than that. The thinktank says the party’s £49bn tax calculation involves factual mistakes, optimistic assumptions and unspecified tax increases. The plans would see the size of the state increase to a level not seen in 30 years, the IFS said. This, in itself, would not be an issue, since it would bring Britain into line with many other advanced economies. The issue is how to pay for it. “If [Labour] want the advantages of a bigger state they should be willing to candidly set out the consequences – higher taxation affecting broad segments of the population.” Indeed, this is the gripe the IFS has with both parties. The Tories would shrink the state; Labour would expand it. If the opinion polls are to be believed, Labour’s “soak the rich” approach has gone down rather better than “more of the same” from the Conservatives. But neither, according to the IFS, is being entirely straight with the public about how their quite different visions would be realised."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2017/may/27/donald-trump-decision-paris-climate-deal","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-05-27T16:01:52Z","webTitle":"Donald Trump will make 'final decision' on Paris climate deal next week","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/may/27/donald-trump-decision-paris-climate-deal","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/may/27/donald-trump-decision-paris-climate-deal","fields":{"headline":"Donald Trump will make 'final decision' on Paris climate deal next week","bodyText":"Donald Trump has resisted pressure from Europe, Canada and Japan to declare his support for the UN’s landmark climate change treaty signed in Paris in 2015, marking a defiant end to his first international trip as US president. The deadlock at the end of the G7 summit in Italy left other world leaders frustrated. The German chancellor Angela Merkel said the discussions “had been very difficult and not to say very unsatisfactory. She added: “Here we have a situation of six against one, meaning there is still no sign of whether the US will remain in the Paris accord or not.” Instead, six of the seven nations used a communique at the end of the meetings to assert their commitment to implement the Paris plan, leaving Trump to tweet that he will decide next week whether the US will join them in their pledge. The US president announced his forthcoming decision on Saturday morning, on the final day of his first international trip as president. “I will make my final decision on the Paris accord next week!” he tweeted from Sicily. During the two-day conclave in Taormina, other leaders repeatedly urged Trump to recognise that as world’s second biggest carbon emitter, the US had to show leadership on climate issues. Emmanuel Macron, the French president, said he had seen progress on climate change at G7, but revealed he had told Trump he would be making an error and ceding ground to China if he did not stick with the Paris accord. Macron said: “It is essential for international equilibrium and the reputation of America that it remains engaged with the Paris treaty. The G7 had shown issues such as climate change are not side issues that can be left to others.” He refused to speculate on the US decision, but he said: “Trump was a good listener, a pragmatic guy and open to debate.” The Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, said he was not going to lecture any country, but he added: “You cannot build a strong economic future unless you are protective and mindful of the climate.” Others warned the US president that he risks a stampede, as others in the 195-nation agreement use American withdrawal from the treaty to reduce their own commitments. Trump retained the option of pulling out of the treaty altogether or, more likely, scaling back on the specific commitments made by the Obama administration. Obama pledged to cut domestic greenhouse gas emissions 26%-28 % below 2005 levels by 2025. Computer simulations suggest earth temperatures could rise by as much 0.2C if the US pulled out of the UN treaty altogether. Feverish negotiations by G7 officials until 3am on Saturday failed to forge a closer consensus, reviving the era when George W Bush was alone among G7 leaders in expressing scepticism about climate change. The White House had signalled at the start of Trump’s tour of the Middle East and Europe that the US would not make a decision on climate change until after the summit, but other G7 leaders, such as Merkel and Macron, hoped they could collectively persuade Trump to commit to the principles of the Paris accord. During the presidential campaign Trump railed against the damage the Paris deal would inflict on traditional US industry. At the summit, his aides said that although his own views were evolving, he would always put the interests of US industry first. In an assertion of US unilateral power, Trump also forced the Italian prime minister Paulo Gentiloni – the summit host – to shred plans for an ambitious statement stressing the plight of migrants was a global rather than regional responsibility. Italy had chosen Sicily as the venue for the summit as the symbolic bridge between Europe and Africa. As many as 200,000 migrants are due to reach Italy this year from Libya, and already more than 1,300 have drowned seeking to make the crossing. During the two-day summit in Taormina, the Libyan capital Tripoli has seen more than 50 deaths in militia infighting, Egypt has twice bombed alleged Islamist training camps in southern Libya, and more than 2,000 refugees have crossed the Mediterranean to the Italian mainland, with scores drowning. Italy had planned a five-page G7 statement on human mobility, stressing migrants’ rights, their positive contribution to host nations and the threat they faced from traffickers. Instead the final statement highlighted the right of nation states to secure their borders, and set migration targets. Trump also shot down Italian plans on African food security, days after the White House revealed plans to cut American foreign aid by a third. In 2015 the G7 committed to lift 500 million people out of famine and malnutrition, but instead famines have spread in Africa. Friederike Röder, director at ONE, the aid charity, said: “In a year of greatly-diminished expectations, the G7 have managed to set a new low. The early promise of this summit was crushed by the Trump administration’s hostile negotiating posture and the evident lack of ambition.” Trump did concede some ground in the final leader’s statement by signing up to a pledge to oppose protectionism. His aides insist he wants free, fair and reciprocal trade. In a win for the Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe, the statement was expected to repeat a pledge from the Japanese hosted summit in 2016 to respect a rules based multilateral trade system embodied in the WTO. But Trump still intends to target German trade practices and its surplus, a stance resented by Merkel. At the end of the summit, Trump chose to give no closing press conference, presumably to avoid questions on whether he knew of his son-in-law Jared Kushner’s reported plans to set up a secret communications channel with Russia. Trump instead chose to address US forces stationed in Sicily, reprising the themes of his first foreign trip and making no mention of the climate change dispute. He said simply that he had staged a series of productive meetings with his allies at the G7, but again opened fire on Nato nations for failing to spend enough on defense, claiming contributions were starting to rise in a way they would not but for his election. Accompanied by his wife, Trump often cut an uneasy, even glowering figure in Sicily. His aides insisted he had not sought to dominate the discussions and had enjoyed the free-flowing conversations, likening them to a family dinner. Economic adviser Gary Cohn said: “He came here to learn. He came here to get smart. His views are evolving which exactly as they should be.” The two days, along with the mini Nato summit in Brussels on Thursday, were seen as a chance for Trump to define his “America First” slogan, and test its compatibility with multilateral institutions such as the G7. At one point, Trump was seen ostentatiously not wearing translation headphones as Gentiloni led a discussion on African growth."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/live/2017/may/27/arsenal-v-chelsea-2017-fa-cup-final-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-05-27T18:51:01Z","webTitle":"Arsenal 2-1 Chelsea: 2017 FA Cup final – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2017/may/27/arsenal-v-chelsea-2017-fa-cup-final-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/live/2017/may/27/arsenal-v-chelsea-2017-fa-cup-final-live","fields":{"headline":"Arsenal 2-1 Chelsea: 2017 FA Cup final – as it happened","bodyText":"Here’s Daniel Taylor’s match report from Wembley: Arsenal lift the 2017 FA Cup! The club captain Laurent Koscielny shares the honour with Per Mertesacker, who was outstanding today. He hadn’t started a game in 392 days, and then played like that. Astonishing! The ticker tape comes down on the parade, as everyone takes their turn in lifting the old pot. It’s just reward: they were all magnificent. Chelsea by contrast weren’t at the races, uncharacteristically outfoxed and outfought. Seems doubles aren’t so easy to land after all, and Antonio Conte still hasn’t won a final as manager. Still, their brilliant league season will keep them warm at night when today’s disappointment fades. But this is all about Arsenal, record 13-time winners of the cup, and Arsene Wenger: the greatest FA Cup manager of all time. Arsene Wenger speaks! “It was an outstanding performance from the first minute onwards. This team has suffered, united, and responded. I said last week this team will win the championship with one or two good buys, and keep them together. They showed strength and we played spectacular football today to win the game. I am very proud [to win seven FA Cups] because you see the fight you need even to win one. I am proud of doing two things that have never been done: to win a championship without losing a game, and to win seven FA Cups. It is not easy, believe me.” And will he be here next season? “We have a board meeting on Tuesday, and all will be clear on Wednesday or Thursday.” Aaron Ramsey, who can file today’s winner alongside the one he scored against Hull in 2014, speaks! “It’s been an up-and-down season, but to finish it with an FA Cup has to make it a successful one. I just love this competition. The boys deserve it, and I’m happy for the manger, I’m delighted. He’s been fantastic for me, fantastic for these players. Fair play to him, he’s changed the system and it’s paid off. So hopefully he’ll be here next season, because we owe him a lot.” Wenger allows a huge grin to play across his face. After all the flak he’s taken this season, this is lovely to see. He’s warmly congratulated by Conte, sportsmanship in full effect. And then he’s embraced by his players, who were to a man beyond excellent today, and richly deserve their success. Chelsea - the brilliant English champions - simply weren’t allowed to strut their stuff today. Arsenal did a comprehensive number on them ... and now the famous old north London club stands as the most successful in the history of the oldest club competition in the world. A simply wonderful final comes to an end! Arsenal win their 13th FA Cup, most deservedly so: they’ve been brilliant today. And that’s their manager’s seventh. That Arsene Wenger, he’s not half bad, huh? 90 min +3: The man-of-the-match Sanchez is replaced by Elneny. 90 min +2: Bellerin hammers a clearance up the right flank. Ozil throws another outrageous dummy to buy a load more time. 90 min +1: The free kick’s taken quickly. Ozil is found clear on the edge of the box! But he pauses before shooting, and Kante nicks the ball off him. 90 min +1: Sanchez dribbles down the left and purchases a cheap free kick off Batshuayi. Tick, tock, tick, tock. 90 min: Giroud takes down a high ball on the edge of the Chelsea box, and instantly turns it round the corner, down the right channel for Ramsey. He’s in, but his shot is not good. Chelsea will have four minutes to save themselves. 88 min: The corner comes to nothing. Batshuayi comes on for Costa. 87 min: And how did this stay out?!?! Ozil enters the Chelsea area from the right, sells Cahill an outrageous dummy, and free, eight yards out, hammers a low shot off the base of the right-hand post. The ball comes back off Courtois, and out for a corner. Wow! 86 min: Kante shoots from distance. Nope. Mertesacker looks to chest and clear, but he’s barged out of the road by Costa, who slaps hard goalwards. Ospina somehow parries, and the ball’s cleared. How was that not a goal?! 85 min: Bellerin backs himself in a footrace with Luiz, knocking the ball past the Chelsea defender and breezing into the box. He shoots low, hard, across Courtois and inches wide of the left-hand post. You wouldn’t bet too much money on this ending 2-1, would you. 83 min: Coquelin wastes no time in getting himself booked, after kicking the ball away after conceding a garden-variety free kick in the centre circle. This match has been gloriously bonkers. 82 min: Willian takes the set piece himself. Luiz races in at the near post, but can only plant his header well wide of the target. Arsenal make another change, removing Oxlade-Chamberlain and sending on Coquelin. 81 min: Willian skips down the right wing and passes a tiring Xhaka. The Arsenal man tugs the winger’s shirt, and goes in the book. This is a free kick that’s basically a corner. Giroud’s first act is to latch onto a Sanchez pass down the left and chip it into the middle, where Ramsey sends a downward header into the bottom right! Arsenal, almost immediately, are back in front! What drama here, to borrow some BBC commentary from the 1979 five-minute final! 78 min: Arsenal respond by sending on Giroud for Welbeck. Out of nothing! Chelsea ping it around awhile. Willian, dropping deep, pings the ball towards Costa, 12 yards out and level with the left-hand post. He taps it to his right, past Holding, and hooks a slow shot goalwards. It takes a nick off Mertesacker, but should still be saved by Ospina. But it squeaks into the bottom left! All in super-slow motion! Brilliant opportunism by Costa! 75 min: Chelsea are keeping busy and scurrying around quite a lot, but passes aren’t quite sticking in the final third. It’s been that sort of day for them. So far. “After Arsene introduces David Moyes, can he say ‘Wenger out’, drop the mic Obama style and stride off to the stadium speakers blasting Ennio Morricone?” wonders Andy Gordon. 74 min: Hazard makes good down the right and earns a corner. Cahill gets up to win a captain’s header, but only succeeds in skittling his pal Luiz and sending the ball high and wide. 73 min: Chelsea are a goal and a man down, and the clock is no longer their friend. Accordingly, Pedro is replaced by Willian. 71 min: Oxlade-Chamberlain reaches the byline out on the left. He can’t find the angle to shoot, so cuts back for Sanchez, whose effort is blocked. Arsenal come again, and this time Oxlade-Chamberlain blasts wildly over the bar from distance. Chelsea are reeling right now. 70 min: And there Chelsea were, pressing Arsenal back. Now Arsenal have a renewed spring in their step. 68 min: This is rank stupidity from Moses. He skitters inside from the right and into the Arsenal area. He drops a shoulder to pass Oxlade-Chamberlain, and should have a dig, but instead goes to ground under a non-existent challenge. For a second the Chelsea fans celebrate a penalty; then the Arsenal fans celebrate the fifth sending off in an FA Cup final, because that’s his second booking in 11 minutes. The champions are up against it now! 67 min: Chelsea begin to press Arsenal back, but to little effect. Here’s Matt Dony’s prediction: “An Arsenal victory, followed by Wenger taking the mic and announcing his retirement, and introducing David Moyes as ‘Your new manager.’” Neutrals: you’d pay good money, wouldn’t you. 65 min: Ramsey and Welbeck combine crisply down the left to cause Chelsea concern. Welbeck enters the area and rolls the ball across for Bellerin, romping in from the right. Bellerin looks to guide one into the bottom left, but his sidefoot is snaffled by Courtois. Chelsea stream upfield, Fabregas having a wild slash at the ball from the edge of the box. This continues to be an FA Cup final of free-flowing, open, devil-may-care attacking entertainment. How we’ve only had one goal is a mystery. 63 min: Some brilliance from Ozil out on the right. He scampers after a ball near the touchline, and sells Cahill a subtle dummy with a drop of the shoulder before he’s even taken up possession. Then he very nearly releases Welbeck down the middle with an outside-of-foot low curler. Just a bit too much juice on it. 61 min: A corner for Arsenal out on the right doesn’t lead to very much. But they come straight back at Chelsea, Oxlade-Chamberlain twisting down the left and nearly creating an opening. After a slow start to the second half, Arsenal are beginning to threaten again. Chelsea respond by replacing Matic with the former Arsenal captain Fabregas. His reception is mixed, much as you’d imagine. 59 min: Matic sprays a stunning diagonal pass towards Moses out on the right. Moses cuts inside and feeds Pedro, who tries to curl one into the bottom left. Ospina is rooted, and he’d have been beaten were the shot on target. But it’s wide left, and a goal kick. Arsenal make their way up the other end, and once again tease a booking out of Chelsea, Kante clipping Ramsey late and seeing yellow. 57 min: A right-wing probe by Azpilicueta causes a bit of trouble in the Arsenal box. It leads to a corner which comes to naught. Welbeck tries to break up the other end, and is hauled back by Moses out on the left wing. That’s a booking. 55 min: ... Arsenal break upfield with Chelsea light at the back. Bellerin is in acres down the right, and he’s got men in the middle. But the cross is dismal, and Courtois can gather ahead of Sanchez and Welbeck. Arsenal could easily have scored five or six goals so far. Nobody’s perfect, but they should certainly have scored more than one. Will they be made to pay for their failure to convert dominance into goals? 54 min: Costa has a yard on Holding as the two chase a long ball down the left. Holding clips the striker’s ankle, just to the side of the area, and is booked. A free kick in a very dangerous position. Hazard flicks the set piece towards the far post, where Luiz lurks. Mertesacker eyebrows out for a corner on the right. From which... 52 min: Chelsea look much sharper since the restart. Moses cuts in from the right and has a belt that’s dealt with well by Ospina. Then Costa bustles in from the same flank but is hounded out of it by Monreal, who wins a free kick for good measure. A good old-fashioned scrap, and Costa responds by grabbing the ball and thinking about lancing it into the crowd in a majestic fit of pique. He catches himself in time. 50 min: Hazard, on the right-hand corner of the Arsenal area, flicks the ball inside for Costa, who will surely latch onto it and fire home. But Mertesacker slides in brilliantly to intercept, and even wins the goal kick by deflecting the ball off the Chelsea striker. Mertesacker hasn’t started a game for 392 days! 49 min: Chelsea ping it around in a pretty fashion. They’ve clearly had a rocket from Conte. Kante shoots from 25 yards, a rising swerver that threatens to fox Ospina and find the top right. But the keeper claims well. 48 min: They’re on the front foot now, though. Pedro tears down the left with extreme prejudice. He drops a shoulder to glide inside, and looks to curl one into the bottom right. Mertesacker sticks out a peg to block. Good football all round. 47 min: Chelsea enjoy two minutes of sterile possession. They’re not exactly on the front foot, but it’s a statement of sorts after their strangely meek and obedient first-half performance. And we’re off again! No changes. Welbeck gets the ball rolling for the second half. Half-time entertainment: A perambulation down Memory Lane, anyone? And that’s that for the first half. Arsenal have been magnificent, and should be more than one goal ahead. But they’re not, and this is perfectly poised. Chelsea aren’t going to take this lying down, are they? It’s going to be fun finding out! 45 min +2: Well over the bar. Sums up Chelsea’s performance so far. 45 min +1: There will be two added minutes tacked onto the end of this first half. And Monreal foolishly shoves Pedro in the back, just to the right of the D. A chance for Alonso to take a whack at goal. 45 min: Hazard and Costa nearly combine to open Arsenal up down the middle. Not quite. The ball pinballs around the box awhile, and for a second it looks as though Costa will pick up the pieces and get a shot in, but Ramsey closes him down well. 43 min: BREAKING NEWS: Ozil tracks back half the length of the pitch to make a tackle. 41 min: Oxlade-Chamberlain slides in on Moses, 30 yards from the Arsenal goal. A clumsy free kick to concede, and a chance for Chelsea to load the box. The champions do exactly that, but what was the point, because Costa is immediately penalised for some needless shoving. Does that exchange qualify as a lull? Only we’re nearly halfway through, and there’s been no lull. 39 min: Hazard embarks on a baroque ramble down the right, draws a couple of men, then flicks forward for Pedro, who takes one step into the Arsenal area and hoicks high over the bar. Snatched and panicky. 38 min: Chelsea do a bit of probing but they can’t find any gaps in this makeshift Arsenal defence. They have at least turned up the energy levels, so low in the early exchanges. 36 min: Bellerin slides a gorgeous ball down the right, and suddenly Sanchez is skittering towards the Chelsea area free! But he dribbles himself wide, and with Cahill over to cover, can’t get a shot away. He really should have done much better. Arsenal will be wondering how they’ve only scored one. 35 min: Hazard drops deep in an attempt to get things moving for Chelsea. His rolled ball down the middle very nearly releases Costa. Wembley is bubbling away; the 90,000 are enjoying this supreme entertainment. 33 min: ... and for a second, it looks as though Hazard is going to dance into the Arsenal box down the right. The excellent Monreal snuffs out the attack. Good luck in calling how this final is going to pan out, because it’s a free-flowing, open, wonderful mess, with both teams committed to madcap attack and to hell with the consequences. Magnificent! 32 min: A free kick sent into the Chelsea box from the left by Sanchez is only half cleared. Xhaka, on the right-hand edge of the D, volleys towards the bottom right. Courtois tips round the post, and deals with the resulting corner. He sets Chelsea away on the counter ... 30 min: Arsenal skedaddle up the other end, and suddenly Welbeck is set free down the left by Bellerin, finding himself free on the left-hand corner of the six-yard box! He clips the ball inside, in the hope of setting up Ramsay for a tap-in. Instead, it looks like squeezing into the corner, but Cahill once again clears off the line. This is absurd! 29 min: Pedro, deep on the right, sprays a wonderful diagonal pass towards Costa, who gets the run on Holding. He’s suddenly free in the box, albeit under a lot of pressure from Holding behind. And Ospina’s coming out to spread himself. The keeper deflects the eventual shot out for a corner on the left, and takes Costa’s boot upside his head for the trouble. Totally accidental. He’s up and about soon enough, and the corner comes to nothing. 27 min: Welbeck tries to break upfield when a Chelsea attack falls apart. Kante comes across to put a stop to his gallop with a cynical leg. The referee isn’t interested in booking the player of the year, but you’ve seen them given. Welbeck doesn’t look particularly pleased about the non-decision. 25 min: Matic tries to release Costa down he middle, but the pass isn’t up to much. Moses wins a throw deep down the Chelsea right. But the ball’s soon shuttled all the way back to Luiz on the halfway line. Chelsea still can’t quite find their rhythm. 24 min: Pedro comes through the back of Xhaka and is slightly fortunate to escape censure. To be fair, Arsenal don’t make very much of it. 22 min: Matic, with his long legs, makes like Ian Ormondroyd and dances down the middle with some ball-on-string skill. He flicks the ball down the left channel for Costa, but the striker can’t quite get his shot away. Mertesacker gets the credit for a fine tackle. A few signs that Chelsea are slowly coming to life, though. 21 min: Costa and Kante get busy in the Arsenal half, attempting to shift Chelsea up a couple of gears. Kante slips the ball wide to Moses, who’s in a lot of space, but the pass isn’t great. Moses has to put on the breaks, and Monreal is able to snuff out the danger. 19 min: The presence of Welbeck forces another Arsenal corner down the right. Welbeck rises to meet it, six yards out. He shoulders it towards the top left ... but it comes off the left-hand post. Ramsey, standing a yard out, is startled as the ball clanks off his chest, back onto the post instead of into the net, and out for a goal kick! Chelsea could very easily be three down already. This wasn’t what anybody expected. Arsenal have been as excellent as Chelsea have been poor. 17 min: Moses slips Pedro into space down the right, but Monreal quickly closes him down to block tackle. The danger is over. Arsenal are faster, stronger and harder right now. Chelsea need to get a wriggle on, and quick. Arsenal, meanwhile, want to make hay while the sun shines. 15 min: Chelsea show their teeth for the first time, Hazard skating down the right and entering the box. He finds Costa in the middle. Costa’s shot from the penalty spot is blocked by Monreal. Arsenal go straight up the other end, Ozil sashaying into the area down the inside-right channel. He takes a heavy touch which sends him a little wide, but still manages to chip the ball over the spreadeagled Courtois. It’s going in, but there’s no pace on the chip, and Cahill can acrobatically backheel a clearance off the line. This is brilliant end-to-end entertainment! 14 min: Ozil drops deep, picks up possession, and slips a lovely ball down the middle of the park. Neither Sanchez nor Ramsey have their heads up, and the pass trundles harmlessly through. But Arsenal are soon coming back again at Chelsea, Sanchez having a crack from 25 yards. It’s not far from the top right, though had it not sailed over the bar, Courtois had it covered. 12 min: Chelsea are struggling to keep hold of possession. On the touchline, Antonio Conte is desperately trying to gee up his team. They’re a little sleepy, slow and second to most balls at the moment. 10 min: That early goal has energised Wembley, and Chelsea aren’t dealing with the vibes very well right now. Courtois, playing football in his own area, suddenly sees Welbeck closing towards him, and slips in panic. He springs up and shifts the ball towards Azpilicueta, just in time, and the danger is cleared. It’s fair to say this is set up perfectly for the neutral, the favourites behind and looking shaky ... though who’s neutral these days? 9 min: The first yellow card of the game goes to Ramsey, who is booked for a tug on Pedro as the Chelsea player dribbles through the centre of midfield. 7 min: Costa gets involved in a tangle with Holding down the Chelsea right. He’s earned a free kick, but for a second it looks as though things are going to kick off, Costa flinging a leg out just to see what happens. It all calms down. The free kick is swung into the box, Costa himself rising to head harmlessly over from 12 yards. This is a lively start, and then some! Courtois claims the corner, but his throw out is reclaimed by Arsenal. The ball’s worked down the inside-left channel. Sanchez flicks it forward for Ramsey, but Luiz heads it back upfield. Sanchez beats Kante to the dropping ball, albeit with arms up. It pings into the area towards Ramsey, who is miles offside. Chelsea stop play, in the hope of the flag going up. Ramsey stops too, because Sanchez chases after the loose ball himself, flicks it across Courtois, and into the bottom right! The flag does indeed go up, but after the ref consults the linesman for a minute, the goal’s given! Early controversy all right. 3 min: Arsenal are getting a good feel of the ball early doors. Chelsea being made to scurry around after it, to no avail. Suddenly Sanchez bursts down the right. He’s eventually surrounded, but a cheeky backheel deflects off Azpilicueta and out for the first corner of the game. 2 min: A bit of nerve-settling possession for Arsenal in the middle of the park. Wembley is bouncing. A rare old noise pinging off the famous stadium’s walls. A sudden roar snaps Wembley Stadium back into business mode ... and we’re off! Diego Costa gets the ball rolling. What an atmosphere. Within 15 seconds, Pedro has latched onto a long ball down the left and laid it off to Alonso, who sweeps it into the Arsenal box. Monreal heads clear purposefully. Then Arsenal go up the other end, the presence of Welbeck down the left forcing Cahill into a hurried clearance. Both teams are on the front foot immediately. The FA Cup final, right here! Before kick-off, wreaths are laid in memory of the sweet souls lost in Manchester at the start of the week. Warm applause, then a minute’s silence, perfectly observed. The players take to the pitch! Arsenal in their famous red shirts with white sleeves, Chelsea wearing their storied blue. It’s an aesthetic pleasure. The Duke of Cambridge, president of the FA and Aston Villa supporter, is introduced to the Arsenal XI by their captain for the day Per Mertesacker, then the Chelsea starters by Gary Cahill. A burst of the national anthem. And then the players are introduced to each other. Fair-play handshakes all round. Kick-off is getting close now. Sol Campbell and Eddie Newton come onto the pitch to wave the cup to all four corners of Wembley, and pop it on a plinth. Then a rousing 90,000-voice rendition of the cup-final hymn Abide With Me. That famous old song was first heard ahead of the cup final in 1927, which wasn’t such a good year for Arsenal as fans of Cardiff City will confirm. The players will be out in a minute! And now it’s the turn of Arsene Wenger, who will become the most successful manager in FA Cup history should he lift the trophy for the seventh time, beating the record he currently holds jointly with Aston Villa legend George Ramsay. “We have worked hard to get here, and we want to win the competition. Last night we lost Kieran Gibbs who went home sick, so the decision to name the team was not so difficult as we do not have too many defenders left. I believe that 99 percent of the Arsenal fans are fantastic people who stand behind the team, and you want to play for them.” That last, fairly pointed, line was in response to a follow-up question about his interview with the BBC’s Football Focus earlier today, in which he said: “The lack of respect has been for me a disgrace, and I will never accept that. There is a difference between being criticised and being treated in a way in which human beings don’t deserve to be treated.” Whatever the outcome today, the post-match press conferences will be worth a listen, I’ll be bound. Antonio Conte, yet to win a major final in his managerial career, speaks! “I think in this type of game it is very difficult to tell if there is a favourite. For the motivation, Arsenal could have something more than us. But we have been working very hard on our mentality. I am sure my players want to do this. It is very important to keep our concentration, because when you win the league in this way, the possibility to be a bit relaxed is there. This week we have worked on this aspect. This is my first final in England and I am enjoying it. There is a lot of excitement, but also concentration because we are here to win.” Arsenal have a few defensive issues, it’s fair to say. It’s the first time their back three of Rob Holding, Per Mertesacker and Nacho Monreal have ever started together. Mertesacker has played just 37 minutes worth of football in the past 13 months; this is his first start in 392 days. David Ospina gets in ahead of Petr Cech, as is the usual way of things in the cups when he’s fit. Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain returns from a hamstring problem to hold the fort out on the left. No great issues for Chelsea, nor are there any major surprises. Nemanja Matic gets the nod over Cesc Fabregas, while Pedro is preferred to Willian. This will be the seventh final John Terry has been involved in, and the third where he starts on the bench. Since you ask: he captained Chelsea in 2007, 2009, 2010 and 2012, got on late in 2002, and watched the whole thing in 2000. There’s nothing much left for him to experience, except possibly coming on in the 88th minute and being carried off on 89 in a sedan chair. Arsenal: Ospina, Holding, Mertesacker, Monreal, Bellerin, Ramsey, Xhaka, Oxlade-Chamberlain, Sanchez, Ozil, Welbeck. Subs: Lucas Perez, Giroud, Walcott, Iwobi, Cech, Coquelin, Elneny. Chelsea: Courtois, Azpilicueta, Luiz, Cahill, Moses, Kante, Matic, Alonso, Pedro, Costa, Hazard. Subs: Begovic, Fabregas, Zouma, Ake, Willian, Batshuayi, Terry. Referee: Anthony Taylor (Cheshire). Is there anything better in this world than a sunny Wembley on FA Cup final day? Well, possibly. But you’d be an awful churl to insist upon making the argument. English football’s signature occasion is oft-derided these days ... but only by fools who long ago let the love drain from their heart and don’t know what they’re missing. It still has a little life in it yet. What a gorgeous day. Today’s big occasion between Arsenal and Chelsea will be the 136th Football Association Challenge Cup final tie. Perhaps surprisingly, there have only been five previous all-London affairs. The first was fifty years ago today, give or take, a few days before the release of Sgt Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band. Spurs taught Chelsea how to play, Jimmy Robertson and Frank Saul scoring for Bill Nicholson’s side, Tommy Docherty’s men making do with a consolation from the one and only Billy Shears Bobby Tambling. That 1967 showdown was referred to at the time as the Cockney Cup Final, a monicker which played fast and loose with the audible range of yer actual Bow Bells. Some proper cockneys starred in the next all-London affair, eight years later, as West Ham saw off a Fulham side featuring their old mucker Bobby Moore. No fairytale for the declining hero, as the Rochdale Whippet, Alan Taylor, capitalised on some poor Peter Mellor goalkeeping to secure West Ham’s second Cup. West Ham also featured in the third all-London showdown, in 1980. This time they did for Arsenal, despite being a Second Division side. And despite Trevor Brooking being notoriously useless with his head. There was only one way it was ever going to end. Then a couple of years later, Spurs were back, and beat Queens Park Rangers in a very strange replay decided by a penalty conceded when notorious hard-man Tony Currie hacked down progressive playmaker Graham Roberts. Erm. Glenn Hoddle did the business from the spot. And finally the clubs contesting today’s final met in 2002. It’s only Ray Parlour, all that. None of them have been stone-cold classics, if we’re being honest. So London owes us. We’re due one. And why not today? A few weeks ago, you’d have called a fixture between these two teams as a fairly routine Chelsea win. And English football’s new champions will certainly go into the match as favourites. But Arsenal have rediscovered some form of late - they won their last five league games by an aggregate score of 13 goals to two - and will fancy their chances of giving their capital rivals a game, even with a patchwork defence. There’s plenty on the line here. Chelsea are going for their second league-and-cup Double; it would be a fitting end to a season in which Antonio Conte’s side have dominated the English game in style. Arsenal meanwhile are going for their third FA Cup in four seasons, a Victorian-style run of which Wanderers and Blackburn Rovers would be proud; it’d be a fitting end to Arsene Wenger’s reign. Unless, y’know, he’s staying put. But that’s an argument for another day. Whatever the outcome, the top of the FA Cup roll of honour ... 12: Arsenal, Manchester United 8: Tottenham Hotspur 7: Aston Villa, Liverpool, Chelsea ... will take on a significantly new look after this match, which can go to extra time and then penalty kicks. Will Arsenal become the most successful Cup side of all time? Or will Chelsea join Spurs in an all-London tie for joint-third spot? We’ll know after this balmy evening is out. It’s the FA Cup final! It’s the most beautiful north London evening! It’s on! Kick off: 5.30pm."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"}]}}
