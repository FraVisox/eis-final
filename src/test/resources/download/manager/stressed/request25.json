The opening day of the Championship game between Yorkshire and the defending champions was abandoned shortly after lunch with an on-time start for day two already in doubt. The wet weather also cost the county their three-day friendly against Leeds/Bradford MCC University last week, so this was not a major surprise. “I can remember playing in snow during a pre-season game in the mid‑2000s, against Durham I think it was,” said McGrath. “We were in the old dressing rooms over on the rugby side of the ground and I tried to sneak off the field. But Martyn Moxon shouted at me: ‘Get back on.’ “I can’t remember a continued spell of rain like this, though. It’s been throughout most of the country as well. Just talking to a few of the Yorkshire lads, they say the wet weather keeps topping up what they’ve had all winter and it’s got nowhere to go. “We’ve been quite lucky at Chelmsford. We managed somehow to get outside netting for four days from 1 March, before we went to Barbados. That was a remarkable effort from our ground staff. We’ve also been outside for the last week but only with bowlers off shortened run-ups.” Moxon, Yorkshire’s director of cricket, was equally frustrated following overnight and early morning rain. “To mark the start of the season like this is particularly disappointing. It’s been grim for a while. “We’ve managed to have a couple of practice sessions this week but only with floodlights on, woolly hats, gloves, the lot. It has just been so miserable it’s not funny any more. Realistically, it’s going to take a long time for it to be fit. I doubt we’d lose the whole game but it’s not going to start on time for day two either.” It was quite apt given the weather that McGrath would reference mid-winter when asked how hard it is to keep players focused during such weather interruptions. “It’s difficult,” he said. “If it’s mid-season, it’s a bit easier. But now everyone is so excited. The night before the county season is almost like Christmas Eve. Everyone is raring to go.” I thought that maybe it was balmy at Southampton, now I know differently. Quick roundup: at 520 on the first day of the season, we have four games abandoned without play, and Middlesex v Northants looking unlikely to resume despite the floodlights at Lord’s. At Southampton, Hampshire are all out for 290, with 75 for Gareth Berg matching Vince’s 75 earlier in the day; and four wickets for Joe Leach. Worcestershire should get a few overs in the gloaming. Thanks for your company! Cricket: why we love it... In the one remaining match, Hampshire are 214 for 6; Will’s favourite Leach has 3-37. Early-season Vince still the only man all day to pass fifty. Ok, so now play has been abandoned at Edgbaston for the day too. So that’s six matches, four abandoned without a ball, one suspended for bad light, and one in bonny Southampton rocking and rolling along: 193 for 5, with 36 not out and a brace of chillblains for Amla. At Lord’s, bad light has stopped play with Middlesex 132 for 4 Weather permitting, there will be 104 overs tomorrow at Old Trafford, with play starting at 11. Interestingly, or not, but I think it is, the last time there was no play on the first day of the season at Old Trafford was in 1999, also on April 13... Bad news from Old Trafford - play called off for the day here too. At Headingley, the early morning rain disappeared a few hours ago and pretty much all of the covers had been removed in hope rather than expectation. But umpires Ian Gould and Richard Illingworth inspected and abandoned the day shortly after lunch, owing to a wet outfield. Prior to the umpires’ decision, Yorkshire’s director of cricket Martyn Moxon even admitted: “I doubt we’d lose the whole game, but it’s not going to start on time for day two either. At best, we could be waiting around for a few hours at least because it’s not drying.” At Southampton, Amla, not out 21 and Northeast, out for 17, have taken Hampshire to 160 for 4. A recovery of sorts at Lord’s where an unfamiliar looking Middlesex are 102 for 4. Elsewhere rain has stopped play either permanently or temporarily. And a little plug for the Lancashire Cricket Matchday Archive, produced by their heritage team. They have produced a more informative scorecard after requests from members at the AGM. The team are looking for details on the five men on the Lancashire war memorial, whom they are hoping to honour this centenary year. If anyone has any details on Alfred Hartley, Williams Knowles Tyldesley, John Nelson, Harold Gwyer Garnett or Egerton Lownes Wright, please contact maxcricket@btinternet.com Play abandoned for the day at Headingley but it is getting marginally lighter over the Pennines. 2.30 inspection at Old Trafford. Good news for Paul Speller’s dad. “In these uncertain times, the fact that, in spite of the weather, my dad did not hesitate to head for OT this morning is extremely reassuring.” Will he be sitting under The Point Paul? I hope so. There’s a small and largely silent, but welcoming, community for him. A bit of movement actually, someone has unzipped their jacket and there is a little gathering on the stairs. An update from Edgbaston: a further inspection at 3. At Old Trafford, a handful (is there a collective noun for cricketers?) of Lancashire players run round the outfield in shorts and woolly hats. Glenn Chapple and groundsman Matthew Merchant examine the covers; funny how cricket people eschew the huge football manager shin length puffa jacket. A bit nesh, perhaps. Ah, now the super sopper is back and the covers are being lifted. In the guardian inbox, people mull over the main photograph above the blog: “Inzamam Ul-Haq’s entire pre-season training routine as demonstrated by Worcester’s keeper and slip cordon – one proper star followed by 4 efforts of declining athleticism / enthusiasm?” wonders Ian Sargeant. To Chris Moore, it is, “a particularly poor attempt at YMCA (apart from one very enthusiastic participant).” Lunch roundup: Old Trafford: inspection at 1.30. An sickly-grey outlook but no rain. Headingley: Start delayed. Rain. Southampton: Hampshire 131 for 3, 75 to Vince, who wasn’t caught at slip, and 33 to Adams. Leach 1-23; Magoffin 2-38. Lord’s:Middlesex 64-4; Cartwright 30, Sanderson 2-14, Hutton 2-17. Canterbury: Play abandoned for the day. Edgbaston: Start delayed, inspection at 1.15. Thank you for your tweets and messages: James Barham you are not alone at despairing over the scheduling - though this is actually a later start to the season than we’ve had some years. Oh, and that’s Vince gone, for 75, bowled Magoffin. Lovely while it lasted. Neither enough, nor too few. Middlesex are 64 for 4 - two each for Hutton and Sanderson. Now I don’t want to jinx things but Vince is properly whizzing along at Southampton, 64 off 62 balls, 12 fours, and a sparkly turn to finish. Could we even dream of, I don’t know, a hundred before lunch? Fifty for Vince! Oh sweet beauty. “When the glorious day dawns and, glory be, it’s only light drizzle, wrap up like Captain Oates and set off to the ground stocked with thermoses” a lovely read by Gary Naylor to pass a few happy minutes. Lunchtime here at Old Trafford but there is still drizzle in the air. Meanwhile Vince has a pretty 30... At Lord’s, Hilton Cartwright successfully defends Ben Sanderson’s hat-trick ball. At Old Trafford, two men in tracksuits slush across the outfield, the scoreboard shows Lancashire’s official partners and a few hardy souls really are sitting out under The Point. I can count 20, each is wearing a dark anorak and 13 are sitting alone with at least a couple of empty rows separating them. I love the sheer eccentricity of it, the not-giving-a-damn-ness, the tenacity and the stubborn-ness. I’ve found another cracking record, though not quite as good as Chanderpaul’s, this time for James Vince who is currently 10 not out at Southampton. First century of the season to Vince would be somehow fitting in a kind of what-the-heck-do-we-do-now way. There will be no play before lunch at Emerald Headingley, where umpires Richard Illingworth and Ian Gould are expected to draw a line through the whole day when they inspect again at around 1.40pm. I have just been down on the outfield and water is coming up with every step taken. The likelihood is that the start of play tomorrow will be delayed as well, with the suggestion being that it will come around tea time if we get some sunshine and wind over the next 24 hours or so. A wicket! Hampshire’s Lewis McManus has the honour of being the first man to be out this County Championship season, a wicket for Joe Leach, taker of 69 Division Two wickets last year and snappily captioned by cricinfo as “thickset and bustling.” Hope he doesn’t mind too much. And, lo, the season started - with overs for Ben Sanderson for Northants and Joe Leach for Worcestershire. Anyone there? Is there actually real sun? Did you bring sandwiches? I saw a tweet yesterday asking for crowdfunding to form the Iceland cricket team, and they promised in return medieval poetry, but I’m not sure anything can beat this from mesnilman. Can i paste things from btl? Let’s try APRIL is the cruellest month, breeding Jinxes out of the dead land, mixing Memory and desire, stirring Warm tea with spring rain. Winter kept us warm, covering Tests in forgetful losses, feeding A little life with dry one-dayers. Summer surprised us, coming over the Severn Estuary With a shower of rain; we stopped in the pavilion, And followed-on in sunlight, into Sophia Gardens, And drank coffee, and talked for an hour. By ‘eck an all lad, thas not from Barnsley, proper Mordor. And when we were children, staying in Aigburth, Our spinner, he took a Michelle on a greentop, And I was excited. He said, Mes, Mes, hold on tight. And down we went. Into Division two, there you feel free. I read, much of the night, and go to sleep in the winter. An Archie crept softly through the vegetation Dragging its lego stinger on its back While I was reading below-the-line On a winter evening on my laptop in work. Musing upon the king Sanga’s retirement And on the effect on all fantasy players. White jumpers drying on the low damp ground And New Road cast under floods again, Rattled by the Severn’s anger, year to year. But at my back from time to time I hear The sound of horns and motors, which shall bring Sweeney to Mrs. Porter in the spring. O the moon shone bright on Mrs. Porter And on her daughter They wash their feet in soda water Et, O ces voix d’enfants, chantant dans la coupole! A dismal dampness round-up: Old Trafford: inspection at 12.40 Headingley: Rain, not much chance of play Southampton: Play to start on time! Hampshire to bat first Lord’s: Play to start on time! Northants have elected to bowl. Canterbury: Play already called off for the day Edgbaston: No play before lunch. Also, I should have said, the nice folk below the line have arranged a County Cricket Fantasy League for the season. You still have time to join: this is the link and the code is AADNYWGH News from Old Trafford: no play till at least 12.40, with lunch taken at 12. The super soppers dutifully meander over the soggy outfield while puddles sit here and there on the covers. Still, everyone in good spirits in the pressbox – with a fabulous first-day statistic from Ken Grimes: Lancashire now have a world-record breaker in their ranks. Shiv Chanderpaul is the new holder of the man to play at the most first-class grounds, 116, after a winter game at the Brian Lara stadium in Tarouba. He knocks dear old Tom Graveney off his perch. More rain news to follow after a coffee. Good morning from a soggy Emerald Headingley, where prospects of play don’t look too promising for this Division One opener between Yorkshire and champions Essex. One thing is for sure, we will not be starting on time. The rain is very fine at present, but the weather over the past couple of weeks means the chances of play at all today are slim. Only last weekend, Yorkshire’s University friendly, due to start on Friday, was called off two or three days beforehand. When we do start, Essex will hand a debut to their overseas Australian seamer Peter Siddle, signed for the first five Championship matches before Neil Wagner returns. Yorkshire are in the midst of an incredible injury and unavailability crisis. They are without seamers Liam Plunkett and David Willey (both IPL), Matthew Fisher and James Wainman, who have side problems, and Steve Patterson due to a broken finger. Ben Coad is also a significant doubt as he recovers from a hip flexor problem, meaning Josh Shaw and Matthew Waite are in a 12-man squad. Coad was initially ruled out of this match, but now he may be risked. Essex hammered Yorkshire twice last season, including inside three days at Chelmsford to end the campaign. Former White Rose captain Anthony McGrath takes charge of Essex for the first time as head coach. This April morning, like so many before, a couple of hundred young men woke with their hearts thumping, their bathroom reflections questioning every dry-mouthed gulp of anticipation and fear. As they unpack their bags of box-fresh whites in six dressing-rooms around the country, we wish them luck and fortune over the following months. For counties big and small, there will also be doubts: will the new signings, only ever chosen with as much whim as certainty, work; will the weather be kind; will England whip away their stars; will the eyes and knees of the trusty stalwart hold out for just one more year? Out on the pitch, we have six cracking contests – Hampshire, boosted by Sam Northeast and Hashim Amla, play promoted Worcestershire at the Ageas Bowl; Lancashire take on Nottinghamshire at Old Trafford; and at the plum tie at Headingley champions Essex spearheaded by Jamie Porter, freshly crowned Wisden Cricketer of the Year, take on the Yorkies, still smarting from the last-minute losses of Liam Plunkett and David Willey to the IPL and without their Voice of Cricket, legendary broadcaster Dave Callaghan who died last month aged 63. In Division Two, Kent, under the temporary leadership of Joe Denly with Sam Billings at the Chennai Super Kings, take on Gloucestershire at Canterbury. A slightly creaking Warwickshire are at home to Sussex who have a new coach in Jason Gillespie, who in 2014 and 2015 coaxed Yorkshire to the title. Middlesex, who went from 2016 Champions to relegation in a year, play Northamptonshire’s motley crew at Lord’s. Two young’uns to watch: Yorkshire’s Harry Brook who captained England’s U-19 World Cup side, and had a good tournament despite being dropped for a misdemeanour off the field; and near-namesake, the strapping Henry Brookes of Warwickshire, who was injured out of the World Cup and is desperate to make up for lost time. Here at Old Trafford it is cold, grey and damp, but there is much to see. The Lancashire top four: Haseeb Hameed, on whom so many hopes are pinned, Keaton Jennings, fresh from Durham, Alex Davies and new captain Liam Livingstone all have points to prove. There’s no Jimmy Anderson, tasty as he’d be on an April pitch. Maybe that explains the signing of Graham Onions from Durham – and Lancashire also have a fancied young leg-spinner Matt Parkinson up their sleeve, although this may not be his kind of day. Nottinghamshire, fresh from Division Two promotion, start their campaign with three difficult away games. New captain Steven Mullaney, Billy Root, Joe’s brother, Tom Moores, Peter’s son, and Jake Ball, back from a disappointing winter tour, all have shadows to eclipse. There has been change here too. Last year’s county blog superstar Will Macpherson has hopped across to a super new job at the Standard while Vithushan Ehantharajah has been snaffled by Cricbuzz for the summer. We wish them both much luck (they won’t need it), so bear temporarily with your late call-ups – think a dressing-gowned Ted Dexter vainly perusing his astrology charts. Below the line remains unchanged and is waiting with open arms for your whimsy and wisdom. Eoin Morgan this week questioned the future of the County Championship. “I’m not sure the Championship matters to everyone anymore,” he said. “I would say I am the last generation of people who care about it.” But, squeezed though it is into the arse-ends of the season, it is hanging on – there are England places to be won and resurrected, and a summer of glories, small and large, to be savoured."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"us-news/2018/apr/12/rafael-caro-quintero-fbi-most-wanted-mexico","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-12T21:44:27Z","webTitle":"Mexican drug kingpin behind DEA murder added to FBI most-wanted list","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/apr/12/rafael-caro-quintero-fbi-most-wanted-mexico","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/apr/12/rafael-caro-quintero-fbi-most-wanted-mexico","fields":{"headline":"Mexican drug kingpin behind DEA murder added to FBI most-wanted list","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"A veteran drug kingpin convicted over the murder of a DEA agent and then released on a technicality from a Mexican prison has been added to the FBI’s list of its 10 most-wanted fugitives. Rafael Caro Quintero now faces additional criminal charges unsealed in a federal court in Brooklyn, New York, and the US government increased the reward for his capture to $20m. Caro Quintero was convicted of ordering the 1985 murder of Enrique “Kike” Camarena, a DEA special agent, and served 28 years in a Mexican prison before being released on a technicality in 2013. His release prompted outrage in the US, and a new Mexican arrest warrant was issued less than a week later. Law enforcement agencies have warned that he is still an active member of the Sinaloa cartel. “We need the public’s help in finding this violent fugitive,” the acting FBI deputy director, David Bowdich, said on Thursday as he announced Caro Quintero’s inclusion on the most-wanted list. “We believe he is still in Mexico.” Several years ago, in an interview with the Mexican magazine Proceso, Caro Quintero denied murdering Camarena. Bowdich said the most-wanted list was “one of our most valuable tools” and that 484 of the 518 fugitives who have been on the list have been captured. Also on Thursday, federal officials unsealed an additional indictment against Caro Quintero, accusing him of trafficking in methamphetamine, heroin, cocaine and marijuana from 1980 until 2017. Caro Quintero has controlled the Sinaloa cartel along with Ismael “El Mayo” Zambada García since the arrest of Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán. Authorities say it is the first time that a suspect sought by the DEA has been added to the FBI’s list. The DEA and FBI’s renewed push to track down Caro Quintero comes at a time when the justice department under the attorney general, Jeff Sessions, is prioritizing enforcement against violent crimes and drug trafficking. Recently, Sessions urged federal prosecutors to seek the death penalty in drug cases when it was appropriate under law to do so. The effort to arrest Caro Quintero comes a few months before “El Chapo” is slated to go on trial in September for his leadership role in the Sinaloa cartel."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/apr/13/morning-mail-us-wavers-on-syria-air-strikes","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-12T20:52:34Z","webTitle":"Morning mail: US wavers on Syria air strikes","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/apr/13/morning-mail-us-wavers-on-syria-air-strikes","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/apr/13/morning-mail-us-wavers-on-syria-air-strikes","fields":{"headline":"Morning mail: US wavers on Syria air strikes","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Good morning, this is Eleanor Ainge Roy bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Friday 13 April. Top stories Washington is still looking for evidence on who carried out Saturday’s chemical weapons attack in Damascus, the US defence secretary, James Mattis, has said. Echoing a morning tweet by Donald Trump that appeared to walk back his threat of imminent action 24 hours earlier, Mattis said his main concern about a military response was how to stop it “escalating out of control”. But the French president, Emmanuel Macron, said on Thurday his government had “proof” that the government of Bashar al-Assad was responsible for the attack. NBC and CNN quoted US officials as saying US intelligence also had evidence pointing to the regime’s culpability. Analysts said the more measured tone suggested the US and allies were prepared to take longer to prepare a more comprehensive, multi-phase attack. At the UN, the Russian envoy, Vassily Nebenzia, said Russia’s “immediate priority is to avert the danger of war”. Asked if he was referring to a war between the United States and Russia, Nebenzia told reporters: “We cannot exclude any possibilities unfortunately because we saw messages that are coming from Washington. They were very bellicose.” The Australian government has no plan to save an endangered Australian turtle species that received global attention on Thursday for its green mohawk and its unique ability to breathe through its genitals. The Mary river turtle, found only in that one river in Queensland, attracted worldwide headlines as one of the standout species on a new list of the most vulnerable reptile species compiled by the Zoological Society of London. But there is no national recovery plan to protect it from extinction and it is unclear whether any federal funds have been allocated for its protection. The international chemical weapons watchdog has backed the UK’s findings on the identity of the chemical used to poison the former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia. The findings by the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons will be a relief to the UK government, which has said novichok, a military-grade nerve agent developed by Russia, was used in the attack. The UK foreign minister, Boris Johnson, said in a statement: “There can be no doubt what was used and there remains no alternative explanation about who was responsible – only Russia has the means, motive and record.” The Australian government is pushing ahead with controversial legislation it says will create “back doors” into encrypted communication services – but still can’t say when it will introduce the bill. After originally aiming to have the legislation before parliament in the first quarter of this year, the government has delayed its introduction. A spokesman for the acting attorney general, Marise Payne, said it was in “the advanced stages of development” and “the government is continuing to consult with key stakeholders”. The former attorney general George Brandis first floated the idea last year, in response to law enforcement frustrations that encrypted communication services such as Whatsapp, Wickr, iMessage and Snapchat remained out of their reach. Tests on Captain Cook’s sweet potato have shed light on how the crop reached Polynesia. Scientists say they have solved the longstanding puzzle, with their research proving the sweet potato evolved just once, probably in central or northern South America, and originated from a single ancestor. Analysis of part of a 250-year-old sweet potato plant collected during Cook’s voyage to the South Pacific on HMS Endeavour suggests the species arrived in Polynesia by means of ocean currents. The findings cast further doubt on the idea that people in the Americas were in touch with Polynesians before Europeans arrived in the New World in the 15th century. Sport Where are the people at the empty Commonwealth Games? There are deserted streets, empty cafes and angry taxi drivers in the Gold Coast, as local businesses battle the unexpected downturn. A lot of the anger stems from an impression that Commonwealth Games organisers convinced some people to stay away. Kyron McMaster’s 400m hurdles win gave the British Virgin Islands a first ever Commonwealth gold, and came months after his coach Xavier Samuels was killed in Hurricane Irma. Thinking time With the flu season almost upon us, doctors are already lining up stethoscope, thermometer and tongue depressor on their desks, says GP Elizabeth Oliver, to battle the wave of potential flu sufferers asking for antibiotics they don’t need. “Influenza is that thing you had that time – if you could have made your brain work, you would have worried you were dying. Some of you cried. Some of you called an ambulance. You remember it forever and recount the tale at family get-togethers.” Vaccination is no guarantee of prevention, but deciding whether to have one is a no-brainer, Oliver says. “Last year at least 3,000 Australians died of influenza, including healthy young adults and children.” A Quiet Place has became a cause célèbre for anti-popcorn crusaders, with purists wanting to enjoy the Emily Blunt film in silence – but it’s not the only part of cinema etiquette that could do with a 21st-century update. “Cinemas have long been considered safe havens where patrons can joyously munch on popcorn, sweets, pretzels and crisps,” writes Joe Queenan. “A Quiet Place aficionados want to change all that, reversing more than a century of socially acceptable antisocial behaviour in the cinema.” A chef who butchered a deer leg in front of vegan protesters has vowed he won’t change, saying he and colleagues sources animal products with care – but opponents argue there’s no such thing as ethical meat. Is there any hope for common ground? “I dreamed my whole life of opening Antler and it exists today as a small, local restaurant specialising in regional Canadian cuisine,” he said, a few days after another protest outside the restaurant. “A group of protesters threatened that business, and my response, like any other business owner, was to defend it.” What’s he done now? Last week Trump described Robert Mueller’s investigation of the Trump campaign’s ties with Russia as a “witch hunt”. But this week he’s co-operating with him – at least according to his overnight tweet. “I have agreed with the historically cooperative, disciplined approach that we have engaged in with Robert Mueller (Unlike the Clintons!). I have full confidence in Ty Cobb, my Special Counsel, and have been fully advised throughout each phase of this process.” Media roundup The NT News devotes its front page to asking the prime minister “What about us?” accusing Malcolm Turnbull of spending big in the southern states and short-changing the territory. “Malcolm Turnbull needs to stop treating Territorians like they are second-class citizens,” chief minister Michael Gunner says. “If the federal government can afford to give Victoria $5bn to build a train line to the airport, they can afford to invest in the NT.” The ABC has a feature on how to save Australia’s farmland as the demand for affordable housing gobbles up more grazing land, which accounts for only 10% of the Australian landmass. And the Daily Telegraph reports that children as young as nine will begin taking lessons on consent as part of the NSW school curriculum. Coming up State and territory health ministers meet in Sydney today to discuss hospital funding and a looming doctor shortage due to visa rule changes. The federal electoral boundaries commission is due to rule on which federal seat in Adelaide will undergo redistribution.

In Comey’s book, A Higher Loyalty, obtained by the Guardian on Thursday from a bookseller in New York before publication, the former official casts Trump as both “unethical” and “untethered to truth” and compares his presidency to a “forest fire”. Likening Trump to a mafia boss, Comey describes a meeting in the Oval Office which gave him flashbacks to his career as a young prosecutor. “As I found myself thrust into the Trump orbit, I once again was having flashbacks to my earlier career as a prosecutor against the Mob,” Comey writes. “The silent circle of assent. The boss in complete control. The loyalty oaths. The us-versus-them worldview. The lying about all things, large and small, in service to some code of loyalty that put the organization above morality and the truth.” The Republican party has launched a concerted effort to get its rebuttal in before the book is published, with a Trumpian web site dedicated to branding the former director “Lyin’ Comey”. But A Higher Loyalty is an instant bestseller online and will be supported by a media blitz to begin Sunday night with an hour-long broadcast on ABC News. Trump called Comey a “weak and untruthful slime ball” on Friday in a Twitter response to the first reports from the book. But Comey is not the only former FBI chief giving Trump a migraine – the special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into possible Russian collusion with the Trump campaign has been accelerating and is also enraging the president. The sky began to fall in for Trump on Monday, when FBI agents raided the offices and a hotel room used by Trump’s lawyer Michael Cohen. The raids were a strong sign that prosecutors might soon charge one of Trump’s fiercest loyalists with a serious crime or crimes, legal experts said. “It’s a disgraceful situation,” Trump said. “It’s a total witch-hunt … It’s an attack on our country, what we all stand for.” As the implications of those raids continue to sink in, Trump may be lured towards the kind of drastic action that would send fissures through the executive branch and beyond, multiple former White House and justice department officials interviewed by the Guardian said. “The raid of Michael Cohen’s office was a seismic event, for any presidency,” said Andrew Wright, a former White House associate counsel and a professor at Savannah Law School. “I think he [Cohen] is in very serious trouble. “And sure enough, the president appears to have really come pretty unhinged at that news, so I think that’s incredibly significant.” Even for a White House that can seem to cycle from crisis to extreme crisis, the current pressure on Trump, and the resulting peril for his presidency and the country, is acute, according to seasoned prosecutors. “The pressure on the president is actually unimaginable to me,” said Betsy de la Vega, who was a federal prosecutor for more than 20 years. While the public has no way of knowing how far along Mueller is in his work, De la Vega said, the decision to conduct the Cohen raids, given their high stakes, could indicate that prosecutors had completed significant work behind the scenes. “They would have to know that setting it in motion would cause great consternation, to say the least, on the part of Donald Trump and his pals, so that gives me the sense that the pace is increasing.” Cohen, who has denied all wrongdoing, could face charges including bank fraud, wire fraud, campaign violations, tax crimes or other charges relating to payments made to multiple women in advance of the 2016 election, and communications thereafter with at least one of those women. The prospect of such an indictment is clearly weighing on the president’s mind. In the week since the Cohen raids, Trump has lashed out at Mueller and his superior, the deputy attorney general, Rod Rosenstein. “Mueller is most conflicted of all (except Rosenstein...),” Trump tweeted in a Wednesday morning tirade against “the Fake &amp; Corrupt Russia Investigation, headed up by the all Democrat loyalists, or people that worked for Obama”. Mueller has indicted or reached plea agreements with 19 individuals, including four former senior Trump campaign aides, plus three companies in Russia. He is a Republican, as is Rosenstein. So are Comey and Jeff Sessions, the attorney general. But none of Mueller’s targets has been as close to Trump as Cohen, who is a friend of the family, has been involved with the Trump children on real estate deals around the world, and who could have a lot to tell prosecutors about operations inside the Trump Organization. The visceral threat of a prosecution so close to his company and his family could drive the president to take a step that the White House asserted last week was within his power: removing Mueller, or perhaps Rosenstein. “There’s a clear pattern of the president seeming to think that the department of justice belongs to him,” said Alex Whiting, a Harvard Law School professor specializing in criminal prosecution issues. “And that’s deeply concerning. These threats to fire Sessions or fire Mueller or fire Rosenstein all fit into that. “It’s a remarkable disregard for the rule of law. The precedent that this is setting, what this means for our country and our future, is very concerning.” The combined pressures from the investigation, and a media cacophony with outlets such as Fox News touting an imminent Trump “personnel decision,” could be driving Trump toward a dangerous step, said Wright. “It feels like there are people that are really trying to tempt the president to take drastic action to try and shut down these investigations, and I think that would just really send us into political convulsions in this country, and I think that would not solve the president’s problems, it would worsen them,” Wright said. “I’m quite concerned about the precarious situation we find ourselves in right now.” Members of congress in both chambers have said they support passing legislation to protect the special counsel, but such legislation is moving slowly. Trump, meanwhile, appears not to have been shaken in his basic faith that the best way to handle the prosecutions swirling around him is to fight back with all the power the presidency can muster. “No Collusion or Obstruction (other than I fight back), so now they do the Unthinkable, and RAID a lawyers office for information! BAD!” Trump tweeted on Wednesday. “It’s the thing he hasn’t learned from the beginning,” said Wright, discussing Trump’s relationship with the prosecution. “It’s like being wrapped by a boa constrictor. The more you struggle, the more likely you’re going to die quickly. And the less you struggle, the more likely you might be able to slip out of its clutches. “And instead the president is just wiggling and wiggling and wiggling.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/apr/12/cabinet-may-call-robust-response-syria-chemical-weapons","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-13T05:35:32Z","webTitle":"Cabinet backs Theresa May's call for robust response to Syria crisis","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/12/cabinet-may-call-robust-response-syria-chemical-weapons","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/apr/12/cabinet-may-call-robust-response-syria-chemical-weapons","fields":{"headline":"Cabinet backs Theresa May's call for robust response to Syria crisis","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The cabinet has unanimously backed Theresa May’s warning that Syria’s use of chemical weapons could not go unchallenged, leaving the way open for British participation in military action against Bashar al-Assad’s regime. Downing Street said senior ministers had agreed it was highly likely the Syrian government was responsible for the “shocking and barbaric” gas attack on the rebel-held town of Douma, which killed up to 75 people. Within hours of the meeting, the prime minister spoke to Donald Trump by phone about the crisis, with the two leaders agreeing to work closely together on the international response. They stressed that Syria must be prevented from launching a similar onslaught on its own people in future. The Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, accused the government of waiting for instructions from the US. He said: “Further UK military intervention in Syria’s appalling multi-sided war risks escalating an already devastating conflict. The government appears to be waiting for instructions from President Donald Trump on how to proceed. But the US administration is giving alarmingly contradictory signals.” At a two-hour cabinet meeting on Thursday, ministers backed plans to take further action – along with the US and France – to prevent Assad’s forces from launching such an “appalling and inhumane” attack again. Cabinet ministers emerged tight-lipped from the unusually long meeting as No 10 awaited the next move from the White House, where Trump had convened a meeting of his own national security council. After the call to the White House, No 10 said: “The prime minister spoke to President Trump about Syria this evening. They agreed that the Assad regime had established a pattern of dangerous behaviour in relation to the use of chemical weapons. “They agreed it was vital that the use of chemical weapons did not go unchallenged, and on the need to deter the further use of chemical weapons by the Assad regime. They agreed to keep working closely together on the international response.” Trump was also expected to speak to the French president, Emmanuel Macron, about what form the action could take, with the White House saying: “No final decision has been made.” It is understood the prime minister wants the UK to play a central role in any action, rather than just supporting France and the US. Although preparations are shrouded in secrecy, training exercises were clearly already under way at RAF Akrotiri in Cyprus in preparation for a possible counterattack by the Russians, close allies of the Syrian regime. However, the transport minister, Jo Johnson, brother of the foreign secretary, told BBC’s Question Time: “There has been no decision to take military action at this point.” The prime minister is thought to be unlikely to consult parliament before any coordinated military action, which is likely to provoke anger from the opposition benches and to divide the public. However, the cabinet’s backing could give her some political cover to take further action. After the meeting at No 10, a Downing Street spokesman said: “Cabinet agreed that the Assad regime has a track record of the use of chemical weapons and it is highly likely that the regime is responsible for Saturday’s attack. Cabinet agreed it was vital that the use of chemical weapons did not go unchallenged. “[They] agreed on the need to take action to alleviate humanitarian distress and to deter the further use of chemical weapons by the Assad regime. Cabinet agreed the prime minister should continue to work with allies in the United States and France to coordinate an international response.” The US defence secretary, James Mattis, said Washington was still looking for evidence on who carried out Saturday’s chemical weapons attack in Damascus and said his main concern about a military response was how to stop it escalating out of control. However, Macron said on Thursday that his government had evidence that Assad’s government was responsible. Earlier, the Brexit secretary, David Davis, said he expected the cabinet to be provided with evidence showing that the Syrian regime was behind the attack and also that the prime minister would set out a properly thought-through plan. Davis, who voted against military action against the Assad regime in 2013, said: “The situation in Syria is horrific – the use of chemical weapons is something the world has to prevent. We of all countries in the world, after the Skripal affair, have perhaps the most immediate knowledge of it apart from the Syrians themselves. We’ve got very delicate circumstances and we’ve got to make a judgment on a very careful, very well-thought-out, well-thought-through basis.” Referring to the 2013 vote, he said that there were two reasons for his opposition: “We had not provided the evidence and the intelligence that we knew who it was, and secondly there was not a proper plan thought through properly. Those two things I’m assured we’re going to answer today.” The foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, withdrew from a press conference in Oxford with his German counterpart, Heiko Maas, to attend the emergency cabinet, instead meeting him briefly at Heathrow. On Thursday, May was also given the backing of her most influential foreign policy backbencher, Tom Tugendhat, to take part in any western strike against Syria without a Commons mandate. However, Conservative backbenchers including Zac Goldsmith have expressed reservations about taking action without a vote. The SNP’s Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, said a parliamentary debate should take place before, rather than after, military action was launched."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2018/apr/12/danny-ray-thomas-police-shooting-unarmed-black-man-texas-houston","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-12T19:23:39Z","webTitle":"Family of unarmed black man killed by Texas police file wrongful death lawsuit","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/apr/12/danny-ray-thomas-police-shooting-unarmed-black-man-texas-houston","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/apr/12/danny-ray-thomas-police-shooting-unarmed-black-man-texas-houston","fields":{"headline":"Family of unarmed black man killed by Texas police file wrongful death lawsuit","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The family of an unarmed black man whose trousers were around his ankles when he was shot dead by a Texas police officer has filed a wrongful death lawsuit. The federal civil action alleges that the Harris county sheriff’s office has a pattern of shooting suspects who do not pose a physical threat and are experiencing a mental health crisis. Danny Ray Thomas, 35, was killed by deputy Cameron Brewer in a north Houston street at about 1pm on 22 March. The case against Brewer and the county seeks damages and claims the officer used excessive force “even after observing that Mr Thomas was unarmed and clearly in a state of crisis or suffering from mental health problems, and was not then presenting any objective danger to others or himself”. Police dashcam footage and a cellphone recording from a bystander show Thomas in a minor altercation with another man. Thomas then walks towards Brewer, who backpedals and yells: “I’ll shoot your ass, man, get down, man!” The moment that the 44-year-old fires a single shot into Thomas’s chest is not captured on video, but happens less than 30 seconds after Brewer arrives. His body camera, issued that day, was left charging in his vehicle. “If you’re mentally ill and you’re black then you already have two strikes against you when you encounter law enforcement,” Benjamin Crump, a civil rights attorney, told a news conference on Thursday. “My God, he had his pants down by his ankles. All you have to do is push him, not give him a bullet to the chest.” Crump is also representing the family of Stephon Clark, an unarmed 22-year-old whose killing in his grandmother’s back yard by police in Sacramento last month set off a wave of protests in the Californian capital. Bob Hilliard, another of the Thomas family’s lawyers, said footage showed Brewer, who is black, putting his knee into the back of Thomas’s lifeless body and handcuffing him. Brewer was equipped with a stun gun, baton and pepper spray but did not use them, according to the court filing. Thomas’s death is under investigation by the sheriff’s office and the Houston police department. Evidence is expected to be reviewed by the Harris county district attorney’s office and presented to a grand jury, which will decide whether to indict the officer on criminal charges. Ed Gonzalez, the Harris county sheriff, said last month Thomas was “foaming at the mouth” and “obviously in a state of crisis of some kind” and expressed concern that the officer went straight to lethal force rather than attempting to de-escalate the situation. The sheriff pledged a transparent and thorough investigation. On Thursday, Thomas’s sister, Marketta, wore a T-shirt with a photograph of her older brother and wept as she recalled the trauma caused by the death of two of his children, who were allegedly drowned in a bathtub by their mother in 2016. “I lost my best friend,” she said. “No one with mental illness … deserves to die”. Crump said the incident underlines the need for better training of police and greater accountability. He recalled the fatal shooting of Terence Crutcher, a black man walking with his hands up, in Tulsa, Oklahoma, in 2016. Crutcher’s family have filed a wrongful death lawsuit. The officer who shot him was acquitted of manslaughter. According to a Guardian investigation, The Counted, 27% of people killed by US police in the first five months of 2015 had mental health problems. Still, criminal convictions of officers who use deadly force are rare. In 2012 an officer with the Houston police department fatally shot Brian Claunch, a mentally ill double amputee in a wheelchair who was holding a pen when police responded to a disturbance call at his care home. The officer was cleared by a grand jury and an internal investigation."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"artanddesign/2018/apr/15/surface-work-victoria-miro-review-women-abstract-painting","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-15T06:59:06Z","webTitle":"Surface Work review – women abstract artists dazzle in historic show","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/apr/15/surface-work-victoria-miro-review-women-abstract-painting","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2018/apr/15/surface-work-victoria-miro-review-women-abstract-painting","fields":{"headline":"Surface Work review – women abstract artists dazzle in historic show","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"There are certain shows that change one’s sense of art. Surface Work is one of them. Spread across two sites, it is nothing less than an anthology of abstract painting spanning an entire century, from early constructivism to post-digital sampling, in which every work holds its own and every work is by a woman. This is a rare and historic event. It is also clear proof, if more were needed, of the institutional bias of the art world. So many of these women’s names are unfamiliar, so many have been stinted, forgotten or ignored, that it is quite possible to walk through rooms full of magnificent works without having heard of their makers. Abstract painting, roughly as represented in British museums, tends to run from Kandinsky, Malevich and Mondrian to Pollock, Rothko and Barnett Newman, through to Richard Diebenkorn, Cy Twombly and – if you’re very lucky – Joan Mitchell, an artist easily as great as Twombly yet appallingly neglected in this country. Bridget Riley and the ever-visible Yayoi Kusama are eminent exceptions too, and last year’s Russian Revolution shows brought us the amazons of the avant garde as never before. But still this show is guaranteed to surprise with its surge of artistic revelations. Hedda Sterne (1910-2011), for instance, a Romanian-born painter associated with the abstract expressionists in New York. Too associated, perhaps: she was the only woman in an iconic photograph of the so-called irascibles, including Pollock, Reinhardt, Motherwell and de Kooning, co-signatories of a momentous letter objecting to the aesthetic conservatism of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in 1950. This singularity proved fateful. “I am known more for that darn photo,” she once remarked, “than for 80 years of work.” At Victoria Miro you can see one of Sterne’s most sublime works, in which several horizontal bars, lavishly painted in glowing hues against a variety of opalescent whites, creams and greys, rise in a storeyed format above one another. Together they conjure repeating seashores stretching away into the distance. Horizontals invoke horizons, almost invariably, in abstract painting, and Sterne plays upon this romantic tendency in the mind’s eye to imagine the beautiful impossibility of a never-ending mirage. Sterne showed at New York’s famous Betty Parsons Gallery, alongside her fellow irascibles and many other American stars, from Joseph Cornell to Jasper Johns. But Parsons (1900-82) was a considerable artist in her own right. Anyone who associates her mainly with an unfailing eye for new gifts might look at her own, in the lush and gorgeous End of Winter, where soil-brown and deep green curves press against each other with energetic force. As in life so in art: the world’s surface stirs with new life. I have never seen the art of Paule Vézelay, one of Britain’s first abstract painters, who was born Marjorie Watson-Williams in Bristol in 1892 but shed her humdrum English name on an early trip to Paris. Silhouettes, painted there in 1938, is a zany array of biomorphic forms, somewhere between planets, fruit and exclamation marks, ultramarine and black against a pale ground so that they dance abruptly on the eye. Vézelay was forced to leave the painting behind at the outbreak of war; it was saved, but many others were lost. Vézelay had to wait until the age of 90 for her first public survey, at the Tate Gallery in 1983. She died the following year. The American artist Helen Frankenthaler (1928-2011), who effectively invented colour field painting, wasn’t honoured at the Museum of Modern Art until after her death though she was acknowledged as a towering figure of postwar abstraction. She is represented here with a wildly gestural work, more calligraphic than the diaphanous “soak stain” canvases for which she is known, and perhaps more explosive. Until I saw this show, I had no idea that Nicolas de Staël had a subtle follower in the Belgian painter Ilse D’Hollander (1968-97), whose gravely beautiful canvases hold rectilinear forms and monochrome colours in quizzically balanced variations. D’Hollander killed herself aged 29. Nor had I come across Howardena Pindell (born 1943), who decoupled pointillism from image so that her millions of coloured points float free, creating an atmosphere of their own, in this case the drift of flickering light through a glade. Or Jay DeFeo (1929-89), whose White Water, from the last year of her life, sets the liquid paint scudding and frothing over the canvas. DeFeo once showed with her compatriots Frank Stella and Ellsworth Kelly, but over here her name has slipped between the slats. To see all these works in London, for the first time, is both momentous and poignant. Of course there are well-known artists here too. A wonderful late ab-ex Lee Krasner (1908-84), involving skeins of delicate ochre and sepia, is perfectly calculated in scale and movement to give an effect of hazy distance brought into momentary focus. The venerable British painters Prunella Clough, Sandra Blow and Gillian Ayres, who alas died last week, are all here, along with a fine white-net Kusama and a non-objective composition by Liubov Popova, Russian constructivist, from 1918. Joan Mitchell’s Red Tree is tremendously arboreal, a blaze of sudden glory conveying all the excitement of looking deep into mysterious thicket. Anyone at all interested in painting might want to start with the early 20th century in Mayfair and move to Wharf Road for more recent work, witnessing the abundantly various approaches to abstraction over time – conceptual, geometric, gestural, hard-edged, romantic, numinous, optical, comic. Neurons and Noise, by Bharti Kher (born 1969), in which a million bindis scintillate across a sizzling plane of circles, sets off vibrations for both eye and mind. Mary Weatherford (born 1963) has a burst of green light on Coney Island flaring up in vinyl and neon paint. Moon, by the Brazilian artist Adriana Varejäo (born 1964), doesn’t appear abstract – a great disc, its surface cracked, revealing a secret dust beneath – until you stand back and witness its eerie geometry. Dala Nasser (born 1990) paints with latex on used trauma blankets, turning refuse into glittering abstract banners. All anthologies are inevitably partial, and perhaps some of the wittiest imaginations here – Mira Schendel (1919-88) and Mary Heilmann (born 1940) – aren’t perfectly represented. One tiny Agnes Martin grid, attempting quietude in the throng, will hardly convince. But the immense range is a blessing, not least because it scotches any notion that women could ever think or paint alike; though they might easily share the same obstacles. Some of these painters were once known as the wives of more famous artists. I won’t repeat the diminution by mentioning those men’s names. Most astonishing, for me, is the American artist Pat Steir’s fiercely beautiful September North China Sea (1994-95), a cascade of dark marks on an umber ground, made with the sheer forces of gravity and liquid. Calligraphy, rain, watercolour art, a twist of Chinese scarlet at its centre: the painting carries a vast culture, geography and climate in its delicate torrents. Steir is 78, and still her marvellous work comes as a surprise. If only more shows were like this one – bringing forward the new, while bringing back the absent legends. • Surface Work is at Victoria Miro Mayfair and Victoria Miro Wharf Road, London; until 16 June and 19 May respectively"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"sport/2018/apr/12/kyron-mcmaster-lets-tears-flow-gold-follows-coach-death","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-12T17:34:15Z","webTitle":"Kyron McMaster lets the tears flow after gold follows coach’s death | Martha Kelner","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/apr/12/kyron-mcmaster-lets-tears-flow-gold-follows-coach-death","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/apr/12/kyron-mcmaster-lets-tears-flow-gold-follows-coach-death","fields":{"headline":"Kyron McMaster lets the tears flow after gold follows coach’s death","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Kyron McMaster did not succumb to tears when he received his gold medal inside the Gold Coast’s Carrara Stadium, waiting instead until he was in relative privacy to release all the pent‑up emotion. “I might not cry out here,” he said. “But when I go back to the hotel, me and my team-mate are going to sit down on the porch and just cry.” The outpouring was not the usual mix of joy or even relief an athlete might experience after years of hard work culminates in a major medal. For McMaster, one of the hottest young talents in athletics, it was grief and regret that the man to whom he owes so much of his success could not be there to watch him win his first senior title. McMaster’s former coach Xavier Samuels, known as Dag, was one of 134 people killed last September when Hurricane Irma ravaged the Caribbean. The British Virgin Islands, where McMaster is from, was among the worst hit by the most powerful Atlantic storm in history. Most of the buildings on the island were either damaged or destroyed and 6,000 people, one fifth of the population, were left homeless. McMaster soon discovered the storm had claimed the life of Samuels, who had been his coach for seven years and fell from a roof during the hurricane. “Me and my cousin were clearing a road when my father called me back up into the house,” he said. “It was the day after the hurricane. My coach’s sister lived right down the hill from us. She told my father and my father told me. I said every day immediately after that: ‘I don’t want to continue track because I really have very little motivation left because I lost someone very close to me.’” With the main stadium on the British Virgin Islands decimated by the hurricane McMaster was persuaded to relocate to South Carolina where he now trains at Clemson University under his new coach, Lennox Graham. Winning the 400m hurdles in an impressive 48.25sec, well clear of his nearest rivals Jeffery Gibson of the Bahamas and Jamaica’s Jaheel Hyde, McMaster said he had been driven by the trauma and upheaval of recent times. “With the hurricane, the loss of my coach, moving to a new coach, changing to a new programme, adapting to a new life it’s been a hard six months on me,” he said. “My family and friends we just made it through together. We know how much this would have meant to my coach.” McMaster is the first Commonwealth champion the British Virgin Islands has had and the territory’s most successful sporting export. He hoped his latest triumph would help its inhabitants recover from tragedy. “My country is the motivation for me right now,” he said. “I’m just searching for ways to help everyone get through this with me. I know they’re back home celebrating. They’re all gathered in one big spot to watch the race on one big TV and it’s 5.45am in the morning. Even if I came last they would’ve still loved me.” England’s Jack Green finished fourth in the final at his first Commonwealth Games and has overcome his own struggles to even be on the start line. The 26-year-old, who suffers from depression, took almost two years out of the sport before returning to competition and said racing can still be a struggle mentally."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2018/apr/11/psg-may-face-uefa-sanctions-overvalued-qatari-deal","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-11T20:13:42Z","webTitle":"Paris Saint-Germain may face Uefa sanctions for over-valued Qatari deals","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/apr/11/psg-may-face-uefa-sanctions-overvalued-qatari-deal","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/apr/11/psg-may-face-uefa-sanctions-overvalued-qatari-deal","fields":{"headline":"Paris Saint-Germain may face Uefa sanctions for over-valued Qatari deals","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Uefa has informed Qatar-owned Paris Saint-Germain they may face sanctions for breaches of financial fair play rules, relating to huge deals with Qatari sponsors which a preliminary investigation has found to be excessive. The deals, in particular a sponsorship of PSG by the Qatar Tourism Authority thought to be paying €120m annually, have been assessed for Uefa by an independent marketing consultancy as far above genuine commercial “fair value”. The formal investigation into PSG’s finances was begun following last summer’s transfer window in which the club spent £198m signing the Brazil striker Neymar, followed by a loan deal with an option to sign the French forward Kylian Mbappé, valued at £167m. Around European football there were widespread complaints PSG must have been breaching FFP rules, which are aimed at restraining the growth in players’ wages by requiring Europe’s clubs to spend within their income and not make huge losses. Javier Tebas, the president of La Liga, accused PSG of financial doping and “peeing in the swimming pool” and promised to formally complain to Uefa. Tebas also accused Manchester City, owned by Sheikh Mansour of Abu Dhabi’s ruling family, of similarly receiving excessive money from Abu Dhabi sponsorships. City, though, did not face an accelerated investigation, and their “related party” sponsorships are thought not to be on the same scale as PSG’s with the QTA. In this second phase of FFP’s implementation, losses are restricted to €30m over three seasons, with extra expenditure allowed for investment in sustainable areas including stadium development and youth academies. Money paid in by owners is not treated as income, as Uefa decided it is not a stable way for clubs to be financed, and too many were falling into financial difficulties in the 2000s. Crucially, owners cannot disguise their funding by paying money in other ways, so if sponsors are “related parties” to the owners, the value of the sponsorships is assessed to be sure it is a fair value, market price. PSG, bought by Qatar Sports Investments in 2011, announced their first deal with the Qatar Tourism Authority shortly before its accounts were assessed by Uefa last time. Following an investigation in 2014, Uefa’s club financial control body (CFCB) agreed a settlement with sanctions against PSG, having determined the fair value of the QTA sponsorship was “significantly below that submitted by the club”. This time the CFCB’s “investigatory chamber” commissioned a prominent independent marketing company, Octagon, to value the current QTA deal. Octagon are understood to have assessed the deal’s benefit to the QTA is very much less than the money the QTA is paying PSG. So PSG faces sanctions and Uefa a very public test of its robustness in applying its FFP rules. The club are understood to have commissioned their own independent valuation, and to be arguing the sponsorships are fair value, given the increased profile generated by the Neymar and Mbappé signings. A spokesman said Uefa does not comment on ongoing investigations, but confirmed the investigatory chamber will meet on 20 April, although a final decision on PSG is unlikely then."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"technology/2018/apr/11/susan-fowler-uber-interview-forced-arbitration-law","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-11T22:02:56Z","webTitle":"Susan Fowler's plan after Uber?

Tear down the system that protects harassers","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Susan Fowler has a simple explanation for her decision to become a whistleblower: It was her only option. The software engineer had no idea that a blogpost detailing her experience of sexual harassment and discrimination at Uber would spread across the globe and pave the way for the ousting of the company’s CEO, Travis Kalanick, and many powerful men in tech. The impetus for publishing the 2,900-word story was an obscure legal clause that prevented her from seeking justice in court. “I was appalled I had unwittingly signed away my constitutional rights,” the 26-year-old told the Guardian. “Somebody had to step up.” Fowler, whose name has become synonymous with the fight for gender equality in the workplace, is now using her accidental celebrity status to fight what’s known as “forced arbitration”. It’s a practice that allows companies to push employee complaints into secretive hearings, which hide labor violations from the public, silence victims with non-disclosure agreements and often protect serial offenders. The system has been widely used for decades, but the standards of what’s acceptable in corporate America have dramatically shifted since Fowler came forward. Much of the contemporary #MeToo reckoning can, in fact, be traced back to her 19 February 2017 blog, which foreshadowed the Harvey Weinstein scandal and the uncovering of sexual harassment and abuse in entertainment, media, publishing and a plethora of industries. Fowler is modest about her impact and in a recent wide-ranging interview said she remained surprised about her fame in the tech world and beyond: “I’m still processing.” Although she’s outspoken on Twitter and graced the cover of Time magazine alongside Taylor Swift and Ashley Judd as the “Silence Breakers” Person of the Year, Fowler said she is “really introverted and really shy”, adding, “It’s hard for me to get out there and talk.” But speaking about arbitration and new California legislation to combat the practice comes easily to Fowler, who is now on maternity leave from her job at the tech company Stripe: “This would be the biggest thing you could do to stop the cycle of harassment, discrimination and retaliation in the workplace.” Part of the reason her account of “One Very, Very Strange Year At Uber” went so viral was that by all measures it seemed she did everything right to speak up about documented and blatant harassment – yet was failed at every step. She alleged that as soon as she was hired, a manager sent her inappropriate messages over the company chat, but that HR brushed aside her complaint and told her to find another team. Fowler wrote that the company protected this man despite claims from multiple female engineers, and despite evidence of numerous instances of discrimination, a manager threatened to fire her if she continued reporting to HR. Eventually, she quit. “I think about what I went through and even worse what I saw some of my co-workers go through,” she recalled, “and I think what would make it so this would never happen again?” The stories of abuse Fowler has heard since speaking out have been devastating, she added: “They ruin lives. They destroy careers. This is such unnecessary suffering.” Fowler said she was shocked when she realized that Uber effectively forced all its workers as a condition of employment to waive their basic rights to even allege labor violations in court. And so did every other company in the industry and beyond. “I didn’t know how systemic of an issue it was.” Fowler, who said she no longer uses Uber to get around, has recently been outspoken about another population affected by her former company’s tactics – passengers who say they were sexually assaulted by drivers. In March, court records revealed that the company has tried to stop a class-action lawsuit by forcing women into individual private arbitration, a move that critics say would cover up a pattern of abuse. Fowler is now advocating for a proposed California bill that would prohibit employers from forcing staff to waive their right to bring labor claims in court. In addition to women in tech, the legislation aims to support vulnerable low-wage and “gig economy” workers who suffer wage theft, discrimination, harassment, assault and other abuses, but are often unable to file complaints due to mandatory arbitration clauses, said the California assembly member Lorena Gonzalez Fletcher, who is introducing the bill next week. “You have women from all walks of life really standing together and saying, hey this affects all of us.” California often leads the nation in progressive labor protections, but corporations have used arbitration to essentially erase those gains, added Caitlin Vega, the legislative director of the California Labor Federation, the bill’s sponsor: “Our goal is to restore workers’ access to a fair and open process.” While companies like Uber and Google say they strive to be leaders in diversity and inclusion, they have openly resisted these reforms. Microsoft announced it was ending forced arbitration in harassment cases earlier this year, but no other big companies have followed. Fowler argued that the industry’s stubborn commitment to the status quo directly impedes diversity efforts at the notoriously male-dominated tech firms.

The Google executive wasn’t very receptive, Fowler said. Uber’s new CEO also recently told Fowler on Twitter he would “take a look” at her suggestion, but it’s unclear if the company is considering reforms or would oppose the legislation. An Uber spokesperson claimed the company currently has an “opt-out provision” for arbitration, but declined to say when it was adopted or comment further. Google did not respond to inquiries.

A tweeted message from Naomi Long, the leader of the cross community Alliance party, led to demands from the defence team of the players and two friends that the trial be stopped. The controversy only came to light after the judge in the trial, Justice Patricia Smyth, lifted most of the reporting restrictions on the case after a hearing on Wednesday. Details were revealed of how the barrister representing Ulster and Irish international Stuart Olding described Long’s tweet as “the straw that has broken the camel’s back in this case”. Frank O’Donoghue QC had made his remarks in court but with the jury not in the courtroom at Belfast Laganside courts on day 40 of the 42-day trial. Long posted her tweet after O’Donoghue described “middle-class girls” who were in the house at the time of the alleged rape. In response Long posted on Twitter: “I genuinely have no words for how atrocious this statement is. ‘Middle-class girls?’ What? Because working-class girls wouldn’t care/don’t matter/think rape is normal? What is the implication of that comment even meant to be?” The Alliance party leader’s comment was then re-tweeted 36 times and received 277 likes, the court was told at the time of the trial. O’Donoghue said he was “aghast” that the former East Belfast MP had tweeted an opinion on the case which was still ongoing, having not attended the trial. He argued that the tweet could influence the 11-strong jury as the Alliance party had 10% of the vote and was the third-largest political party in Belfast. O’Donoghue said Long’s intervention “is such to create a substantial risk of prejudice. That this cannot be cured. And that, regrettably, this jury shall now have to be stood down and discharged.” However Smyth rejected O’Donoghue’s application to collapse the trial due to the tweet. Paddy Jackson alongside Stuart Olding were cleared of rape last month in a high-profile trial in Belfast in which their two friends Blane McIlroy and Rory Harrison were found not guilty of indecent exposure and perverting the course of justice. The revelations over the legal argument about Long’s tweet only emerged on Wednesday after a number of Belfast-based media organisations mounted a legal challenge to have reporting restrictions lifted regarding the trial. Long has yet to respond in person to the revelations but the Alliance party said in a statement: “We are always conscious of our responsibilities when making any comment related to live court proceedings and exercise great care to avoid any remarks which would be construed as prejudicial. “The tweets related to a comment from a counsel’s closing address regarding class and not evidence before the court, so were entirely unrelated to and made no reference or inference whatsoever to the guilt or innocence of those on trial.” The Alliance party statement stressed that the trial judge had disagreed with the defence team and refused to dismiss the jury. Earlier on Wednesday, supporters of the two Irish rugby players took out a full-page newspaper advertisement demanding they be reinstated for both province and country. The advert in the Belfast Telegraph states that as “Ulster and Irish rugby fans we want these innocent men reinstated and rightly allowed to resume their roles for both both and country. The IRFU (Irish Rugby Football Union) should take note of the silent majority and not bow to the court of social media.” The supporters of Jackson and Olding pointed out that both men have apologised for the content of WhatsApp messages. “What is reprehensible is the extent of the social media backlash aimed at incriminating men unanimously acquitted of any crime. We are fed up with this cyber persecution.” The full-page advertisement written in red ink on a white background is signed: “Real fans standing up for the Ulster men.” Their backing for Jackson and Olding who are currently suspended for all Ulster and Ireland duties comes just ahead of a planned protest outside the Kingspan Stadium in Belfast on Friday. Feminist groups and other campaigners are holding a demonstration at the home of Ulster rugby ahead of the province’s clash with Welsh side Ospreys on Friday evening. They want Ulster and Ireland to ban the pair from playing."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/apr/12/homes-jobs-future-global-capitalism-mainstream-political-parties","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-12T05:00:23Z","webTitle":"People want homes, jobs, a future: no wonder they distrust capitalism now | Larry Elliott","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/12/homes-jobs-future-global-capitalism-mainstream-political-parties","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/12/homes-jobs-future-global-capitalism-mainstream-political-parties","fields":{"headline":"People want homes, jobs, a future: no wonder they distrust capitalism now","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"It’s just like old times. Donald Trump has picked a fight with China over trade and he is at odds with Russia over Syria. Relations between Beijing and Moscow are getting closer as the former communist superpowers confront the old American enemy. A regional conflict in the Middle East is a means by which the United States and Russia can engage without actually coming to blows – until now at least. Welcome to the new cold war. The clock has been turned back to the days before the Berlin Wall came down. History tells us that the first cold war lasted from 1945 until 1990, and was won by the west. Capitalism triumphed over communism, freedom over tyranny. The early 1990s witnessed a victory roll for markets: economic shock treatment was administered to the former Soviet Union and its satellites; a global free trade deal was wrapped up; and parties of the left got with the programme. They stopped talking about socialism and embraced the need for greater competition, efficiency and labour market flexibility. The centre of gravity of politics shifted. Before the collapse of the Soviet Union, the middle ground in the west was halfway between full-blown communism at one extreme and full-blown capitalism at the other. From the late 19th century onwards, the fear that the working classes would be seduced by Marxism prompted parties of both left and right to introduce reforms intended to knock some of the rough edges off capitalism. Bismarck was won over to the idea of old age pensions; the welfare state in Britain was started by the Liberal government of 1906; Roosevelt came down hard on Wall Street during the Great Depression. There were plenty more concessions after the second world war. With the Red Army occupying eastern Europe and strong communist parties in France and Italy, the generosity of America’s Marshall plan was not just philanthropy. It was also the result of fear of communism and a feeling that if capitalism couldn’t deliver for ordinary people, they had somewhere else to go. This anxiety dwindled over the decades as it became clear that the Soviet Union’s economy worked a lot better when the need was to provide tanks and aircraft for total war than it did to produce consumer goods in peacetime. The end of the cold war removed the threat of an alternative ideology altogether. So the new middle ground – the third way – moved closer to an undiluted form of capitalism. To take just one obvious example, the economic strategy being proposed at present by John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor – higher personal and corporate taxes, state ownership of the public utilities and the railways, a national investment bank – would have been firmly in the social democratic mainstream when the cold war was at its height. Now it is seen as so extreme that Labour dissidents are – in another echo of the past – toying with the idea of forming a new centrist party. In the new post-cold war politics, parties that once believed their job was to make capitalism work for voters now believed their task was to make voters fit for capitalism. State intervention did not cease, it merely took a different form. Governments might have believed they could do nothing to prevent communities wiped out by deindustrialisation and were no longer to guarantee full employment as they once had, so instead they used welfare reform to get the unemployed to take low-paid jobs and tell the poor that they needed to smoke less, drink less and eat more healthily. State control over the people replaced state control over the economy as the focus of policy, and it didn’t really matter whether the voters liked the tough love or not, because there was nowhere else to go. The austerity policies of the past decade saw the full flowering of the new politics. Those who were responsible for the biggest financial crisis since the second world war went unpunished; those who were innocent felt the full force of deficit-reduction programmes. There was nothing like Marshall aid for Greece when it was experiencing a 30% fall in GDP, no writing off of the country’s debts as there was for West Germany in 1953. It is now almost three decades since the cold war ended, and few hanker for a return to the days when the iron curtain divided Europe. Yet the promises made in the early 1990s have not been fulfilled. Liberalising markets did not lead to economic nirvana; instead the orgy of speculation unleashed led to the financial crisis of 2008. Living standards have continued to rise in the west, but more slowly than they once did. Productivity growth has stalled. In the UK, personal debt levels are not much lower than they were before the crash. The country that has done best in the post-cold war era – China – has done so with a version of the old middle way. Strong growth has meant a stupendous fall in poverty rates over the past four decades but movements of capital have been carefully regulated, trade barriers have remained higher than in the US or Europe and the state has maintained ownership of large chunks of industry. China has become more market friendly but only up to a point. The decision to embrace the discipline of the global marketplace has proved disastrous for parties of the centre left. They did well enough during the late 1990s and early 2000s, when cheap imported goods flooded in from China, but were bereft of ideas when the global economy hit the wall in 2008. Where there would once have been a plan to re-regulate capitalism there was instead an intellectual vacuum. There are some obvious lessons to be drawn from this. The first is that the mainstream parties need to come up with policies that do things for people rather than do things to people. The record shows that the managed capitalism of the cold war delivered better results than the unmanaged capitalism since. The second lesson is that voters don’t buy the idea that global capitalism is a force of nature – the economic equivalent of the “beast from the east” – that cannot be tamed. That’s why Trump’s proposed tariffs on Chinese imports and McDonnell’s plan to nationalise the utility companies are proving popular. People want now what they have always wanted: a job, decent pay, a pension, a roof over their heads and a sense that their children will be better off than they are. They can’t understand why the global economy can’t deliver today what nation states could deliver half a century ago. There is one final lesson. If mainstream parties don’t come up with the answers, the evidence is that voters will look elsewhere for solutions. The rise of populism explodes the myth that they have nowhere else to go. • Larry Elliott is the Guardian’s economics editor"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"news/2018/apr/11/corrections-and-clarifications","type":"article","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-11T19:59:11Z","webTitle":"Corrections and clarifications","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/apr/11/corrections-and-clarifications","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/2018/apr/11/corrections-and-clarifications","fields":{"headline":"Corrections and clarifications","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"• An article investigating the under-representation of BAME people on British magazine covers last year cited Office for National Statistics ethnicity data for England and Wales from 2011.

Age: 45. Appearance: A tumbler filled with a spirit of some kind, usually whisky. Doesn’t sound wildly interesting. There’s one additional, non-standard ingredient. Go on ... A mummified toe. Gulp. Indeed. But don’t gulp too hard or you might swallow it. I’ll try not to. Where can I try this unlikely concoction? At the Sourdough Saloon in Dawson City. Where is Dawson City? In Yukon territory, Canada. Head for Alaska and veer right, dodging the bears. And why do they drink liquor with mummified toes? Good question. First, there’s not a lot to do in Dawson City, especially in the winter. Second, it’s good for business at the saloon. Third, the prevalence of frostbite up near the Arctic Circle means there’s a ready supply of toes to dunk in much-needed strong drinks. Urgh! How did the tradition start? In the 1920s, miners Otto and Louie Liken did some rum smuggling on the side. On one run, while being pursued by mounties, one of the brothers – there is lively argument over which – got frostbite in a toe. To stop it becoming gangrenous, the other brother hacked – or shot – it off. They kept the trophy in their shack, where it was discovered 50 years later by an entrepreneur. In 1973, he developed the drinking ritual to prove you were a “true Yukoner”. Any rules? “You can drink it fast, you can drink it slow, but the lips must touch the toe.” You get a certificate if you follow the rule; 100,000 people have qualified. Is the original toe still in use? Sadly not. In 1980, it was swallowed by a local miner who was trying to beat the sourtoe record. On his 13th cocktail, his chair tipped backwards and he swallowed it. The digit was never found. But ... Best not to ask. There have been seven toes since, with some being lost or stolen along the way. The bar must always be on the lookout for more toes. Indeed. Enter Briton Nick Griffiths, a 46-year-old former Marine commando. I’m sensing this may be the news peg. Well spotted. A little late in the day, but we got there. While training for the 300-mile Yukon Arctic ultramarathon, Griffiths lost three toes to frostbite. A Canadian nurse told him about the cocktail and he’s planning to send his toes to Dawson City as backup. He even hopes one day to go there and drink them. Not literally. No, just let his lips touch them in the approved manner. Not to be confused with: Rusty nail, the Savoy corpse reviver, Missouri mule, Madagascan pickled penis sundowner. You made that up. Of course I did. Who would call a drink a rusty nail?

The Mary river turtle is one of the most striking creatures on the planet, and it is also one of the most endangered. The 40cm long turtle, which is only found on the Mary river in Queensland, features in a new list of the most vulnerable reptile species compiled by the Zoological Society of London (ZSL). Despite the turtle’s punk appearance – derived from vertical strands of algae that also grow on its body – its docile nature made it historically popular as a pet. Gill-like organs within its cloaca – an orifice used by reptiles for excretion and mating – enable it to stay underwater for up to three days, but it was unable to hide from the pet collectors who raided its nests during the 1960s and 1970s. The turtle is placed at 30th on ZSL’s Evolutionarily Distinct and Globally Endangered (Edge) list for reptiles. First established in 2007, Edge lists have previously been published for amphibians, birds, corals and mammals, helping guide conservation priorities for 100 most at-risk species. Each species is given a score which combines extinction risk with its evolutionary isolation or uniqueness, with the latest list supported by a study in the journal Plos One. Top of the list is the Madagascar big-headed turtle, which has an Edge score higher than that of any other amphibian, bird or mammal, and is still taken for food and global trade. Other unusual and endangered species include the Round Island keel-scaled boa from Mauritius, a snake which is the only terrestrial vertebrate known to have a hinged upper jaw; the minute leaf chameleon from Madagascar which is the size of a human thumbnail; and the gharial, a slender-snouted fish-eating freshwater crocodile. Less than 235 gharial survive in the rivers of northern India and Nepal. Rikki Gumbs, co-ordinator of Edge reptiles, said: “Reptiles often receive the short end of the stick in conservation terms, compared with the likes of birds and mammals. However, the Edge reptiles list highlights just how unique, vulnerable and amazing these creatures really are.” He added: “Just as with tigers, rhinos and elephants, it is vital we do our utmost to save these unique and too often overlooked animals. Many Edge reptiles are the sole survivors of ancient lineages, whose branches of the tree of life stretch back to the age of the dinosaurs. If we lose these species there will be nothing like them left on Earth.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"stage/2018/apr/18/am-dram-amateur-theatre-troupes-musicals-welwyn-thalians","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-18T06:00:16Z","webTitle":"Some enchanted evenings: my part in Welwyn Garden City's am-dram dynasty","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/apr/18/am-dram-amateur-theatre-troupes-musicals-welwyn-thalians","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2018/apr/18/am-dram-amateur-theatre-troupes-musicals-welwyn-thalians","fields":{"headline":"Some enchanted evenings: my part in Welwyn Garden City's am-dram dynasty","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"“How do you measure a year in the life?” asks the closing number of Jonathan Larson’s Rent. It’s one of several musicals I know word for word – and one of several my mother is “not too sure of”. And I know the answer to its question: you can measure the years of my life in musicals. I held my first boyfriend’s hand through Little Shop of Horrors. I came out as queer halfway through rehearsals for My Fair Lady. My birth was announced on the opening night of The King and I. I didn’t choose this life; I was born into it. My family has been part of the amateur theatre scene in Welwyn Garden City, Hertfordshire, since 1929. That’s four generations. My dad’s side of the family staged plays at the Barn theatre, my mum’s side put on musicals with the Welwyn Thalians Musical and Dramatic Society. Each year of their lives and mine has been mapped by the tensions and tribulations of mounting two or three productions, usually from the classic canon of Gilbert and Sullivan, Rodgers and Hammerstein and a regular churning out of Oliver! during “harder days / Empty larder days”. (Sorry. I can’t stop myself.) Though my experience of am-dram was unusually immersive, it’s a world known and loved by many across the UK. There are more than 2,500 member societies of the National Operatic and Drama Association, and many more guerrilla operations. My research suggests that on any enchanted evening you are no more than 100ft from an open audition for South Pacific. In the case of Welwyn’s Thalians, nine decades have seen a predictable diminishing from an almost unbelievable heyday. When my great-grandmother was at the directorial helm in the 1930s, shows would pack out with half the population of the embryonic new town. Casts were large, runs were long, the line between amateur and professional was much murkier (Oscar nominee – and later Dame – Flora Robson was an early and active Thalians supporter.) Additional late trains were scheduled to take audiences back from Welwyn to London. I followed in Gran’s tap shoes from the ages of seven (as a member of The Wizard of Oz’s Lullaby League) to 18 (Harmonising Servant #4 in My Fair Lady). Partly for the love of it, partly because it was cheaper for my family to cast me and my brother than to find a babysitter on rehearsal nights. We swelled the ranks of plumbers from Luton, sales assistants from Stevenage and most of Hertfordshire constabulary as cowboys and can-can dancers, with wobbly eyeliner and suspect accents. Membership was predominantly white and middle class, like most of home counties suburbia, yet the feel was and is inclusive. Anyone who walks through the door is welcome to join – am-dram needs the bodies for the chorus numbers, you see, as long as they can hold a tune. And even that rule is regularly waived. It is difficult to paint it three-dimensionally when explaining it to other people, but, for me and my family, the Thalians was so much more than a hobby. It was a secret language, it was a palace we played in, it was a vast library of librettos and anecdote and local names that we knew intimately. We were privy to the inner sanctums of this world – the gossip, the committee decisions (my grandfather being chairman). We could read the cast list on the kitchen table, its ink still wet, while my mother rang round with the good news and the difficult conversations. Our wardrobes were half-requisitioned for costume storage, our car journeys earmarked for harmonious pre-rehearsal rehearsal. Alas, the dynasty was sundered by my moving to London for uni and starting a career in queer performance and live art. My lifestyle and politics now tend to jar with the conservative values of am-dram. I wince at the same lines I once sang (other than A Woman’s Touch from Calamity Jane, which elicits a knowing snort of laughter). I keep the two sides of myself in contact, however, which has made for some interesting crossover episodes. I bring my mother to a lot of live art made by friends and collaborators (she has asked several award-winning artists how on earth they learned all those lines). In turn, I brought the acclaimed lesbian performance-maker and Guggenheim fellow Lois Weaver to my mum’s Guys and Dolls. I spent most of my early 20s revelling in my liberal bubble. But recently I’ve developed more ambivalent feelings about my identity as a small-town exile. If you have left a place – a home town, a lifestyle, a community theatre group – it is tempting to dismiss everything of that time as an irrelevant preamble to the main event, when you step on stage as the person you want to be viewed as. Perhaps, though, it is worth a return visit: to reconcile those versions of yourself and find what might be worth holding on to, salvaging or celebrating. Where am I left standing? A progressive, gender-queer performance-maker with a penchant for conservative musical theatre? Or a Thalian on sabbatical, waiting to make my grand return when the amateur rights are released for Fun Home? I’m still working that out – and I am, of course, doing a show about it. My mother, meanwhile, is doing Made in Dagenham. I, AmDram by Hannah Maxwell is at Camden People’s theatre, London, from 1-3 May."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"fashion/2018/apr/28/the-best-face-masks-beauty-sali-hughes","type":"article","sectionId":"fashion","sectionName":"Fashion","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-28T07:00:08Z","webTitle":"The best face masks | Sali Hughes","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2018/apr/28/the-best-face-masks-beauty-sali-hughes","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/fashion/2018/apr/28/the-best-face-masks-beauty-sali-hughes","fields":{"headline":"The best face masks","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"I’m a curmudgeon about face masks, putting me out of step with the beauty community, which can’t get enough of them. My issue is not with masks in principle, but their ambitious claims and high customer expectations. I see face masks are a relaxing treat and believe they can temporarily improve skin appearance and texture, making them ideal as a weekly or pre-party boost. What I don’t buy is their doing lasting good, and I fear they encourage a curative, rather than preventive, mentality. Taking proper daily care of your skin with cleanser, flannel, acid, serum and moisturiser will yield far greater results in the long term than a weekly blitz with anything. But, for ephemeral loveliness, I do love Beauty Pie’s Advanced Serum-Infusion Sheet Masks (£13.82 for five for members), which are biocellulose (meaning they’re able to hold more moisture than paper), so are extremely wet, but any excess sinks in with light massage. The complexion emerges plump, smooth and moist, making the sheets perfect for flights, if you can bear to appear to fellow passengers like Hannibal Lecter on the gurney. Sheet masks are wasteful (arguably less so than pots, though, which routinely languish unfinished in the bathroom, the formula spoiling and the plastic unable to justify its own existence), so I favour reusables. Nannette de Gaspé’s dry sheet masks (imprinted with ingredients) are my favourites, but the cost of their technology makes them prohibitively expensive. So I’m delighted with Miss de Gaspé, a new, more moderately priced version. While still by no means cheap at £30, each of these fabric masks can be used up to three times and gives the best results of any I’ve tried. Brighten Beam is perfect when things look dull, imparting brightness. If a disposable still offends (we’ll be seeing more compostable versions soon), try a Korean washable sheet mask (about a fiver on Amazon or eBay, and much of a muchness). The principle is simple: the silicone mask is placed over skincare, preventing evaporation and intensifying results (just as you might wrap conditioning masked hair in clingfilm). Alternatively, take a piece of muslin, cut out holes for eyes and nose, soak in any treatment essence and/or oil you fancy, drape over the face and relax."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"global-development/2018/apr/12/food-waste-recipe-for-disaster-global-hunger-fight-shoppers-warned-world-food-programme","type":"article","sectionId":"global-development","sectionName":"Global development","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-12T06:00:23Z","webTitle":"Want to save the world from hunger?

The World Food Programme has launched a social media movement, #RecipeforDisaster, with the aim of making the public more conscious of the food waste they generate. It is hoped the initiative, which is being launched in Britain first before being rolled out globally, will encourage people to share recipes online and make a donation. Although there is enough food in the world to go around, one-third of the 4bn tonnes produced each year is wasted, costing the global economy nearly $750bn (£530bn) annually. A recent study found that no African country is likely to reach the UN target of ending childhood malnutrition by 2030, and that malnutrition indicators remained “persistently high” across the length of the Sahel, with 14 countries affected. “If we can tackle the problem of food waste, we could feed 9 billion people every day,” said Corinne Woods of the WFP. “In developing countries the majority of food is wasted in storage and production, which WFP is helping to address with new technologies and community education. However, in the developed world most food is lost on the plate. Recipe for Disaster aims to confront this issue and get people to take action by creating a meal and making a donation.” On a typical day, the WFP has 5,000 trucks, 20 ships and 70 planes on the move, delivering food and other assistance to those most in most need. Every year, it distributes approximately 12.6bn food rations. The campaign encourages consumers to check for food close to its best-before date that is still edible. Despite concerted efforts to reduce food waste through the entire supply chain, the British government’s waste advisory body, Wrap, says £13bn-worth of edible food is thrown out in the UK every year. With consumers often unaware of the difference between a use-by and a best-before date, Wrap is overseeing a major simplification of labelling."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2018/apr/11/slow-uk-economic-growth-is-not-just-a-cold-weather-trend","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-11T17:49:59Z","webTitle":"Slow UK economic growth is not just a cold weather trend | Larry Elliott","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/apr/11/slow-uk-economic-growth-is-not-just-a-cold-weather-trend","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/apr/11/slow-uk-economic-growth-is-not-just-a-cold-weather-trend","fields":{"headline":"Slow UK economic growth is not just a cold weather trend","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The UK economy had a poor start to 2018.

Most City economists think it will be 0.3%, down from 0.4% in the final three months of 2017. At one of Britain’s long-established thinktanks, the National Institute for Economic and Social Research, they think it could be as low as 0.2%. There are reasons to think the position is not quite that gloomy. The unexpectedly cold weather, especially the snow at the end of February and the beginning of March, stopped work on building sites and prevented consumers from getting to the shops. On past form, there will be a bounceback in activity in the second quarter. The first quarter number may also be revised upwards. Even so, it is still obvious that the economy has lost momentum in recent months. Last year’s story was of weaker but better-balanced growth, with consumer spending muted by industry doing well. This year’s story, so far, has been weaker growth, pure and simple. There are reasons factory output has stalled. Sterling has been rising on the foreign exchanges as the markets have started to bet against a cliff-edge Brexit. That makes exports more expensive at a time when demand from the rest of Europe has faltered. After years of underinvestment, it is also the case that manufacturing has lacked the capacity to meet rising demand. The pound rose against the dollar after the news in anticipation of a quarter-point hike in borrowing costs from the Bank of England next month. This looks a bit curious. Threadneedle Street is clearly worried about wage inflation picking up, but in the past the Bank’s response to such data would have been to cut borrowing costs, not raise them. Why the pay gap extends to pensions Three years have passed since new rules came into force allowing people over 55 to draw money out of their accumulated pension pots to live on when they stop working. The new arrangements are designed to provide more choice, but as new research from the financial firm Zurich UK has shown, they have also highlighted how the gender pay gap extends beyond retirement. Over the course of their working lives, women tend to earn less than men. Inevitably, therefore, they also tend to stick less into defined contribution pension schemes. That, in turn means, the average woman starting to draw down her pension has a pot of £132,000 compared with £212,000 for the average man. Assuming a 3% annual yield, that would provide a man with an annual income of £6,360 according to Zurich’s calculations, while a woman would get £3,990. Clearly, women will have smaller pension pots than men until such time as they have equality in lifetime earnings. In the meantime, they would need to get a yield of 5% on their investments in order to achieve the same annual income as men. That’s achievable, but only by taking more of a risk with the money carefully accumulated over the decades. Tesco bucks the trend The past year has been tough for the retail sector. A big structural shift – the relentless growth of online shopping – has coincided with a cyclical downturn caused by the impact of higher inflation on family budgets. Almost 6,000 shops across the UK closed last year – the biggest casualty list since the economy was clawing its way out of recession in 2010. All of which makes the performance of Britain’s biggest retailer – Tesco – impressive. In the year to February, the company saw operating profits rise by 28% and gained market share in food despite the strong competition from Aldi and Lidl. The City liked what it saw in the Tesco numbers on Wednesday. For a start, Tesco seems to have recovered from the time three years ago when it announced a £6.4bn loss – the biggest in British high-street history. Secondly, while it is still early days, investors think the takeover of the food wholesaler Booker will pay off. Finally, cost-cutting and greater efficiency meant profit margins rose to 3% in the second half of the year, making a 2019-20 target of 3.5%-4% look achievable, especially if, as looks likely, falling inflation and rising wages gradually boost consumer spending power."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/apr/12/wealth-inequality-reasons-richest-global-gap","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-12T08:00:26Z","webTitle":"Wealth inequality is soaring – here are the 10 reasons why it’s happening | Dominic Frisby","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/12/wealth-inequality-reasons-richest-global-gap","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/12/wealth-inequality-reasons-richest-global-gap","fields":{"headline":"Wealth inequality is soaring – here are the 10 reasons why it’s happening","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Damning statistic follows damning statistic on wealth inequality. The latest, from the House of Commons, is that by 2030 the richest 1% will own two-thirds of global wealth. The distribution of wealth – or rather the lack of it – may well prove to be the defining issue of our age. Such inequality has provoked revolution and revolt in the past. It will do so again, unless we fix it. It’s true that wealth inequality has always existed, no matter what the design of the society. Whether capitalist or communist, democratic, autocratic, or plutocratic, it will exist. Yet many of the extremes we see today are avoidable. They come as a result of an unlevel playing field, the direct consequence of certain government policies. Here, in my eyes, are the top 10 causes of wealth inequality, in reverse order. The tax code George Osborne and Gordon Brown are the chief architects of a tax code that is now the longest in the world – in excess of 10m words and 21,000 pages. (Too long by about 20,500 pages, I’d say). The few have the resources to find the loopholes, of which there are many, and exploit them. The many don’t, so end up paying more on a proportional basis. Do we really need 12.5 times the number of words in the Bible to explain how much tax people should pay? Bank bailouts If I manage my business imprudently, I go bust. Why should banking get special favour? It’s an example of one rule for some, another for the many. Quantitative easing Money printed as part of quantitative easing (£435bn in the UK and counting) is created out of nothing. It goes straight into the financial sector, pushing up the prices of financial assets. Great for those who own said assets, or work in related sectors, but not for most people. Who actually voted for quantitative easing and bailouts anyway? No one. Central banks are unelected bodies. Planning laws Like the tax code, planning laws are so onerous that only the few have the resources to navigate them. Thus housebuilding has mostly become the preserve of a few large corporations. I’d love to build my own house. Wouldn’t you? Tough luck. Not measuring inflation properly In the 47 years since 1971, the money supply has increased by 67 times, growing at around 11.5% a year. The Bank of England uses a measure of inflation called CPI, which tracks the prices of certain everyday consumer goods, to set interest rates. But CPI only measures the effects of around 10% of this newly created money. It ignores property and financial assets, where 77% of newly created money has ended up, so prices have risen unchecked. It’s one reason we have seen such runaway house price inflation in recent decades. Great if you own property or financial assets. Not so great if you don’t. Government subsidies We tend to measure a subsidy’s success in terms of the benefits gained by those who receive it. Rarely do we consider the unseen costs and unintended consequences. For example, help to buy was meant to help young housebuyers; instead, it became a cash cow for building companies, and pushed house prices further out of reach for those not yet on the housing ladder. Housing benefit is meant to help the poorest; yet it pushes up the cost of renting and lines the pockets of landlords. However well-intentioned, subsidies create special interest groups, who then lobby for more subsidy. Even something like agricultural subsidy has gone wrong. Landowners are actually paid to own farmland and can avoid inheritance tax on it. So investors pile into farmland, prices become unaffordable for local farmers and the market is distorted. It’s a straight transfer of wealth from the taxpayer to the landowner. Debt-based money Here’s a little known fact: banks create money when they lend. Excluding QE, 97% of money has been created through lending. When somebody borrows money – even just by spending on a credit card – new money is created. No wonder our economy is so geared around finance. The more money there is, the higher prices will rise. But this doesn’t happen evenly. Prices rise first closest to where new money is created. By the time this newly created money has trickled down to everyone else, prices may have risen, but wages usually haven’t. If you own the assets or operate in the sectors that have benefited from all this newly created money – the financial sector and the London property market – you’ve made spectacular gains. Otherwise not. Zero interest-rate policies When we suppress interest rates, we effectively lower the cost of debt. We might associate debt with poverty, but cheap debt is in fact a luxury of wealthy corporations, families and governments. And they’re the ones who benefit most when interest rates are kept low. Cheap debt just encourages taking on more debt, which ultimately leads to higher asset prices, which those prudent folk who avoided excess debt (or were unable to borrow) must now incur. Why are we subsidising debt, anyway? Income tax If you have nothing, the only way you can narrow the gap between you and those at the top is by working, but you are constantly and heavily taxed on your labour. The wealth of those at the top, meanwhile, doesn’t derive from their salaries, but from the appreciation in price of their companies, their real estate, their bonds and so on, which largely go untaxed, unless they sell (so most don’t). Our society is geared to owning assets. Hard work and productivity are penalised. Successive governments claim to be “supporting hardworking families”. Really? Don’t tax labour so heavily, then. Tax something else – such as land. The decline in the purchasing power of money For a host of different reasons, the purchasing power of money has fallen by 99% in the past 100 years. That’s an average decline of 5% a year. Wages have not risen by the same amount. Those who rely on their salaries to get by have suffered an inexorable erosion of their wealth. Those who own assets have made good. All of these causes of inequality are within the power of government to put right. Ultimately wealth is created by hard work and endeavour, not by reallocation and redistribution. Yet we penalise labour and subsidise both debt and the ownership of assets. All that is required is a level playing field for everyone. Honest money and a simpler tax system, which doesn’t pander to special interest groups, would fix most of the above. • Dominic Frisby is a financial writer and the author of Bitcoin: the Future of Money?"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"music/2018/apr/12/manic-street-preachers-jobs-meaning-jeremy-corbyn-doesnt-understand-that-resistance-is-useless","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-12T11:30:30Z","webTitle":"Manic Street Preachers: ‘Jobs give us meaning – Jeremy Corbyn doesn’t understand that’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/apr/12/manic-street-preachers-jobs-meaning-jeremy-corbyn-doesnt-understand-that-resistance-is-useless","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/apr/12/manic-street-preachers-jobs-meaning-jeremy-corbyn-doesnt-understand-that-resistance-is-useless","fields":{"headline":"Manic Street Preachers: ‘Jobs give us meaning – Jeremy Corbyn doesn’t understand that’","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Nicky Wire and James Dean Bradfield are seated in the latter’s hotel room in Marylebone, central London, ostensibly promoting the Manic Street Preachers’ forthcoming 14th album, Resistance Is Futile, but instead talking about the possibility of Manic Street Preachers splitting up. Wire says he finds the prospect “terrifying”, which is understandable: they have been in the band for 31 years – they formed at secondary school in Blackwood in south Wales – and neither of them seems to know what else they might do. “I can’t go and teach at the Cardiff Institute of Music, you know,” smiles Bradfield. “My first lecture on how to make it in the music business: ‘Piss everybody off, dress like your mum and learn how to play on the job.’ ‘Er … can we have a new lecturer, please?’” Nevertheless, they say, splitting up is a thought that has occurred to both of them in the four years since they last released an album, a trying period during which Wire’s elderly parents fell ill, his mother gravely so, and their Cardiff studio, Faster, was closed after the building that housed it was earmarked for redevelopment and demolished – its closure made the local news in Wales. The process of building a new one, Bradfield protests, turned him into “a low-rent version of what’s-his-fucking-name from Grand Designs”. “He would ring me up and go: ‘I’ve got a bit of bad news – steel prices have gone up,” sighs Wire, with the unmistakable air of a man who didn’t join a band in order to discuss supporting joists. To most observers, the Manics seem to have spent the past decade in the kind of creative Indian summer that has eluded most of their peers. They enjoyed their commercial zenith in the late 90s, when, as Wire disbelievingly points out, they were so big that a single such as The Masses Against the Classes, which opens with a sample of Noam Chomsky and ends with a quotation from Albert Camus’ book The Rebel, could knock Westlife’s Seasons in the Sun off No 1. If they have never recaptured that high point, the past 10 years have still come replete with gold albums, arena tours and critical acclaim. That last record, Futurology, in particular was widely hailed as one of the best records the band has made. But Bradfield says he has found himself wondering if the Manics still had an audience – an odd thing to worry about given the size of the venues they still play, but as he says, the band were always “fucking obsessed with a desire to be huge”. Wire says he has been beset by doubts, not just about their relevance, but the relevance of rock music in general. From the start, at least part of the point of Manic Street Preachers was, as Wire once beautifully put it, “to give clues to a more rewarding life”, to use rock music as a means by which you could transmit ideas about books and films and politics. The journalist Stuart Maconie recalled faxing them, early on in their career, a standard set of questions for a weekly NME Q&amp;A called Material World, and receiving in response a set of “apposite, brilliantly chosen quotations from a whole range of cultural figures – Mao, Philip Larkin, Marilyn Monroe, George Best, Flaubert, Andy Warhol, Heidegger”. But in a world of social media, rock music is clearly no longer the main conduit of youth culture. “It’s dictated by role models, icons, whatever you want to call them,” Wire says. “Music used to be the leader in terms of that, everything about the way we looked growing up was about searching out how to look like those kind of people. Now they’re getting it from avenues that I can’t comprehend why they’d want to.” He sighs. “The emptiness of it. Actually, I feel a certain sense of pity, because I think our youth was so definite and tangible and exciting and full of space to dream and magic and all those kind of ephemeral things. Whereas now, it’s just ratcheted at you at such a fucking speed. And we all know, because we’ve all got kids, and you try to kind of … not influence them, but pass on things that made your life magical, and they just seem completely fucking irrelevant. It’s not nostalgia, that’s a key thing; it’s actually things just disappearing. It’s like the NME closing, that was the worst thing about it: it’s just another nail, telling you music is less relevant.” Nevertheless, he says, “the one thing I know for certain, in this world of absolute doubt and uncertainty, is that when the three of us get in the studio, there is still a magic there”. Hence they didn’t split up, and while Resistance Is Futile certainly doesn’t shy away from addressing the band’s doubts – they are there in everything from its title to its cover photo, featuring “one of the last samurai warriors – someone who knows his time is over thanks to the coming of the gun” – it arrives filled with brashly anthemic songs that deal in what Wire calls “ecstatic miserablism … effervescent melancholy”. He says he feels “drained of intellectual stamina … That’s why I don’t think anyone should be in charge of a political party at 75 or something, because at 50, I’m fucking struggling.” He also claims he was incapable of the effort that went into researching Futurology’s theme of “connecting Europe through art movements, like an antidote to politics” – during which he became so “obsessed with things like [Futurist poet] Mayakovsky and Malevich’s Black Square” that the rest of the band “didn’t know what I was fucking on about”. But Resistance Is Futile’s songs are as lyrically rich as ever. They variously touch on the doomed, booze-sodden marriage of Dylan Thomas and Caitlin Macnamara, the “seismic cultural gap” revealed by the death of David Bowie (“I don’t think there’s ever going to be anybody to replace him: that self-made, that extravagant, intellectual, playful, funny, gorgeous, best hair ever, best clothes ever – how can that happen again from a working-class background in Brixton?”), the paintings of Yves Klein and the story of Vivian Maier, the Chicago nanny who had a double-life as a street photographer, quietly taking 150,000 photos of US cities and society that were only discovered, to vast acclaim, after her death. The latter’s story keys into another of Wire’s obsessions about the internet era: that nothing is ever truly secret, that everyone’s lives are constantly documented and held up to public scrutiny. “One of the greatest things Francis Bacon ever said was that you self-realised,” he says. “There was a period of five years in his life, literally no one knows what the fuck he did. He destroyed everything he painted, there were rumours he was an interior decorator, he was in Berlin … Just no one knows what went on for that period, and that can never happen again, that self-realisation where you really form yourself through isolation and scarcity and ideas. I actually feel sorry for the generations coming after us, because of that. How can you do it? Everything is there, laid out for you to be embarrassed by when you’re older, without realising. All our embarrassing songs that we wrote when we were 15, you know, thank fuck no one heard them. So there’s humiliation, as well, that idea of one false step … If you look back at me and Richey at the start, fuck me, we’d have been killed today. I dread to think what I would have put James and Sean through, because some of the interviews are just … there’s so much talk, and it’s only by the end that we talk any sense. But that was the process, wasn’t it, of just going through all that stuff.” There is also a considerable amount of fretting about politics, which seems faintly surprising: given the band’s past political allegiances to Tony Benn and Arthur Scargill, I had assumed they would be quite gung-ho for Jeremy Corbyn, but apparently not. “I’m coming around to him a lot more, but not gung-ho, no,” says Bradfield. “I’m not one of those people that goes on about the liberal elite in London, but I don’t think he understands what makes the working classes tick outside of London and that is just hardcore industries. We’ve operated at our optimum as people when jobs give us meaning, and in the post-industrial hinterlands, he doesn’t understand that. I remember somebody at a meeting down in south Wales, an old guy, ex-miner, wanted his son to have a proper, real, blue-collar job, and he was saying: ‘What do you expect us to do, Mr Corbyn, make fucking love spoons out of hemp?’ I don’t think Jezza gets it, I don’t think he connects with people on that level, which is part of the reason we’re having political problems in Wales.” Wire says he’s “completely baffled by my own political vacuum” since Brexit: “A lot of it’s just about political intelligence, the frustration where I think we grew up in a time when there was a lot of political intelligence on both sides, to be honest. Now … there’s never any answers, it’s just statement after statement of opposing vitriol, you know, which I just … I just can’t see a middle way at the moment.” And Bradfield and Wire go off on a lengthy tangent about politics: they talk, as much to each other as to me, about Tony Benn’s notion of the EU as “a gentleman’s club for millionaires” and how the remain campaign failed because it didn’t make enough of the EU’s failings and the need to reform it, whether or not the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, is “an old-school totalitarian communist” (this, I should point out, is a phrase Wire uses with approval, rather than censure), and the proposed 2016 closure of the Tata steelworks in Port Talbot. They don’t, it has to be said, sound much like an irrelevant band stuck for things to say. “There is a sense of a massive fun and excitement being in our band,” says Wire. “Every record we’ve made recently, whether you like them or not, they’ve all been convincing. It’s still full of vitality. You can’t really fake that. We have to be completely committed to this.” He smiles. “At our age, if you’re not, then it’s fucking over.” Resistance is Futile is released on Columbia on 13 April"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"news/2018/apr/13/weatherwatch-europe-has-a-history-of-fatal-tornadoes","type":"article","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-13T20:30:02Z","webTitle":"Weatherwatch: Europe's fatal tornadoes","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/apr/13/weatherwatch-europe-has-a-history-of-fatal-tornadoes","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/2018/apr/13/weatherwatch-europe-has-a-history-of-fatal-tornadoes","fields":{"headline":"Weatherwatch: Europe has a history of fatal tornadoes","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"For most of us the word “tornado” conjures up images of vast “twisters”, like the one that ripped through the US state of Kansas and whisked away Dorothy and her dog Toto in the 1939 film The Wizard of Oz.

During the last 200 years Europe has suffered three tornadoes with death tolls of over 50 people: Ivanovo in Russia in June 1984 (69 fatalities), Oria in Italy in September 1897 (55 fatalities) and Montville in France in August 1845 (at least 70 fatalities).

New research published in the journal Weather, Climate and Society, reveals that we could expect as many as 170 fatalities, up to 2,500 injuries, and serious damage to 25,000 buildings.

Khalifa al-Obeidi, a spokesman for Haftar’s Libyan National Army, denied the claim as fake news generated by Haftar’s opponents, and his aides pointed to undated photographs of Haftar inspecting troops inside Libya. But media organisations including Le Monde and France 24 reported claims suggested that Haftar, aged 74, had indeed suffered a stroke. Haftar was reportedly taken from Jordan to Paris earlier this month. Some separate medical sources confirmed that the self-appointed Field Marshal had been taken ill, but said he was improving and not in a critical condition. Haftar’s departure from public life for an extended period, or questions about his capacity, would throw the already deeply chaotic Libyan politicical situation into further disarray. Haftar has been strongly supported by Egypt and the United Arab Emirates. His Libyan National Army, largely based in the east of Libya, has been making steady military progress, but has been criticised for using brutal methods in a country overcome by civil war almost ever since the toppling of Colonel Gaddafi in 2011. He has been the leading opponent of the UN-backed Libyan government based in Tripoli, led by Fayez al-Sarraj. Nevertheless, he has been received in both Paris and Rome as an important interlocutor for the west as it tries to bring the civil war to an end and to control the flow of migrants from the Libyan coast into Italy. Haftar’s spokesman said the reports were being generated by those fearful that the Libyan National Army was making military progress, including its capture of the town of Derna. The scale of the disruption in Libya was underlined by a UN report on Tuesday that said armed groups in Libya were holding thousands of people in prolonged arbitrary and unlawful detention, and subjecting them to torture and other human rights violations and abuses. “Men, women and children across Libya are arbitrarily detained or unlawfully deprived of their liberty based on their tribal or family links and perceived political affiliations,” the report by the UN Human Rights Office says. “Victims have little or no recourse to judicial remedy or reparations, while members of armed groups enjoy total impunity.” The report says that since renewed hostilities broke out in 2014, armed groups on all sides have rounded up suspected opponents, critics, activists, medical professionals, journalists and politicians. Hostage-taking for prisoner exchanges or ransom is also common. Around 6,500 people were estimated to be held in official prisons overseen by the judicial police of the Ministry of Justice in October 2017. There are no available statistics for facilities nominally under the Ministries of Interior and Defence, nor for those run directly by armed groups. The report says armed groups routinely deny people any contact with the outside world when they are first detained. “Distraught families search for their detained family members, travel to known detention facilities, plead for the help of acquaintances with connections to armed groups, security or intelligence bodies, and exchange information with other families of detainees or missing persons,” it said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/apr/11/trent-alexander-arnold-liverpool-fear-no-one-champions-league","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-11T21:30:13Z","webTitle":"Trent Alexander-Arnold says Liverpool fear no one in Champions League","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/apr/11/trent-alexander-arnold-liverpool-fear-no-one-champions-league","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/apr/11/trent-alexander-arnold-liverpool-fear-no-one-champions-league","fields":{"headline":"Trent Alexander-Arnold says Liverpool fear no one in Champions League","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Trent Alexander-Arnold has said Liverpool fear no one in the Champions League semi-final draw on Friday and believes his game reached new heights after being targeted as a weak link by Manchester City. The 19-year-old excelled in both legs of the quarter-final and insists a sixth European Cup triumph is a realistic aim for Liverpool given the manner of their 5-1 aggregate defeat of the runaway Premier League leaders. Alexander-Arnold, who was nine the last time Liverpool reached the Champions League semi-finals, scored the opening goal of an unbeaten campaign by Jürgen Klopp’s team in the play-off win at Hoffenheim. He claims there is no team, past or potential, in the competition who intimidate Liverpool. “Throughout the whole tournament there hasn’t been a team who strike fear in us,” he said. “We’ve looked at it from the start that we’re in it to win it. As it goes on, you get closer and closer to getting that chance to win it. We’ve taken another step closer to the final and there are still two more games ahead of us. Whoever we draw on Friday, we’ll look forward to the game and hopefully get to the final.” The defender’s confidence was echoed by Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, who believes the City victory will have an impact on the remainder of Liverpool’s season. “To beat City twice is no easy feat,” the England midfielder said. “We did it twice in a week and earlier this season. It shows us that when we are at the races and at the right level we can beat anyone in this league. Hopefully now it is on us – whoever we get in the next round – to prove we can beat anyone in Europe as well.” Pep Guardiola and his team sought to exploit Alexander-Arnold’s inexperience in the quarter-final, particularly in the first leg at Anfield, only for the Liverpool-born defender to thrive in his duel with Leroy Sané. “I guess Man City looked at it and felt I was the weak link,” the teenager said. “Maybe that gave me that underdog mentality and I tried to prove them wrong. That’s what I went out to try and do – prove them wrong and show them I’m not the weak link in the team. “I think over the two legs I did my best to win my personal battles and help us win the tie. It was a different test for me. It was a bigger, harder test. I had to play to a better level than I’ve probably ever played before. It tested me to a new level and now I know that I’ve got that in me. That is the level I need from myself to keep my standards really high and to hopefully be able to play in these elite European games and come out on top.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"stage/2018/apr/15/the-way-of-the-world-the-country-wife-plastic-review","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-15T07:00:07Z","webTitle":"The week in theatre: The Way of the World; The Country Wife; Plastic – review","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/apr/15/the-way-of-the-world-the-country-wife-plastic-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2018/apr/15/the-way-of-the-world-the-country-wife-plastic-review","fields":{"headline":"The week in theatre: The Way of the World; The Country Wife; Plastic – review","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Restoration drama has in the past week been restored to the London stage. And here are two arguments for why that’s a good thing: utterly different productions of plays by Williams Congreve and Wycherley. Both demonstrate, to an age inclined to under-writing, the delights of intricate expression. Both present to a sentimental epoch the astringent possibilities of scepticism. Both challenge a theatrical shibboleth. When desperate, and not laughing, you are supposed to be able to know that a Shakespeare play is a comedy because it ends in marriage. But matrimony here is a fearful thing. A financial cage from which people flit for pleasure. Nowhere is this more dazzlingly portrayed than in The Way of the World, yet its first staging in 1700 was a flop: Congreve retired aged 30. The play does have hazards. The plot is so corrugated that it makes sense simply to go along with what is evident – the need for ex-rake Mirabell to unlock an inheritance and marry his beloved Millamant, and the undermining of his plans by past romances and resentments. Latch on to the local delights until all unravels into a kind of clarity. At the centre (hardly the heart) of the play is a horror story. The Dwindling. In one of the most precisely itemised, gloriously calibrated speeches ever written, Millamant lays down the conditions for her marriage. No pet names, and no having to be nice to fools because they are her husband’s relations. If these and other stipulations are met, she may, “by degrees, dwindle into a wife”. Mirabell makes his own demands (among them are, strikingly, no straitlacing or makeup), but it is the woman who lays down the grounds for a truthful marriage. This is a doubly powerful exchange: driven equally by the feeling of the lovers, sparringly expressed, and their contempt for society’s arrangements. Geoffrey Streatfeild is a subtle, convincing Mirabell. Justine Mitchell is superb as Millament. She has the necessary poise and quickness but also brings something unexpected. In a world of subterfuge she is candid. Not merely bewitching but lovable. Haydn Gwynne – got up like Marie Antoinette’s idea of a shepherdess in a frou-frou frock – is a tremendous, toppling feat of self-deception, sad and ridiculous: “O, nothing is more alluring than a levee from a couch in some confusion.” The comic highpoint is Fisayo Akinade as – “I make remarks” – Witwoud. Bewildered by his own preposterousness, he totters around as if he were balancing a pile of epigrams on his head. I can’t remember when I last saw an actor who seemed so effortlessly funny, instantly able to capsize an audience. This success, helped by Anna Fleischle’s glowing jewel-box design, proves the exceptional range of director James Macdonald: one of theatre’s great lights. Having brought flesh to the brilliant, bony structures of Caryl Churchill’s plays, he now makes clear the structure beneath the flim-flam of high-speed talk. From the earthiness of Arnold Wesker’s Roots he turns to the acidity of Restoration rapier speak. Alex Beckett – Barney Lumsden in W1A – was very funny and nimble as a pivotally deceiving character: Waitwell. Tragically, Beckett died suddenly last week. The Donmar cancelled the rest of the week’s performances as a mark of respect. At Southwark, Morphic Graffiti bring clarity, speed and vigour to their adaptation of Wycherley’s story of an innocent young woman tethered to an old goat. Abandonedly lewd – from the pun in its title to the pretended, much discussed impotence of one character – The Country Wife ends in calculation, with the heroine looking forward to a life of lying (my pun) and “a dance of cuckolds”. You need to go prepared for this young company to live up to their name: they morph plays and graffiti their talent over it. But every moment is directed with conviction by Luke Fredericks. The action is transplanted from 1675 to the 1920s – with bright young things prancing their way through dilemmas. Fredericks has a background in dance which tells in the fluid display of the evening. Scene changes are performed by the cast, who scythe their way across the stage in silk pyjamas and clinging robes, bumping bums, shimmying, cha-cha-cha-ing. Another rhythm is set up between private and public speech. Any aside by a character – this production makes you realise how many there are – is accompanied by a dipping of light. It’s an impressive technical feat by lighting director Sam Waddington; it also repunctuates the play, giving it the flicker of film. It becomes not only a series of dialogues between characters but a series of internal discussions. With a witty apogee when one aside, frozen in light, consists only of a gasp. Ever since I saw Thomas Coombes in Tooting Arts’s Barbarians I have wanted to see him on stage again. Two years ago he steamed with fury. Here he is in Plastic, Kenneth Emson’s part-rhyming play, first seen as a work in progress at the 2015 Latitude festival, about the legacy of teenage bullying. He is again furious – and remarkable. As a put-upon, simmering schoolboy (“Think Columbine,” he repeats to himself) he has a face like a fist and a body bunched up with hurt. I’m amazed telly hasn’t snaffled him. There is plenty more talent in Josh Roche’s pacey production. Mark Weinman as the cool schoolboy; Madison Clare as the temptress teenager; Louis Greatorex as the dark joker. Sophie Thomas’s design sends lightbulbs zinging on wires, bringing flashes of colour to a dark place. This echoes Emson’s script: punchily written but intermittent, stronger on pulse than on plot – and packing in a young audience.

No MLS team has ever won the annual club competition in its current iteration with only two – Real Salt Lake in 2011 and the Montreal Impact in 2015 – having even played in the final. But that patchy record doesn’t mean Toronto FC, who are through to this year’s final after playing to a 1-1 draw with Club América on Tuesday night for a 4-2 aggregate victory, are simply happy to be there. “We didn’t sign up for this tournament to get to the final, we signed up to this tournament to try to win it,” Toronto coach Greg Vanney said afterward in a press conference. He added: “We are not happy with just being in the final. We have another very good team in Chivas Guadalajara [to play in the final]. ... We have to find our way through that one to win the championship, so we’re not done and we’re not happy just with just being where we are. We have a lot of work still to do.” Toronto FC advance to the home-and-home total goals final against Chivas, who haven’t won a Concacaf trophy since 1962 and will be itching to be making their own bit of history. Vanney put out the same starting lineup from last week’s 3-1 win in the first leg, but substitutes Victor Vazquez, Chris Mavinga and Justin Morrow were unavailable. Missing the playmaking Vazquez became an issue early as striker Jozy Altidore went down in the seventh minute with an injury. He was replaced by Tosaint Ricketts. Osorio scored in the 11th minute, taking a pass from Ricketts just before the penalty box and slotting the ball neatly into the net for a 1-0 lead. It was Osorio’s third goal of the Champions League tournament. Toronto defender Eriq Zavaleta seemingly scored an own goal in the 20th minute, tying the game 1-1, but the assistant referee raised his flag for an offside call after the near score. Toronto goalkeeper Alex Bono made an impressive save in the 27th minute, getting a single hand on a sharp standing header from Club América midfielder Alex Ibarra, deflecting the ball wide of the net. Bono came up big again five minutes later, throwing his hands up for a close-quarters save on Bruno Valdez, catching his own rebound to quiet Club América’s offense. The Toronto FC goalkeeper stepped up again in the 63rd minute, jumping to get a glove on the ball and tip a well-placed strike from Alejandro Diaz over the crossbar. Bono charged forward to put his body on a cross in the 77th minute, getting to the ball before a hard-charging Club América forward. As the game wore on Toronto captain Michael Bradley moved further and further back, helping to shore up TFC’s defense. His presence made a difference in the 80th minute when he stopped a potential breakaway by Diaz. Club América had a free kick right on the edge of the penalty area in the 84th minute, with goalkeeper Agustin Marchesín coming up to take the shot so his teammates to load up the box. His shot was blocked by Toronto FC’s wall, defusing the threat. Andres Uribe tied it for Club América in the second minute of injury time on a penalty kick."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/blog/2018/apr/12/barcelona-waning-powers-iniesta-suarez-messi","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-12T07:59:25Z","webTitle":"Waning powers of Iniesta and Suárez point to change at Barcelona | Jacob Steinberg","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2018/apr/12/barcelona-waning-powers-iniesta-suarez-messi","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/blog/2018/apr/12/barcelona-waning-powers-iniesta-suarez-messi","fields":{"headline":"Waning powers of Iniesta and Suárez point to change at Barcelona","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"If it was possible for Barcelona not to become overwhelmed by despair when they fell to Juventus last season, there was no way for them to rationalise their stunning collapse against Roma on Tuesday. Succumbing to the best team in Italy and a fellow European giant did not feel like a drama, even though they had started the tie as slight favourites. But folding so meekly against Roma has exposed a deeper malaise. Roma should not be patronised given they have taken some serious scalps, from finishing top of a group that contained Atlético Madrid and Chelsea to overcoming the awkward challenge of Shakhtar Donetsk in the last 16, to keeping out Lionel Messi over 180 minutes. It was a formidable effort from Eusebio Di Francesco’s side, who left the Stadio Olimpico in a state of ecstasy as they overturned a 4-1 deficit from the first leg, and they have yet to concede a goal at home in this season’s Champions League. Their next opponents would be foolish to underestimate them. For all the accolades coming their way Roma are a team lacking obvious star power. They are fourth in Serie A, it is 17 years since their last Scudetto and they had not reached a European Cup semi-final since 1984. Not unreasonably, Barça celebrated drawing them last month instead of another heavyweight – and that is why their third consecutive quarter-final exit smarts so much. They had travelled to Rome holding what should have been an impregnable lead. Yet the whiff of decline was hanging over them by the end of a riotous match and the alarming thing for Barcelona is that this has been coming. The warning signs were there when Neymar departed for Paris Saint-Germain last summer. They lost the Spanish Super Cup to Real Madrid, causing Gerard Piqué to say he felt “inferior” to the team from the Bernabéu for the first time in his career, and although they are set to win La Liga, Ernesto Valverde’s men have rarely convinced in their toughest European assignments. A 4-1 aggregate victory over Chelsea in the last 16 masked slow and disjointed displays, with Messi seizing on errors by Antonio Conte’s team, and Barcelona were often bereft of fluency in the first leg against Roma, who were punished for sloppy defending at the Camp Nou. In the return Roma found the ruthlessness to target Barcelona’s flaws, highlighting the imbalance of Valverde’s 4-4-2 system and the increasing dependence on Messi, whose frustration was encapsulated by a cynical trip on Aleksandar Kolarov. Barça were bereft of penetration in the wide areas, with the full-backs, Jordi Alba and Nélson Semedo, unable to advance, and nothing damned them more than being outplayed in the area where they used to be untouchable. The inclusion of Sergi Roberto as an extra shield in midfield revealed how Barcelona have misplaced their identity. There was too much caution and not enough control or incision, but perhaps that was no surprise. Andrés Iniesta, who hinted he may have played his last Champions League game, is 33. Sergio Busquets is 29. Xavi Hernández left three years ago. A strength has become a weakness and that meant there was little protection for a vulnerable defence, with Edin Dzeko bullying Piqué and Samuel Umtiti. “We didn’t know how to respond,” Busquets said. Admittedly there were mitigating circumstances. Philippe Coutinho was cup-tied after forcing his transfer from Liverpool in January. Ousmane Dembélé, who was signed with the Neymar cash, has struggled to regain his rhythm after a thigh injury. It is easy to imagine them thriving when Coutinho and Dembélé are operating in tandem with Messi. Where Luis Suárez fits in remains to be seen, though. The Uruguayan was the deadliest striker in the world after signing from Liverpool in 2014, combining beautifully with Messi and Neymar at times and destroying the continent’s best defences on his own at others, but he is 31 and his powers are waning. Suárez’s opportunistic strike in the first leg against Roma was his first goal in the Champions League since March 2017, a staggering statistic, and he spent most of Tuesday’s match being knocked around by Roma’s defenders, that extra half a yard of pace no longer there, his trademark spikiness never materialising. It was not just his booking for timewasting that summed up the striker’s lame performance, it was the moment when Iniesta released him on the left and he did not have the speed to escape his markers. Suárez is approaching the end of the line and he is not alone. Others will have to be replaced if a new imperial era is to begin. Regeneration is required and Valverde, who replaced Luis Enrique last summer, deserves the time to oversee it given Barça remain unbeaten in the league and face Sevilla in the Copa del Rey final next weekend. Yet there are more questions than answers as the season draws to a close. Difficult decisions must be made. This champion team’s wrinkles are starting to show."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"media/2018/apr/11/netflix-sued-lawsuit-allegations-cash-bonuses","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-11T20:06:19Z","webTitle":"Netflix sued over allegations of 'rigged' bonus payments to top executives","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/apr/11/netflix-sued-lawsuit-allegations-cash-bonuses","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2018/apr/11/netflix-sued-lawsuit-allegations-cash-bonuses","fields":{"headline":"Netflix sued over allegations of 'rigged' bonus payments to top executives","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Netflix is facing an investor lawsuit that alleges board members “rigged” top executives’ bonuses to pay them millions regardless of how well the company performed. The lawsuit, filed by the City of Birmingham Relief and Retirement System, claims the Netflix board “rigged the compensation process, guaranteeing Netflix officers huge cash payments while misleading investors into believing that these payments were justified by attainment of real performance goals”. The complaint comes three months after Netflix converted its executives’ cash bonus system into salary under Donald Trump’s new tax law – a change that ensures executives are paid in full regardless of company’s performance. The lawsuit claims Netflix’s chief content officer, Ted Sarandos, will receive a salary of $12m for the current year – more than last year’s salary and cash bonus combined. The chief product officer, Greg Peters, will get $6m in salary, also more than his combined total for 2017, according to the suit. The suit alleges Netflix rigged the system so it could claim tax deductions and hand out bonuses irrespective “of achieving real accomplishments that serve the company and its shareholders”. The lawsuit went on: “To qualify as ‘performance-based’ the compensation must, among other requirements, be contingent on the attainment of one or more pre-established, objective performance goals.” But according to the complaint, Netflix’s global subscriber-based performance goals were nearly always hit, with what the Financial Times last year described as “uncanny accuracy”. Investors wondered if hitting its numbers so precisely was a fait accompli. The complaint reads: “By July 2017, Netflix’s top officers had hit their target squarely in seven out of eight quarters, missing by just one percentage point in the other quarter. This artificial precision resulted in the company paying these officers approximately $18.73m out of a target pool of $18.75m.” The distinction is important for Netflix, because if bonuses are not performance-based that could become a tax code violation. Under the guidelines, executive bonuses above $1m could be deducted from corporate taxes – but only if “the outcome is substantially uncertain”. Prof Steven Balsam, a Temple University accounting professor, described the scenario of a company claiming an inherently unpredictable business model hitting its targets so squarely and consistently as “suspicious”. “Either they are somehow changing to the targets, or they’re managing to the targets,” Balsam told the Guardian. Regulatory filings show Netflix’s three top executives at the time – Sarandos, Peters and Neil Hunt – hit their targets in seven out of eight quarters between the beginning of 2015 and the end of 2016. The company’s filings showed it never exceeded forecasts, and only missed by just one percentage point in one quarter. The company’s overall revenue target of $8.276bn was exceeded by $12m, or 0.14%. That meant that out of a target pool of $18.75m, Hunt, Peters and Sarandos collected $18.7295m. But that contrasts with Netflix’s claim that its subscriber base is unpredictable, with profits and subscriber numbers often differing widely from company forecasts. In July last year, for instance, Netflix reported 5.2 million new subscribers in the second quarter compared with its own prior estimate of 3.2 million. Balsam said: “That again is an interesting signal, a red flag perhaps, to dig deeper. Revenue is almost totally off the subscriber base. How can you predict revenue but not the two factors that go into revenue?” Last year, Netflix insisted its bonus scheme was compliant with the tax code. It claimed that because its targets are set during guidance early in any given quarter that this makes them “inherently uncertain, and not a foregone conclusion”. Netflix said: “To hit the target, it requires effort and management skill by the executives. It is also a benefit to the company as we receive a tax deduction.” Under the new tax law, performance-based bonuses are not tax deductible. Balsam said: “It seems like it benefits them because it takes some of the risk away. If it’s truly a performance-based bonus, then in some quarters you’re going to miss the targets. But by making it salary, they’re now guaranteed.” In a statement Netflix said: “We intend to respond to these claims at the appropriate time.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/apr/11/danny-drinkwater-move-frustrating-season-chelsea","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-11T16:00:03Z","webTitle":"Danny Drinkwater may seek move after frustrating season at Chelsea","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/apr/11/danny-drinkwater-move-frustrating-season-chelsea","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/apr/11/danny-drinkwater-move-frustrating-season-chelsea","fields":{"headline":"Danny Drinkwater may seek move after frustrating season at Chelsea","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Danny Drinkwater is growing frustrated at his bit-part role at Chelsea and will consider his future at the end of the season after finding opportunities increasingly limited since his arrival from Leicester last summer. The England midfielder was bought for £35m on deadline day in August having made clear his desire to move south – he had even submitted a transfer request to force through the deal – only to succumb to a calf injury on his arrival. He was unable to play at all until the end of October and, having endured other niggling injuries and illness in the period since, has made only five Premier League starts. His last appearance came in the defeat at Manchester City more than five weeks ago and N’Golo Kanté, Cesc Fàbregas and Tiémoué Bakayoko are ahead of the 28-year-old in Antonio Conte’s pecking order. He is expected to depart Chelsea in the summer after a frustrating and acrimonious second season in charge and Drinkwater, who has fallen out of England contention, is expected to make a decision on his future once the identity of the next manager is clear. Regardless of that appointment, the club’s recruitment department is already discussing targets and sales for next season, with changes expected in midfield. There have been suggestions in France of strong interest in Nice’s Jean Michaël Seri, who came close to joining Barcelona last year. The Ivory Coast midfielder, 26, would cost a similar fee to that paid for Drinkwater. Fàbregas will enter the final 12 months of his contract this summer, while there is tentative interest from Monaco in re-signing Bakayoko, though that could yet prove a difficult deal to conclude, despite the France international having struggled to make much of an impact over his first season in England. Chelsea still consider the 23-year-old, for whom they paid around £40m, a player of huge potential. Drinkwater, who had arrived hoping to re-establish his Premier League-winning midfield partnership with Kanté, may still see better prospects of regular first-team football elsewhere. That combination with the Frenchman has been used from the start only six times in all competitions, with Conte’s criticisms of the hierarchy’s transfer business last summer having prompted suggestions he had not prioritised the Englishman’s signing."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2018/apr/11/argentinian-police-officers-dismissed-after-claiming-mice-ate-marijuana","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-11T16:14:59Z","webTitle":"Argentinian officers fired after claiming mice ate half a ton of missing marijuana","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/11/argentinian-police-officers-dismissed-after-claiming-mice-ate-marijuana","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/apr/11/argentinian-police-officers-dismissed-after-claiming-mice-ate-marijuana","fields":{"headline":"Argentinian officers fired after claiming mice ate half a ton of missing marijuana","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Eight Argentinian police officers have been dismissed after claiming that more than half a ton of marijuana which disappeared from a police warehouse had been eaten by mice. The disappearance of the drugs was discovered during an inspection of a police warehouse for impounded drugs in the town of Pilar, 60km outside the capital city of Buenos Aires. The cannabis had been in storage there for two years. But of the 6,000kg that had been registered, only 5,460kg were found. Suspicion fell on the city’s former police commissioner Javier Specia, who had left the inventory for the impounded marijuana unsigned when he left his post in April 2017. His replacement, commissioner Emilio Portero, noticed the shortfall and notified the force’s internal affairs division, who inspected the warehouse. Called before Judge Adrián González Charvay, Specia and three of his subordinates all offered the same explanation: the missing narcotics had had been “eaten by mice”, they said. But forensic experts told the court they doubted even a large number of rodents could have eaten so much marijuana. “Buenos Aires University experts have explained that mice wouldn’t mistake the drug for food, and that if a large group of mice had eaten it, a lot of corpses would have been found in the warehouse,” said a spokesperson for the judge. The four police officers have been called to testify before the judge on 4 May. The judge will seek to determine if the missing marijuana was the result of “expedience or negligence”. Specia also faces an internal police investigation into why he has not yet presented his sworn income statement for 2017."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/blog/2018/apr/12/pep-guardiola-manchester-city-premier-league","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-12T10:19:00Z","webTitle":"Never underestimate how hard it is to win – and manage in – the Premier League | Paul Wilson","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2018/apr/12/pep-guardiola-manchester-city-premier-league","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/blog/2018/apr/12/pep-guardiola-manchester-city-premier-league","fields":{"headline":"Never underestimate how hard it is to win – and manage in – the Premier League","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The image of Pep Guardiola with his head in his hands contemplating Manchester City’s Champions League exit from a seat in the Colin Bell stand is likely to be an enduring one. This, the unwritten caption will say, is what England can do to the world’s finest coaching talent. To be strictly accurate it was not English football’s fault that Guardiola lost it so completely at the end of the first half against Liverpool, it was more a combination of Martin Atkinson and the Spanish referee Antonio Mateu Lahoz. There are only so many staggeringly incorrect decisions a man can take in important games at the end of the season after all, and presumably Guardiola will now have even more sympathy with how Guus Hiddink and the Chelsea players felt when Tom Henning Øvrebø’s comedy refereeing favoured his Barcelona side in 2009. Guardiola said at the time he could understand Chelsea’s frustration, and it is not difficult now to recognise his own. With a modicum of competence from officials – and/or, it must be said, better finishing from Raheem Sterling – City might by now have the league trophy on the sideboard and the satisfaction of at least giving Liverpool a run for their money. As it is, City go to Spurs on Saturday night out of Europe and out of sorts after three consecutive defeats, unable even to wrap up the title by winning at Wembley. This is not the denouement to a majestic season everyone was expecting and no matter what happens over the next few weeks – even if City recover to the extent of winning the title with record numbers of points and goals – the quest for perfection is over. In all probability only Guardiola himself is worried about that; because he believes he is judged more harshly than other managers in England he set himself the task of proving all the critics wrong. While some of the criticism he is receiving is wilfully disproportionate considering what City have achieved in the league, Guardiola is always likely to be haunted by the reflection that the season, and his own behaviour, could have been better. If it is any consolation, he is far from alone in the Premier League in letting standards slip. In this relentless workplace 10 managers have been sacked, which would represent half the table had not West Brom been responsible for two of the dismissals. Of the managers still at the clubs where they started the season, José Mourinho is merely treading water at Manchester United, where many fans were thoroughly disillusioned by the club’s meek exit from Europe, and Antonio Conte has been picking fights with Chelsea throughout a disappointing title defence. Arsène Wenger is in a category of his own in this regard, flatlining as usual with progress in a cup as a side interest, but even allowing Arsenal the benefit of the doubt there are question marks against the names of managers at the above clubs plus Leicester, Everton, West Ham, Southampton, Stoke and West Brom. Again, that is almost half the league, and that is being generous to David Wagner and Roy Hodgson, whose teams have not yet pulled clear of relegation worries. The number of Premier League managers who have managed to enhance their reputations this season is small and comprises just Jürgen Klopp, Mauricio Pochettino, Sean Dyche and Rafael Benítez in the top half of the table. Below them Eddie Howe and Chris Hughton have proved capable, as has Javi Gracia since taking over at Watford, and, while Carlos Carvalhal deserves special mention for immediate impact and significant improvement, Swansea know perfectly well from recent experience it is best to judge a manager over the course of a full season. However bad Guardiola feels at the moment he at least has one trophy in the bag and another shortly to follow. His situation is a lot brighter than that of one of his City predecessors, Mark Hughes, who at the moment is struggling to escape responsibility for getting two teams relegated in the same season. Or Alan Pardew, who somehow managed to make a grim situation at West Brom even worse. Or even Sam Allardyce at Everton, whose famously thick skin appears to prevent him realising how thin his bond with supporters is becoming. Looking at the table, there could easily be half a dozen fresh managerial appointments before the start of next season. For the most part, too, it is experienced coaches and leaders going through the churn. The Premier League is hard to hack. Last year’s champions are looking like missing out on the top four. United cannot be happy with second, Mourinho says so, and improved as Liverpool and Tottenham are they know they have to be pushing for leadership rather than merely settling for finishing above Chelsea and Arsenal. Even Guardiola has just admitted the Premier League is demanding. Previously he has claimed it is no better or worse than Spain or Germany, and he is in a position to know, though after the remarkable reversal of fortune on Saturday he said the unexpected derby result – “United did not have a single shot on target in the first half” – showed how tough the Premier League can be. That was the City manager being philosophical, accepting disappointment with grace, not seeking excuses in his side’s weak finishing or the referee’s performance. The pictures were not beamed around the world as avidly as the ones from pitchside against Liverpool, though the sentiment deserves to be remembered just the same. What should not be forgotten is how difficult it is to win the league, and how easy City have made it look. For all the drama of the past week every other team in England – yes, even Liverpool – would still swap places with them given the chance."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"film/2018/apr/16/is-avengers-infinity-war-an-allegory-for-disneys-world-conquering-master-plan","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-16T09:00:16Z","webTitle":"Is Avengers: Infinity War an allegory for Disney’s worldconquering master plan?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/apr/16/is-avengers-infinity-war-an-allegory-for-disneys-world-conquering-master-plan","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/apr/16/is-avengers-infinity-war-an-allegory-for-disneys-world-conquering-master-plan","fields":{"headline":"Is Avengers: Infinity War an allegory for Disney’s world-conquering master plan?","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Unless you’ve been living in a communications black hole for the past decade, you’ll know that the forthcoming Avengers: Infinity War is the culmination of Marvel’s strategic 10-year comic-book movie masterplan, bringing together the whole stable of superheroes for a blockbuster to bust all blocks. The movie itself is about another masterplan: bad guy Thanos is trying to acquire the all-powerful “Infinity Stones”. If he gets them all, and puts them in his shiny fancy-dress glove – sorry, “Infinity Gauntlet” – he can “wipe out half the universe” with a snap of his fingers. But we can’t ignore the fact that there’s a third masterplan behind all of this. Thanos’s quest mirrors another, less fanciful mission to acquire powerful assets – that of Marvel’s parent company, Disney. For “infinity stones” read “entertainment brands”. Disney bought Marvel in 2009 for $4bn. In 2006 it also bought its animation rival Pixar, for $7.4bn. In 2013, Disney acquired Lucasfilm, owners of Star Wars, for another $4bn. Now it is in the latter stages of a $52bn takeover of rival studio 21st Century Fox, whose properties include most of the Marvel superheroes it didn’t have the rights to already, such as the X-Men, Deadpool and Fantastic Four, plus assorted brands from Alien to Avatar to The Simpsons. So basically, Disney is Thanos, and well on the way to controlling half the movie universe. And while we cheer the Avengers’ noble stand against galactic hegemony on the screen, they’re really on the side of Disney’s corporate hegemony in real life. In 2016, it controlled about a quarter of it: it was behind the year’s five highest grossing movies worldwide, and made a record-breaking $7bn (it only managed the top two movies last year, and four out of the top 10). In recent history, the big six Hollywood studios have held roughly equal sway but if the Fox takeover goes ahead, it will have an estimated 39% market share. And it’s not just the movies. Frozen made $1bn at the box office, but Frozen merchandising made even more. The theme park business, which earns twice as much as the movies do, is expanding hugely – they’re even building a Star Wars-themed hotel. Disney is reportedly planning its own Netflix-style streaming service, which could mean you won’t be able to see its content anywhere else. As a result, looking at Disney’s schedule, we can practically predict the top movies for the rest of the decade: Avengers: Infinity War, Avengers sequel, Han Solo movie, The Incredibles 2, Star Wars Episode IX, Frozen 2, reboots of Mary Poppins, Winnie the Pooh, Mulan, Aladdin, Dumbo, more Marvel movies, and so on. You could call it the Infinity Slate. Where does it end? When the entire entertainment universe is in Disney’s gauntlet? Do the other studios now have to band together to form a rebel alliance? Will franchise fatigue bring the whole magic kingdom crashing down? Unless you boycott movies, your weapons are useless against it. Then again, a Star Wars-themed hotel … pretty cool, huh?

The ultra-processed truth about 10 of our bestselling foods","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"As the saying goes: if your granny wouldn’t have recognised what’s in it, it’s probably not real food. Yet half the food we take home is made in factories from a list of ingredients and additives as long as your arm, most of which never found a place in any grandparents’ kitchen cupboard – and wouldn’t in yours or mine today. We are a nation of ultra-processed-food eaters. Our lives have become too fast-paced to cook from scratch and our tastebuds now crave the sweet and salty flavours that ultra-processed foods deliver. Our bread is fluffy and sticks to the teeth like candyfloss. Our yoghurts are super-sweet and creamy. We have ready meals that are shelf-stable (long life without refrigeration), which we can prise open, heat, eat and go. Nutritionists are alarmed. The ultra-processed foods we tend to eat now are calorie-dense and a major contribution to obesity. They have also been stripped of bioactive compounds such as phytoestrogens and fibre, which we know are good for us. All we get is calories (and occasionally added vitamins). And although individually they are all approved for safety, we have no idea what effect the cocktail of additives might have on us in the long term. The nutritionist Dr Courtney Scott from the Food Foundation says it costs less to fill up hungry kids on ultra-processed foods than fresh. “For £1 worth of spinach, say, you can get 60 calories. For £1 worth of apples you get 307 calories. For £1 of turkey dinosaurs, you’re getting 730 calories. It is not surprising that the foods that are palatable – they are full of salt and sugar and fat – and that are calorie-rich for a low price are the ones that we’re consuming the most of,” she says. A group of international scientists has produced what they call the Nova definition of four classes of food, from fruit and vegetables in their natural state to ultra-processed, which are, they say, “industrial formulations typically with five or more and usually many ingredients”. These include “substances not commonly used in culinary preparations”, and contain additives “whose purpose is to imitate sensory qualities” of natural foods such as fruit. They are, says Prof Carlos Monteiro from the University of São Paulo in Brazil, “intrinsically unhealthy”. “Maybe many of these preservatives are innocuous but even if only 10% or even 1% of them are harmful, people are unnecessarily exposed to harm,” he says. And they are re-educating our taste preferences. “The hyper-palatability tends to make people eat more than they need and make people used to accentuated flavours they will not find in most real foods.” His collaborator Prof Jean-Claude Moubarac, from the department of nutrition at the University of Montreal, Canada, goes further. These foods cause social and cultural damage, he says. “They promote overconsumption and a relationship to food that is characterised by compulsion, stress and anxiety.” We looked at what is actually in 10 of Britain’s favourites, choosing a top seller from 10 categories of packaged foods tracked by Euromonitor International. What is the country eating? Bernard Matthews Turkey Dinosaurs Ingredients: turkey 46%, breadcrumb (wheat flour (calcium carbonate, iron, niacin, thiamin), salt, yeast, turmeric, turmeric extract, colour (paprika extract)), water, rapeseed oil, batter (wheat flour (calcium carbonate, iron, niacin, thiamin), salt), starch, skimmed milk powder, milk protein, salt, potassium chloride, natural flavouring (milk), lemon juice concentrate, spirit vinegar. “Something that has only 46% turkey is going to be full of a lot of other stuff,” says Scott; we should therefore be wary of this, nutritionally, if we’re looking for a healthy source of protein. In spite of the breadcrumbs, there’s not much fibre – 0.7g per 100g once cooked. The company’s website promotes its dinosaurs as “Jurassic fun for kids” with “no artificial colours, flavours or preservatives”, but, says Scott, “I don’t know anyone who would have paprika extract in their home kitchen.” Paprika extract is a highly concentrated oil-soluble extract from capsicum pods. Nor would they have milk protein, which is extracted in a factory, or skimmed milk powder. The dinosaurs also contain two forms of salt – sodium chloride and potassium chloride, making up 16% of a child’s daily allowance in 100g (just over two dinosaurs). Bernard Matthews did not respond to requests for comment. Batchelors Pasta ’n’ Sauce – chicken and mushroom Ingredients: pasta tubes (84%) (durum wheat semolina, wheat flour), maize starch, whey powder (milk), yeast extract, salt, onion powder, flavourings, mushroom juice concentrate (0.5%), vegetable oils (sunflower, palm), dried parsley, sugar, ground turmeric, chicken fat, black pepper extract. Scott says she did a double take at this list of ingredients. “Unfortunately, there is no chicken or mushroom in the chicken and mushroom sauce. There is chicken fat and there is mushroom juice concentrate,” she says. The mushroom juice concentrate will have had the fibre and vegetable micronutrients pounded out of it in the industrial process. Premier Foods, which makes Batchelors and also Mr Kipling cakes, says: “Processing plays a very important role in food safety and preservation. We recognise the importance of healthy lifestyles and balanced choices, and continually work on developing increasingly healthy and convenient options for consumers, as well as having an increased focus on positive nutrients such as fibre and protein.” Drying foods was one of the oldest preservation methods, they say. “Batchelors Pasta ’n’ Sauce is low in fat, has no added MSG and no artificial colours or preservatives.” Young’s Seafood Sticks Ingredients: water, surimi (35%) [processed alaska pollock protein (fish), sugar], potato starch, sugar, wheat starch, salt, rapeseed oil, soya protein, flavourings [contains crustaceans, flavour enhancers: disodium inosinate, ribonucleotides], egg albumen powder, colours: carmine, capsanthin; yeast. A gold star for anyone who knows how surimi is made. It does contain Alaska pollock – but not whole slices or chunks of fish, just the protein; it is fish that has been mechanically beaten and pulverised to a paste. As it is tasteless and shapeless, sugar is added, followed by a host of additives – two forms of starch and some shellfish bits and flavour enhancers – so it can be formed into a solid, fishy-tasting stick. Young’s said it would not be able to comment. Fray Bentos steak and kidney pie Ingredients: water, puff pastry (27%) (wheatflour (with calcium carbonate, iron, niacin, thiamin), margarine (palm oil, rapeseed oil, water, salt, emulsifier (mono- and diglycerides of fatty acids)), water, salt), beef (12%), pork kidney (9%), stabiliser (xanthan gum), modified maize starch, wheatflour (with calcium carbonate, iron, niacin, thiamin), salt, spices, yeast extract, flavouring, tomato paste, barley malt extract, beef extract, chicory extract, sugar, colour (plain caramel), tomato powder, garlic powder. This is one of the bestsellers in Euromonitor’s shelf-stable category. Water is the first item on the ingredients list, followed by the puff pastry. The meat is only a fifth of this tinned pie. “The thing that struck me about this product was the amount of processed ingredients that you wouldn’t find at home – emulsifiers, stabilisers, malt barley extract. It’s a pie but it also has sugar in it,” says Scott. One pie is supposed to be for two people, but “I don’t know who eats half a pie.” A whole one would deliver 60% of the daily salt intake and nearly 20% of fat. There is no veg. “Fresh foods rich in bioactive compounds (flavonoids, for instance), including onions, garlic and other foods used in freshly prepared dishes are absent from these products,” says Monteiro. “Being ready-to-eat products, it is unlikely they will be consumed with fresh foods that usually need preparation. On the contrary, one ultra-processed food tends to be consumed with other ultra-processed foods.” Xanthan gum is not from an exotic tree. It is fermented sugar. The name comes from the type of bacteria used. It is a stabiliser to bind together ingredients such as fat and water that would otherwise repel each other. Fray Bentos did not respond to requests for comment. Warburtons white bread Ingredients: wheat flour [with calcium, iron, niacin (B3) and thiamin (B1)], water, yeast, salt, vegetable oil (rapeseed, sustainable palm), soya flour, preservative: calcium propionate; emulsifiers: E481, E472e; flour treatment agent: ascorbic acid (vitamin C). “As far as we’re concerned, the industrial loaf with all its additives isn’t actually bread,” says Chris Young of the Real Bread Campaign. It is calling for an Honest Crust Act to legally define “sourdough”, “artisan”, “wholegrain” and “craft”, as well as “fresh” and “freshly baked”, and to make manufacturers list all their ingredients – some are left out on the basis that they are just part of the processing. The launch of the Chorleywood Process in 1961 changed the UK’s bread drastically. This was the discovery of how to go from a pile of flour to sliced, plastic-wrapped bread in three to four hours, using lower-protein wheat, vitamin C, fat, yeast and high-speed mixers. Bread gained additives, “relaxants to overcome the stress of the machine and then tighteners again”, Young says. “It was a milestone – or tombstone – in the history of bread.” A Warburtons spokesperson says bread is one of the UK’s main sources of dietary fibre. “It is misleading to consider mass-produced bread an ‘ultra-processed food’. We bake it fresh, every day, using the same methods you would at home. However, in order to meet demand and ensure that we are able to produce affordable products for our consumers, we do this on a much larger scale.” McVitie’s milk chocolate digestives Ingredients: fortified wheat flour (39%) (with calcium, iron, niacin, thiamin), milk chocolate (30%) [sugar, cocoa butter, cocoa mass, dried skimmed milk, dried whey (milk), butter oil (milk), vegetable fat (sal and/or shea, palm), emulsifiers (soya lecithin, E476), natural flavouring], vegetable oil (palm), wholemeal wheat flour (9%), sugar, glucose-fructose syrup, raising agents (sodium bicarbonate, malic acid, ammonium bicarbonate), salt. There is lots of sugar in this, predictably – and not just sugar (twice) but glucose-fructose syrup. Dried skimmed milk will also be sweet. The digestives also contain palm oil, much used in ultra-processed foods. “Health-wise, palm oil is not fantastic because it is a highly saturated fat. It is being used instead of trans fats, which used to be commonly found in this type of product,” says Scott. “From a nutritional perspective, we’ve swapped one particularly unhealthy fat for one that isn’t particularly good for you either.” There are also concerns about the environmental impact of farming and harvesting palm oil. McVitie’s says it provides transparent information so people can make healthy snacking choices. “Biscuits are simply baked by combining a few ingredients. They are a source of fibre and adhere to strict nutrition guardrails,” it says. Müller Corner Crunch toffee hoops yoghurt Ingredients: yoghurt (milk), sugar, water, cocoa butter, milk powder, flour (rice, wheat, maize), cocoa mass, modified starch, whey powder (milk), lactose (milk), flavourings, wheat starch (gluten), caramel, stabilisers: carob bean gum, guar gum, pectins, acacia gum; emulsifier: soya lecithin; salt, barley malt, vegetable fats (palm, rapeseed). Müller says it has removed 13.5% of sugar across its yoghurt range since 2015, but this pot still contains 18.4g per 100g. There is sugar, lactose and caramel in the mix. Making yoghurt at home involves milk and bacterial cultures, says Scott. This one has much more, including four types of stabiliser to stop the ingredients separating. Pectins, among them, are found in fruit and used in jam-making. But here they have been isolated and used together with other additives, which is typical of the process involved in ultra-processed foods. A spokesman from Müller says: “We are fully aligned with the view that a balanced diet and lifestyle is important, but we also believe that it should be permissible for people to enjoy moments of pleasure, which is what this product offers.” Kellogg’s Crunchy Nut Corn Flakes cereal Ingredients: maize, sugar, peanuts (7.5%), barley malt flavouring, molasses, honey (1%), salt, vitamin &amp; minerals: niacin, iron, vitamin B6, vitamin B2 (riboflavin), vitamin B1 (thiamin), folic acid, vitamin B12. Sugar is the second ingredient here – 11g per 30g serving. From a nutritional perspective, maize and sugar are going to be very quickly digested. There is not a lot of fibre to slow the process down, so you are likely to feel hungry sooner. “In addition to it being very sweet and reinforcing that sweet palate, nutritionally this isn’t going to stay with you for very long,” says Scott. Kellogg’s says it provides a variety of convenient, nutritious and high-quality foods, all of which can play a role in a healthy, balanced diet. “Multiple studies have shown that people who start the day with a cereal breakfast tend to weigh less and have improved nutrient intakes,” says a spokesperson, pointing to the added vitamins. Mr Kipling Cherry Bakewells Ingredients: flour (with added calcium, iron, niacin, thiamin), sugar, vegetable oils (palm, rapeseed), plum and raspberry jam (glucose-fructose syrup, plum puree, sugar, raspberry puree, gelling agent (pectin), acid (citric acid), acidity regulator (sodium citrates), colour (anthocyanins), preservative (potassium sorbate), flavouring), glucose syrup, glace cherries (cherries, sugar, acidity regulator (citric acid), preservatives (potassium sorbate, sulphur dioxide), colour (cochineal), sweetened condensed skimmed milk (skimmed milk, sugar), ground rice, desiccated coconut (contains preservative (sodium metabisulphite (sulphites), whey powder (milk), dried egg white, ground almonds, salt, dextrose, emulsifiers (sorbitan monostearate, polysorbate 60), raising agents (disodium diphosphate, sodium bicarbonate), milk proteins, humectant (vegetable glycerine), flavouring, preservative (potassium sorbate). This list of ingredients was “shocking”, says Scott, with five different types of sugar. “Not surprisingly, one cake – one little bakewell tart – is 72% of your daily intake,” she says. Flour, sugar, vegetable oil and jam are all ingredients anybody might have in their kitchen, but then come palm oil, preservatives, acidity regulators, emulsifiers and humectants. “That’s when my nutrition alarm bells start going off – not necessarily because there is anything wrong with each individual ingredient, but because this is telling me that this is a very ultra-processed product that is not going to have anything of value in it nutritionally. “There’s a bit of flour and it’s fortified – OK. A tiny, tiny bit of fruit in the form of raspberry and plum puree. This is a far cry from eating a raspberry or a plum.” Premier Foods says: “Mr Kipling Cherry Bakewells contain no hydrogenated fats, and no artificial colours or flavours.” Cadbury Dairy Milk chocolate Ingredients: MILK**, sugar, cocoa butter, cocoa mass, vegetable fats (palm, shea), emulsifiers (E442, E476), flavourings. **The equivalent of 426ml of fresh liquid milk in every 227g of milk chocolate MILK SOLIDS 20% MINIMUM, ACTUAL 23%. COCOA SOLIDS 20% MINIMUM. Cadbury has MILK in capitals on the Dairy Milk ingredients list, stressing that it has plenty of real milk as well as real cocoa solids in its chocolate. It also has emulsifiers and flavourings – as well as cheap palm oil – that you wouldn’t have in the kitchen cupboard. These are engineered to give the right silky mouthfeel for a chocolate bar. Cadbury did not respond to requests for comment. *** Scott says the Food Foundation’s report last year, Forced Fed, shone a light on the reasons people eat ultra-processed foods. Cheap calories for cash-strapped families, yes – but promotion is a big factor, too. About 60% of food advertising expenditure is on confectionery and prepared convenience foods. Public Health England published evidence that promotions, often on junk food, cause us to buy 20% more than we otherwise would. “In this environment, it’s really not surprising that we’ve ended up in the situation where half of our calories are coming from ultra-processed foods,” Scott says. Like other food campaigners, she wants TV advertising bans before 9pm and a clampdown on promotions – and some way of making healthy food as cheap as the factory-made."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"film/2018/apr/15/western-review-valeska-grisebach","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-15T07:00:08Z","webTitle":"Western review – a tense German drama set in Europe’s borderlands","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/apr/15/western-review-valeska-grisebach","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/apr/15/western-review-valeska-grisebach","fields":{"headline":"Western review – a tense German drama set in Europe’s borderlands","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"The third feature from German film-maker Valeska Grisebach sharply observes two intersecting communities of men with a woman’s needling gaze. Though titled Western, it is set in eastern Europe, close to Bulgaria’s Greek border (hinting at the presence of refugees). Wild country – politically volatile, physically harsh, and its own kind of wild west frontier. Lonely cowboy Meinhard (Meinhard Neumann) is a German construction worker and former legionnaire sent to spend the summer building a hydroelectric power plant in rural Bulgaria. More comfortable in the company of pearl grey steed Tornado than he is with his boss, Vincent (Reinhardt Wetrek), Meinhard ditches his testosterone-fuelled colleagues and befriends Adrian (Syuleyman Alilov Letifov), one of the villagers. His fellow Germans are a parody of hyper-masculinity, spending their off-duty hours drunkenly braiding one another’s hair around a campfire, taunting women and picking fights with their new neighbours. Non-professional actor Neumann is a fascinating screen presence: tall, sinewy, mustachioed and googly-eyed. Grisebach watches him closely, as leaves cast dancing, dappled shadows on his bare back. There’s something romantic in the way she shoots these men and the landscapes they roam; pinkish dawns that brighten to hot, dusty daytimes, bleeding into honeyed sunsets and balmy evenings. The film is less interested in drama and plot than it is in the slow simmer of tension that threatens to boil over among the men. “We’re here to build things. Infrastructure. We’re helping them,” says one of Meinhard’s xenophobic coworkers, incensed by the idea that their presence, signalled tactlessly by a newly hung German flag, might be unwelcome. Like the Hollywood westerns it references, it’s a story of economic imperialism as an assertion of male dominance, the political implications of colonisation hanging in the air like stale sweat."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"culture/2018/apr/11/trevor-noah-michael-cohen-witch-hunt-stephen-colbert-round-up","type":"article","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-11T14:53:52Z","webTitle":"Trevor Noah on the Michael Cohen raid: 'That doesn’t sound like a witch-hunt'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2018/apr/11/trevor-noah-michael-cohen-witch-hunt-stephen-colbert-round-up","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/2018/apr/11/trevor-noah-michael-cohen-witch-hunt-stephen-colbert-round-up","fields":{"headline":"Trevor Noah on the Michael Cohen raid: 'That doesn’t sound like a witch-hunt'","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Late-night hosts on Tuesday discussed the FBI raid on Trump attorney Michael Cohen’s offices, as well as Mark Zuckerberg’s testimony before the Senate judiciary committee. Trevor Noah Comedy Central’s Trevor Noah covered the Cohen raid and disputed Trump’s claim of the investigation being a “witch-hunt”. “Michael Cohen, President Trump’s personal lawyer and VIP customer at Joseph A Bank,” Noah began. “Yesterday, thanks to the FBI, he had a really, really bad day.” After showing news segments about the raid, Noah asked: “How corrupt is your circle if your lawyer uses his one phone call to call you? “Anytime the FBI raids a lawyer’s office, it’s a really, really big deal. But it’s an even bigger deal when that lawyer is Michael Cohen,” Noah explained, summarizing Cohen’s, often called Trump’s “fixer”, close relationship with the president. “Basically, Michael Cohen is Trump’s go-to guy for everything,” Noah continued. “So if Trump has ever done anything shady – which I know sounds ridiculous, but stick with me here – this FBI raid has a good chance of finding it.” Noah went on: “Now, in Trump world, what’s happening here is a giant conspiracy, right? It’s Robert Mueller trying to take Trump down for political reasons. The only issue with that argument is the conspiracy would have to involve every single person in law enforcement.” The host then showed a news clip explaining the process by which a warrant to search Cohen’s office was secured: first, special counsel Mueller had to have found evidence of criminal activity, handed off the material to Rosenstein, who made a referral to the southern district of New York, an attorney for which sought out a search warrant and waited for a judge to sign off on it. “That doesn’t sound like a witch-hunt to me,” Noah said. “What we’re hearing is way too much legal procedure to be considered a witch-hunt. If people in Salem had this kind of due process, they would have never burned anyone.” Stephen Colbert “Right now, before anything else, I want to give a shout out to any FBI agent watching this from Michael Cohen’s hotel room,” Stephen Colbert began. “Of course, I’m talking about yesterday’s big raid on Trump attorney and man realizing he left his soul on the bus, Michael Cohen. “This exact moment, FBI agents are so far up in Trump’s business that they’re reading his emails with a proctoscope,” Colbert joked, before explaining that in the raid on Cohen’s home and legal offices FBI agents reportedly recovered Cohen’s computer, financial records, phone and materials related to the $130,000 payment to Stormy Daniels just weeks before the 2016 election. “When Trump found out about this he was pretty upset,” the host continued, showing clips of Trump calling the raid “a real disgrace” and “an attack on our country”. The president also characterized the raid as a “break-in”, to which Colbert replied: “They don’t break in, they used a search warrant.” “Did you see what they did to my attorney?” Colbert quipped, impersonating Trump. “They broke into his office, stole a bunch of damning evidence. I think they might kidnap him to jail.” “Here’s the thing,” Colbert said. “The Cohen raid was planned, approved and reapproved by multiple, actual Trump appointees, including Rod Rosenstein, the Republican prosecutor handpicked by Trump to serve as deputy attorney general.” Trump, the host explained, has been fuming about the investigation being a “witch-hunt”, upping the ante on Tuesday by tweeting “attorney-client privilege is dead!” “Well, it is for you,” Colbert shot back. “Because it turns out paying $130,000 to shut up a porn star right before the election is a violation of campaign finance law, and knowingly lying to a bank about why you need the $130,000 is bank fraud, and attorney client privilege doesn’t apply if they’re investigating a crime jointly undertaken by the attorney and the client.” Jimmy Kimmel Finally, Jimmy Kimmel addressed Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s testimony before Congress regarding the data breach that allowed millions of people’s personal information into the hands of Russia and Trump’s campaign data firm Cambridge Analytica. “The CEO of Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg, testified before the Senate judiciary and commerce committees today to explain how and why all your personal information somehow wound up in the hands of a foreign country,” Kimmel began. “Zuckerberg testified for more than five hours today,” he continued. “It was tough, but at the end of the hearing he wowed senators by presenting them with a slideshow he made of all their memories together.” The host joked that “the best part was getting to see Mark Zuckerberg in big boy clothes”, adding that the Facebook CEO, notorious for a uniform of hooded sweatshirts and jeans, “has a suit, it turns out”. “Facebook has admitted that as many as 270m accounts are or may be fake and used to spread false information online,” Kimmel added. “Although, let’s be honest, most real Facebook accounts are used to spread false information online.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"football/2018/apr/12/six-of-the-most-dramatic-nights-european-cup-champions-league","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-12T11:55:30Z","webTitle":"Six of the most dramatic nights in the European Cup and Champions League","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/apr/12/six-of-the-most-dramatic-nights-european-cup-champions-league","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/apr/12/six-of-the-most-dramatic-nights-european-cup-champions-league","fields":{"headline":"Six of the most dramatic nights in the European Cup and Champions League","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The almost shocking conclusion to what had been a notable Juventus recovery against Real Madrid at the Bernabéu has not only divided opinion – it was a penalty all day long, one could only admire the stealth with which Medhi Benatia administered his shove in the back of Lucas Vázquez and the bravery of Michael Oliver for punishing it – but has also inspired much talk of the evening being one of the most dramatic in the history of the European Cup and Champions League. However the latter stages of the competition have frequently produced controversy, spectacle and drama. Here are six other notable European nights to consider. 1) 2005 final, Milan 3-3 Liverpool (Liverpool win 3-2 on penalties) Comebacks do not come any more unexpected or spellbinding than this. Call it the greatest of escapes, the miracle of Istanbul or just the ultimate games of two halves but the fact is the first half was so embarrassingly one-sided that some Liverpool supporters are said to have attempted to leave the stadium during the interval, only to find the gates locked. Cue a little tactical adjustment by Rafa Benítez, who brought on Didi Hamann for the second half, and heroic performances by Steven Gerrard and Jerzy Dudek, and Liverpool recovered a three-goal deficit, negotiated extra-time and then won on penalties. Unforgettable. 2) 2009 semi-final, Chelsea 1-1 Barcelona (agg 1-1) Almost certainly the height of European injustice, as the Norwegian referee Tom Henning Øvrebø waved away four reasonable Chelsea penalty appeals before a 90th-minute goal from Andrés Iniesta swept Pep Guardiola’s Barcelona into the final with their only shot on target. One of the most memorable images of the night was Michael Ballack sprinting half the length of the pitch while remonstrating with the hapless official, before Didier Drogba’s sweary rant to the camera at full-time earned him a five-match ban. Øvrebø apologised some years later but it was far too late to earn Guus Hiddink the shot at Manchester United in Rome he so craved. 3) 2010 semi-final, Barcelona 1-0 Internazionale (agg 2-3) Barcelona were at the height of their supremacy under Guardiola in 2010 but Inter arrived at the Camp Nou with a 3-1 lead from the first leg. The visitors soon went down to 10 men when Thiago Motta was dismissed in the first half but what followed was a defensive masterclass, more organisation than improvisation, as Inter virtually abandoned attack to concentrate their resources on stopping Barcelona from scoring again. This was peak José Mourinho who, after outwitting Guardiola while short-handed, was presented with few problems by Louis van Gaal’s Bayern Munich in the final. Perennial underachievers in Europe, Inter had suddenly landed the treble of the Serie A title, Coppa Italia and Champions League. 4) 1960 final, Real Madrid 7-3 Eintracht Frankfurt A 10-goal final certainly sounds dramatic, even if the distribution of goals suggests the showpiece might have been a tad one-sided. In Britain at least, this felt like it was the moment when the European Cup came of age, when the scales fell from insular eyes and the attraction of continental competition was suddenly grasped. The final provided royal entertainment for an immense Hampden Park crowd of 127,621, an audience that seemingly included – just like the Sex Pistols at the Free Trade Hall or the Velvet Underground’s first LP – a great many people who would later be inspired to achievements of their own. If this was football, Britain wanted more. 5) 1977 quarter-final, Liverpool 3-1 Saint-Étienne (agg 3-2) Strange as it might seem now, it came as news to the nation at large to discover there was something intoxicatingly special about European nights at Anfield. Liverpool under Bob Paisley were breaking new ground – in Bill Shankly’s time the club had never been synonymous with European success – and when the French champions scored an away goal the home side needed two more to progress. Thanks in part to a hugely partisan crowd, Ray Kennedy and David “supersub” Fairclough they got them, though knowing what we know now the most arresting sight of the evening was the spilling, seething, all-standing Kop. 6) 1999 final, Bayern Munich 1-2 Manchester United “Football: bloody hell,” as someone said. The last part of United’s treble was undramatic in normal time – an under-strength side appeared to possess neither the wit nor the will to cancel out Mario Basler’s early goal. The most famous three minutes of stoppage time in history changed all that, however. The substitutes Teddy Sheringham and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer added one late goal and then another to leave the opposing defenders on the floor in dismay. The Uefa president Lennart Johansson had to remove Bayern’s ribbons from the trophy before presenting it. “I can’t believe it,” he said. “The winners are crying and the losers are dancing.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/apr/12/conservatives-split-syria-labour-military-action-theresa-may","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-12T10:18:01Z","webTitle":"The Conservatives are as split on Syria as Labour.

They just hide it better","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"How does the Conservative party want Theresa May to respond to the suspected chemical weapon attack in Syria? A quick browse of the papers, news channels and social media this week would suggest that the Tories are urging a meek and indecisive prime minister to transform into an iron lady and take drastic action. Johnny Mercer – Tory MP and former soldier – used a widely praised Telegraph article to call on the prime minister to put an end to “pious politics and endless self-flagellating” and bypass a parliamentary vote on the issue. Tom Tugendhat – the Conservative chair of the foreign affairs select committee – has said that “standing aside while people are gassed or sharing the murderer’s lies doesn’t make us safer”. Even May’s nemesis George Osborne seems to be on side – using a leader in the paper he edits to argue that there is no need for a Commons vote before action in Syria. As British submarines complete with Tomahawk cruise missiles are ordered to move within range of Syria, it looks as though May is steeling herself to take their advice. The prime minister has summoned her cabinet for an emergency meeting this afternoon to discuss whether Britain should join its French and American allies in proposed military strikes. The signs so far suggest that this discussion won’t be extended to MPs en masse, with figures in Downing Street keen to stress there is only “limited precedent” for parliament to be consulted. But it would be a mistake to assume this means May has her party’s full backing. Scratch the surface and it soon becomes clear the Conservative party is nearly as divided as Labour on the issue. The only difference between the divisions within the Labour party and the Tories on intervention in Syria is that the Conservatives’ are better hidden. While the vast majority of Tories would happily condemn Bashar al-Assad for the attack, the disagreement begins when it comes to what the response should be. For all the noise this week, there is a sizeable group of people who are still stung by the events surrounding Libya and Iraq and remain cautious over the benefits of intervention. They see the language of younger, more boisterous MPs as verging on reckless. More than one minister can be found who’ll warn that the approach of Mercer and Tugendhat would lead to a third world war. This group argue: if there’s no grand plan for regime change, why fire just to forget? Even some MPs who voted with David Cameron in 2013 – when the then prime minister lost a Commons vote on military action against Assad by 13 votes – wonder if it’s a worthwhile venture. Five years on, it’s not clear what options to intervene in Syria are left. Julian Lewis – the chair of the defence select committee – warned this week that a military campaign against the Syrian president could mean the UK government is inadvertently helping al-Qaida. It doesn’t help that Donald Trump is flirting with war via Twitter. Cautious Conservatives question whether it is such a good diplomatic idea to rush to the side of a man tweeting “Get ready Russia” and boasting about “smart!” missiles. “If it were any other US president maybe it would be a different reaction,” explains one such MP. The heightening of tensions between the west and Russia means that any “measured response” will also be a political one. Finally, there are those MPs who agree with the idea of intervention but value the sovereignty of parliament. This group would feel uncomfortable if such a big decision was taken without consultation. Were May to ignore them, it would hurt party morale and make her day-to-day job of governing with no majority harder. But the problem is if the decision were to go to parliament, it’s not a sure thing that May would win. She would almost certainly have to rely on Labour rebels’ votes for her majority in this instance. Some in government think the risk of asking for approval is too great to be worth the gamble. Were she to lose a vote, it would be a devastating blow to her standing on the international stage. After all, nothing says “global Britain” less than a prime minister who can’t do as she wishes on foreign policy. The longer the clock ticks, the more difficult things become. Had action been taken on Monday with parliament still in the midst of recess, May would have found it easier to get away with a retrospective vote on her actions. That is a more difficult sell now. As speculation grows on the size of the response and its aims, the number of questions over the UK’s participation grows. It’s not just her MPs who may see red. A Times/YouGov poll today on the public’s appetite for military intervention serves as a stark warning of problems ahead – just 22% of the public backs airstrikes on Syria while another 34% “don’t know”. If May goes ahead with strikes, she will need all the help she can get from her party in winning the “don’t knows” round to her cause. The problem is that whatever the prime minister does, she will alienate some of the colleagues she must depend on. • Katy Balls is the Spectator’s political correspondent"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"science/2018/apr/12/scientists-solve-mystery-of-how-giants-causeway-was-formed","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-12T15:02:16Z","webTitle":"Scientists solve mystery of how Giant's Causeway was formed","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/apr/12/scientists-solve-mystery-of-how-giants-causeway-was-formed","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2018/apr/12/scientists-solve-mystery-of-how-giants-causeway-was-formed","fields":{"headline":"Scientists solve mystery of how Giant's Causeway was formed","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"According to legend, the Giant’s Causeway was built by the Irish giant, Finn MacCool, as a crossing to confront his Scottish rival. Scientists have an alternative explanation, and for the first time they have reproduced in the laboratory the process through which the causeway’s 40,000 near-perfect hexagonal columns were formed. Geometric columns are seen in a variety of volcanic rocks across the Earth and are known to form as the rock cools and contracts, resulting in a regular array of polygonal prisms or columns. But until now, geologists had been unsure of the threshold at which cooling magma suddenly fractures into a geometric pavement. Yan Lavallée, professor of volcanology at the University of Liverpool and lead author, said: “[This] is a question that has fascinated the world of geology for a very long time. We have been wanting to know whether the temperature of the lava that causes the fractures was hot, warm or cold.” To answer the question, Lavallée and colleagues recreated the process in the laboratory using basalt cores drilled from the Eyjafjallajökull volcano in Iceland. The 20cm-long cylinders, gripped by a clamp at each end, were heated to more than 1,000C until they began to soften into lava. The samples were fixed at each end in a mechanical grip and cooled to test at what point they snapped. The basalt magma fractured at between 840-890C, the study found, suggesting that this is the temperature at which the Giant’s Causeway would have formed. “I have spent over a decade pondering how to address this question and construct the right experiment to find the answer to this question,” said Lavallée. “Now, with this study, we have found that the answer is hot, but after it solidified.” In the future, he hopes to extend the investigation by using a large pool of magma to reproduce the geometric fracturing as rock is cooled – although he said such an experiment would need to be performed under carefully controlled conditions. The Giant’s Causeway formed between 50 and 60 million years ago, when the region that now sits on the Antrim coastline was subject to intense volcanic activity. Molten basalt erupted through chalk beds and formed a lake of lava. As this cooled and contracted, cracks propagated across the plateau to form hexagonal stepping stones. Similar geological structures are seen elsewhere in the world, including Devils Postpile in the US, and the pattern occurs on many scales because faster cooling produces smaller columns. The findings are published in the journal Nature Communications."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"money/2018/apr/15/which-consumers-association-email-internet-closing","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-15T06:00:09Z","webTitle":"Which? pulls the plug on its email service","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2018/apr/15/which-consumers-association-email-internet-closing","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2018/apr/15/which-consumers-association-email-internet-closing","fields":{"headline":"Which? pulls the plug on its email service","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"I have been a member of Which? for more than 50 years and a supporter of its campaigns for fairness on behalf of consumers in the UK.

Meet the new breed of payday lenders\r\n","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The worst of the payday lenders, famed for offering short-term loans at sky-high interest rates, may have faded away, but vulnerable consumers are still being targeted with offers of loans with four-figure APRs. The medium-term loan market, where money is lent for three to 12 months, is thriving with some lenders charging well over 1,000%, frequently to those on the lowest incomes, or unable to borrow from the traditional banks. These loans appear to work on the same premise as payday loans – a fast online or mobile application process, and money in your account quickly. Oakam, which advertises heavily on daytime TV, boasts it will lend to those on benefits or with CCJs. New customers can borrow between £200 and £1,750 and repay it over three to 12 months. Returning customers can “borrow up to £5,000 over time”. Oakam’s typical APR is 1,421%. It was the highest APR that Money found in the sector, though many others top 1,000%. For a £500 loan over six months, PiggyBank has a typical APR of 1,270%, Mr Lender 1,244.2%, Trusted Quid 1,212.95%, Lending Stream 1,325%, and Wonga 1,086%. Yes, Wonga. The notorious payday lender has largely fallen out of the news, but it hasn’t gone away; it’s just offering longer loan terms. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) introduced new rules for short-term lenders in January 2015. Interest rates are capped at 0.8% per day, and customers can never repay more than twice the amount borrowed. Oakam keeps within the cap, just. Borrowing £500 over six months earns a rate of 1,416.9%. Borrowers repay £946.26, just £54 shy of double the cash borrowed. Oakam CEO Frederic Nze says the firm’s typical APR is not representative of what it actually charges customers, with higher rates for new customers skewing the figures. He says most customers are charged an “annual interest rate” of between 36.8% and 288%. “Our rates for new customers begin beneath the FCA’s rate cap for high-cost short-term credit – borrowers cannot be charged more than 0.8% interest per day nor repay more than 100% of the loan principal in interest. While new Oakam customers begin at a higher rate, those using our mobile app have been able to bring down their rates over time by building a digital track record of responsible borrowing behaviour,” he explains. Debt charity StepChange says 1.4m lower-income households resorted to high-cost credit to meet living costs last year – up from 1.1m in 2016. It found those using such credit tend to be on low incomes and often in insecure jobs with irregular work patterns. It says this disproportionately affects women, who tend to be in part-time or casual work more than men. Other users of high-cost credit include people with no credit history due to their age or being new to the UK. The FCA is reviewing other high-cost credit products, with its findings out in May 2018. It is thought to be examining businesses such as BrightHouse, which sells electrical and white goods on a rent-to-own basis, along with doorstep lenders such as Provident. “We want to see the FCA introduce a cap on rent-to-own and doorstep loan products, just as they already have on payday loans. No one should have to pay back more than double what they borrow over the course of their agreement,” says Gillian Guy, chief executive of Citizens Advice. The End High Cost Credit Alliance was launched last month, fronted by actor-turned-activist Michael Sheen. It is campaigning against high-interest credit providers and working to find fairer alternatives. It says “fair finance” means the lender is not unfairly targeting consumers with a product they can’t afford. What lenders to approach? Moneyline is a social lender in Blackburn. Borrowing £500 over six months at its APR of 208.73% would mean the borrower repays £653.16. Scotcash is a not-for-profit social enterprise based in Glasgow. A £500 loan repaid over six months at 145.1% APR would repay £618.21. Street UK, an “ethical loans company” and competitive alternative to doorstep or online lenders. Its typical APR for new customers is 120%. Another option is a local credit union. Owned and controlled by their members, the credit unions offer both savings and loan products and cannot charge an APR exceeding 42.6%."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"film/2018/apr/12/cannes-film-festival-2018-full-list-of-films","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-19T15:46:56Z","webTitle":"Cannes film festival 2018: full list of films","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/apr/12/cannes-film-festival-2018-full-list-of-films","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/apr/12/cannes-film-festival-2018-full-list-of-films","fields":{"headline":"Cannes film festival 2018: full list of films","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Official selection Competition Everybody Knows (dir: Asghar Farhadi) – opening film At War (dir: Stéphane Brizé) The Wild Pear Tree (dir: Nuri Bilge Ceylan) Ayka (dir: Sergei Dvortsevoy) Dogman (dir: Matteo Garrone) Le Livre d’Image (dir: Jean-Luc Godard) Knife + Heart (dir: Yann Gonzalez) Asako I &amp; II (dir: Ryusuke Hamaguchi) Sorry Angel (dir: Christophe Honoré) Girls of the Sun (dir: Eva Husson) Ash Is Purest White (dir: Jia Zhang-Ke) Shoplifters (dir: Hirokazu Kore-eda) Capernaum (dir: Nadine Labaki) Burning (dir: Lee Chang-Dong) BlacKkKlansman (dir: Spike Lee) Under the Silver Lake (dir: David Robert Mitchell) Three Faces (dir: Jafar Panahi) Cold War (dir: Pawel Pawlikowski) Lazzaro Felice (dir: Alice Rohrwacher) Yomeddine (dir: AB Shawky) Leto (L’Été) (dir: Kirill Serebrennikov) Un Certain Regard Donbass (dir: Sergei Loznitsa) – opening film Angel Face (dir: Vanessa Filho) Border (dir: Ali Abbasi) The Dead and the Others (dir: João Salaviza &amp; Renée Nader Messora) El Angel (dir: Luis Ortega) Euphoria (dir: Valeria Golino) Friend (dir: Wanuri Kahiu) The Gentle Indifference of the World (dir: Adilkhan Yerzhanov) Girl (dir: Lukas Dhont) The Harvesters (dir: Etienne Kallos) In My Room (dir: Ulrich Köhler) Little Tickles (dirs: Andréa Bescond &amp; Eric Métayer) Muere, Monstruo, Muere (dir: Alejandro Fadel) My Favorite Fabric (dir: Gaya Jiji) On Your Knees, Guys (Sextape) (dir: Antoine Desrosières) Sofia (dir: Meyem Benm’Barek) Out of competition Solo: A Star Wars Story (dir: Ron Howard) The House That Jack Built (dir: Lars von Trier) Le Grand Bain (dir: Gilles Lellouche) Little Tickles (dir: Andréa Bescond &amp; Eric Métayer) Long Day’s Journey Into Night (dir: Bi Gan) Midnight screenings Arctic (dir: Joe Penna) Fahrenheit 451 (dir: Ramin Bahrani) The Spy Gone North (dir: Yoon Jong-Bing) Whitney (dir: Kevin Macdonald) Special screenings 10 Years in Thailand (dir: Aditya Assarat, Wisit Sasanatieng, Chulayarnon Sriphol &amp; Apichatpong Weerasethakul) The State Against Mandela and the Others (dir: Nicolas Champeaux &amp; Gilles Porte) O Grande Circo Mistico (dir: Carlo Diegues) Dead Souls (dir: Wang Bing) To the Four Winds (dir: Michel Toesca) La Traversée (dir: Romain Goupil) Pope Francis: A Man of His Word (dir: Wim Wenders) Closing film The Man Who Killed Don Quixote (dir: Terry Gilliam) Directors’ Fortnight Pajaros de Verano (Birds of Passage) (dirs: Ciro Guerra and Cristina Gallego) – opening film Amin (dir: Philippe Faucon) Carmen y Lola (dir: Arantxa Echevarria) Climax (dir: Gaspar Noe) Comprama un Revolver (Buy Me a Gun) (dir: Julio Hernandez Cordon) Les Confins du Monde (dir: Guillaume Nicloux) El Motoarrebatador (The Snatch Thief) (dir: Augustin Toscano) En Liberte!

He was speaking before the release of the results of an investigation by the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons into the attack. Fleming devoted much of his 30-minute speech to the subject of Russia, ranging from Salisbury to cyber-attacks on the UK. He also made a fleeting reference to chemical attacks in Syria, without adding the “alleged” caveat used by the government. “And whilst we face an emboldened Russia, we also see the tectonic plates in the Middle East moving. We see Iran and its proxies meddling throughout the region. The use of chemical weapons in Syria,” he said in Manchester. In what was his first public appearance after more than two decades as an intelligence officer, Fleming said the attack in Salisbury on the Russian double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia was “sobering”, and the first time that a nerve agent had been deployed in Europe since the second world war. “It demonstrates how reckless Russia is prepared to be, how little the Kremlin cares for the international rules-based order, how comfortable they are at putting ordinary lives at risk,” he said. Fleming, a former deputy director of MI5 who became director of GCHQ last year, indicated that he anticipated a long-running confrontation with Russia, saying GCHQ’s expertise would be in increasing demand. Hinting at possible retaliatory action, he said GCHQ was developing its toolkit, including cyber-offensive capabilities, and boasted of how GCHQ had used cyber-offensive tools to defeat Islamic State online. He was more emphatic in attributing blame for the Salisbury attack than Theresa May, who has tended to speak of Russia rather than the Kremlin and who has restricted her assessment to saying only that Russia is “highly likely” to have been behind the attack. The UK case against Russia is based partly on the use of the nerve agent novichok, but also on undisclosed intelligence. GCHQ, along with its US counterpart the NSA, closely monitors Russian government communications. Fleming said the UK had lots of adversaries who were exploiting the fast pace of technological developments. “Alongside these new dangers, we must not and have not forgotten the old foes. For decades, we have collected intelligence on Russian state capabilities, on their intent and posture. And for over 20 years, we’ve monitored and countered the growing cyber threat they pose to the UK and our allies. This has never gone away. But nevertheless, recent events are particularly stark and shocking.” He said the robust response from the UK and the international community to the Skripal case “shows the Kremlin that illegal acts have consequences”. The intelligence agencies have until recently been coy about their own ability to mount cyber-attacks on other countries. Fleming said: “We’ll continue to expose Russia’s unacceptable cyber behaviour, so they’re held accountable for what they do, and to help government and industry protect themselves.” But he added: “To stay ahead, to match the pace of technological change, we are investing in deploying our own cyber toolkit. It’s one that combines offensive and defensive cyber capabilities, to make the UK harder to attack, better organised to respond when we are, and able to push back if we must.” Speaking of the GCHQ cyber-offensive operation against Islamic State, Fleming said it had shown how effective such measures could be. “We may look to deny service, disrupt a specific online activity, deter an individual or a group or perhaps destroy equipment and networks.” He was speaking on the final day of a three-day conference organised by the National Cyber Security Centre, the shop window of GCHQ. At MI5, which he joined in 1993 from the private sector, Fleming focused on Northern Ireland, counter-terrorism and cybersecurity, and he was involved in organising security for the 2012 London Olympics."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2018/apr/16/when-good-tv-goes-bad-arrested-developments","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-16T11:59:07Z","webTitle":"When good TV goes bad: Arrested Development","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/apr/16/when-good-tv-goes-bad-arrested-developments","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2018/apr/16/when-good-tv-goes-bad-arrested-developments","fields":{"headline":"When good TV goes bad: why Arrested Development’s cast look as confused by the reboot as the rest of us","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"From Mr F to “Her?”, from “Marry me!” to Motherboy, Arrested Development’s smart callbacks and Easter eggs have maintained its cult following well into the fickle streaming age. As well as being highly meta, the series – which originally aired on Fox from 2003 to 2006 – borrowed from the single-camera world of reality TV to create a fresh and frantic portrait of a decadent, dysfunctional family. Without AD we most likely wouldn’t have 30 Rock or Community, or Michael Cera and Alia Shawkat (who has wowed of late in Search Party). Fast-forward to 2018, however, and the idea of the Bluths returning may well send fans fleeing their screens quicker than Buster evading a loose seal. But how did a series so knowing that it once had Henry “Fonzie” Winkler jump a shark, jump the shark itself? Back in 2013, Netflix launched a new series of AD, which had acquired legendary status since its cancellation. The third series had ended abruptly, leaving a definite sense of unfinished business. Indeed, its finale contained plenty of plot points that could have been shark-jump material, had they been deployed earlier on – such as Lindsay finding out she wasn’t a Bluth and Lucille’s adopted son Annyong revealing himself as the source of the family’s ruin. But here, right at the “end” of Arrested Development, they felt just on the right side of surreal. The trouble really began during the reboot. Rather than the brilliantly chaotic ensemble approach of old, each episode of the new series focused on a single character, due in part to the cast’s other commitments. The result is disjointed and repetitive, with the same stories told multiple times from different viewpoints. Besides, the plot is largely nonsense. Michael – “the one son who had no choice but to keep them all together” – has been reduced to a pathetic wreck, trying to crash in his son’s college dorm. Ron Howard – before merely an omniscient narrator – now pops up to fuel dull in-jokes about his career and personal life. George Michael is now an unlikable lothario who ends up dating the same woman as his father (and, erm, she’s Ron Howard’s illegitimate daughter). There are also lots of “gags” about Tobias – a character built on hints and innuendo – being a sex offender. Cameos from Seth Rogen and Kristen Wiig as a young George Sr and Lucille add little, but presumably took a nice chunk out of the budget. Only Jessica Walter as Lucille really manages to reach the bizarro heights of old, while the rest of the cast look as confused by the reworked format as the rest of us. Last year, Netflix began promoting yet another season with the tagline “this time the Bluths are all together. Whether they like it or not”, presumably meaning no more of this separate timelines business. But, really, the damage has been done. With Jeffrey Tambor (George Sr) dismissed from Transparent over allegations of sexual harassment, maybe now is the perfect time to let AD bow out. There’s always money in the banana stand, but there ain’t always laughs."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2018/apr/12/belgian-army-criticised-for-plan-to-let-homesick-cadets-to-sleep-at-home","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-12T09:56:32Z","webTitle":"Belgian army criticised for plan to let homesick cadets sleep at home","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/12/belgian-army-criticised-for-plan-to-let-homesick-cadets-to-sleep-at-home","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/apr/12/belgian-army-criticised-for-plan-to-let-homesick-cadets-to-sleep-at-home","fields":{"headline":"Belgian army criticised for plan to let homesick cadets sleep at home","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The Belgian army has been criticised over plans to allow homesick recruits to sleep at home rather in barracks during their initial training, as it deals with a major recruitment crisis. The 28,000-strong army has suffered from a large number of recruits quitting early over complaints that they miss their friends and family. With a high attrition rate among older soldiers adding to the defence ministry’s woes, the army is examining whether to lift its boarding requirements altogether for recruits. Alex Claesen, a spokesman for the ministry, told the Belgian daily newspaper Het Nieuwsblad that the army was responding to modern lifestyles. “The army wants to include more free evenings where the recruit can leave the barracks. The youngsters are still expected at the gate on Sunday evening or at the latest Monday morning and are not allowed to go outside before Friday,” he said. “We are also looking into extending the free weekend by focusing more on the lessons. The army is even studying whether the boarding regime can be relaxed or even lifted. Then the recruits who live near the military school or the barracks can go home in the evening.” Belgium has come under criticism in recent years over its failure to live up to its Nato commitment to spend 2% of GDP on defence. It currently spends 0.9%, of which 75% goes on personnel and pension costs. The defence ministry has been on a major recruitment drive, but it has been a hard sell because of pension reforms, poor job prospects on leaving the army and a demand in recent years for soldiers to patrol the streets of Belgium’s major cities under the counter-terrorism operation Vigilant Guardian. Danny Lams, a former paratrooper who chairs a veterans’ organisation representing Ostend and the areas bordering the Netherlands, nevertheless condemned the army’s plans to allow soldiers to sleep at home. “That’s how you grow a defence of nothing, an army that you cannot count on. You do not go to a war zone with men who miss their mama,” he said. “We used to sleep on the cold ground under a leaky tarpaulin. We wanted to serve our country. If you allow the recruits to go home during the week, the military will soon ask for a mobile home if they are sent to the front.” Some units patrolled the streets for about 200 days out of 365 last year. Belgium has 70 personnel in Afghanistan protecting Mazar-i-Sharif airport in the north of the country. The army has 2,204 women in its ranks and 25,687 men."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/askjack/2018/apr/12/how-can-i-store-my-digital-photos-for-ever-external-hard-drive","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-12T10:13:28Z","webTitle":"How can I store my digital photos for ever?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/askjack/2018/apr/12/how-can-i-store-my-digital-photos-for-ever-external-hard-drive","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/askjack/2018/apr/12/how-can-i-store-my-digital-photos-for-ever-external-hard-drive","fields":{"headline":"How can I store my digital photos for ever?","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"I read your article from June 2016 on What’s the best way to organise and store my digital photos? Is it not sufficient to save my pictures on one external hard drive? Must I save them on two? Also, for how many years will an external hard drive keep the pictures safe? I have an Apple iMac and until now all my pictures were stored in Photos. Yesterday, I transferred them to an external hard drive and emptied Photos. Is this not enough to ensure the safety and availability of my pics for ever? Arunima Nothing lasts for ever, and digital images can disappear in seconds. People lose their most important photos every day when hard drives fail, when smartphones and laptops are stolen, when online services shut down, and when natural disasters strike. Fires, floods and earthquakes can also destroy digital records. To be really safe, you should have more than one copy of each photo, stored in more than one way in more than one place. Digital data is a particular problem because storage formats change all the time. I still have data on 8in, 5.25in and 3.5in floppy disks, Iomega Zip disks and quarter-inch tapes. The photos might be safe but I won’t know unless I buy something that can read them. Operating systems, software and file formats also keep changing, so being able to see a file doesn’t mean you can load it. Happily, the standard .jpg/jpeg picture file format developed by the Joint Photographic Experts Group may well last “for ever” despite efforts to replace it with JPEG 2000, PNG (Portable Network Graphics), SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics), SPIFF (Still Picture Interchange File Format), BPG (Better Portable Graphics), FLIF (Free Lossless Image Format), HEIF (High Efficiency Image Format, aka HEIC in Apple’s iOS 11), and Google’s WebP, among others. Making digital documents last for ever therefore involves two processes. First, you have to keep moving the data to new storage systems before the old one fails or becomes unreadable. Second, you may have to keep converting documents to whichever file format becomes dominant before the old one is abandoned. Disk drives The one thing we know about hard drives is that most of them fail sooner rather than later. Recently, I had a 1TB PC hard drive fail after four years, and a 2TB external USB hard drive failed after seven years. Some drives fail after a few months while others work for a decade or more. There is no way of knowing. However, it’s a good rule of thumb that a drive is increasingly likely to fail after five years or 50,000 hours of use. If you want to keep photos for 50 years, you might have to store them on roughly 10 hard drives in all. Because a hard drive can fail at any time, it’s not enough to store your photos on a single drive. Two hard drives is a usable minimum, but I have my photos on at least three: my desktop PC, the external USB hard drive that backs up my PC, and an 8TB drive that backs up three external hard drives. Hard drives are good for storing photos because they are cheap, they provide fast access to data, and it’s very easy to copy a whole hard drive to another hard drive – especially if you have USB 3.0 or Thunderbolt connections. However, backup drives have their limitations. First, your data is vulnerable both to human error and to malicious software. Second, your data is at risk of being stolen or destroyed by fire, flood or some other disaster. If your external hard drive is always plugged into your PC, then you can delete whole folders by accident, or by making errors when copying files. If your PC is infected by malware such as ransomware, it will usually encrypt files on external hard drives as well. If a burglar steals your PC, they may take the backup drive as well, and if your house burns down, you’ll also lose both. You should therefore keep a backup “off site” in the office, or at a friend or relative’s house, or perhaps sealed in a moisture-proof box in a garage or shed. Optical discs Because of the risks to hard drives, it’s a good idea to keep backups on removable storage media as well. The current options include CD-R, DVD and Blu-ray optical discs. With optical drives, you should use high-quality discs and store them in a cool, dark and dry place. Photos on write-once optical discs cannot be deleted by accident, cannot be encrypted or infected by malware, and are unlikely to be stolen. Because they are portable, you can easily store copies off-site. Unfortunately, a CD only stores 702MB of data, which is great for 100K texts but not so good for 5MB image files. A DVD can store 4.7GB, which is practical for many projects but isn’t big enough for a significant photo collection. For example, you can probably fit all the photos from a wedding or a holiday on one DVD, but maybe not a whole year. Blu-ray discs can store a lot of data: 25GB on single-layer discs and 50GB on the dual-layer discs used to distribute movies. (Triple- and quad-layer discs are also available.) You can probably fit your whole photo collection on a few dual-layer Blu-ray discs, and 20 will hold a terabyte. Best of all, you can buy Panasonic Archival Grade or Century Archival Grade Blu-ray discs that are claimed to last for 50+ or 100+ years respectively. These avoid the need to keep copying data to new media, though it’s hard to say how many people will still be using Blu-ray drives in 2120. USB thumbdrives and SD memory cards are not suitable for long-term archival storage because the charge decays over long periods. Ideally, they should be refreshed every four or five years. You can do that by running the Windows checkdisk command. Cloud storage Storing photos “in the cloud” – basically, on someone else’s collection of hard drives – solves all the problems of using local hard drives and of transferring data to new physical media. But it is important to remember that data in the cloud is not safe and not under your control. The biggest risks with cloud storage are being locked out of your account, being hacked by someone who deletes all your stuff, and by your account being closed if you don’t pay any charges required. Of course, online storage services may also shut down or go bust, and in one case – Megaupload – the servers were seized by the US Justice Department. Many large companies offer photo storage services including Amazon, Google, Microsoft (OneDrive), and Apple (iCloud). However, these can be expensive if you need a lot of storage, and your photos will not be as accessible as they are on a local hard drive. Before you commit to making some large uploads, check how easy it is to download files, and whether file-names, sizes and Exif data are preserved. Flickr offers a terabyte of free photo storage space, with adverts, though it is not as attractive as it used to be. SmugMug is a good alternative and provides unlimited storage for $47.88 a year, after a 14-day free trial period. Microsoft offers a terabyte per user with Office 365, with Personal (one user) priced at £59.99 a year and Home (five users) at £79.99. Amazon offers unlimited photo storage if you pay £79 a year for Prime membership. Be careful of services that don’t preserve your original photos exactly as you uploaded them. Google charges £7.99/$9.99 per month to store a terabyte of photos at their original quality, but will store them free at a reduced (16MP) resolution that it, correctly, calls High Quality. Facebook’s photo storage is free but it reduces images from printable quality to web-viewing quality. There are many alternatives, but the largest players – Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google and Microsoft – are most likely to be around in the long term. Of course, prices and terms may change, and if you store photos for 50 or 100 years, the cost adds up. Have you got a question?

The company’s Holt Street headquarters in Sydney’s Surry Hills were buzzing with extra security as the editors of the Australian mastheads flew in for meetings with the New York contingent. Co-chairman Lachlan Murdoch was joined by chief executive Robert Thomson and other board members, including the former president of Spain José María Aznar and former Olympics executive Ana Paula Pessoa. There was one notable absentee, however. The executive chairman, Rupert Murdoch, was still laid up at home recovering from a back injury he acquired during a sailing accident. The 86-year-old told his executive team in January that he would need “some weeks” to recover from the accident, but several months have now passed and Murdoch senior is still lying low. In what may be a signal of the power dynamics at play in the Murdoch empire, the board meeting was chaired by eldest son and likely heir Lachlan, with rival and younger brother James, the chief executive of 21st Century Fox, attending remotely. Sources say it is looking ever more certain that Lachlan will take the reins when Rupert Murdoch moves on. On the agenda no doubt were Foxtel’s discussions with Cricket Australia for the rights to all matches after 2019 to air on Fox Sports. Prince Charles dons the Masterchef cravat Good to know Prince Charles made the most of his trip to Australia for the Commonwealth Games by starring in a local reality show. He found time to drop into Darwin for a dinner with the Royal Flying Doctors Service, which was being filmed for a segment for the 10th series of MasterChef Australia. Producers Endemol Shine secured the royal guest because Charles’s wife, Camilla, is a fan, reports said. Privatise the ABC? Who, me? When the communications minister, Mitch Fifield, acknowledged at Senate estimates he was a member of the Institute of Public Affairs, many reacted with disbelief. The IPA’s agenda, after all, is the privatisation or breaking up of the ABC. But it’s no secret Fifield remained a member or that he once held that view. In 2008 he gave a speech in which he proposed reducing the size of government, including privatisation and tax reform. He praised the sale of the Commonwealth Bank, Qantas and Telstra, Australian Defence Industries, the airports, CSL, the National Transmission Network and the National Rail Corp. And then he went further. “Conservatives have often floated the prospect of privatising the ABC and Australia Post,” Fifield said. “There is merit in such proposals.” As the minister responsible for the ABC, does he still support privatisation? “That’s not the position of me or the government,” Fifield told the committee. Perhaps a new book from his friends at the IPA, researchers Sinclair Davidson and Chris Berg, will give the minister food for thought. Against Public Broadcasting: Why and How We Should Privatise the ABC, provides a road map for politicians who wish to dismantle the $1.1bn organisation. “When the ABC was founded in the 1930s the problem was a scarcity of media,” the authors say. “Now that we live in a world of media plenty, it is hard to see why the government is still subsidising a media empire. This book provides an outline of how policymakers can dispose of the ABC, while at the same time preserving its value and realising that value for the benefit of taxpayers.” Glee over Alberici In other Senate estimates news, Fifield welcomed with glee the admission by the ABC’s managing director, Michelle Guthrie, that a dramatic restructure was to blame for recent editorial failures. The minister has declared that a loud chorus of complaint from the government benches about Emma Alberici’s coverage of corporate tax policy has been “thoroughly vindicated”. Fifield was joined by Malcolm Turnbull and Mathias Cormann in savaging the ABC for what they claimed was a failure to “present a balance of views on the corporate tax policy”. In a statement to his favourite organ, the Australian, after estimates on Wednesday, the senator said the ABC was right to acknowledge errors in the story. “The government’s concerns about company tax policy reporting by the ABC have been thoroughly vindicated,” Fifield said. “It’s good that the ABC have accepted responsibility for these errors and have made internal changes to improve their editorial processes.” Surprise SBS hire Media buyer John Sintras, the former chief executive and chairman at Starcom Mediavest Australia and more recently global president of IPG Mediabrands in New York, was named chief audience and content officer for SBS on Thursday. Sintras is replacing chief content officer Helen Kellie, who died of cancer last year aged 52. Kellie was an experienced former BBC marketer who worked with brands including Top Gear and Doctor Who and, more recently was hands on with SBS’ Struggle Street. The appointment might have been surprising for some given Sintras’s reputation as a media buyer and advertising executive rather than a program maker. A spokeswoman for SBS said Sintras would work closely with the directors of both TV and online and radio content, who “continue to be responsible for all production, acquisitions and scheduling in their respective areas”. SBS managing director Michael Ebeid said Sintras was a seasoned and respected Australian media leader with a strong track record of inspiring his staff. “As SBS increases its commitment to connect Australians with distinctive content and services on a range of devices and platforms, John’s passion in leveraging transformation and technology to deliver business growth, together with his in-depth knowledge of data optimisation and insights, will be invaluable,” Ebeid said. Gibney v the Tele Rebecca Gibney protested vehemently on social media this week at the tabloid treatment of a very personal issue in her family which she has spoken about on an upcoming episode of Julia Zemiro’s Home Delivery on ABC TV. Gibney said she was “extremely saddened” by the headline in the Daily Telegraph – “Gibney reveals sex assault horror: Grandpa preyed on me” – and had not been contacted by the newspaper or given any warning by the ABC that the story was set to appear ahead of the May broadcast. Weekly Beast understands there were several mistakes that led to the devastating story for the New Zealand-based actor. As is customary in order to meet long print deadlines, ABC TV publicity loaded the episode on to its media portal for review a good month before the broadcast date. A TV journalist from the Daily Telegraph watched the episode and wrote it up, and there was no embargo in place to stop her. The ABC should have been more mindful of the sensitivities and put an embargo on the show, sources said. But things really went awry when the Tele added a sensational – and factually incorrect – headline. Gibney was not sexually assaulted by her grandfather, because she managed to fight him off. So what was a gentle, sensitively handled episode about her family turned into a lurid story out of her control. “I have not seen the show and I have not been contacted for publicity nor have I given any interviews for the episode so any quotes used have not come directly from me to any journalists,” Gibney wrote on Instagram. “My family and I are extremely saddened that I was not contacted or informed that this article was coming out (with an appalling headline which I did not say) and I am so sad that they are using our family to sell their newspaper. It’s not on. I have always been open about my personal issues and if it helps others then my job is done. What I do detest is somebody using our family’s personal story for publicity without even bothering to contact our family to clarify what is clearly a distressing situation for us.” Home Delivery producers told Weekly Beast they would be pushing for the ABC to control the release of sensitive content to the media in future. “Last week the ABC released standard publicity material regarding the return of three popular ABC programmes: Julia Zemiro’s Home Delivery, Gruen and The Weekly with Charlie Pickering,” an ABC spokesman said. “The media release referred to guests on the new series of Julia Zemiro’s Home Delivery, including actor Rebecca Gibney. The ABC did not provide any information to media about the content of the episode or the matters discussed by Ms Gibney in the program. “The ABC is disappointed the Daily Telegraph has sensationalised matters of a sensitive nature to Ms Gibney, causing undue distress to Ms Gibney and her family.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2018/apr/12/london-house-prices-falling-fastest-rate-nine-years-halifax","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-12T08:55:29Z","webTitle":"London house prices falling at fastest rate in nine years, says Halifax","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/apr/12/london-house-prices-falling-fastest-rate-nine-years-halifax","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/apr/12/london-house-prices-falling-fastest-rate-nine-years-halifax","fields":{"headline":"London house prices falling at fastest rate in nine years, says Halifax","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"House prices in London are falling at the fastest rate in nine years, according to Halifax, Britain’s biggest mortgage lender. Prices in the capital were down 3.2% between January and March compared with the previous quarter, the sharpest decline since the depths of the financial crisis, according to regional data collated by IHS Markit and published by Halifax, part of Lloyds Banking Group. London also recorded the sharpest fall in annual house prices since the start of 2011. Property values fell 3.8% in the first quarter from a year ago, following a 0.7% annual drop in the fourth quarter. London prices have been falling on a quarterly and annual basis since the third quarter of 2017.There was a small annual increase of 0.3% in prices in the south-east of England at the start of the year, and a rise of 1.9% in the south-west. Prices grew strongly elsewhere in the country. The east Midlands and East Anglia recorded the fastest rates of annual price inflation, at 7.3% and 7.2% respectively, followed by Scotland at 6.7% and Yorkshire and the Humber at 6.1%. The standardised price of a home in London was £430,749 in the first quarter, the lowest since the end of 2015. Figures are standardised in order to track the price of a “typical house” by giving values to certain attributes of the properties and using them to calculate the price. The figure for the south-east was £337,776, a one-year low. Such prices are still far above the average UK figure of £223,819. Apart from London and the south-east, only the south-west and East Anglia remain above the national figure at £237,371 and £236,335 respectively. Average house prices are lowest in Northern Ireland at £127,793, Scotland at £145,837 and the north of England at £146,648. Across the UK, house prices stalled in the first quarter. Paul Smith, IHS Markit’s economics director, said: “The subdued performance of the UK housing market, especially in the south of England, seems to reflect a general lack of appetite amongst households at present for activity related to major purchases in line with the general squeeze on real incomes seen in recent months. “Allied with a general undercurrent of Brexit-related uncertainty, plus the likelihood of higher – albeit still historically low – interest rates later in the year, the market seems set to persist in a subdued state for the foreseeable future.” The figures came as Britain’s property surveyors gave their most downbeat assessment of the housing market for five years. The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (Rics) said that demand from buyers fell for the 12th month in a row in March, new instructions from sellers declined for the seventh consecutive month and prices were flat nationally. One surveyor, Toby Whittome of Jackson-Stops in London, said stamp duty increases and Brexit had “killed the fluidity of the London market”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/booksblog/2018/apr/12/mystery-crime-fiction-bestselling-book-genre-sophie-hannah","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-12T14:37:34Z","webTitle":"No mystery crime is the biggest-selling genre in books | Sophie Hannah","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2018/apr/12/mystery-crime-fiction-bestselling-book-genre-sophie-hannah","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/booksblog/2018/apr/12/mystery-crime-fiction-bestselling-book-genre-sophie-hannah","fields":{"headline":"It's no mystery that crime is the biggest-selling genre in books","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"It has happened at last! Finally, the literary world is a meritocracy! Crime fiction – which I first became aware of as the Best Genre Ever when I read my first Enid Blyton mystery at six years old – is now officially the UK’s bestselling genre. Nielsen Bookscan data at the London book fair has revealed that crime novels in 2017, for the first time since Nielsen’s records began, sold more than the category rather vaguely labelled “general and literary fiction”. Crime sales of have increased by 19% since 2015 to 18.7m, compared to the 18.1m fiction books sold in 2017. This might be the first time that the genre I write, read and love has outsold any other, but it’s certainly not the first time I’ve been asked: “Why is there such an appetite for crime novels?” Crime fiction was extremely popular long before it was the most popular, and so we crime writers have to answer this question all the time. Sometimes it is presented in an evidently disapproving manner: “Can you account for the unstoppable popularity of crime fiction, Ms Hannah? And where were you at 9pm on Tuesday evening? Writing a crime novel, I bet.” (Prolific authors take note: the word “unstoppable” is never truly intended as a compliment, and you should be suspicious of anyone who uses it about you.) So why is crime fiction suddenly the most popular genre of fiction in the UK? I think readers have a sense that this is a genre that will: a) prioritise their pleasure and entertainment over anything the writer might want to get out of the experience; and b) offer a guaranteed a gripping plot. Yes, many literary novels have fantastic plots, and some crime novels are as dull as a puddle in a potholed pavement – nevertheless, as a genre, crime always promises suspense and action in a way that general and literary fiction does not. Bestselling thriller writer David Baldacci has said: “When times are stressful and it looks like the bad is winning out over the good, along comes the genre of crime novels to put the balance back in life. People inherently don’t like folks who do bad to get away with it. In real life they do, all the time, because of a variety of factors. But in novels, evil is punished, and the good guys mostly win, after solving the puzzle. And all is right with the world. At least fictionally.” Solving the puzzle: for most of us, that’s life. Will we get the job we want? Does our sister-in-law secretly hate us? Is our current relationship going to last? We’re spurred on by not knowing and desperately wishing we did. Crime is the only genre that puts puzzle-solving – making sense of what the hell’s going on – at the centre of everything. It’s closest to our core motivation, as we blindly stumble through life, needing but never being given all the answers. Still, this has always been true of crime fiction, so what accounts for the sudden surge in the genre’s popularity? Here we need to look at another eternally popular genre, romance, which also has puzzle at its centre: where will true and lasting love come from? Is true happiness possible? Is he The One? Just as comeuppances for bad guys are not always delivered by real life, neither is the perfect soulmate with whom we can live happily ever after. Both crime and romantic fiction are driven by quests for conclusive answers and happy endings. The killer being safely locked up is as much a happy ending as marrying Mr or Ms Right. In both genres, the realism of the driving force (puzzle/need for happy resolution) combined with the not-quite-so-realistic comfort/fairytale value of the genre-prescribed ending (safety restored/happiness with a true soulmate) is what appeals. Selina Walker, publisher of Century and Arrow, attributed the recent rise of psychological thrillers to them being “a sort of ‘melding’ of the women’s relationship and detective genres”. And she is right; in this genre, which I first encountered in Nicci French’s The Memory Game and Joy Fielding’s See Jane Run, the crime puzzle and the love puzzle are wrapped up in the same package (“Is he/she the one, or is he/she dangerous for us?”). Many readers, perhaps most, will recognise this dilemma from our real lives, because in the UK’s new bestselling genre, the problems that accompany that question are usually — and with a comforting lack of realism — resolved as soon as one knows the correct answer."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"business/2018/apr/12/carpetright-to-close-92-outlets-shedding-hundreds-of-jobs","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-12T08:03:54Z","webTitle":"Carpetright to close 92 outlets, shedding hundreds of jobs","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/apr/12/carpetright-to-close-92-outlets-shedding-hundreds-of-jobs","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/apr/12/carpetright-to-close-92-outlets-shedding-hundreds-of-jobs","fields":{"headline":"Carpetright to close 92 outlets, shedding hundreds of jobs","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Carpetright has confirmed plans to close 92 stores, with the potential loss of 300 jobs, in a restructuring process designed to stave off administration. Shares in the UK’s biggest carpet retailer fell sharply 16% to 35p as the company said it wanted to move out of almost a quarter of its 409 stores in September. It will also be asking landlords for rent reductions of up to 50% on 113 more sites under a company voluntary arrangement, a process designed to stave off insolvency and which must be approved by its creditors. Completion of the CVA will be dependent on Carpetright also raising £60m in new funds from shareholders in order to reduce debt and cover the cost of the restructure. It also needs to secure £15m in short-term funding from its banks to cover immediate costs. Carpetright, which has a UK workforce of 2,700, has issued a series of profit warnings in recent months, sending its shares sharply lower. The company said the closures were necessary to “restore the viability of the group’s business model” as it struggles to survive amid a slowdown in the housing market and a squeeze on consumer spending which has dampened demand for expensive household goods. It has also faced increasing competition, particularly from the Tapi chain set up by Carpetright’s founder, Lord Harris, and his son. Harris left Carpetright in 2014. Several major retailers have fallen into financial difficulty as they battle with rising costs, from business rates and an increase in the legal minimum wage, as well as a shift towards online shopping. Carpetright’s troubles come a few weeks after fashion chain New Look, advised by Deloitte which is also advising the carpet retailer, won approval for a CVA that involves the closure of up to 60 of its 593 stores and rent reductions on dozens more. The baby goods retailer Mothercare is thought to be considering a similar move while Toys R Us pushed through a CVA before going bust earlier this year. The toy retailer said on Thursday it would close its remaining 75 stores by 24 April with the loss of more than 2,000 jobs. Carpetright said trading “remained difficult” and it expected to make a small loss for the year to the end of April. The company intends to provide further detail a few days after creditors vote on the CVA proposal on 26 April. Wilf Walsh, the chief executive of Carpetright, said: “These tough but necessary actions will enable us to address the burden of a legacy UK property estate consisting of too many poorly located stores on unsustainable rents and are essential if we are to restore our profitability and deliver a successful turnaround.” He said that getting rid of unwanted stores, most of which were signed up on 25-year leases in 1990s and early 2000s under previous management, would enable Carpetright to focus on improving the service and environment in its remaining outlets. “Completion of the CVA and equity financing will enable us to establish an appropriately sized estate of modernised stores on economic rents, complemented with a compelling online offer, enabling Carpetright to address the competitive threat from a position of strength.” Walsh said he was “committed to the project” of seeing the turnaround through. “I don’t think now would be the time to bail,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/apr/16/share-the-dream-the-games-that-celebrated-disability-sports","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-15T18:00:04Z","webTitle":"'Share the dream' – the Games that celebrated disability sports","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/apr/16/share-the-dream-the-games-that-celebrated-disability-sports","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/apr/16/share-the-dream-the-games-that-celebrated-disability-sports","fields":{"headline":"'Share the dream' – the Games that celebrated disability sports","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"“Australia made it the best,” says 15-year-old para athlete Kailyn Joseph of her Commonwealth Games experience. The Australian long-jumper, who has cerebral palsy, was one of an unprecedented number of athletes with disability who competed at the Games on the Gold Coast – there were nearly 300 in total, 73% more than in Glasgow four years ago. She is beaming with positivity, and not simply because she topped her T37 class, finishing fifth overall in the T38 final. At the Commonwealth Games she has felt a sense of inclusivity and support like nowhere else in sport. Indeed, for all the feats of athleticism, skill and determination seen in the past 11 days, arguably the most significant achievement has been the way para and able-bodied events have been seamlessly integrated to form a rich and highly watchable schedule. At the Commonwealth Games, even the medals table is a combination of able and para results. “It’s the best idea,” says Joseph of the shared format, which was introduced in 2002. “Being a para athlete, we look forward to the Commonwealth Games so much because here we’re just like any able-bodied person. We get to be with everyone else in the same environment. We don’t get that in the Paralympics and World Championships. It’s so great because it brings the focus on to para athletes. I love it.” What’s more, the attention has fallen on Joseph’s age and her talents rather than her disability: “I have messages saying, ‘You’re such an inspiration, you’re 15 years old and you’re competing with people who are 10 years older.’ It’s crazy,” she says. “And the athletes’ village couldn’t have been better. It was like home.” Kailyn Joseph – long jump Pictured above: Competitors in the T38 long jump during the track and field events at Carrara Stadium. There were many tales of joy and woe on the track at the Carrara Stadium. Jessica Frotten of Canada crashed during the women’s T54 1,500m final while Madison De Rozario took gold for Australia; her compatriot Kurt Fearnley took silver in men’s T54 1500m final, beaten by Canadian Alexandre Dupont by just 0.23 of a second. Pictured above: Jessica Frotten of Canada crashing; Madison de Rozario receiving her gold medal; Kurt Fearnley smiling at family as he leaves the track after being beaten to the line by Alexandre Dupont. Humble, gregarious, apprehensive, confident, proud – whatever their disposition and whatever their chances of victory, the para athletes all shared a sense of positivity about the value of para sport. “Don’t look at disability, look at your ability,” Friana Kwevira told the media after winning bronze in the women’s F46 javelin, making her Vanuatu’s first ever Commonwealth Games medalist. “If I can make it, you can make it.” “Here [at the Commonwealth Games] I feel I can contribute to the medal tally and make a difference,” said Bonnie Bunyau Gustin, a para weightlifter from Malaysia, who eventually missed out on a medal by a whisker, coming fourth in the men’s lightweight final. There was even a visually impaired photographer, Andrew Follows, and his guide dog, Leo, on the sidelines at the swimming and gymnastics to capture the action. He too shared their delight, saying his Games experience had been “absolutely epic”. Bonnie Bunyau Gustin – powerlifting Pictured above: Friana Kwevira (javelin) and Holly Robinson (javelin).

Sophie Pascoe – swimming Pictured above: Timothy Disken (swimming) and Andrew Follows (visually impaired photographer). In the para swimming, there was considerable success for Australian athletes. They claimed seven gold, contributing to an overall total of 73 medals alongside their able-bodied team-mates, thereby helping drive Australia to the top of the medal charts. Timothy Disken was one of the most remarkable competitors. Just six months ago he lay in a coma in Canada, with doctors unsure if he would survive emergency brain surgery. Disken suffers from hydrocephalus – the excessive accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid on the brain. He roared back to fitness and claimed gold in both the 100m freestyle S9 and 100m breaststroke SB8. “I’m pretty on top of the world,” he said afterwards. Pictured below: competitors in the para lawn bowls and para swimming events at the Commonwealth Games. In the lawn bowls, Ken Hanson made history as he became Australia’s oldest Commonwealth Games gold medal winner, aged 68. To do it he had to produce the shot of his life in the men’s B6/B7/B8 match, blasting away two Kiwi bowls from the jack, giving the Australians a last-gasp win. But it was not so much the stories of success that stood out as the spirit of togetherness that propelled the competitors. A fine example of this was in events that paired para and able-bodied entrants, such as Ann Muir, who operated as a “director” for her visually impaired team-mate Sue Curran, guiding her shots in. How fitting it was, then, that “Share the dream” was the motto of the Games.

But a former Labor foreign affairs minister, Bob Carr, who’s the director of the China-Australia relationships institute at the University of Technology Sydney, said Australia would be wrong to think its legislation was to blame, and instead pointed the finger at “flamboyant anti-China rhetoric” from political leaders. The prime minister was asked if Australian ministers were having trouble getting visas to China, and he told radio 3AW he was “very confident any misunderstandings will be resolved”. “I can’t – I wouldn’t say they have been declined. I have to be careful and precise about that,” Turnbull said. “I want to say we have a very good relationship with China. I regularly correspond with Chinese leaders – both the premier, Li Keqiang, and the president, Xi Jinping – but it is very – but the relationship is very deep and extensive. But from time to time there are differences in perception.” Speaking to Guardian Australia, Carr suggested reflection was in order. “If there is a freeze on visas from China, it is not in response to the anti-espionage, foreign interference legislation introduction in December. All countries … are entitled to such measures and China is realistic, it recognises that,” he said. “If there is a freeze, it is a response to the sometimes flamboyant anti-China rhetoric which has been adopted by Australia since early last year. “Australia has become, rhetorically, the most adamant anti-Chinese of all American allies. Not even Shinzo Abe of Japan has gone further than Australia in rhetorical combat.” Pointing to comments from then deputy prime minister Barnaby Joyce, who in early 2017 claimed China had the capacity to “overrun” Australia, and comments made by Turnbull during the Bennelong byelection, Carr said it would not be surprising if China had decided to retaliate. “It is almost as if we are inviting a response from Beijing,” he said. The Australian Financial Review reported the annual Australian trade and business expo looked set to be cancelled this year in response to the rising tensions, while government ministers were finding their visa requests denied. Turnbull blamed Chinese media for what he called a “misunderstanding”. “I’ve seen the reports and all I would say is there clearly has been some misunderstandings and mischaracterisations of our foreign interference legislation in the Chinese media,” he said. “I just want to say we have a very strong and respectful relationship and like every nation, we ensure, do everything we can to ensure, that our politics, that any foreign interference in our politics is open and declared, we don’t accept foreign interference in our politics and that is not directed at any one nation, and the most obvious example around the world right now, is Russia.” Asked a third time if Australian ministers were being denied visas, Turnbull sighed. “I want to be precise about this. I would say there has been a, there is certainly some tension, there has been a degree of tension in the relationship that has risen because of criticism in China because of our foreign interference laws, but it is very important that the Australian government ensures that only Australians are influencing their political processes and where foreigners seek to do so, they do it openly and transparently.” The legislative net the government plans on casting spreads further than China, but was lobbed in response to former Labor senator Sam Dastyari’s relationship with a Chinese donor, which ultimately led to his resignation. Business leaders and China watchers have called for caution. The former Labor prime minister Kevin Rudd accused the government of “neo-McCarthyism”. Earlier this year he called for a more balanced China strategy, “not one which begins to wave the flag of neo-McCarthyism in this country against the Chinese community that live here”. The Labor leader, Bill Shorten, asked for clarification over whether any Australian ministers had had their visas refused, but acknowledged Australia’s relationship with China had, historically, been bumpy. “In the past, the relationship with China has had more turbulence than you might want to say, but China is a very important part of Australia’s future,” he said. This week there have been reports China is looking to establish a military base on the Pacific island nation of Vanuatu, which both the government and opposition have raised concerns about. China has spent the past decade implementing its new foreign direction as it enjoys the fruits of an economic boon, while its authoritarian government looks to open doors to the international community. Those familiar with the Chinese-Australian relationship at both a business and political level told Guardian Australia the nation’s leaders needed to pay more attention to what China was saying as it laid out its plans, and urged a more “thoughtful and considered” engagement with the emerging world power. Turnbull’s plans to visit China later this year are reportedly still on track, although no date has yet been set. The Chinese embassy has been contacted for comment."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2018/apr/17/amazon-returns-hermes-terms-conditions-consumer-champions","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-17T06:00:34Z","webTitle":"Coming to terms with Hermes deliveries","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/apr/17/amazon-returns-hermes-terms-conditions-consumer-champions","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/apr/17/amazon-returns-hermes-terms-conditions-consumer-champions","fields":{"headline":"Coming to terms with Hermes deliveries","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"In February I ordered a Toshiba TV from Amazon which was delivered by Hermes. When I turned it on I discovered the screen was cracked and asked Amazon for a replacement. The new one – again delivered by Hermes – was fine, but I had to arrange the return of the faulty one. I decided to use Hermes again and paid the delivery fee (to be refunded by Amazon), repacking the faulty TV After the collection, I didn’t hear anything for several days so decided to “track” my parcel. It had arrived at Hermes’ local depot and gone no further. Hermes initially told me they had lost it but I could make a claim for compensation. It then told me that they do not compensate for TVs – as in their terms and conditions. I had, foolishly, assumed that as Amazon used Hermes to deliver, it would be the best choice to send it back. Now Amazon has charged me the full price for the missing TV, £408.97. So I have paid twice plus the Hermes delivery charge; a total of £828.23. It never occurred to me that Hermes could “lose” a parcel the size of the packed TV. Hermes is adamant it will not compensate me. And Amazon, despite my pleadings, insists its policy is to charge for items not returned. SH, Brixton, London SW2 Amazon has apologised and given you a full refund of the cost of the TV and delivery charge. Hermes says the confusion is because, while Hermes does deliver TVs on behalf of some retailers, its separate “myHermes” service (which you apparently used) – for small businesses/consumers/returns etc which is bookable online – will not compensate for loss or damage to certain items such as TVs. The myHermes website has the list of excluded items which shows that TVs are not covered by compensation for loss or damage. It says you should have seen this when you ordered the delivery. Hermes adds: “We would like to apologise to SH for the inconvenience caused and are pleased that the matter has been settled satisfactorily. Over the course of the year more than 99% of the 300m parcels we deliver arrive without any problems. “However, we always advise customers to check whether the items they are sending or returning are on the excluded items list, which is detailed very clearly on our website during the booking process.” We welcome letters but cannot answer individually.

They flirted with danger here, falling two goals behind on the night, before Danny Welbeck eased their nerves by scoring a beauty. Ramsey topped off a satisfying night with another goal in stoppage time. They will have to improve to get through the semi-finals, where they will meet one of Marseille, Atletico Madrid or Salzburg. Here are today’s other results: Marseille 5-2 RB Leipzig (agg: 6-4) Sporting 1-0 Atletico Madrid (agg: 1-2) Salzburg 4-1 Lazio (agg: 6-5) Elneny claims another assist, slipping a pass through to Ramsey , who eat the offside trap and then chips the advancing goalkeeper. Arsenal are into the semi-finals! 90+1 min: On another Arsenal counter, Ramsey rolls the ball to his right so that Welbeck can fire off a shot on the run. He bangs it off from 18 yards. But the keeper bats it away. 90 min: There will be at least three more minutes. There is no sign that Arsenal are going to do anything ridiculous during that time. 88 min: Koscielny clears a tame cross. All belief has drained from CSKA. Arsenal bound forward and see if they can help themselves to another goal. Ozil presents Iwobi with an ideal chance to do exactly that, but Iwobi shanks a sidefooter from 12 yards, sending it wide by almost as much. 86 min: Welbeck is everywhere now. All Arsenal’s attacks are revolving around him, and even CSKA’s attempted clearances are tending to find him. 84 min: Iwobi leads a counter-attack. He sends it wide to Ozil on the left. The German’s cross it put behind for a corner. Ozil delivers an out-swinger. Chambers gets his nut to it near the penalty spot, but it’s an easy save for the keeper. 82 min: Nababkin flings in a long throw. That triggers momentary chaos in the Arsenal box, until the ref blows for a foul on Monreal. 80 min: That goal by Welbeck was so good that it may help make up Gareth Southgate’s mind about taking him back to Russia for the World Cup. CSKA substitution: Milanov on, Chalow off. “You’ll be delighted to learn that the German for ‘phew’ is ‘puh!’,” reports Dominik Wallerius. Arsenal substitution: Iwobi on, Lacazette off after an ineffective display. That’s a superb goal! After a prolonged Arsenel possession play, Welbeck beat Nababkin with a wonderful turn wide on the left and then swapped passes with Elneny and curled an excellent finish into the far corner from 12 yards. Marvelous work by Welbeck and that should seal a place in the semi-final! 74 min: Welbeck wins a freekick mid-way inside the CSKa half. Ozil floats it into the box. Iganshevich heads it back out. 72 min: Golovin overhits a cross, giving an increasingly wobbly Arsenal a moment to try to steady themselves. CSKA substitution: Natcho on, Bistrovic off. 70 min: Panicky defending by Arsenal. Elneny garryowens the ball out of his box. Ozil ducks to avoid the dropping ball. Iganshevich, of all people, pounces on it and cracks off a fierce low shot from 25 yards. It whizzes just past the post! 66 min: Ozil swings over a corner. It’s flicked on (by Mustafi?). Koscielny, tries to slash it into the net at the back post but he’s off balance and can’t keep the shot down. Arsenal substitution: Chambers on, Wilshere off. The midfielder isn’t limping but may still have a sore ankle following that accident in the first half. Or maybe he was withdrawn because he kept giving the ball away in the second half. 65 min: A lucky ricochet off the referee puts Arsenal into an attacking position! Ozil’s shot is blocked but he fights to force a corner. “I hope these last couple of years at Arsenal won’t cloud over the fact that Petr Cech has been one of the greatest goalkeepers over the last two decades,” says Upender. “Only Buffon, Neur, Casillas, De Gea and Van der Sar have been better.” Yes, he was superb. He’s dwindling now, alas. 63 min: Wilshere gives the ball in midfield. CSKA romp forward. Then they slow down and probe. But Arsenal regrouped well to close down any openings. 61 min: Penalty!? The crowd yelp with glee after the ref points to the spot when Musa goes down under an untidy challenge by Mustafi. But it turns out the ref was not point to the spot, he was signalling for a goal kick. What’s the German for ‘phew’? 59 min: Elneny seems to have gone back into the defence again. He seems to have been assigned, of is treating himself to, a floating role. But this avant-garde approach isn’t making Arsenal any more secure... 57 min: Elneny guides a lovely header into the bottom corner of the net! But the goal is correctly ruled out for offside. 57 min: Elneny appears to have gone back into midfield. The back five wheeze lasted 10 minutes. 56 min: Arsenal steady themselves with some confidence-building passing in the opposing half. They don’t threaten to break through but at least they don’t break down. 55 min: Ozil darts past V Berezutski deep in his own half. The centreback makes sure Ozil doesn’t go on to start a counter-attack by chopping him down. He’s lucky not to be shown a yellow card. 53 min: Golovin curls the freekick over the wall and towards the bottom far corner. Cech dives like a felled tree and paws it around the post. 52 min: Ramsey concedes a freekick by tripping Golovin. It’s about 22 yards out, to the left ... Oh Arsenal! Golovin let fly with a swirling shot from 30 yards, Cech couldn’t hold it and doesn’t manage to push it very far away. Nababkin reacts faster than Monreal and lashes the bouncing ball into the net from a difficult angle! 49 min: Vitinho receives the ball in the box, does a little spin and clips it towards Chalov in the centre. Monreal heads it away. 47 min: CSKA have more zip in their play already. Elneny seems to have dropped deeper for Arsenal, serving now as a third centreback. Arsenal, then, have switched into holding mode. Which is not to be confused with Holding mode. 46 min: The teams are back on the pitch, including Wilshere. Since you’re here, why not sign up for our free, (occasionally) funny, (usually) 5pm-ish email, the Fiver? Here are the half-time scores from the other quarter-finals: Marseille 3-1 RB Leipzig (agg: 3-2) Sporting 1-0 Atletico Madrid (agg: 1-2) Salzburg 0-0 Lazio (agg: 2-4) The visitors are in danger of Arsenaling this up. They were on easy street for most of the match but ended up conceding a goal and becoming ragged. Suddenly their path to the semi-finals looks a lot more awkward than it should have done. CSKA have got their danders up and look dangerous going forward. And Wilshere limped down the tunnel at the break with a sore ankle: he may not return for the second half. 45+3 min: Wilshere attempts to play a one-two. His pass is poor ... and then he goes down and appeals for treatment. He looks in pain and is clutching his left ankle. No one touched him but perhaps he rolled it? 45+1 min: Ramsey is back on. There will be at least three more minutes in this half. 45 min: CSKA are playing with renewed confidence. They work the ball beautifully behind the Arsenal defence. Bistrovic cuts the ball back across the face of goal from the right. And Monreal wellies it clear before Musa can pounce! 44 min: Arsenal, so comfortable for much of the match, are flailing a little now, looking a tad ragged, especially with Ramsey still off the pitch. 43 min: A CSKA corner is cleared as far as the edge of the box. Bistrovic wraps his right foot around it and tries to guide it towards the top corner. he misses by a yard! 41 min: There’s a pause in play because Ramsey is down in need of treatment after mist-timing a tackle on Bistorvic. The boos from the home crowd suggest they think he’s trying to waste time and and interrupt CSKA’s momentum. But the Welshman is carried off on a stretcher to receive treatment. Straight after losing Dzagoev, CSKA get themselves back into the tie! Kuchaev sent over a cross from the left. Monreal was outjumped by Nababkin, whose header was parried by Cech. Chalow reacted quicker than Mustafi and hammered the ball into the net from close range! CSKA substitution: Vitinho on, Dzagoev off. CSKA’s best player has to withdraw because of an injury, though I can’t tell you what is wrong with him. 37 min: Golovin fluffs a chance at one end - failing to get off a shot after dashing into a good position - and then Arsenal hare down the other end and create an opening of their own. Welbeck sends a low ball across the face of goal ... just beyond Ozil. 35 min: A fast break by Arsenal. Ozil feeds Lacazette, who tries to roll a pass into the path of Ramsey. If he gets to it, he’ll have a free shot from eight yards! But Akinfeev scurries off his line to snatch it first. 34 min: Akinfeev hoofs the ball downfield. Musa does well to get it under controls and then runs at the Arsenal defence. But Mustafi blocks his shot. 32 min: Golovin pulls backs Wilshere, perhaps because he saw Arsenal’s game against Southampton last weekend and thinks Wilshere approves of that sort of thing. But the ref doesn’t, and he awards a freekick about 30 yards out. Arsenal make a mess of it. 30 min: Arsenal sit deep and allow CSKA to knock the ball around impotently in front of them. This is match is no thriller, but Wenger will be satisfied with how comfortable his team look. 27 min: Following a fine move y CSKA, Dzagoev finds space at the edge of the D and opens fire. Koscielny makes a fine block. And suddenly Arsenal are raiding forward! Lacazette unloads one from 20 yards. But V Berezutski does a Koscielny, jumping in front of the shot to make a good block. 25 min: Bellerin scoots down the right, nips a pass in to Ramsey and dashes forward in anticipation of the return. But Ramsey went for a flashy flick and got it wrong. CSKA have the ball back. 23 min: Ozil supplies Lacazette, running down the left. The Frenchman tries to dig out a centre for Welbeck. But instead he presents the ball to the goalkeeper. 21 min: Bistrovic tries his luck from long range. Don’t bother doing the lottery tonight, Kristijan. 19 min: Ozil botches a freekick, hitting it straight at the first defenders as his team-mates waited for a delivery in the box. But to the German’s credit, he then sprinted 30 yards back to regain possession, catching up with the speedy Musa, no less. 18 min: Bellerin wins a corner for Arsenal after being put in by Ozil, who’s starting to pull strings in the opposing half. But his corner isn’t up to much. 15 min: Ramsey slides a pass through to Welbeck, whose first touch is hefty. Had he taken that pass in his stride he would have been able to sprint past Iganshevic and through on goal. 13 min: A poor defensive header by Koscielny puts Arsenal under pressure. But Dzagoev relieves it by over-hitting his cross. Mustafi should head the ball into Koscileny’s face to wake him up. 12 min: CSKA build nicely down the right, Nababkin and Musa swapping clever passes. Nababkin then tries to slip a through-ball in to Dzagoev, but Monreal intercets. 10 min: Koscielny gets sloppy on half-way. CSKA take advantage and launch an attack, winning a freekick near the right-hand corner flag when Elneny handles. The freekick is headed clear. 8 min: Kuchaev sends over a hopeful cross from the left. Mustafi dives to clear, heading it upwards into Wilshere’s face. Wilshere goes down in and medics rush on to treat him. He soon gets back to his feet but looks a little groggy. You get the impression it’s going to take something freakish for CSKA to get back into this game, and maybe that little incident is the sign that things are about to get odd? 6 min: Cech sends a long ball forward for Lacazette to chase. But one of the Berezutskis beats him to it and clears. 5 min: It’s been a cosy start for Arsenal. The game is generally proceeding at quite leisurely pace and Arsenal are having plenty of the ball. 3 min: Despite the feats this week of Roma and Juve, there’s no early storm from CSKA: theirs is a slightly more cautious approach. Having said that, Cech has just had to charge off his line to intercept an intended pass to Musa, who had darted in on the wrong side of Mustafi. 1 min: CSKA set the ball rolling. The stadium is full and loud! CSKA are in blue jerseys with red shorts and socks. Arsenal are in their usual kit. And the giant screens around the ground are showing pictures of Yuri Gargarin to encourage CSKA to boldly go in search of an unlikely victory. The teams eventually stride out on to the pitch after Arsenal kept the home team waiting in the tunnel. You show ‘em who’s boss, Arsène! The TV pundits keep describing CSKA’s back three as “ageing”, which invites the question: who is not ageing? “Why isn’t Mkhitaryan even in the squad, this is ridiculous!” fumes David Thompson. He has a knee injury, David. And Xhaka has the flu. Here, in case you’re interested, is today’s Fiver, featuring the lowdown on Gigi Buffon’s meltdown. “I’m an Arsenal supporter,” confesses Nelson Kalberer. “Even so, I’m going to say that we lose but still go through to the semis. If we don’t go through, I’ll eat my shoe.” Is it a loafer? Around 300 Arsenal fans have travelled to this match and, according to Robbie Savage on BT, many of them were fraternising happily with CSKA supporters in Red Square this afternoon. What is more, they’ve all been presented with traditional Russian hats to keep them warm during the match. A lovely touch, and Arsenal are probably feeling a little embarrassed that hand out bowlers to all the CSKA fans who visited London last week. “Ah! The Berezutski twins are in,” yelps Charles Antaki. “I know nothing about them other than they are rather hulking and slow, and that various Guardian writers assure us that their combined age is over 100. So yes, there is a good chance that Arsenal will get past them to score the one or two goals that will make the tie safe. But as you rightly warn, look what happened earlier this week; and as Arsenal fans will add, remember that this is Arsenal.” Those Berezutski lads are not as old as you think: they’re 35, mere pups compared to their fellow centreback Ignashevich, who’s 38, older than today’s referee (who’s 36, if you must know). Here’s what the Arsenal manager has said about his team’s approach: ““I think the best way for us is just to play to win the game. Mentally we have to be in a high place. We have an opportunity to go into the semi-final so all we have to think about is to win and go through.” And here’s what he says about the overall atmosphere in Moscow. “Surprisingly peaceful. Everybody is very nice and you cannot feel any tension at all. The conditions were perfect last night [when they trained at the ground].” Arsenal make two changes to the side that started in the first leg, with Elneny and Welbeck replacing Xhaka and Mkhitaryan. Ther are three alterations to CSKA’s side, as Bistrovic, Natcho and Chalov come in – those changes are in all midfield, where CSKA were decent last week – their problems were all in defence. Chalov helped earn his place by scoring in the weekend’s in the derby defeat by Dinamo. CSKA: Akinfeev; Ignashevich, A Berezutski, V Berezutski; Nababkin, Golovin, Bistrovic, Dzagoev, Kuchaev; Chalov, Musa Subs: Pomazun, Milanov, Vitinho, Schennikov, Natcho, Zhamaletdinov, Khosonov Arsenal: Cech; Bllerin, Mustafi, Koscielny, Monreal; Ramsey, Elneny, Wilshere; Welbeck, Ozil; Lacazette Subs: Macey, Mertesacker, Holding, Iwobi, Chambers, Kolasinac Nketiah Referee: F Zwayer (Germany) After what the Champions League has thrown up this week and, indeed, some of Arsenal’s away performances this season, who amongst us is willing to say that CSKA Moscow have no chance of turning this tie around? Arsène Wenger’s team lead 4-1 from the first leg so have one foot in their first European semi-final for nine years – but that does not mean they are incapable of tripping up. Having said that, CSKA have not been particularly strong at home in Europe this season, already losing to Manchester United, Basel and Lyon. And Arsenal are the Europa’s League’s top scorers and were clearly superior in London last week: their defence wobbled at times but CSKA’s was far worse in the face of Arsenal’s rapid attacking. So, all things considered, CSKA actually have no chance of turning this tie around. You see if I’m wrong. But even if the contest seems over, this match may be welcomed as an opportunity to improve Anglo-Russian relations in some small way at this time of high tension. Let’s hope everyone gets along nicely in and around the stadium today."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"technology/2018/apr/12/racism-slurs-reddit-post-ceo-steve-huffman","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-12T09:56:03Z","webTitle":"Open racism and slurs are fine to post on Reddit, says CEO","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/apr/12/racism-slurs-reddit-post-ceo-steve-huffman","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2018/apr/12/racism-slurs-reddit-post-ceo-steve-huffman","fields":{"headline":"Open racism and slurs are fine to post on Reddit, says CEO","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Racist slurs are permitted on Reddit, says the popular social news and discussion site’s chief executive, Steve Huffman.Within a discussion thread that followed the publishing of the site’s transparency report on Russian propaganda, Huffman, in reply to a question from a Reddit user about whether “open racism, including slurs” are allowed on the platform, said their use was not against Reddit’s rules. “On Reddit, the way in which we think about speech is to separate behavior from beliefs,” said Huffman under his username spez. “This means on Reddit there will be people with beliefs different from your own, sometimes extremely so. When users’ actions conflict with our content policies, we take action.” Huffman’s controversial response explains why outwardly racist and high-profile communities have been allowed to operate on a site that has 542 million monthly visitors. “Our approach to governance is that communities can set appropriate standards around language for themselves. Many communities have rules around speech that are more restrictive than our own, and we fully support those rules,” Huffman said. Reddit’s approach to offensive behaviour has evolved from a position of actively banning users for hate speech to one allowing it under the guise of free speech. In July 2015 Huffman said of banning hate speech: “I don’t think we should silence people just because their viewpoints are something we disagree with. There is value in the conversation, and we as a society need to confront these issues.

Featured in this year’s lineup are new movies from major auteurs Jean Luc-Godard, Pawel Pawlikowski, Wim Wenders and Spike Lee, as well as a genuine blockbuster in the form of Solo: A Star Wars Story, but expected works by Lars von Trier, Mike Leigh and Terry Gilliam are not present, while the official selection features a lack of women directors in its lineup. Godard, Pawlikowski and Lee will all debut films in the official competition. Veteran French auteur Godard’s film Le Livre d’Image is a video essay in the style of many of his recent works, while Pawlikowski’s Cold War tells the story of a romance set across multiple countries in the 1950s. Lee, meanwhile, will debut BlacKkKlansman; a crime drama about an African American man who infiltrates a Ku Klux Klan chapter, it is likely to be among the most provocative films in this year’s competition. The trio are joined in the race for the Palme d’Or by directors from Egypt, Japan, Lebanon, South Korea and China. Also included in the official selection are films by two dissident directors who have been in conflict with the governments of their homelands: Jafar Panahi, who has been banned from leaving his native Iran, will debut Three Faces, while Russian director Kirill Serebrennikov, who has been under house arrest since 2010 over fraud charges, will debut Leto, a drama about the underground rock and roll scene in Soviet Russia. Cannes festival director Thierry Frémaux urged both Russia and Iran to let the directors attend this year’s event. Another Iranian director, Asghar Farhardi, will open the festival with his film Everybody Knows, a thriller that stars Penélope Cruz and Javier Bardem. David Robert Mitchell moves from horror (It Follows) to film noir with Under the Silver Lake, which stars Andrew Garfield; while Gomorrah and Tale of Tales director Matteo Garrone will present his “urban western” Dogman. Wim Wenders, meanwhile, will appear out of competition with Francis: A Man of His Word, a behind-the-scenes documentary about Pope Francis’s time as head of the catholic church. The Star Wars spin-off Solo will also premiere out of competition, while Christopher Nolan will present a special 70mm screening of 2001: A Space Odyssey. While the lineup for this year’s festival was global in scope, there was a notable absence of female directors. Only three of the 18 films competing for this year’s Palme d’Or are directed by women, the same number as at last year’s festival, a situation criticised at the time by Cannes jury member Jessica Chastain. Discussing the discrepancy, Frémaux blamed wider issues in the film industry. “There are not enough women directors but we don’t have time to talk about that here. Our point of view is that the films are selected for their intrinsic qualities. There will never be a selection with a positive discrimination for women,” he said. Ahead of what will be the first edition of Cannes since the emergence of sexual misconduct allegations against mogul Harvey Weinstein, a regular attendee at the festival in previous years, Frémaux described the current reckoning over sexual abuse as an “earthquake” moment for both the festival and the industry as a whole. He indicated that the festival would look to change some of its policies in regards to gender equality. “We will discuss equality of salary,” he said. “We want to question our own process about the parity of the juries. The festival director also noted that this year’s festival jury, which will be headed up by Cate Blanchett, would feature more women than men. However, Melissa Silverstein, founder of activist group Women and Hollywood says that Cannes needs to do more to promote female film-makers. “The Cannes Film Festival is arguably the most important film event in the film world outside of the Oscars. When we don’t have enough women-directed films in the lineup the message received is that women are not good enough. “If you pay attention to the film community, all around us, the conversation is shifting, and people are pushing for inclusion. It would be great if the Cannes Film Festival was a part of that,” Silverstein added. Notable too is the absence of several major films that had been tipped for inclusion. There is no place The House That Jack Built, the serial killer drama directed by von Trier. Von Trier had been banned from the festival in 2011 after the director describing himself as “a Nazi” and said that he “understood Hitler”, but had been widely expected to be welcomed back for this year’s event. Also missing is Leigh’s historical epic Peterloo, while Gilliam’s long-awaited comedy The Man Who Killed Don Quixote cannot be screened at the festival due to a legal dispute between Gilliam and one of the movie’s backers. It is possible that one or more of those films will be added to the lineup at a later date, with Frémaux promising more news on Von Trier’s film in “a few days”. However, one name that will definitely absent from this year’s lineup is that of Netflix, with the company’s chief content officer Ted Sarandos announcing on Wednesday that none of the streaming giant’s films would be screening at the festival. The move comes in response to a ruling by Cannes that demands that all films competing for prizes at the festival receive a full theatrical release. Despite the impasse, Frémaux said that Netflix remains “welcome in Cannes. We have an ongoing debate. We want to tell Ted [Sarandos] to come, let’s keep talking.” The Cannes film festival will be held from 8 to 19 May."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"music/2018/apr/12/piotr-anderszewski-these-diabelli-variations-were-a-totally-enthralling-musical-journey","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-12T11:12:02Z","webTitle":"Piotr Anderszewski review – Diabelli Variations are a totally enthralling musical journey","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/apr/12/piotr-anderszewski-these-diabelli-variations-were-a-totally-enthralling-musical-journey","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/apr/12/piotr-anderszewski-these-diabelli-variations-were-a-totally-enthralling-musical-journey","fields":{"headline":"Piotr Anderszewski review – Diabelli Variations are a totally enthralling musical journey","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Ever since Piotr Anderszewski took himself out of the running for the 1990 Leeds Piano Competition, walking out during his semi-final recital when he was one of the favourites to take the first prize, his name has been inextricably linked with the Diabelli Variations. By no means regular competition repertoire, the Beethoven had been the main work in Anderszewski’s Leeds programme (alongside Webern’s Op 27 Variations), and a decade later, his recording of it was widely hailed as the finest to appear in many years. That interpretation has clearly lost none of its freshness and vivid commitment over the subsequent decade and a half. As the second part of Anderszewski’s Barbican recital it was an astonishing performance, perhaps the most completely convincing reading of the Diabelli I’ve ever heard in the concert hall. Some readings, even from indisputably great pianists, can’t entirely avoid squareness in a work that, for all its moments of the transcendence that only late Beethoven can access, sometimes seems to fall back on the mechanics of variation form. But there was no trace of that, or of routine of any kind, in a single bar here. Every one of the 33 variations seemed freshly imagined, with their dizzying contrasts of wit and pathos, explosive energy and communing stillness; it made for a totally enthralling musical journey in which not a single step was misplaced. The only possible encore after that was more late Beethoven, and Anderszewski duly obliged with the first of the Op 126 Bagatelles. The first half of his recital had been devoted to Bach, with three preludes and fugues from the second book of the Well-Tempered Clavier, followed by the third of the English Suites, in G minor. That was equally extraordinary in its own way, with a Glenn Gould-like clarity to the textures and rhythmic articulation, informed by a freewheeling imagination that was never wilful. Anderszewski certainly brought his own ideas to the music, but whether in the stream of melodic invention that courses through the C major Prelude, the quiet intensity with which he invested the opening of D sharp minor Fugue, or the spiky, Scarlatti-like exuberance of the pair of gavottes in the suite, they never seemed anything other than quintessential Bach."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"music/2018/apr/17/snail-ballet-dancers-slow-pixel-elizabeth-saint-jalmes-cyril-leclerc","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-17T16:39:00Z","webTitle":"Snail ballet: 176 slow dancers await their moment in the slimelight","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/apr/17/snail-ballet-dancers-slow-pixel-elizabeth-saint-jalmes-cyril-leclerc","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/apr/17/snail-ballet-dancers-slow-pixel-elizabeth-saint-jalmes-cyril-leclerc","fields":{"headline":"Snail ballet: 176 slow dancers await their moment in the slimelight","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Only minutes after meeting Elizabeth Saint-Jalmes and Cyril Leclerc at their Paris apartment, I’m invited into their darkened boudoir. Several snails are crawling on the floor next to the bed. Each has a little light-emitting diode attached to its shell that activates sensors on a nearby speaker designed by Elizabeth that is pumping out soothingly drone-like music composed by Cyril. What I’m witnessing is a teaser for a six-hour, 176-snail ballet called Slow Pixel that the two artists are bringing to London later this month for its UK premiere as part of Cryptic’s Sonica festival. For only £4.50, you can watch illuminated snails crawl around a darkened room to challenging music. Don’t tell me you’re not tempted. “These snails were raised to be eaten,” Elizabeth whispers. It’s striking how all three of us change our behaviour in this chambre des escargots – we speak more quietly, walk gingerly around the room (none of us want to hear the crunch of calcium carbonate shell) and find ourselves kneeling to get a closer view. We, as much as the snails, are performers in this ballet. Can you assure me, I whisper, that no gastropods were harmed in the making of this artwork? “Absolutely,” replies Elizabeth, thoughtfully placing one on my notebook, the better to illuminate my shorthand. She tells me that these eight snails, and the hundreds more she and Cyril keep in the cellar, are from the gastronomically prized species gros-gris (fat greys). “We are vegetarians and in a sense we have freed them from their destiny.” That destiny, most likely, was to be sauteed in garlic butter. Cyril produces a plant mister and sprays the snails with water. “They like humidity and showering them helps simulate that,” he says. Don’t the snails get stressed with diodes strapped to their shells? “Snails don’t get stressed,” he says. “Their heart rate is always 35 beats per minute. You know when they’re upset, though. They retreat into their shells.” Cyril, 43, and Elizabeth, 40, have been using snails in their art for eight years. Their first gastropod-based interventions involved feeding snails paper of different colours. Cyril recalls: “We would feed them red paper and they would shit red patterns. And if we fed them yellow and blue paper, what colour do you think they would shit?” Green? “Exactly.” The French couple’s art has an appealingly daffy, anti-commercial tenor. To clinch the point, Elizabeth takes a hunting horn from its case and blows a few notes so loud as to give any urban foxes in the 20th arrondissement the willies. Not to be outdone, Cyril starts strumming his tampura, an Indian stringed instrument often used to create droning, meditative effects. As I sit on the sofa drinking Japanese tea and snacking on cheese and nuts while they blow and strum, I wonder what the neighbours think. “We’re very much influenced by Fluxus,” says Elizabeth. That group of 60s artists, musicians, performers and even chefs often created art happenings involving chance, factors that provoked interactions between artist and audience. Elizabeth and Cyril’s work is neo-Fluxus, combining music, choreography and drawing, plus free-roaming snails. They hope to seduce visitors into a new relation with space and time. In a world where, as Parisian philosopher Paul Virilio has argued, technological change destroys space and compresses time, what a beguiling existential corrective it is to slow to a snail’s pace for a few hours. “Remember when you were a kid and you could sit and look at an insect for hours? Or watch a snail crawl across a path?” asks Elizabeth. Cyril hopes it will give visitors a Proustian rush, provoking bittersweet meditation on impermanence and lost time. During the performance, Elizabeth and Cyril place the light-bearing snails on the walls, creating effects that simulate the night sky or city lights. While the snails crawl up and down, the artists project video footage behind them shot from the window of the Trans-Siberian Express – as if to emphasise the difference between the human and gastropod pace of life. “What we both found amazing was how on the train, which actually only goes at about 80kmh, you can do nothing but eat, sleep and read – so your mind and body are in a different temporal relation to the world,” says Elizabeth. “That inspired much of what we’re thinking about with Slow Pixel.” Do many visitors stay for six hours? “It varies – some stay for just a few minutes,” says Elizabeth. “We insist only on one thing – people leave their phones outside.” They’ve both noticed how some visitors will try to smuggle their phones into the performance space, furtively taking selfies with snails. “It’s a shame when they do that, because we’re hoping to encourage mindfulness,” says Cyril. “Be in the moment, not always photographing it.” Such mindful art is a growing cultural tendency, embracing things from colouring books, to Rolf Hind’s opera Lost in Thought, to the TV shows that court viewers who want to get a real-time reindeer’s eye view of crossing the Arctic. “These can be immersive experiences for individuals, liberating them from the everyday world,” says Elizabeth. “Just for a few hours.” Minutes later when I’m strap-hanging on the Métro, hurrying to catch the Eurostar home to meet a deadline, I realise these two French artists are right: us heedless humans have much to learn from the wisdom of snails. Slow Pixel is at Kings Place, London, 20-21 April."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"politics/2018/apr/12/may-can-strike-syria-without-commons-vote-says-senior-tory","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-12T10:42:53Z","webTitle":"David Davis says he has been reassured over his doubts on Syria action","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/apr/12/may-can-strike-syria-without-commons-vote-says-senior-tory","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/apr/12/may-can-strike-syria-without-commons-vote-says-senior-tory","fields":{"headline":"David Davis says he has been reassured over his doubts on Syria action","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"David Davis, Theresa May’s most dovish cabinet minister, has said he has been given reassurance over the doubts about military action in Syria that led him to vote against David Cameron’s proposals in 2013. On Thursday, May was also given the backing of her most influential foreign policy backbencher, Tom Tugendhat, to take part in any western strike against Syria without a Commons mandate. Cabinet ministers returned to London from the Easter break for a meeting on Thursday afternoon that is widely expected to sign off British involvement in any attack. Davis told a Wall Street Journal conference in London that he had not previously been convinced that the Syrian regime was behind the 2013 chemical weapons attack in Ghouta, which provoked the vote in parliament on taking action against the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad. Cameron lost the vote after a number of Tories rebelled and Labour MPs opposed action. The Brexit secretary said he had also been concerned about the lack of a detailed plan for what would happen after intervention, but said he had been assured those concerns about the current situation would be answered. “There were two reasons in 2013. We had not provided the evidence and the intelligence that we knew who it was, and secondly there was not a proper plan thought through properly. Those two things I’m assured we’re going to answer today,” he said. Davis said no final decision had been made. “The cabinet is meeting in full at 3.30 to discuss it. The situation in Syria is horrific – the use of chemical weapons is something the world has to prevent. We of all countries in the world, after the Skripal affair, have perhaps the most immediate knowledge of it apart from the Syrians themselves. “We’ve got very delicate circumstances and we’ve got to make a judgment on a very careful, very well thought-out, well thought-through basis.” Earlier on Thursday, Tugendhat, chair of the foreign affairs select committee, insisted the prime minister had the right through the royal prerogative to make the decision without consulting parliament. May is understood to be close to committing the UK to join a coordinated military intervention in Syria, insisting the chemical weapons attack on Douma “cannot go unchallenged”. Parliament is not due to meet until Monday. With Donald Trump and his senior advisers delaying weekend plans to stay in Washington for a meeting of the US national security council, Tugendhat said the danger of Russian retaliation had to be set against the need to respond to the breach of the international ban on the use of chemical weapons. He told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “I think that looking at what we’re doing is rather more important than looking at what Russia might do. What we’re doing is dealing with a violation of the 1925 Geneva gas protocol, and exercising the 2005 responsibility to protect. “Russia signed up to both of those and what we’re seeing is moments when Russia should be standing with us.” Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour leader, is demanding a vote in parliament first, a position backed on Thursday morning by the SNP leader in the Commons, Ian Blackford, who said: “It’s a very dangerous step for the government to take action without having that consent of parliament and by extension the consent of the people of the country.” But the first head of Britain’s national security council, Lord Ricketts, also argued that May could act first and consult parliament later. “I think PM has to have discretion to take that sort of urgent targeted action where necessary and then present the case to parliament afterwards.” It has become a convention that the government must have a mandate from parliament for military action since the vote on the Iraq war in 2003. MPs on both sides now believe the 2013 vote was a mistake, because it conferred a sense of impunity on the Assad regime that was likely to have added to its readiness to use chemical weapons. Even so, there is no guarantee of a majority for action. May has to rely on the DUP’s 10 votes to win, and even a small revolt could defeat her. An overnight poll suggested barely a fifth of voters backed even a targeted military response, and there is wide concern that it might escalate. Lindsey German, who founded Stop the War, told Today: “No one knows where this is going to end ... You can see how this could spread very, very dangerously indeed.” Last year, Trump launched a limited missile strike after agas attack, and Russia was given enough warning in advance to withdraw military personnel from the target. Ricketts insisted such “deconfliction” could be used again."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2018/apr/13/no-plan-to-protect-queenslands-green-haired-turtle-from-extinction","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-12T18:00:14Z","webTitle":"No plan to protect Queensland's green-haired turtle from extinction","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/apr/13/no-plan-to-protect-queenslands-green-haired-turtle-from-extinction","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/apr/13/no-plan-to-protect-queenslands-green-haired-turtle-from-extinction","fields":{"headline":"No plan to protect Queensland's green-haired turtle from extinction","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The Australian government does not have a plan to save an endangered Australian turtle species that received global attention on Thursday for its green mohawk and its ability to breathe through its genitals. The Mary river turtle, found only in that one river in Queensland, attracted worldwide headlines as one of the standout species on a new list of the most vulnerable reptile species compiled by the Zoological Society of London (ZSL). But despite this listing it does not have a national recovery plan to protect it from extinction and it is unclear whether any federal government funds have been specifically allocated for its protection. The turtle is 29th on ZSL’s Evolutionary Distinct and Globally Endangered (Edge) list for reptiles, which highlights the conservation needs of some of the world’s unique reptiles. The turtle is not the only reptile species found in Australia to appear on the list, with eight species making the top 100, and seven of those appearing in the top 40. Among them are the critically endangered western swamp tortoise, which is number seven on the Edge list, the pig-nosed turtle, number 19 on the list, and the Gulbaru Gecko, a critically endangered Queensland species that was only discovered in 2001 and appears at 40 on the list. Conservationists say the list highlights the lack of conservation attention many Australian reptiles receive compared to more charismatic and iconic mammal and bird species. The federal government’s threatened species strategy specifically targets 20 mammals, 20 birds and 30 plants, but no reptiles. “Australia is one of the richest places in the world when it comes to reptile biodiversity, yet our federal government’s threatened species strategy doesn’t even include reptiles. It is an entire class of species missing from the current national recovery efforts,” said Australian Conservation Foundation policy analyst James Trezise. “The research shows species like the Mary river turtle and western swamp tortoise are globally significant. If we are to see these species survive into the future we need more effective laws to protect their habitat and our governments must significantly increase funding available for their recovery”. According to the Edge list, the population numbers for the Mary river turtle are unknown. The species is listed as endangered under Australia’s national environment laws – the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act – but it has not been recommended for a national recovery plan. Instead, the Environment and Energy Department’s EPBC database lists a two-page conservation advice that includes a list of priority actions that would help protect the species. The pig-nosed turtle, which appears at number 19 on the Edge list, is not protected under Australia’s national environment laws at all because it was ruled as ineligible for a threatened species listing under the EPBC Act in 2005. Scientists and conservationists say the Edge list also highlights the dire state of affairs for non-turtle species such as lizards and snakes. Seven of the Australian species that appear in the top 100 on the list are turtles. Associate Professor Dave Chapple from the School of Biological Sciences at Monash University said the dominance by turtles on the list was partly because more was known about them. “On a worldwide level, the number of reptiles is 10,711 as of February this year. The number of turtle species is only 350. There are 6,451 lizards and 3,691 snakes,” Associate Professor Chapple said. “Obviously the number of lizards and snakes is substantially higher than all of the other groups. But what generally happens is turtles are quite large – which has been linked to increased extinction risk – charismatic and well known, so we know a lot more about their conservation status.” He is hoping that will soon change in Australia with the forthcoming publication of new conservation information about Australia’s lizards and snakes. The International Union for Conservation of Nature conducted two workshops in Australia in 2017 to assess the conservation status of about 970 of Australia’s snake and lizard species, which at the time represented 100% of Australian species. Of those, 10 to 15% are believed to be threatened. Before that, only about 15% of Australian snakes and lizards had had their conservation status assessed by the IUCN. Associate Professor Chapple said now that scientists knew which Australian lizard and snake species met the criteria for a threatened species listing through the IUCN, they were using the information to focus on the species most in need of being added to the list of threatened species in Australia. “In terms of actions based on our updated knowledge of the threat status, we need to put work into that area and that’s where our focus should be now,” he said. Tim Doherty, a research fellow Deakin University’s Centre for Integrative Ecology, said more support for Australian reptiles was essential because the country was a global hotspot for reptile biodiversity. “We’ve got more than 1,000 different species which equates to roughly 10% of the global total of the world’s reptiles, and more than 90% of our species are endemic, meaning they’re found nowhere else in the world,” Dr Doherty said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/apr/12/the-foreign-donation-bill-is-a-smokescreen-to-attack-civil-society","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-12T07:01:46Z","webTitle":"The foreign donation bill is a smokescreen to attack civil society | Lee Rhiannon","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/12/the-foreign-donation-bill-is-a-smokescreen-to-attack-civil-society","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/12/the-foreign-donation-bill-is-a-smokescreen-to-attack-civil-society","fields":{"headline":"The foreign donation bill is a smokescreen to attack civil society","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Australian democracy has been under threat for some time. There is a group of political operators who are able to walk the halls of parliament, arrange meetings with decision-makers at the drop of a hat, funnel big money into political parties, and influence regulations, policies and legislation. Nobody reading this will be surprised when I say that this group of powerful political operators comprises corporations and industry lobby groups. However, unless you’ve been following the Turnbull government’s electoral funding and disclosure reform bill, you might be surprised to learn that apparently there is a bigger threat to democracy, a more powerful group of political operators in Australia – charities and community groups. That is the laughable idea the Turnbull government would have you believe. After years of donations scandals including the jailing of disgraced MPs; after witnessing the revolving door between powerful industries and MP and political staffer positions; and after over $1bn in political donations have been made – the government claims they’re finally listening to the people of Australia and addressing political donation reform. Only, they’re not. The Turnbull government is using the overwhelming public appetite for politics to be cleaned up as a smokescreen for pushing through legislation that will curtail the activities and voice of charities and community groups. Tim Costello, the Human Rights Law Centre, the Hands Off Our Charities Coalition and many others have highlighted the disastrous consequences this legislation will have on our civil society if allowed to pass. There is a glaring discrepancy in this bill. Not only does it act as a smokescreen for the government to attack civil society, it completely fails to address the actual, documented threat to our democratic system - big money. The joint standing committee on electoral matters, of which I am a member, this week published its report on the bill. Significantly, the majority report recommends that a legislative framework should cover industry associations and businesses and not just charities and not for profits. However, the Turnbull government has so far shown no inclination to make international capital flows through different business interests more transparent, or prohibit funds raised in majority foreign-owned businesses or industry lobby groups being used in political activities. This underscores their myopic interest in cracking down on civil society groups while ignoring the far greater problem of big money’s influence on politics. We’ve seen the power of big money in politics. From tax regulations that allow one third of companies to pay no corporate tax to the mining lobby toppling a sitting PM; from a housing system that puts profit before the human right to shelter to a gambling sector that is allowed to funnel billions out of the pockets of working Australians, some of whom are suffering crippling addictions. Yet instead of tackling the issue of big money, the Turnbull government ignores the evidence, ignores the public outcry for change, and disingenuously dresses up an astounding attack on political enemies as political donation reform. Of course we need political donations reform – an issue the Greens have been campaigning on for over 15 years. Our vision for reform includes: a ban on donations from for-profit corporations and foreign entities, caps on other donations, caps on election expenditure, increased transparency and real-time online disclosure. Turnbull’s bill is so far removed from addressing political donations reform that had it been law at the time of the Sam Dastyari scandal, those donations still wouldn’t have been illegal. We do need real reform on political donations and to get big money out of politics. What we don’t need is more spin and attacks on civil society from this government. • Lee Rhiannon is the Greens’ democracy spokesperson and Senator for NSW"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/2018/apr/12/china-named-worlds-top-executioner-as-global-rate-falls","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-12T04:53:20Z","webTitle":"China named 'world’s top executioner' as global rate falls","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/12/china-named-worlds-top-executioner-as-global-rate-falls","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/apr/12/china-named-worlds-top-executioner-as-global-rate-falls","fields":{"headline":"China named 'world’s top executioner' as global rate falls","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"China remains the “world’s top executioner” amid a decline in executions worldwide, Amnesty International has said in its annual report on capital punishment. According to the report, released on Thursday, China implemented “more death sentences than the rest of the world combined”. Amnesty believes thousands of executions and death sentences occurred in 2017 in China, where they are considered a state secret. China aside, executions worldwide dropped again in 2017, with at least 993 recorded in 23 countries – down 4% from 2016 and 39% from 2015. At least 2,591 death sentences were recorded in 53 countries in 2017 – down from a record high of 3,117 in 2016 – and at least 21,919 people are known to be under a death sentence, Amnesty said. The human rights group said the “positive trend” towards ending capital punishment was exemplified by sub-Saharan Africa, where 20 countries have now abolished the death penalty for all crimes. Just two countries in the region, Somalia and South Sudan, carried out executions last year. “The progress in sub-Saharan Africa reinforced its position as a beacon of hope for abolition,” the Amnesty International secretary general, Salil Shetty, said. Excluding China, 84% of the reported executions last year were carried out in just four countries: Iran, Saudi Arabia, Iraq and Pakistan. Bahrain, Jordan, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates resumed executions in 2017. Iran has the highest known figure despite an 11% drop on 2016, executing at least 507 people, with at least 31 death sentences carried out in public. The US remained the only country in the Americas to carry out executions, with 23 last year, up slightly from the year before. Shetty said with the progress in Africa, “the isolation of the world’s remaining executing countries could not be starker”. But Amnesty said the continued use of the death penalty for drug-related offences was “distressing”, with 15 countries last year imposing death sentences or carrying out executions. Drug-related executions were recorded in China, Iran, Singapore and Saudi Arabia, where “drug-related beheadings rocketed from 16% of total executions in 2016 to 40” in 2017. The US was noted for putting people on death row who have mental or intellectual disabilities, a criticism also levelled against Japan, the Maldives, Pakistan and Singapore."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/apr/13/rugby-misogynists-public-support","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-13T05:00:27Z","webTitle":"Spare me these sob stories about the rugby misogynists | Suzanne Moore","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/13/rugby-misogynists-public-support","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/13/rugby-misogynists-public-support","fields":{"headline":"Spare me these sob stories about the rugby misogynists","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"How do legends have sex, and who do they have it with? Perhaps it’s none of my business, except when these things become public knowledge, it’s because they are exposed in court. That word “legends” sticks in my mind. Or rather in my craw. It was in one of the WhatsApp messages read out in court in the Belfast trial of the “star rugby players”, Paddy Jackson and Stuart Olding, accused of rape and unanimously found not guilty last month. The messages discussing what had happened the night before, for which they later apologised, talked of “shaggers”, of “Belfast sluts”, of “pumping a bird” and “spit-roasting”. Such technical terms had to be explained by barristers to the judge and jury, but somehow it was the self-glorifying “Why are we are such legends?” in the players’ WhatsApp group that got me. Legends indeed. I am not sure this is the word they would be using now. This was a high-profile trial in which the woman who had accused them of rape had her bloodied knickers passed around a courtroom, in which the taxi driver who took her home told of her sobbing, and her distressed texts were also read out. Since the men’s acquittal further details have been released, of a pornographic video shared with Olding the day after the night in question. The jury unanimously acquitted these men of rape. Their friends Blane McIlroy and Rory Harrison were unanimously found not guilty of indecent exposure and of perverting the course of justice. None of these men did anything illegal. Yet they are now fighting in a different court: the court of public opinion. The widespread disgust at the way that they spoke about the woman who they had sex with clings to them. It is the nature of what these young men said to each other that has appalled so many people and led to the creation of the hashtag #IBelieveHer. This week a full-page advertisement has been taken out in the Belfast Telegraph by supporters of Jackson and Olding, asking that their suspension from Ulster and Ireland rugby duties be lifted. The advertisement reads: “As Ulster and Irish rugby fans we want these innocent men reinstated and rightly allowed to resume their roles … The IRFU [Irish Rugby Football Union] should take note of the silent majority and not bow to the court of social media.” One wonders about the kind of sex these premier athletes actually want. This week Otto Putland, a swimmer who represented Wales at the Commonwealth Games, was also cleared of rape at Cardiff crown court. He had denied forcing himself on a woman after she had consensual sex with his friend, the Olympic swimmer Ieuan Lloyd. Does male bonding have to involve the seeming humiliation of women, as it does in some American college fraternities? Is it always a kind of performance that needs to be watched by their mates? In the Belfast trial where a slang expert was brought in to explain “spit–roasting”, the woman spoke of one player penetrating her from behind while another player walked in naked, holding his penis, looking to join in. Footballer Ched Evans, unanimously cleared of rape in 2016, had sex with a woman in a hotel room following a night out in Rhyl, immediately after his friend Clayton McDonald had had sex with her. Evans left via a fire exit without speaking to the woman. His younger brother and another man watched the encounter through a window. So is this is the ultimate in hyper-masculine male bonding? What is happening when these young sportsmen who know each other’s bodies, whose business is their bodies, choose to enact their sexual desires in this way? Of course, there is no reason why such sexual activity should not be consensual, and a lot of pornography indicates that such encounters are every woman’s fantasy. Perhaps, though, in such scenarios, the women is the vessel through which these young guys communicate their power to each other? These men are not rapists, but they are guilty of vile misogyny. None of them presumably has difficulty getting women, who flock to them. To bring Jackson and Olding back on to the rugby field now, as their supporters are demanding, would appear to endorse what looks like degrading behaviour. This would hardly be the first time such a thing has happened. But how do we teach the boys who admire and emulate sportsmen to respect women if this is how their role models conduct themselves? Talking after his acquittal about the risks of mixing alcohol and sex, Ched Evans said he had been “young” and “stupid” at the time. Is behaviour such as Jackson’s and Olding’s – which some seem willing to write off as high jinks, high-testosterone pranks – in fact best understood as being meant for each other? These men may need an audience for their performances and then to congratulate each other the next day. But is this really living the dream? For that dream, as we have seen, can turn into a nightmare for everyone involved, while a woman can look from the outside as if she is a disposable conduit, not a person in her own right. This is where we still are. And yet there are voices telling us to think about these poor innocent lads whose reputations are ruined. It is shameful. Misogyny is not a crime, clearly, but spare me the suffering of these rugby legends. For them to be portrayed as victims, now? That is truly unbelievable. • Suzanne Moore is a Guardian columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"sport/2018/apr/12/maro-itoje-agent-suspended-breach-betting-regulations","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-12T21:05:00Z","webTitle":"Maro Itoje’s agent banned for 22 months after breach of betting regulations","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/apr/12/maro-itoje-agent-suspended-breach-betting-regulations","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/apr/12/maro-itoje-agent-suspended-breach-betting-regulations","fields":{"headline":"Maro Itoje’s agent banned for 22 months after breach of betting regulations","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Maro Itoje’s agent has been suspended for 22 months by the Rugby Football Union after being found guilty of breaching betting regulations. Matt Hart of the Stellar Group, which also represents Gareth Bale and Taulupe Faletau, was found guilty of two breaches – betting on rugby matches and receiving proceeds, as well as non-cooperation with a request for information by the RFU. Hart was found to have placed 1,476 bets on rugby union worldwide between January 2013 and July 2016. As part of both RFU and World Rugby regulations, agents are not allowed to bet on matches. There is no suspicion that Hart was using inside information or trying to influence a match or its outcome, but the RFU’s anti-corruption officer, Alys Lewis, said: “This decision unequivocally demonstrates that any activity which undermines the integrity of our sport, and exposes players and rugby to potential integrity issues, will be treated seriously.” Chris Robshaw, meanwhile, has admitted it has been “tough to look in the mirror” after what he described as one of the lowest points in his Harlequins career. John Kingston’s departure as director of rugby was announced this week but he revealed on Thursday that the decision had been taken before Harlequins’ humiliating 35-5 defeat by London Irish last Saturday. Kingston, who leaves at the end of the season after 17 years at the club, did not tell the players until Monday, however. Robshaw said: “It is tough to look in the mirror. It is not just down to John – as a collective we have not been good enough this year. As players we have not been good enough and unfortunately [John] being the top man, he has taken the stick for that.” Quins want to identify a successor by the end of the season and the board intends to consult senior players including Robshaw, who was made England captain in 2012 by Stuart Lancaster – one of the frontrunners for the job. After the club signed a strategic partnership with the All Blacks last month, a number of New Zealanders are also in the frame."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/2018/apr/12/jack-laugher-commonwealth-gold-annie-last-moutain-biking-womens-hockey","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-12T17:40:17Z","webTitle":"Laugher lands second Commonwealth Games gold despite fitness concerns","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/apr/12/jack-laugher-commonwealth-gold-annie-last-moutain-biking-womens-hockey","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/apr/12/jack-laugher-commonwealth-gold-annie-last-moutain-biking-womens-hockey","fields":{"headline":"Laugher lands second Commonwealth Games gold despite fitness concerns","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Jack Laugher’s rivals must worry about what he could achieve at full fitness after the Englishman won a second Commonwealth gold medal despite, by his own admission, not being in peak condition. The diver comfortably won the 3m springboard title after emerging victorious on the 1m board despite struggling to recover from a plethora of injuries in the build-up to the Games. He is also well poised to make it a hat-trick of gold medals alongside his partner Chris Mears in the 3m synchronised event in which they are the Olympic champions. Laugher finished with 519.40 points, ahead of Canada’s Philippe Gagné and James Connor of Australia, to improve on the silver medal he won at Glasgow four years ago. “I’m really proud, especially coming off of Glasgow and a heart-breaking second place,” he said. “I’ve worked really hard with my strength and conditioning team, my diving coach and my physios, to get me in great shape for here. I’m still struggling, I’m not back to full fitness. It wasn’t a great build‑up, but to have a great competition and a great start to the international season, I’m really happy.” Laugher’s girlfriend, Lois Toulson, won bronze in the 10m individual event, moreover. The day started well for Team England’s women as Annie Last took gold ahead of a compatriot, Evie Richards, in the mountain biking. Last overtook Richards before the 9km mark in the 27km race, going on to win in 1:18.02. It was a first senior title for the 27-year-old, who has deferred her medical studies to pursue a cycling career. She showed promise as a youngster with eighth place at the London Olympics before sustaining injuries and failing to qualify for Rio four years later. “It was absolutely amazing,” she said of her gold. “The race went really smoothly. My legs were good and it all just came together.” But the England Women’s hockey team, which contains many of the personnel who won gold for Great Britain in Rio with a penalty shootout victory, did not fare so well this time. They were defeated in the semi‑final by New Zealand, who triumphed 2-1 in the penalty shootout. England will now play India in the bronze medal match on Saturday."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/apr/13/late-risers-die-early-nightmare-late-night-tv-health-night-owls","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-13T09:00:32Z","webTitle":"Late risers more likely to die early?

Wake me up from this nightmare","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"In my (admittedly self-regarding) opinion, I do my very best living between the hours of 11pm and, say, 3am. That’s when my children have been confined to their beds and I have the relative freedom that allows me to consume television until my eyes start to sting. Essentially, I’m talking about repeated episodes of Bullseye (the original Jim Bowen incarnation, not the abhorrent Dave Spikey reboot), maybe some BBC4 music documentaries that I’ve already seen seven or eight times, or one of the 45 episodes of A Place in the Sun that are clogging up my Sky box. Essentially nothing that represents challenging viewing, because I’m too done in to think properly by then – anything on Netflix feels like a chore, plus there’s the added time needed to scroll through endless menus, deciding on what to watch. The best way I can describe my nocturnal nirvana is that it’s like being alive while being partially dead – a battle against sleep in order to feel as though I’ve enjoyed some quality solitary time, even if nothing constructive is being achieved. A tiny, useless victory against the relentless tyranny of parenting. Sadly, I don’t get to do it all that often, partly because I’m not a leisure-rich member of the aristocracy, but mainly because my children are still young and need help with feeding and dressing themselves before getting to school on time. But at weekends or when there’s a school holiday – that’s when our rigid timetables get binned and I get to wallow on the sofa in dim light, binge on cerebral junk food and carefully work my way through some medium-quality alcohol. Tragically though, the enduring nuisance that is science has come along to jam a spanner in my well-oiled works. A study from the chronobiologists at the University of Surrey (I had never heard of chronobiology – maybe I should have been watching something slightly more educational than Shooting Stars reruns) suggests that night owls are more prone to smoking, heavy drinking, depression and drug abuse. Oh, and unhealthy eating. The study, published in Chronobiology International shows that late risers are 30% more likely to have diabetes, 22% more likely to have respiratory problems and 94% more likely to have psychological disorders. Thankfully, the chronobiologists aren’t here to night-shame us – they argue that lives could be saved if society was more flexible to the needs of those who stay up late. They’ve found that the No 1 underlying factor when it comes to risk of premature death is chronic sleep deprivation. It seems that some of us are predisposed towards a nocturnal existence – the body clock is partly determined by genes, but the study also found that those of us who burn the midnight oil are disproportionately likely to be white – possibly for cultural reasons or because Europeans may have evolved to go to bed and get up later. Another study in American hospitals in 2012 showed 10% more patients were admitted with heart attacks on the days after the clocks went forward and 10% fewer when they went back. Essentially, the chronobiologists’ argument is that if those of us who thrive in the small hours were allowed to start work at noon or later instead of pitching up bleary-eyed and barely coherent at 9am, the world would be a better place and we’d be attending fewer funerals of our night owl colleagues. We’re all wired differently and while I’m not about to start shrieking that the nine-to-five routine is discriminatory against people who feel more comfortable in the small hours, there’s a genuine argument for making more of an effort to accommodate them. While we’re lucky to be living in an era of more adaptable working practices, with home working and flexible hours increasingly available, surely more needs to be done if we all want to operate at our very best. And by “very best” I mean “slightly hungover and a bit stiff from passing out on the sofa at 4am”. This has all come as a massive wake-up call for me. If I carry on with my night-time solitude, I may lose a few years. So in future, if you catch me tweeting about a 1980s episode of Top of the Pops at 2am, please tell me to get to bed – you could be saving my life. • Andy Dawson is a freelance writer and author of Get in the Sea"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"news/2018/apr/12/corrections-and-clarifications","type":"article","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-12T20:00:17Z","webTitle":"Corrections and clarifications","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/apr/12/corrections-and-clarifications","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/2018/apr/12/corrections-and-clarifications","fields":{"headline":"Corrections and clarifications","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"• An opinion piece incorrectly said a paper by Tim Hewish of Commonwealth Exchange excluded south Asian, African and Caribbean nations from proposals for a “bilateral free labour mobility zone”.

With three rounds left both the Sharks and Newcastle are strong contenders for Europe’s Champions Cup qualification with a top-four spot hinging on the outcome of Friday ’s shoot-out at Kingston Park. The two clubs are separated by only one point in fifth and sixth positions, with the winners set to jump into third. Wasps and Leicester will not be easily denied play-off places but fifth-placed Newcastle, with two of their last three games at home plus a trip to face the Tigers, can still shape their own destiny. Sale will have to dig even deeper, with a long hike to Exeter and a final home fixture against Leicester rounding off a tricky run-in, but their confidence has been given a timely lift by last week’s dramatic win over Wasps. Trailing 17-0 in the first half they came back to win 28-27 courtesy of Marland Yarde’s last-second try. According to their captain, Jono Ross, the trick now is to reproduce their dominant home form on the road. This season they have won away against only the bottom three teams in the league and will need to find an extra gear to outwit the Falcons and the Chiefs. “We think we’re a good side but we haven’t been as good as we’ve wanted to away from home,” Ross said. “We need to replicate the performances we’ve put in at the AJ Bell. Hopefully that will be enough.” A big finish would also improve Ross’s chances of a place on England’s tour to his native South Africa. The Johannesburg-born back-row forward is qualified for England via a grandmother from Essex and Sale’s director of rugby, Steve Diamond, said Eddie Jones and England’s forwards coach, Steve Borthwick, have been making inquiries. Ross, who had stints as a young player with Harlequins, Saracens and the Bulls in South Africa, spent three years playing alongside Sergio Parisse for Stade Français before joining Sale last summer and has become an influential figure for the Sharks, assuming the captaincy after an injury to Will Addison. “For me it’s about performing well for Sale week-in week-out. I don’t want to think about things that are out of my control. I’ve had no conversations with Eddie but every player has international aspirations.” The 27-year-old is clearly resilient, having featured in every league game this season, and has been pleasantly surprised by life in the Premiership compared with the slower-paced Top 14. “The speed of the game and the conditioning are quite different to what I experienced in France. It’s more similar to back home in South Africa. There are also a fantastic group of people here. We care about each other and I think that shows.” For the Newcastle game Paolo Odogwu and Luke James start at left wing and inside-centre respectively, with the tighthead prop WillGriff John returning to the front row and Byron McGuigan named at full-back. The 18-year-old Cameron Redpath, the English-qualified son of the former Scotland international Bryan, is poised to make his Premiership debut off the bench. Newcastle’s lineup features Gary Graham, who is back after injuring his neck at England training in early February, with Joel Hodgson, the league’s most accurate goalkicker this season, chosen ahead of Toby Flood at fly-half. “For us it’s a must-win game in terms of keeping our top-four hopes alive,” said Dean Richards, the Falcons’ director of rugby. “If we don’t win we can almost kiss the semi-finals goodbye.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"education/2018/apr/16/teachers-strikes-movement-leaders-west-virginia-oklahoma-arizona","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-16T10:00:05Z","webTitle":"Teachers' strikes: meet the leaders of the movement marching across America","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2018/apr/16/teachers-strikes-movement-leaders-west-virginia-oklahoma-arizona","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/education/2018/apr/16/teachers-strikes-movement-leaders-west-virginia-oklahoma-arizona","fields":{"headline":"Teachers' strikes: meet the leaders of the movement marching across America","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"When teachers in West Virginia went on strike in February, there was little indication that a swath of other states would follow suit. But that action in the Appalachian state, which resulted in teachers winning a 5% pay rise, has spurred on educators in Oklahoma, Kentucky and Arizona. Teachers in Oklahoma have been on strike since 2 April, while school districts have also walked out in Kentucky. In Arizona, teachers are demanding a 20% pay rise and could go on strike at the end of April. In some states the protests are being driven from the bottom up, rather than by unions, as teachers and school districts take matters into their own hands. Here are some of the leaders of the teachers’ strike movement. Cindy Gaete is a 25-year-old teacher at Marshall elementary school in Tulsa, Oklahoma. The daughter of Chilean immigrants, she is currently the only Spanish speaker in her school, which is nearly a third Latino. She says it is frustrating that in addition to her teaching duties that the lack of Spanish speakers means that any time the schools needs to communicate with parents that she has to serve as translator. “The first thing I told my principal when I got hired is that if we are a third Latino, there should not be just one Hispanic teacher in your school,” said Gaete. Inspired to fix her school, she helped lead a 110-mile March for Education that arrived in Tulsa from Oklahoma City. As teachers are expected to end their strike this week, she says that it’s important for teachers like her to run for office to keep the momentum. On Saturday, Gaete decided to lead by example and file her papers to run for state representative in Oklahoma 78th house district. “Today I start day one of my campaign for house district 78,” said Gaete in announcing her bid. “For my students. For my community. Because all students deserve an equitable educational experience, regardless of race, socio-economic status and gender.” State representative Attica Scott is currently the only black woman serving in the Kentucky general assembly. The 46-year-old former executive director of Kentucky Jobs With Justice, she challenged a 34 year incumbent corporate Democrat in 2016 to take office and is working hard to encourage more women to run for office. She says that one of the reasons that teachers, a field that is 77% female, are underpaid because they are women. “This teacher movement is being led mostly by women because most of the teachers are women and it’s also one of the reasons why teachers are so under attack,” says Scott. “As so often in fields led by women those are the fields that are seen as most vulnerable by politicians.” “The fact that we see an underrepresentation of women in elected office has a significant part to play in these attacks,” she says. To correct the problem, Scott is helping lead an effort in conjunction with Emerge Kentucky to elect over 40 female teachers to the Kentucky state house. “We as women in office have to make sure that we are bringing along with us our sisters across the country, who are wanting to run for office,” says Scott. In the #MeToo era, Scott thinks that the dynamics of more women running for office could be a powerful force for desperately needed changes in state legislatures. “I am so excited,” says Scott. “We are seeing this movement go from marching and protesting and rallying at state house to running for the state house.” Jay O’Neal is a seventh-grade English teacher based in Charleston, West Virginia. He and fellow teacher Emily Comer founded the West Virginia Public Employees United private Facebook group in early October. Teachers were lobbying for a 5% pay rise, which West Virginia’s governor, Jim Justice, eventually granted them in early March. The West Virginia movement was unusual in that, at the beginning, teachers were organizing without the support of their unions – the West Virginia Education Association and the American Federation of Teachers. “Originally it came out of my frustration at there being two main teachers’ unions here that want probably 99% of the same things but they work against each other a lot of the time,” O’Neal said. “To me it was just frustrating because I felt like our issues were against the legislature but nothing was ever going to happen unless we work together.” After O’Neal and Comer formed their Facebook group, membership quickly ballooned. By the end of January it had 20,000 members and had become a key organizing hub for teachers ahead of the strike. Teachers in the southern part of the state began holding local actions, staging “walk-ins” at their schools – handing out information to parents and teachers – and other areas quickly followed. “It was definitely bottom-up, not top-down,” O’Neal said. The unions soon jumped on board, and the strike was born. Noah Karvelis, from Phoenix, Arizona, is one of the founders of the “Red for Ed” campaign that has seen thousands of teachers take part in actions around the state. The teachers are asking for a 20% pay rise, which they say would barely bring their wages in line with neighbouring states, and more funding for students. A report by WalletHub, published in September 2017, rated Arizona among the worst states in the country for public school spending per student and by pupil-to-teacher ratio. In 2015, Arizona ranked third last in terms of state spending per pupil, according to the US Census Bureau. Red for Ed held a series of walk-ins at schools on 4 April, and more than 800 schools across the state will take part in walk-ins on 11 April. Karvalis said they were inspired by teachers’ success in West Virginia. “It’s empowered everybody. It’s shown us that you can do this, you can stand up, you can stand together and you can fight back and it’s shown us that you can win.” The state is set to finalise its budget on 17 or 19 April. If there is no substantial increase in educational funding then the teachers could decide to strike. “In the course of their winning, states like West Virginia have left us a blueprint. We’re following those models, we’re taking notes,” Karvalis said. “They have been nothing but helpful and inspiring and it woke up a sleeping giant to see that.” Heather Cody is a 28-year-old single mother who attended Mayo Demonstration school, an innovative experimental public school in Tulsa, Oklahoma, and currently teaches there. The school was once so innovative that teachers from around the state often went there to study their non-conventional methods of group learning and refusing to assign students to grades. However, budget cuts have decimated what was once a proud gem of Oklahoma’s education system. “I want my daughter so badly to go to Mayo, but it’s not special any more,” says Cody. Cody makes so little that she is forced to live with her parents to make ends meets. After her parents offered to send her three-year-old daughter to private school because they were concerned about the low quality of public schools, she says she was determined to get involved to fight for public education funding. “I went to public school all my life, I’m a public school product and I can’t imagine not having my daughter in a public school,” she said. “It’s so much more diverse. I just didn’t get my book smarts from there, but I got my worldly view from public school and I just can’t imagine robbing my child of that.” Two years ago, her union president encouraged her to get involved in an emerging leaders program. A valuable program that she says gave her the confidence to take charge of arranging logistics for the 110-mile march for education from Tulsa to Oklahoma City. “I tell you, it wasn’t hard work because as soon as the media picked up on it, my phone started ringing,” says Cody. “It wasn’t working at all. They just came to me.” Cody says that after the march her and so many others inspired to get even more involved in organizing. “One thing that will happen for sure is that in November, there will be a change in Oklahoma,” says Cody. Marq Lewis is a 42-year-old African American documentary film-maker and activist who has primarily concentrated his work on organizing against police brutality. Lewis marched the entire 110-mile march from Tulsa to Oklahoma City during recent protests, livestreaming interviews and supporter reactions on his Facebook page, which average over 4,000 views per video with some live streams getting as many 80,000 views. The reaction to the video has been overwhelming. “A lot of people have been calling me crying,” says Lewis. “A lot of people are saying that they have a deeper understanding because, like me, they didn’t really understand what teachers go through because teachers don’t get on television and get heard.” Before March, he had not really been involved in union struggles, focusing most of his work on police brutality. Lewis feels that the Oklahoma teachers’ walkout opened up new avenues between organized labor and communities of color. “This opened a window of opportunity for people in the marginalized community to understand in a concrete way what teachers have gone through, but also to see that teachers working in marginalized communities among African Americans and Hispanics or communities that are poor white need help,” says Lewis. “There is a still a huge disconnect,” says Lewis. “But I’m hoping that the march from Tulsa to Oklahoma City does not go down in vain, it just opens up the doors for future dialogue.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2018/apr/12/labour-warns-apollo-against-pursuing-interest-in-firstgroup","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-12T17:10:47Z","webTitle":"Labour warns Apollo against pursuing interest in FirstGroup","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/apr/12/labour-warns-apollo-against-pursuing-interest-in-firstgroup","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/apr/12/labour-warns-apollo-against-pursuing-interest-in-firstgroup","fields":{"headline":"Labour warns Apollo against pursuing interest in FirstGroup","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Labour and the RMT union have warned the US private equity firm Apollo Global Management off pursuing its interest in the transport firm FirstGroup, after the British company rejected a takeover approach.

Under UK takeover rules, Apollo, which owns companies including Claire’s Accessories and the US restaurant chain Chuck E Cheese’s, has until 9 May to make a firm offer or walk away. But Labour and the RMT indicated that Apollo would face fierce opposition, with scrutiny of takeovers particularly intense after the turnaround specialist Melrose’s controversial, but ultimately successful, pursuit of engineer GKN. The shadow transport minister, Andy McDonald, criticised the government’s handling of rail franchises after the bailout of Stagecoach and Virgin Rail on the East Coast line earlier this year. “Rail franchising is in chaos and has already cost the taxpayer billions of pounds in bailouts over the last year,” he said. “Companies know that the government will come to their rescue if they fail and are encouraged to take ever greater risks. “The last thing public transport in the UK needs is for FirstGroup to be taken over by a company that will aggressively cut costs and extract even greater profits at the expense of taxpayers and passengers.” The RMT general secretary, Mick Cash, said: “This looks like another bunch of speculators and asset strippers homing in on the British transport sector. “First have been propped up by the government on the Great Western routes for many years now and where this hostile bid leaves their UK bus and rail operations is anyone’s guess. The only solution to this kind of uncertainty and instability is public ownership.” Apollo declined to comment on its interest in FirstGroup. Analysts at stockbrokers Investec and Liberum Capital said Apollo could be looking to break up FirstGroup and sell off divisions to other buyers. But Liberum pointed to the political difficulty of such a plan. “The acquisition of a large UK employer providing essential services to the public by a foreign private equity fund seems unlikely to be welcomed in the current political environment,” it said. “Even before that, private equity ownership of rail franchises seem unlikely to be acceptable.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2018/apr/24/carlo-rovelli-the-order-of-time-review","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-24T06:00:13Z","webTitle":"The Order of Time by Carlo Rovelli review – a worthy heir to Stephen Hawking","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/apr/24/carlo-rovelli-the-order-of-time-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/apr/24/carlo-rovelli-the-order-of-time-review","fields":{"headline":"The Order of Time by Carlo Rovelli review – a worthy heir to Stephen Hawking","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"In Hitler’s Germany, a handful of physicists bristled at the mere mention of quantum theory. The troubling uncertainties of Einsteinian relativity and other physical exotica were viewed as “Jewish science” inimical to German nationhood and the Newtonian mechanics of Deutsche Physik. “German physics” (sometimes called “Aryan physics”) failed to make inroads in 1930s Germany because its champions were so plainly deluded. To forward-looking German physicists such as Max Planck and Werner Heisenberg, the idea that relativity was a “Jewish fraud” was manifest nonsense. Albert Einstein was indeed Jewish, but had he masterminded a “world crisis” in physics, as the anti-relativity lobby insisted? Hardly. Nobody said that relativity theory was easy. Einstein’s notion that time and space are essentially one (the concept of curved “spacetime”) is the stuff of abstract poetry. Fortunately, the Italian physicist Carlo Rovelli writes of “warped time” and other tentative physics with incisive clarity. Known for his work on loop quantum gravity theory and the pre-Socratic Greek philosopher Anaximander, Rovelli is one of our great scientific explicators. His poetic essay collection Seven Brief Lessons on Physics sold more than a million copies in English translation in 2017 and remains one of the fastest-selling science books ever. The Order of Time, a deeper, more abstruse meditation, elucidates some of the key developments in the philosophy and physics of time. Fortified with quotations from Proust, Anaximander and the Grateful Dead (Rovelli has a hippyish past), the book continues a tradition of jargon-free scientific writing from Galileo to Darwin that disappeared in the academic specialisation of the last century. Clock time, said Einstein, is an illusion. In his general theory of relativity (published over a century ago in 1915) he predicted that time passes more quickly “high up” than below, nearer to the Earth. So if a man who has lived at sea-level meets his twin who has lived in the mountains, he will find that his sibling is slightly older. Analogously, a clock placed on the floor runs a little more slowly than one on a table. So which of the two tells the real time? The question runs through Rovelli’s book. What is real? What exists? Einstein’s observation that time passes at different speeds in different places unsettled not just the anti-Jewish physicists of the Third Reich but the Roman Catholic church. Can it really be a sin to know? In the 17th century, curiosity-driven researchers such as Galileo had dared to put divine laws to the test. (“For in much wisdom is much grief”: Ecclesiastes.) In tasting of the tree of knowledge, Einstein quite as much as Galileo had offended against the established order of things, according to Rovelli. Beautifully translated by Erica Segre and Simon Carnell, The Order of Time is an expression of the scientific desire to know and understand the world. “Physicists are not immune to talking nonsense,” says Rovelli, but physicists are said to go deeper than other scientists into the mystery of existence. The laws of physics – gravity, energy, motion, time – underpin those of chemistry, astrophysics and meteorology combined. So an understanding of the workings of time requires some understanding of physics. Rovelli’s book opens with a discussion of Newton’s idea of absolute “true time”, ticking relentlessly across the universe. This is how most of us still imagine time, though Einstein showed that there is no single “now” but rather a multitude of “nows”. Rovelli goes on to consider Aristotle’s belief that what we call “time” is simply the measurement of change: if nothing changed, time would not exist. Newton chose to disagree. If the universe was to be frozen, time would tick on regardless. Impishly, Einstein asserted that both Aristotle and Newton were right. Aristotle correctly explained that time flows in relation to a before and after; and Newton’s absolute time does indeed exist – but as a special case in Einstein’s “spacetime” theory of gravity, which treated space and time as one and the same. In Rovelli’s own elucidation, the Earth moves round the sun because of the distortion of “spacetime” by the sun’s greater mass. An analogy presents “spacetime” as a rubber sheet distorted by a heavy ball representing the sun; a smaller ball rolling by, representing a planet, will tend to fall into this depression, apparently attracted. In Einstein’s universe, this is what is known as gravity. Time runs slower wherever gravity is strongest, and this is because gravity warps or curves “spacetime”. The riddle of time may ultimately be beyond our “blurred”, Earth-bound comprehension, says Rovelli. All the same, in lucid pages, he manages to bring difficult ideas down a level. Not since the late Stephen Hawking’s A Brief History of Time has there been so genial an integration of physics and philosophy. • The Order of Time by Carlo Rovelli is published by Allen Lane (£12.99).

Ahmed Saadawi, who won the “Arabic Booker” – the International Prize for Arabic Fiction – in 2014 for his novel Frankenstein in Baghdad, is up for the £50,000 prize, shared equally between author and translator, along with his English translator, Jonathan Wright. Saadawi’s novel, which the judges said “accrues in horrors as you move through it”, tells the story of a Baghdad junk dealer who assembles body parts left on the streets and stitches them together to make a political statement. The corpse goes missing, resulting in a series of eerie murders across the city. Han, who won the prize in 2016 for her novel The Vegetarian, is shortlisted for The White Book, which draws on her experience of losing an older sibling, who died before Han was born, and explores the various symbolic meanings of the colour white. Krasznahorkai is nominated for The World Goes On, a collection of 21 stories spanning from a Hungarian interpreter contemplating his state of mind while in Shanghai to a child labourer who wanders off from a quarry. Also shortlisted is the Polish author Olga Tokarczuk’s Flights. Exploring the concept of travel and anatomy, Flights spans centuries, from the story of a 17th-century Dutch anatomist who dissected his own amputated leg, to a present-day Polish emigree returning to her home country to poison her terminally ill childhood sweetheart. Another contender is Virginie Despentes, a French journalist, filmmaker and former sex worker. Her novel Vernon Subutex 1 follows a Parisian record store owner who becomes homeless and, unbeknown to him, internet famous. Judges described the book as a “racy, sexy, urban, picaresque”. Spain’s Antonio Muñoz Molina, the author of more than a dozen novels, is nominated for Like a Falling Shadow, which explores the story of James Earl Ray, assassin of the American civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr, and the 10 days he spent in Lisbon while attempting to evade the FBI. The chair of judges, Lisa Appignanesi, said the 2018 shortlist was “only united in diversity. There are books with very strong narrative, books with lyrical atmosphere as their forefront, and books with a real density of metaphysical preoccupation. These six were definitely the best, in terms of the energy of the narrative and their formal exhilaration.” She said the judges had debated whether to include two previous winners. “We talked at length about not allowing repeat performances like Krasznahorkai and Han. But there was a sense we had to consider the novels and find the best fiction instead. And The White Book is so different from The Vegetarian that we could be talking about a different writer.” Translated fiction accounts for 7% of literary fiction sales in the UK, and the Man Booker International winner is a considerable powerhouse each year. Sales of last year’s winner, A Horse Walks Into a Bar by the Israeli author David Grossman and translator Jessica Cohen, soared by 1,367% in the week after the announcement. The paperback sold 53 times more copies than Grossman’s previous book. Joining Appignanesi on the judging panel are the translator and writer Michael Hofmann, the authors Hari Kunzru and Helen Oyeyemi, and the journalist Tim Martin. The winner will be announced 22 May at a dinner in London. 2018 Man Booker International shortlist Vernon Subutex 1 by Virginie Despentes, translated by Frank Wynne (France) The White Book by Han Kang, translated by Deborah Smith (South Korea) The World Goes On by László Krasznahorkai, translated by John Batki, Ottilie Mulzet and George Szirtes (Hungary) Like a Fading Shadow by Antonio Muñoz Molina, translated by Camilo A Ramirez (Spain) Frankenstein in Baghdad by Ahmed Saadawi, translated by Jonathan Wright (Iraq) Flights by Olga Tokarczuk, translated by Jennifer Croft (Poland) • This article was amended on 13 April 2018 because an earlier version said that Olga Tokarczuk’s Flights was the first of her novels to be translated into English.

The Campaign Against Arms Trade brought the case against Liam Fox, the international trade secretary, seeking permission to appeal against a decision last July that granting licences for the export of arms from the UK to Saudi Arabia was not unlawful. CAAT has warned that British weapons could be used to kill or injure Yemeni civilians. Since the bombing of the war-torn country began in March 2015, the UK has licensed £4.6bn of arms to the Saudi regime, including £2.7bn of ML10 licences for aircraft, helicopters and drones, and £1.9bn of ML4 licences for grenades, bombs and missiles. Last month, Unicef reported that thousands of children had been killed during the conflict. The protesters claim that the decision to grant the licences breached UK arms export policy, which states that the licences cannot be granted if there is a “clear risk” the arms might be used in a serious violation of international humanitarian law. Earlier this month, the UN declared the three-year war in Yemen to be the world’s worst humanitarian crisis, with more than 22 million people in desperate need of aid and protection. A Saudi-led bombing campaign against Houthi rebels in the country has destroyed infrastructure including schools and hospitals. In January 2016, a UN panel of experts accused Saudi forces of “widespread and systematic” attacks on civilian targets. The British government has confirmed that it is tracking 350 possible breaches of international humanitarian law, but has yet to suspend any military licences to Saudi Arabia. Part of the hearing at the court of appeal in London on Thursday scrutinised the various sources of information used by the UK government to decide whether or not Riyadh had breached international humanitarian law in its use of British weapons. Part was held in public and part in closed session, where sensitive intelligence matters were aired. Andrew Smith of CAAT said: “Thousands of people have been killed since the verdict last July, and the humanitarian situation has only got worse, yet the arms sales have continued. We believe that these arms sales haven’t just been immoral, they have also been illegal.” Rosa Curling of Leigh Day, representing the campaign group in the case, said: “Where there is a clear risk UK arms might be used in the commission of serious violations of international law, arm sales cannot go ahead. The risk is very real. You need only look at the devastating reality of the situation there.” James Eadie QC, representing Fox, told the court that if incidents of concern occurred, such as a strike on a Yemeni hospital by the Saudis, it would be taken seriously by the British government. “If we think there are still concerns that are live and ongoing, we seek to engage if we can to try to obtain further information,” he said. The two court of appeal judges hearing the case, Lord Justice Irwin and Lord Justice Flaux, indicated that they are likely to reserve judgment."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/lostinshowbiz/2018/apr/12/is-2411-truther-olly-murs-right-about-a-coverup-at-selfridges","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-12T16:41:44Z","webTitle":"Is 24/11 truther Olly Murs right about a coverup at Selfridges?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/lostinshowbiz/2018/apr/12/is-2411-truther-olly-murs-right-about-a-coverup-at-selfridges","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/lostinshowbiz/2018/apr/12/is-2411-truther-olly-murs-right-about-a-coverup-at-selfridges","fields":{"headline":"Is 24/11 truther Olly Murs right about a coverup at Selfridges?","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"In ordinary circumstances, a 33-year-old man using social media to warn seven million people of a terror attack underway in central London would be regarded in generally positive terms. Unfortunately, the events of 24 November 2017 were not ordinary: the warning took the form of a tweet bellowing: “Fuck everyone get out of @Selfridges now gun shots!!”, and the 33-year-old man fearing for his life in a department store back office was noted troubadour and persistent hat apologist Olly Murs. Murs who did that quite good song with Rizzle Kicks seven years ago. Murs, the multiple Brit-eligible chap who is also cheeky, and whose place in the pantheon of modern popular culture occupies the gossamer-proportioned cavity between Robbie Williams and Bradley Walsh. Also – and, with hindsight, slightly awkwardly – it was quickly established that, despite scenes of chaos prompted, in part, by reports of gunshots, there had not been any gunshots. Within minutes Murs went from hero to berk. Very quickly, stern words about communicating mistruths to millions of people came from former News of the World editor Piers Morgan: “When you have millions of followers be very careful what you tweet.” The pair’s Twitter exchange that night also involved an “if you was there you’d have understood mate” from Murs, and a “stop tweeting … nothing happened” from Morgan. Not exactly a battle between the forces of good and evil, but certainly a battle between someone who had gone out of his way to help your nan with her shopping and, well, Piers Morgan. Maybe that’s unfair. In the same situation, Morgan, a close personal friend of Donald “I really believe I’d run in there” Trump, may well have gone “the full John Smeaton”. Morgan could quite feasibly have marched around kicking Selfridges shoppers in the knackers until he was certain any threat had been neutralised. But is it harsh, at all, to suggest that there is something slightly “wearing a frock on a Titanic lifeboat” about Morgan’s general demeanour? Something that suggests Morgan, on that highly charged November day, might, in fact, have barged his way past Olly and as many nans with shopping as he deemed necessary, in order to get into that same safe place and start tweeting? Anyway, the story eventually went quiet, save for the occasional Twitter user amusingly quote-tweeting one of Olly’s subsequent communiques — “Evacuating store now!!! Fuck heart is pounding” — during busier-than-expected weekend shopping trips. Until this week, when the Sun splashed a new interview with Olly across its front page with the headline “OLLY: I’M NO WALLY”. “Something happened that day,” he was quoted as saying. “Whether it was covered up, I don’t know.” (He also introduced the slightly odd detail that he was in the store attempting to purchase a massage chair for his aunt.) “I ran into an office,” he added, “after being told by the staff of Selfridges that someone was there with a gun.” Reporting these claims, NME’s sceptical take was: “Olly Murs has bizarrely hinted that last year’s terror attack scare at London’s Oxford Circus was a ‘cover-up’.” And so, here we are, with Murs as gunshot coverup truther: the tightest-trousered conspiracy theorist in town. The back office he legitimately thought he was going to die in has, it seems, become the hill he is prepared to die on. File this one alongside rapper BoB and his charming flat-Earther ways, or Kylie Jenner and her chemtrail theories. Except! Except. Except: what if Murs, regardless of his status as a semi-endearing bumbling pop chancer, was telling the truth? Because, you see, Lost in Showbiz has heard claims via two different Selfridges employees that suggest Murs is, in fact, not mistaken about what went down that day. And the more you think about it, and as long as you don’t think about it too hard, the more it would make sense that Murs has been pushed so hard as a lone voice in this narrative: he’s the ultimate fall guy. Quite literally – who would believe the word of a man who has fallen off stage, and on stage, and split his trousers on stage so frequently that his performance mishaps are virtually a YouTube subgenre? With this in mind, Lost in Showbiz wearily engages in what colleagues nearer the front of this esteemed journal might consider “actual journalism”. The first call is to the British Transport Police, who are routinely cited in articles, such as NME’s, debunking Murs’s version of events. They say they weren’t part of the Selfridges investigation, because they were handling Oxford Circus. A good start: get the Pulitzer committee on standby! Next stop is the Metropolitan police, who are quite helpful in terms of a prompt response, but no use whatsoever in when it comes to clearing Olly’s name (“We really could not discuss or answer a question in relation to any individual”). Also, they repeat their earlier lines about there having not been any evidence of shots having been fired. Lost in Showbiz must concede at this stage that this whole proper journalism business is surprisingly hard work. How is it not possible to unmask a major conspiracy relating to public safety with one phone call and one query submitted via an online feedback form? No wonder reporters in films always have their ties loosened. But perhaps someone else can continue this story. Perhaps there is a courageous soul out there prepared to risk everything, like they do in those films with loosened ties, to get to the bottom of all this. Perhaps they have access to a double-berth garage capable of housing cardboard boxes full of paperwork, like the one Hank had in Breaking Bad — that was an absolutely brilliant investigation space. And perhaps they are brave enough to pursue the truth, even if it is quite possibly not true at all, while also being brave enough to stand shoulder to shoulder with a man who could at any moment burst into a passable cover of something off The Commitments soundtrack. Because, make no mistake, this isn’t about wanting Murs to be right. It’s about wanting Morgan to be wrong. A thankless pursuit, maybe, in this instance; but a noble one nonetheless. Margaret Atwood uncovers the Alderaan cell In a strong week for conspiracy theories of the stars, Margaret Atwood, whose own Rizzle Kicks collaborations are sadly yet to see the light of day, has been having a chit-chat with Variety. “They got the idea from Star Wars,” she says at one point – but what could she be discussing? The Force Awakens would be the obvious answer, but no: the Handmaid’s Tale hitmaker is actually discussing 9/11. Notes Atwood: “Remember the first one? Two guys fly a plane in the middle of something and blow that up? The only difference is, in Star Wars, they get away.” The only difference! And there’s more right here: “Right after 9/11, they hired a bunch of Hollywood screenwriters to tell them how the story might go next. Sci-fi writers are very good at this stuff, anticipating future events.” Atwood’s assertion seems to represent both freedom from facts and the freedom to make up her own, apparently hinging on the notion that George Lucas invented the concept of one moving thing being capable of damaging another thing. News perhaps to anyone involved in numerous conflicts, or who used a bowling alley, before 1977. But perhaps as well as writing books that predict the future, Atwood has also found a way to rewrite the past. If that is indeed the case, there is a certain pop singer here in the UK who might appreciate some advice on how to handle 24/11 2017."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"environment/2018/apr/13/air-pollution-spikes-can-heighten-risk-chest-infections-research-utah","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-13T09:55:12Z","webTitle":"Spikes in air pollution can heighten risk of chest infections, research suggests","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/apr/13/air-pollution-spikes-can-heighten-risk-chest-infections-research-utah","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/apr/13/air-pollution-spikes-can-heighten-risk-chest-infections-research-utah","fields":{"headline":"Spikes in air pollution can heighten risk of chest infections, research suggests","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Even short-term increases in air pollution are linked to a higher risk of developing viral chest infections that turn into conditions such as bronchiolitis, new research suggests. The study, carried out by scientists in the US, looked at levels of tiny particles in the air known as PM2.5s across eight locations along the Wasatch Front in Utah, including Salt Lake City. This area features a string of towns and is home the majority of the state’s population and, due to various factors, experiences large variations in air pollution. The team then looked at the number of people who turned up at local healthcare centres and hospitals and were diagnosed with acute lower respiratory infections during the same period of time. The results, published in the American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, reveal that an increase in diagnoses of such infectionsappears to follow an uptick in air pollution in the previous weeks. “There may be some connection between air pollution and [acute] lower respiratory infections, whether it is that air pollution causes the airway to become more susceptible to infection, or once you are infected it may cause the body to respond less vigorously to the infection,” said Dr Benjamin Horne, director of cardiovascular and genetic epidemiology at the Intermountain Medical Center Heart Institute in Salt Lake City, adding that it could also be that high pollution drives people to stay indoors, increasing the chance of passing infections around. The team analysed healthcare data from more than 146,000 individuals who were diagnosed with an acute lower respiratory infection between 1999 and 2016. More than three quarters of diagnoses were made in children under the age of two years old, the majority of whom had bronchiolitis. In some cases, the infections proved deadly: 26 children and 81 adults died within a month of diagnosis. The reason for the high proportion of young children, said Horne, might be down them being more vulnerable to infections or adults being more likely to nurse their own infections at home. After taking into account factors such as the day of the week, the season and the weather, the team found that for every 10micrograms per cubic metre increase in PM2.5s, the odds of ending up with an acute lower respiratory infection at some point in the following four weeks rose by 15-32%, depending on the individual’s age. The team found the increase in risk was higher for those in emergency care or admitted as an inpatient than it was for outpatients – suggesting that air pollution might be linked to more severe infections. Horne said the findings suggest that preventive measures such as avoiding areas of high traffic or increasing hand washing after a pollution spike might reduce the risk of infection. Prof Paul Cullinan, an expert in environmental respiratory disease at the National Heart and Lung Institute at Imperial College London, welcomed the research, but said the study had a number of limitations, including that it did not show air pollution caused the infections, and did not take into account socioeconomic status. But Cullinan said the study was valuable since there had been little research into whether there is a link between air pollution and respiratory infections. “This is one of the few,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2018/apr/22/paul-mccartney-linda-stella-mary-frozen-in-time-vegetarians","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-22T11:00:20Z","webTitle":"Frozen in time: Paul and Linda McCartney and family, 4 April 1976","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/apr/22/paul-mccartney-linda-stella-mary-frozen-in-time-vegetarians","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/apr/22/paul-mccartney-linda-stella-mary-frozen-in-time-vegetarians","fields":{"headline":"Frozen in time: Paul and Linda McCartney and family, 4 April 1976","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"In April 1976, Paul and Linda McCartney were on a month’s break from the Wings Over the World tour, which would head to North America in May for Paul’s first shows there since the Beatles’ final US gig in August 1966. Photographer David Montgomery, who had also shot the cover for Jimi Hendrix’s Electric Ladyland, captured the McCartney clan – including sheepdog Martha and Lucky the dalmatian – in what looks like bucolic bliss, but is in fact the back garden of their London home in Cavendish Avenue. Animals were a huge part of family life. Paul has often said that he and Linda became vegetarian after watching lambs gambolling outside their farm window. They pushed their lamb chops aside, and that was the end of their meat-eating days. “It is because we like animals, it’s an ethical thing, not really about health,” Paul told Nigel Slater in 2007. The McCartneys’ passion for animals didn’t stop there. Linda once had a goose delivered by taxi from Glasgow to their remote farm on the Mull of Kintyre. She would also have her beloved horses transported between Scotland and Woodlands Farm in Sussex as they moved between homes. Mary McCartney, who was six when this photo was taken, has spoken of how being vegetarian in the 1970s and 80s was harder for the children, although “we weren’t forced into it”. “It was at the exact age where you want to fit in with all your friends. There weren’t really many options, it was just chips and beans.” It was partly in response to this attitude that Linda published her first vegetarian cookbook in 1989, and established her own food brand in 1991. Paul, brought up on postwar British food, liked to have something to replace the “hole in the middle” where the meat used to be, and her range of pies, veggie sausages and burgers was deftly aimed at exactly that market – early TV adverts featured truckers tucking into meat-free meals. By the time of Linda’s death, 20 years ago this month, 25 million of her meat-free dinners were being sold a year. Linda was the pioneer in the family for vegetarianism, and the children have embraced her legacy. Stella’s fashion range is entirely vegan and she, Paul and Mary together set up the Meat Free Monday campaign in 2009. Mary, like her mother, is both a photographer and a cookbook author who says: “I try and make the ingredients stuff you can get at a normal grocery shop.” Just like Mum."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"sport/blog/2018/apr/12/grand-national-2018-a-horse-by-horse-betting-guide","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-14T07:56:33Z","webTitle":"Grand National 2018: horse-by-horse betting guide","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2018/apr/12/grand-national-2018-a-horse-by-horse-betting-guide","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/blog/2018/apr/12/grand-national-2018-a-horse-by-horse-betting-guide","fields":{"headline":"Grand National 2018: horse-by-horse betting guide","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Thunder And Roses (Age 10, weight 10st 5lb) Won the Irish Grand National in 2015, beating Rule The World at level weights, form which looked pretty good when the runner-up won the next year’s Grand National.

Romped to glory in the Becher, showing how well he goes round here, but the extra weight he got for that did not help at Haydock in February, where he couldn’t go with the easy winner and finished tired. Anibale Fly (8, 11st 8lb) Travelled well and was still going on at the finish when third in the Gold Cup, suggesting he might cope with this distance. Beat 27 rivals by daylight in a hotly contested handicap chase at Leopardstown over Christmas. Still on a beatable rating but this is asking a lot, with a big weight to carry. Doesn’t always get that high at his fences and took a heavy fall in the Irish Gold Cup. Also took a liberty at Cheltenham’s third-last and there is likely to be at least one scare along the way. The Last Samuri (10, 11st 8lb) Couldn’t finish quite as strongly as a classy rival when second in the 2016 National. Shot up the ratings, has not won since and is still 10lb higher than that day. Faded into a well-beaten 16th last year and something similar seems likely. Admirably consistent but in need of luck. Valseur Lido (9, 11st 7lb) Wasn’t far off the best when with Willie Mullins, for whom he won two Grade Ones as a novice. May well have won the 2016 Irish Gold Cup, but for unseating at the last. Missed a year and four runs since his comeback seem to show him in decline. Still high in the weights, just 5lb below his peak, and would need something like his best to get involved here. Stamina must also be taken on trust, as he’s never raced beyond three miles and a furlong. Total Recall (9, 11st 5lb) Instantly improved by last summer’s move to Willie Mullins, since when his only failure has been a fall in the Gold Cup. Won the Munster National easily and then scrambled home in the Ladbrokes Trophy, when held up for a late challenge. Now 9lb higher but likely to have more to offer and wasn’t out of it when hitting the deck at Cheltenham. A clear round will surely put him in contention. Alpha Des Obeaux (8, 11st 4lb) Not far short of the best as a staying hurdler and useful over fences but is rated to the hilt of his ability. Ran a fair race to be eighth in last year’s Irish National, when he was hampered by a faller, and beaten only by Total Recall in the Munster National, trying to give him lumps of weight. Not usually a strong finisher and has broken blood vessels at times. Perfect Candidate (11, 11st 3lb) Cheltenham specialist who has run many fine races there but not usually to the same level elsewhere. Pulled up at the fourth-last a year ago and only 2lb lower in the weights this time but trainer says he had an interrupted preparation then. A sound jumper and solid stayer with no secrets from the handicapper and likely to be outpaced by something if still in contention after the last. Shantou Flyer (8, 11st 2lb) Would have an extra 4lb to carry if the weights had not been set in February, since when he ran a fine second at the Cheltenham Festival, finishing strongly to be beaten by a neck. Promising teenage jockey who rode that day will be aboard again. Pulled up four fences from home last year but was only seven and entitled to do better now. Hasn’t won since but several efforts have suggested he is ready for this marathon trip. Slight concern that his Cheltenham form is so much better than elsewhere. Tenor Nivernais (11, 11st 1lb) A front-runner when things go well, he never got involved last year and finished 17th. In common with most of his stablemates, has been well below his best this year but the yard is now getting winners. Wins over fences have come in small fields, which does not augur well here. It’s more than five years since he won at a track where the bends go to the left. Carlingford Lough (12, 11st 1lb) Irish Gold Cup winner of 2015 and 2016, this veteran has dropped a stone from his peak rating in the past year and is now on a weight that would make him dangerous if he returned to something like his best. Has shown little in four runs this season but all came before New Year, when he has not traditionally been at his best. Interesting. Delusionofgrandeur (8, 10st 5lb) Has been useful and consistent around the northern tracks this winter but it’s hard to believe he has the class for this and his stamina seems to have been exposed by weak finishing efforts in his last two starts. Tiger Roll (8, 10st 13lb) Three times a winner at the Cheltenham Festival, including in the Cross-Country last month. Has also won a Munster National, so neither big fields nor marathon distances are a problem. He’s not wonderfully consistent and was well beaten on the two previous occasions when he ran a month after Festival success. Also, he’s not the biggest and could meet trouble when the field bunches up at the Becher’s – Canal Turn section of the course. But he undoubtedly has the talent to win and it would be no surprise if he did so with authority. Vieux Lion Rouge (9, 10st 13lb) Hoping it can be third time lucky but the limitations of his stamina seemed to be exposed by the last two Nationals. Has had a poor season, failing to finish within 12 lengths of a winner, but is slightly higher in the ratings than for his previous two attempts, which hardly seems fair. Comes from a stable having a poor run. Chase The Spud (10, 10st 12lb) Muddy marathons are the thing for this winner of last year’s Midlands National. On drier ground or against classy opposition, he generally gets left behind. Having won at Haydock in November, he went up 10lb and has struggled in two subsequent runs, suggesting he lacks the necessary quality unless it rains plenty. Warriors Tale (9, 10st 12lb) A dogged galloper, he goes well at Newbury and should therefore be suited by this circuit. Looked as though he was reaching the limits of his stamina when headed close home in the Great Yorkshire Chase, over a mile shorter than this. Up against it, on a rating 12lb higher than when he last won. Seeyouatmidnight (10, 10st 12lb) Third in the Scottish National two years ago, though his jumping was scrappy at times and his stamina gave out about a furlong from the line. Has had a wind operation. Because of injuries, his decent third in a much shorter race last month was his first run over fences for 16 months, which is not ideal preparation. Nicely weighted on the pick of his form, including a defeat of Blaklion at Cheltenham two years ago. Gas Line Boy (12, 10st 11lb) Jumped the last with the leaders last year but had nothing left and tired into fifth, having taken a shoulder-barge from the runner-up at the second-last. Fell at the first in 2015 but usually does well over these fences, having won here in December. Has held his form so well that he is now rated higher than ever, 4lb higher than for last year’s race. Another respectable showing is likely. The Dutchman (8, 10st 11lb) Career best in January when running away with the Peter Marsh, pulling 13 lengths clear of Captain Redbeard. Was fired up the ratings to a mark 9lb higher than he’s ever been and may struggle to compete until he drops back down. He was carrying less weight that day than four other finishers of moderate talent, whereas here he will mix with Festival winners on a similar weight. Stopped quickly and was found to have bled from the nose when pulled up at Haydock in February. Pleasant Company (10, 10st 11lb) Given every chance last year by a masterful Ruby Walsh ride, creeping smoothly into contention on the second circuit before getting tired from the third-last and finishing ninth. Jumped soundly but stumbled and nearly unseated on landing over second Valentine’s, which can’t have helped. Only 1lb lower, despite modest efforts on both starts this season, and won’t have Walsh’s help. Ucello Conti (10, 10st 10lb) This plodder must be one of the few horses to spend three years in Gordon Elliott’s yard without winning. Often runs well, however, and has twice been placed in the Thyestes and also in Leopardstown’s Paddy Power Chase. Was a distant sixth in this race two years ago after notable mistakes. Went well last year until a rival jumped across him at Becher’s, causing his rider to fall off. Generally a sound jumper but will surely find something too quick for him on the run-in, even if his stamina holds up. Saint Are (12, 10st 10lb) Fine record at Aintree in April stretches back to 2011, when he won a Grade One novice hurdle. Won a handicap chase the next year and has since been second and third in the National, from four attempts. Soft ground is no use, as he showed when pulled up in 2016. Gets to run off the same rating as when third last year but we can’t be sure he retains his ability aged 12. He’s had just two runs this season and predictably failed to cope with soggy ground both times. Stable has been quiet for a month or two. Raz De Maree (13, 10st 9lb) Stormed clear in the Welsh Grand National and would have done the same the previous season if he hadn’t bumped into a future Gold Cup winner in Native River. Is also a winner of the Munster National and two Cork Nationals, giving him an excellent record in big-field marathons. Gone up another 6lb to match the highest rating he’s ever had and Chepstow form does not always translate well to Aintree. He’s a hold-up horse who will therefore need luck, which he didn’t get last year, when he unseated his jockey while dodging a faller. Would be the oldest winner for 95 years but clearly is not in decline. Very dangerous if able to get into contention by the third-last. I Just Know (8, 10st 8lb) Entered the reckoning with an authoritative success in the North Yorkshire Grand National, when he made all the running. Went up a stone in the weights, which is a lot for beating five finishers who have done little for the form. That might have been his big day, in a race the trainer was winning for the third year in a row, at a course where this horse is unbeaten. But he copes well with a stamina test and could have more to offer. Virgilio (9, 10st 8lb) Has a good record round Aintree’s Mildmay course, which may not translate to the much bigger National course and fences. Disappointing when eighth there in November and had a wind operation the next month. Unraced since mid-December, an unorthodox National preparation. Likes a dry-ish surface, so could do without much rain. Fairly weighted and could get involved if everything falls right but more likely to be seeking softer targets. Baie Des Iles (7, 10st 8lb) Tough, staying mare who is still young enough to have her best days ahead of her, being younger than any National winner since 1940. Never got into it when sixth in the 2016 Irish National and could only find the one pace when fifth in the Welsh National that year. Last seen running a fair third in Punchestown’s National Trial, giving weight to the first two, who made that form look good in the Irish National. She’s in big trouble if a turn of foot is required but, granted soft ground, she could get a lot of these in trouble by grinding along relentlessly in front. Maggio (13, 10st 8lb) Went into a lot of notebooks as a National type when bolting up by 12 lengths in a race on the Mildmay course here two years ago, but then had to miss last year’s National after a badly timed injury. Hard to say how much ability he retains, as he’s been raced so sparingly and often over hurdles but it’s a concern that he is now older than any National winner since 1923. Leap of faith required. Pendra (10, 10st 8lb) Stamina is the most obvious weak spot for this talented but frustrating type who appears not to be the most robust. Beaten over 100 lengths into 13th two years ago, eased down on the run-in on soft ground. Has only had two runs since, when a fine second in last year’s Kim Muir and when well beaten in the same race this year. Ground made the difference; it was good when he was second, very testing when he flopped. Hard to believe he’s a National winner in waiting. Buywise (11, 10st 8lb) Famously frustrating beast who has finished fast but too late on many a day, often after killing his chance with a mistake. Has been held back by metal pins in a back leg but the trainer says he’s moving better than ever and won a decent pot at Sandown in January. Offsetting that he ran so poorly when 12th in the 2016 National on soft ground, which should have suited, and after a much stronger season than this one. Childrens List (8, 10st 8lb) One of the least experienced in the field after just four runs over fences, of which his only win came in a 2016 beginners’ chase. Background and pedigree suggest his stamina might not stretch to a race like this and he was pulled up on his only attempt in a long-distance handicap chase. Doesn’t seem to like big fields. Rating looks a bit high. Hard to fancy. Lord Windermere (12, 10st 7lb) Ruined his chance last year by boiling over before the start. Did pretty well, then, to work his way into contention by the second-last but was a tired seventh in the end. Fell on his only outing since, when heavy ground did not suit. If the weather dries up and he behaves himself, it’s not beyond him to get involved off a rating that has dropped a stone and a half from his peak. He was a dual Festival winner but four years is a long time to make your supporters wait for another victory. Captain Redbeard (9, 10st 7lb) Game and consistent, he’s already had an excellent season, winning the Tommy Whittle in December and chasing home The Dutchman in the Peter Marsh back at Haydock. Warmed up with a first hurdles success for two years. Still on a beatable rating in the right contest but this might not be it. There’s a lot more strength in depth than he’s used to meeting and all his wins have come in single-figure fields. Not the most efficient jumper, mixing flamboyant leaps with the odd mistake. He didn’t have much left at the end of his last two races. Houblon Des Obeaux (11, 10st 7lb) Thoroughly experienced plodder after 38 starts over fences. By no means a prolific winner in recent seasons, though he managed to nick a weak race at Sandown in November. Got round in his own time to be 10th last year, beaten by 42 lengths. Could do better if the ground is soft. Blinkers may have helped when he was third at Ascot last month and could do so again. A distant third in the Welsh National last season and has since dropped 9lb, while his stable has finally hit form after a bleak winter, so a case can be made for him plugging on into fifth, maybe. Bless The Wings (13, 10st 6lb) Veteran of 46 races over fences showed his wellbeing by winning round Cheltenham’s cross-country course in December. Has twice been second in the Irish National and was beaten just a short-head in 2016 under Ruby Walsh. Now 6lb higher than when second at Fairyhouse last year. Jumping has never been flawless but a clear round could easily put him in the leading bunch on the run from the third-last. Doubtful he can be fastest from there. Could do with the ground drying up. Milansbar (11, 10st 6lb) Gave a mulish display when dropping himself out in the Welsh National and was then remarkably revived by the fitting of blinkers when an easy winner of Warwick’s Classic Chase. A change of jockey may also have helped. Believing he would miss the cut for this, connections raced him in two more marathons on heavy going in the past two months, including a fair second in the Midlands National. Will have to be remarkably robust to show his best form here at the end of such a taxing season. Final Nudge (9, 10st 6lb) Close second in the Badger Ales on his first run of the season but went up a few pounds and has not really shone in stronger races since. Travelled strongly in the Welsh National and Kim Muir before the limitations of his stamina appeared to be shown up in both. Double Ross (12, 10st 6lb) Was running a fair race just behind the leaders when his saddle slipped at the second Canal Turn two years ago, causing him to be pulled up. Now 7lb lower and capable of going well again, though his form this season has been patchy. Was giving lumps of weight to the first three when fourth at Chepstow in October and plugged on gamely to be fourth in the Kim Muir last month. Stamina must be in question, given he got tired and faded in the Hennessy for the last two years. Road To Riches (11, 10st 5lb) Career peaked with an extremely game effort to be third in an attritional Cheltenham Gold Cup three years ago, when quality rivals like Many Clouds, Silviniaco Conti and Carlingford Lough were a long way behind. Ran to a high level for another season after that and was second in the 2016 Irish Gold Cup but has been two stones below his best in the last year. Enthusiasm seems to be on the wane, despite various bits of headgear being tried. On a dangerously low rating if he ever does bounce back to something like his best.

The speech is widely recognised as one of the most provocative, racist public pronouncements in recent UK history, and will be read by the actor Ian McDiarmid, who has recently announced that he doesn’t believe Powell was a racist. Sharing a link on Twitter, the BBC media editor Amol Rajan praised the “amazing production job”, with the BBC preview itself describing the “significance of the speech”, with little acknowledgement of its toxic effects. Why the BBC would think to do this at a time when far-right nationalism and casual racism is on the rise in Europe and the UK is baffling. It’s a flamboyant party trick that masks the deadly undertones of racism in British society that still exist. Last month new figures showed that hate crime on London Underground has soared by almost a third in three years. “Punish a Muslim Day” letters sent to addresses across the country, and widely shared online, promised that 3 April would be a day filled with racialised violence, and universities have been grappling with continuing accusations of racism at their institutions. As a reminder for those of you lucky enough to have never read or heard Powell’s words, his infamous speech quotes one of his Wolverhampton constituents, who said “in this country in 15 or 20 years’ time the black man will have the whip hand over the white man”. The speech was highly effective in stirring up the notion that immigration would cause the degradation of society. “They found their wives unable to obtain hospital beds in childbirth, their children unable to obtain school places, their homes and neighbourhoods changed beyond recognition,” Powell said, talking about the consequences of immigration on “native” UK citizens. Fascists from the BNP, EDL and Britain First have been modelling their language upon it ever since. The speech also condemned the race relations bill, which was to make it illegal to refuse housing or employment to someone on the grounds of their colour or their race. The full speech itself is easily accessible on the internet, while anyone who wants to hear Powell read parts of it as a “primary source” of historical information only need type it into Google. The BBC does not need to be platforming this speech, and it’s been heartening to see an immediate backlash to its decision on social media. The normalisation of Powell’s inflammatory rhetoric around immigration and race has come through in recent years, both subtly and overtly. In 2011, historian David Starkey proclaimed that Powell’s “prophecy” was “absolutely right in one sense”, and that “the problem is that the whites have become black”. He is still listed as an honorary fellow at Cambridge University, even fronting one of its videos in 2015, until there was an outcry from students who rightly proclaimed him as “aggressively racist”. McDiarmid, who plays the role of Powell in the play What Shadows, has also tried to claim that the politician was not a racist. In an interview published in the Telegraph today, he states that Powell was right “in terms of the numbers” and that these days everyone accepts that “[immigration] can’t go on in an unlimited way because the results, as he said, would be catastrophic”. Meanwhile, far-right racist groups such as the White Pendragons, who recently tried to arrest Sadiq Khan, share links (more than a dozen in 2018 alone) on their private Facebook pages and internet forums, citing Powell as an inspiration. For many people his words still have resonance. It’s they who will be most obviously pleased to hear his words rendered for the first time in full on BBC radio, who will share the links and soundbites of his sickening oratory as they continue to make life terrifying for immigrants and brown and black people in this country. The resurrection of Powell’s hateful hyperbole is particularly jarring at a time when Caribbean migrants who came to the UK decades ago are being unceremoniously booted out of the country as a result of the Home Office’s hostile environment policy. This year also sees the 70th anniversary of Windrush – the influx of black immigrants that came from the Caribbean Commonwealth countries in the mid-20th century, representing the first non-white mass immigration to the UK. Our government asked them to come to the country to help with infrastructure following the second world war. This is a time when we should be celebrating their contributions to British society against the odds, not having to fight to keep them in the country, against a backdrop of the BBC airing a speech that made their lives so hard in the first place. My grandmother and grandfather, who moved to the UK from Jamaica in the 1950s and who were firmly a part of the Windrush generation, lived in Wolverhampton, where Powell’s constituency was, and so would have been particularly vulnerable to his lies. The BBC needs to withdraw this programme and not give the weight, time or credence implied by getting an actor to voice his speech in full, to a man still seen as a prophetic hero by some on the far right. Powell was dismissed from the shadow cabinet after his inflammatory speech in 1968. We need to dismiss him now, too. • Charlie Brinkhurst-Cuff is a freelance journalist and opinions editor at gal-dem.com, a magazine written by women of colour"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"environment/2018/apr/18/country-diary-trees-ruined-paper-mill-tamar-valley","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-18T04:30:14Z","webTitle":"Country diary: a chiffchaff sings by the paper mill's ruins","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/apr/18/country-diary-trees-ruined-paper-mill-tamar-valley","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/apr/18/country-diary-trees-ruined-paper-mill-tamar-valley","fields":{"headline":"Country diary: a chiffchaff sings by the paper mill's ruins","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Anemone nemorosa flowers in steep woods below the muddy track, which was once maintained as a carriageway for enjoyment by the Edgcumbes, when out on scenic drives from Cotehele House. The sound of turbulent water carries up from the swollen stream, rushing towards its junction with the tidal Tamar on the Ashburton Bend below Calstock. From the valley side, a mine stack protrudes through trees that colonise waste tips and workings, and there are glimpses of renovated cottages and a little vineyard near the old engine house, converted by the Landmark Trust into a holiday home. Upstream, by the hamlet of Danescoombe, isolated high walls no longer bound the kitchen garden, established before 1900 by the estate’s gardeners. Instead, sparse rows of narcissi in rough grass indicate later cultivation by tenants until the 1960s. Nearby, the most precipitous market garden plots have reverted to mossy woodland with undergrowth of sprawling daffodils, ivy and winter-flattened ferns. Trees also encroach on the ruins of an 18th-century paper mill powered by an overshot water-wheel. It made coarse brown paper and millboard (cardboard), used for wrapping and packing produce from the Tamar Valley’s then extensive apple and cherry orchards and soft fruit gardens; documented in 1788, when it was insured for £600, the mill was still working in 1851 “with one vat and a beating engine”, though production ceased in 1857. Rags and hemp would have been transported upriver from Plymouth on sailing barges. These materials, supplemented with local wood shavings and reeds, were then unloaded into horse-drawn carts, and hauled the final mile along the lane inland towards the mill. After soaking in the vat and pounding by the stamps, resultant mashed-up pulp was spread on to frames, pressed and dried into sheets. Today, in this sheltered wooded enclave, a chiffchaff sings and flits from willow catkins to fresh shoots in bramble thickets in search of insects. Primroses and celandines thrive in damp hedge-banks, to be succeeded by stitchwort, campions, fresh ferns and bluebells. Higher up, trodden horse pastures remain waterlogged; sprayed-off arable fields await a period of dry weather for ploughing, but for now above Honicombe yet more drizzling cloud shrouds Hingston Down."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"science/2018/apr/21/neurosurgeon-eric-leuthardt-interface-mind-machine-brain-implants","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-21T13:00:05Z","webTitle":"Neurosurgeon Eric Leuthardt: ‘An interface between mind and machine will happen’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/apr/21/neurosurgeon-eric-leuthardt-interface-mind-machine-brain-implants","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2018/apr/21/neurosurgeon-eric-leuthardt-interface-mind-machine-brain-implants","fields":{"headline":"Neurosurgeon Eric Leuthardt: ‘An interface between mind and machine will happen’","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Dr Eric C Leuthardt, 45, is a neurosurgeon at Washington University in St Louis. He is also the co-founder of NeuroLutions, a research laboratory developing direct interfaces between mind and computer. Leuthardt is pioneering the use of electrical brain implants to help restore motor function to the paralysed limbs of stroke victims. He is also helping to develop electrode systems that can directly decode the unspoken “inner voice” of the mind, and use it to direct external action; for example, Leuthardt’s subjects have been able to control the cursor of a Space Invaders video game just by thinking. He has published two science fiction novels aimed at “preparing society for the changes” that his work predicts. He believes that in the coming years neural implants that link the human brain directly to computers to enhance cognitive functions will be like pacemakers or tattoos, used with hardly a second thought. This interview was conducted by phone, when Leuthardt had just dropped off his children at school and was on his way to perform an operation to remove a brain tumour. A direct neural interface with machines has long been a science fiction dream. When did you first get involved in helping to make it happen? I started down this road back in 2002, when people were testing the first examples on monkeys. We have come a long way since then. We have a number of different implants being used in clinical trials now. In my view, we will reach a real inflection when these things become really clinically relevant. How far along that route are you? We have finished our first successful clinical trial with stroke patients. In the near term we will be in discussions with the US Food and Drug Administration to bring this technology to wide clinical use, which will hopefully happen in the next couple of years. I guess any procedure involving the brain feels like a different category of risk to most people. You must face that anxiety every day. I think there are two types of surgical practice that really strike at the core of people’s anxiety. One is brain surgery, where you are operating on something that people see as themselves, their sense of identity, their mind. The other one is, I think, paediatric surgery, where the operation is on the thing most precious to you – your children. I think both create a dynamic where you need to work harder to create trust with your patients. When it comes to innovation that might link a person’s mind directly with a machine, it seems as much an ethical as a medical question. Is that how you see it? Ethicists are critical in what we do. A working interface would be a real turning point in human evolution. I don’t say that with bombast or hyperbole. And just like with artificial intelligence, we need to take the greatest care in how we think about it. Whether it happens in five years or 50 years, it will happen. I wrote these two science-fiction novels to try to walk people through some of the things that could happen; for example, if others got unauthorised access to these implants, or when corporations got involved. We need to be thinking about these things now, rather than after the fact. Was one of the motivations in writing your books to work out these things for yourself? Did you feel the same at the beginning of the process as at the end? I had certain ideas in mind when I started the books, but there was an evolution. I came to think less about that individual interface and more about the effect this technology might have on society. We need to think hard about how advances [might] not increase social division. You are an optimist, but presumably it’s a guarded optimism? I’d like to think it is an informed optimism. Human intelligence is the most important resource on the planet, to preserve ourselves and the world. I believe the more we can advance human intelligence the better equipped we will be to do that. But we are in explosive times. Some of the fiction that I wrote even a few years ago I now see companies actually promising to do [what I described]. The premise of my second book was a neural implant that would allow you to download all your thoughts and create a virtual version of yourself. I saw the other day a company selling something that offers a scan of your brain and creates a virtual version, which is getting pretty close. The billionaires of Silicon Valley, the pharaohs of our age, intent on immortality, seem particularly interested in the technology. Elon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg, the founders of Google are all developing projects in this area. What will be the next big advance? Capturing the mechanical intent of imagined words is not that hard with this technology. I and a number of others have shown it is at least possible. What is much harder is higher-level semantics – capturing ideas directly from the brain. But I think we will get there. Decoding that inner voice seems one step closer to understanding the ultimate mystery of consciousness… It starts to challenge some of our fundamental assumptions of the mind/brain relationship. We always had this idea that the software is separate from the hardware… we are now showing that the software is represented in the hardware. I understand you studied theology as an undergraduate. Does that inform your work at all? I got a degree in biology and theology. I was interested in bringing very different disciplines together. One of the things I have always said is that in many ways theology was more important. It forced me to think about the big picture and to write my thoughts down. I think that has made me both more analytic in my science and more inductive in where that can go. Theology helps you realise how faith is an embedded part of our psychology – leaving aside religion, scientists have all sorts of beliefs they hold on to which the data does not support. Scientific advance is often as dependent on conversion, just as much as any religion. As a surgeon, when you are faced with a brain very directly, do you have a very clear sense of the person, the thing you are trying to preserve? Absolutely. There is a duality to it. One is the utter respect it demands. The other is how we are now seeing how the brain is much more plastic than we thought. The ability to recover function is extraordinary. We have always had a sense that it doesn’t heal… That’s right. If we take some of it away we tend to think there is no way our mind will return to “normal”. In fact, experience often shows the opposite. I wrote recently about the “biohacking” movement – people who attempt DIY implants to enhance their cognitive functions. Do you have such people volunteering to be part of neurointerface trials? Somebody called my secretary yesterday, saying they wanted an implant to meld themselves with artificial intelligence, and might I be someone who could help them do that? There is definitely an interest. When I give talks, I ask the question: “If I offered you a small surgery, a one-centimetre incision, and I told you I could improve your memory by 50%, who would want one?” In the younger generation almost all the hands go up. Clearly this notion of altering yourself has changed dramatically. No one had tattoos 30 years ago, now more than 50% do. Would it be something you would welcome yourself? Yes. I had one of my engineers build a non-invasive brain stimulator for myself, and I used it when I was writing my second novel. It clearly made a difference. I did a little experiment. I found I could write 500 words in 30 minutes, where it used to take me an hour or more … Where do I get one …?

And all the snappier when you come to consider its subject matter. Daniel Kalder was living in Moscow in the early 2000s, when he saw on television an item about the Rukhnama, or The Book of the Soul. This was the principal (but by no means the only) contribution to the genre of dictator literature, written by Turkmenbashi, the then führer of Turkmenistan. Struck by the lurid – not to say supernatural – way in which this bizarre tome was being depicted, Kalder set himself the task of reading it; as he says: “I had known about Mein Kampf and Mao’s Little Red Book since I was a child and I had visited many Russian apartments where dusty volumes of Lenin cluttered up bookcases. This, however, was the first time I had witnessed the phenomenon of the living dictator book.” Unfortunately, so maddeningly tedious is The Book of the Soul that by the time Kalder finished it – some three years later – Turkmenbashi’s body had given up. The idea of a book about the book-mad overlord of this desert realm was – if you’ll forgive a cliche worthy of any dictatorial wordsmith – dead in the water. So, instead, Kalder set himself the task of reviewing an extensive selection of the unwieldy tomes penned by the dictators of the 20th and early 21st centuries. He didn’t even have any assistance such as the weird contrivance Turkmenbashi had devised: a statue featuring an enormous copy of the Rukhnama, which “was supposed to open by itself, to reveal a double-page spread of [his] wisdom each night – but it never did. The mechanism had broken, and nobody repaired it.” Some might argue this was a good thing – and that furthermore, these vanity/tyranny-published novels, volumes of poetry, memoirs and many reams of pseudo-ideological claptrap should also be consigned to the dustbin of history, along with their originators. But as Kalder points out: during the long years he was writing the book the world has lurched into a new and fissiparous era – one that might well be as productive of dictators as the middle years of the last century. Meanwhile, the medium through which dictatorial – or wannabe dictatorial – “thought” is conveyed has changed from millions of weighty words to a mere handful of twittering characters, arguably making it that much easier for the (let’s face it, reading-averse) masses to be simultaneously aroused and hoodwinked. Kalder begins with the dusty volumes he saw cluttering Russian bookshelves. He argues, semi-persuasively, that Lenin should be viewed as the father of dictatorial literature. (And it’s worth noting here that although Kalder is adept at phrasemaking, he manages to resist the coinage, dic-lit. Would that I were so restrained.) A bookish lad, Lenin did indeed model his persona on the two-dimensional characters he found in Nikolay Chernyshevsky’s revolutionary pot-boiler What Is to Be Done? (1863). What’s more, when it came time, after the 1905 revolution, to seize control of tumultuous events, Lenin used this title for his own strategy chapbook. He also wrote a great deal of rather stodgy quasi-Marxist semi-theory, whereby he attempted to shoehorn the sprawling Russian agrarian economy (and its equally sprawling history) into the weird rubric of dialectical materialism. Kalder is surely right to finger Lenin as the literary justifier of the so-called “dictatorship of the proletariat”; but while it’s also true that given the opportunity, he acted with exemplary – and dictatorial – cruelty, surely what characterises his oeuvre overall is that it’s directed at seizing and consolidating power, rather than building some sort of monolithic mythos. As Kalder riffs, apropos Lenin’s vapid The State and Revolution: he “reached up from the page to hand you the crack pipe of revolution for another hit of the good shit”. Kalder likes these anachronistic tropes – but while funny, I’m not sure they serve him well. They made me insistently aware that the minds who produced these works – whether incendiary or enervating – were in fact radically different from my own; and that their authors were responding to radically different circumstances. Which is by no means to justify the papery solecisms of Lenin et al – or the horrors they justified or covered up. But ultimately cracking wise doesn’t quite cut it when it comes to either preventing tyranny, or providing nuance. Kalder’s on firmer ground with Stalin, who, having seized power despite Lenin accusing him from beyond the grave of “rudeness”, went on to have an exemplary dic-lit career of churning out mind-numbing verbiage – whether by himself, or by committee. Building on Lenin’s example, Stalin crystallised the notion of the dictatorial canon: by making his works (and by implication, himself) the very synecdoche of truth itself. Yet Kalder has some difficulties with Stalin as well, when it comes to his basic contention that within every dreadful writer there lurks a savage autocrat, waiting to get out. For while it’s true that he was a dictator sans pareil, and his mature prose was correspondingly crushingly awful, as a young man Stalin penned some not insignificant poetry in his native Georgian – evidence, perhaps, of the literary and ethical road less taken. Mussolini also gives Kalder pause for thought: Il Duce was, after all, a professional journalist, and highly successful newspaper editor, who knew how to analyse grammar. He was also refreshingly theory-lite – and free from the obligation to marmorealise any ideological predecessors. Kalder even has good words to say about Mussolini’s attempt at a weird bodice-ripper, The Cardinal’s Mistress, which has the distinction of being the only remotely “proper” novel written by a dictator. (Saddam Hussein had a late career burst of novelising, but the results make an average Mills &amp; Boon look like Madame Bovary.) Kalder gets round the Mussolini problem by pointing out that, as despots go, he was by no means the worst – more of a big bully than an out-and-out tyrant, at least until he entered the Nazis’ endgame. As for the Führer himself, Kalder quotes a copy editor: “At age thirty-five, Hitler had mastered neither basic spelling nor common grammar. His raw texts are riddled with lexical and syntactical errors. His punctuation, like his capitalisation, is as faulty as it is inconsistent.” Anyone who has to mark assignments by preliterate students will have suffered such profligate errancy – and while not every duff essay is a Mein Kampf, it can be difficult not to feel you’re at the mercy of “a posturing autodidact who seems to have no difficulty believing the utmost drivel”. The afterlife of Hitler’s dreadful, poisonous, ill-written book is possibly the most disturbing: it still sells in shed-loads throughout the world. Not so Chairman Mao’s Little Red Book, the mass production of which once threatened to overwhelm China’s printing presses – it, together with the humongous amount of drivel attributed to the Great Helmsman (mostly written by dependable henchmen), ended up in landfill. Perhaps the critical verdict on the dictators described in these pages – variously lynched, shot and otherwise extemporised to death – should make us a little more sanguine about their literary efforts. After all, it’s one thing for your books to be remaindered – quite another to have your body pulped. Kalder borrows the central conceit of Kafka’s story In the Penal Colony to characterise the full horror of dic-lit: like the ghastly machine that executes transgressors by inscribing their crimes on their living flesh, the books of demagogues as various as Enver Hoxha and Ayatollah Khomeini have been enactments of torment, rather than literature in any normal sense. Which rather counts against Kalder’s urge to finger literature itself for the mass murdering of the last century. True, all writers do indeed have dictatorial inclinations – how else can we rule effectively over our papery realms? But as he points out, all good writing depends on accepting the inherently chancy nature of the world – whereas all despotic governance, like all bad writing, is predicated on the exact opposite: a near-psychotic need to enforce hard-backed conformity. • Will Self’s latest novel, Phone, is published by Penguin.

Defence lawyers had accused the government and authorities under the former rightwing president Nicolas Sarkozy of wrongly claiming there was a hotbed of leftwing anarchist terrorists in a sleepy village in central France and manipulating the case in order to look tough. The notorious case, known as the Tarnac affair, began in November 2008 when more than a hundred French police officers swooped on the tiny rural village of Tarnac, arresting anti-capitalists who were living on a communal farm and running a village shop. In a vast media operation, the then rightwing government and French authorities alleged that the so-called Tarnac Nine were a cell of dangerous subversives intent on anarchist armed insurrection to overthrow the state. At the time, villagers and the accused denied the charges, rights groups said the case was a misuse of anti-terrorism laws and lawyers said the case was deliberately being manipulated to make the government look tough against a supposed “enemy within”. After 10 years of investigation — in which terrorist charges were dropped — and a three week trial, the two main accused – Julien Coupat, a business and sociology graduate, and his archeologist girlfriend, Yildune Lévy – were cleared of sabotage or belonging to any group. “The hearing has allowed it to be demonstrated that the Tarnac group was a fiction,” the leading judge said. Coupat and Lévy were found guilty of refusing to consent to a biological DNA test, but weren’t given a sentence. Of eight defendants — five men and three women, aged between 31 and 43 — the rest were also cleared of belonging to a subversive group. But one was convicted of handling stolen goods and attempting to falsify administrative documents. “This is a humiliation for the anti-terrorism services of the time, for the magistrate who instructed the case, as well as for the anti-terrorist prosecutor,” said the lawyer Jérémie Assous, who defended several of those acquitted. It emerged during the investigation that a former British police spy had infiltrated the group and made claims against them. French authorities did not pursue charges on those elements and Coupat had described the spy as “insignificant”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2018/apr/22/gun-love-jennifer-clement-review-superb-surreal-journey-trumps-america","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-22T09:00:18Z","webTitle":"Gun Love review – trigger-happy in Trump’s America","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/apr/22/gun-love-jennifer-clement-review-superb-surreal-journey-trumps-america","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/apr/22/gun-love-jennifer-clement-review-superb-surreal-journey-trumps-america","fields":{"headline":"Gun Love review – trigger-happy in Trump’s America","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Chekhov’s dramatic principle about guns – that if you have one hanging on the wall in the first act, it needs to go off at some point – is followed to the letter in Jennifer Clement’s superb new novel. There are a great number of guns in this book, all of which are described with clinical efficiency, and whenever they are fired, something bad happens. Yet there’s also a great deal of love here; amid the violence and hopelessness of gun-crazed contemporary America, humanity breaks through. In the otherworldly Florida milieu that Clement depicts, half hell and half purgatory, nondescript characters flit about, scraping by with dead-end jobs and no prospects. Margot France is no exception, a young woman living in a broken-down car with her 14-year-old daughter, Pearl. At first glance, she is no less of a wreck than her neighbours. A teenager when she got pregnant, she left her well-to-do family in disgrace, fleeing to this place in the middle of nowhere. She brings a sensibility at odds with received notions of trailer park America: Margot and Pearl dine off Limoges china, a family possession, and, in one striking set piece, Margot revives a long-submerged talent on the piano to play Rachmaninov in her local church. But destiny and the gun aren’t far away, in the charismatic but satanic form of Eli Redmond, whom Margot falls for, with disastrous results. There are similarities, in the first half at least, between Gun Love and Emma Donoghue’s Room. Both are excellent at describing the intensity of the love between a mother and child within a claustrophobic environment, and the disruption that a hostile male presence causes to this bond. However, while Room’s midway change of setting leads to catharsis, Chekhov’s maxim holds true here, and Clement’s true protagonist, Pearl, finds herself on a near-surreal journey across Trump’s America, where she finds unexpected kindness and institutional neglect in equal measure. Clement’s spare, often oblique style makes this book feel like a great lost murder ballad by the likes of Johnny Cash or Nick Cave. Seen through the eyes of Pearl, whose initially naive perspective is soon toughened by brutal experience, it has some moving poetic flourishes: a victim of violence is described as walking “straight into the shooting gun like she was walking into a water sprinkler on a hot Florida day in July”. There are echoes here of other great chroniclers of violence, such as Cormac McCarthy, and this is one of those rare books that the reader might wish to be a few dozen pages longer, to spend some more time in this fully realised world; a couple of characters feel underdrawn. Nonetheless, by the time that the long-awaited showdown between Eli and Pearl comes around, readers will feel conflicted by their own response to the horrors and wonders that they have encountered. • Gun Love by Jennifer Clement is published by Hogarth (£14.99).

Pompeo was responding to senators during five hours of testimony at his confirmation hearing on Capitol Hill, where he also faced questions over whether, as secretary of state, he would be part of a “war cabinet” that Trump is assembling ahead of potential conflicts with Iran, North Korea, Russia and Syria. Bob Menendez of New Jersey, the top Democrat on the Senate foreign relations committee, asked Pompeo, currently CIA director, about a Washington Post report that in March last year he and the national intelligence director, Dan Coats, were alone with Trump when he complained about the FBI investigation and James Comey’s handling of it. Sign up to receive the top US stories every morning “This account strongly suggests that the president asked you and Director Coats to interfere with then FBI Director Comey’s investigations into the Trump campaign’s contacts with Russia,” Menendez said. “What did President Trump say to you and Director Coats in that meeting?” Pompeo replied: “Senator, I’m not going to talk about the conversations that the president and I had … But I will tell you this. The article’s suggestion that he asked me to do anything improper is false.” Under further questioning, he added: “I don’t recall what he asked me that day, precisely. But I have to tell you, I’m with the president an awful lot – he has never asked me to do anything that I considered remotely improper.” Pompeo said he would not talk about private conversations with the president but acknowledged: “I spoke with Special Counsel Mueller, who interviewed me. Requested an interview, I cooperated.” He declined to reveal the subject of the conversation. Later, Pompeo was pressed by Democratic Senator Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire on whether he agreed with Trump’s characterisation of the Russia investigation as a “witch-hunt” and whether the president has the right to fire Mueller. He declined to comment. But Pompeo did make clear that he would not resign if Trump fires the deputy attorney general, Rod Rosenstein. “My instincts tell me that my obligation to continue to serve as America’s senior diplomat would be more important at increased times of political and domestic turmoil,” he said. However, he also said the “historic conflict” between the US and Russia is due to Moscow’s “bad behaviour”, contradicting Trump’s assertion that the Mueller investigation is to blame. The former Kansas congressman was nominated by Trump last month to succeed Rex Tillerson. The state department has been marginalised under the leadership of Tillerson, who endorsed huge budget cuts and saw morale plummet, and old allies around the world have been left bemused by mixed messages from an impulsive president. Pompeo is seen as a foreign policy hawk who was opposed to the Iran nuclear deal and has been criticised for his past support for the Iraq war and tolerance of waterboarding and other methods of torture. He has also made incendiary comments about Muslims, and gay and lesbian people. In his opening remarks, Pompeo referred to “demoralising” vacancies at the top echelons of the state department and said he planned to fill them. “My relationship with President Trump is due to one thing: we’ve demonstrated value to him at the CIA,” he said. “So, in turn, he has come to rely on us. I intend to ensure that the Department of State will be just as central to the president’s policies and the national security of the United States.” The hearing inevitably had a particular focus on Syria, where Trump has tweeted threats of a missile strike in retaliation for use of chemical weapons against civilians, while also taunting Russia. Pompeo said he believed the president had the authority to order an attack without consulting Congress, citing precedent rather than the constitution. He also appeared to confirm reports that about 200 Russian mercenaries were killed in February during a clash with US-led forces in Syria. “In Syria, a handful of weeks ago, the Russians met their match and a couple hundred Russians were killed,” said Pompeo, without disclosing further details. Media reports have suggested that Russian mercenaries working for the so-called “Wagner Group” were involved in the battle in February. North Korea also figured prominently. Pompeo said “no one is under any illusions” that a planned US-North Korea summit can achieve a comprehensive agreement on the denuclearisation of the North. But he said he was optimistic it could “set us down the course to achieve a diplomatic outcome that America and the world so desperately need”. He claimed: “I have never advocated for regime change.” Senator Edward Markey asked if Pompeo concurred with John Bolton, the new national security adviser, that if economic sanctions are exhausted, a ground invasion of North Korea would be necessary to rid it of its nuclear weapons programme. Pompeo said: “I supposed I could hypothesise such a situation so I’ll answer your question as could I imagine one? Yes, I could. I suppose it’s possible that we would get to the condition where … Kim Jong-un was directly threatening and we had information about his activities. Yes, I can imagine times when America would need to take a response that moved past diplomacy.” Markey and Pompeo agreed that the consequences of such an attack would be “catastrophic”. Markey said: “I don’t feel comfortable with you not taking that off the table.” Pompeo faced scrutiny over his past criticism of the Iran nuclear deal. He claimed: “I want to fix this deal.” But that appeared to be at odds with a more aggressive statement he made on Twitter in November 2016: “I look forward to rolling back this deal with the world’s largest state sponsor of terrorism.” Senator Cory Booker, a Democrat from New Jersey, grilled Pompeo over past comments suggesting that Muslim Americans have a special obligation to condemn terrorist attacks. The director insisted: “I’ve heard these critiques. I have worked closely with Muslim leaders, with Muslim countries. The CIA has saved countless thousands of Muslim lives during my 15 months. This is at the core of who I am, Senator Booker, and I promise you I will treat people of each faith or no faith with the dignity and respect they deserve.” But Booker also pushed Pompeo about his friendship with Frank Gaffney, widely seen as an Islamophobic conspiracy theorist, and past remarks in which he used the word “perversion” to describe homosexuality. “Yes or no: do you believe gay sex is a perversion?” Booker demanded. Pompeo said he stood by his view gay marriage is inappropriate and claimed: “My respect for every individual, regardless of their sexual orientation, is the same.” The start of Thursday’s proceeedings were interrupted by protesters chanting: “No Pompeo! No more war!” One demonstrator was removed by police while shouting: “This man is no diplomat!” Among those watching in the packed committee room were Nikki Haley, the US ambassador the UN, and Bob Dole, a former senator and Republican presidential candidate, who described Pompeo as “a brilliant guy”. He added: “He’s ready to go and he will be our top diplomat. What we would like to urge is a quick confirmation because he is needed by the president and the rest of us who live in this wonderful country.” But Pompeo faces a close vote. CNN journalist Manu Raju tweeted that, after the hearing, Republican senator Rand Paul said he is still a “no”. Menendez voiced Democratic concerns over Pompeo’s closeness to the president with a series of sharp questions from the off. “Will you enable President Trump’s worst instincts? Will you advocate for long-term strategies to protect US national security and interests, or will you be lurching from crisis to crisis as we have been under this administration? “Will you advocate for robust diplomacy or will you take America into unnecessary and costly wars? Will you stand up to President Trump and say ‘no, you are wrong in that view’? Or will you be a yes man? Americans are scared that this president – the commander in chaos – will lead them into war. This is not a time for taunts and tweets.” Since being nominated last month, Pompeo has spent much of his time at the state department and has spoken to all eight living former secretaries including Hillary Clinton, whom he criticised over the 2012 attack on US facilities in Benghazi, Libya."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"stage/2018/apr/12/kazuo-ishiguros-the-remains-of-the-day-to-be-adapted-for-the-stage","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-12T15:41:03Z","webTitle":"Kazuo Ishiguro's The Remains of the Day to be adapted for the stage","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/apr/12/kazuo-ishiguros-the-remains-of-the-day-to-be-adapted-for-the-stage","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2018/apr/12/kazuo-ishiguros-the-remains-of-the-day-to-be-adapted-for-the-stage","fields":{"headline":"Kazuo Ishiguro's The Remains of the Day to be adapted for the stage","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Twenty-five years after it was made into an Oscar-nominated film, Kazuo Ishiguro’s Booker prize-winning novel The Remains of the Day is to be adapted for the stage. Ishiguro will collaborate on the adaptation, by playwright and novelist Barney Norris. It will tour the UK after its world premiere at Northampton’s Royal &amp; Derngate in February next year. Ishiguro won the Booker prize in 1989 for his poignant novel about a journey undertaken by an English butler, Stevens, who looks back over his life in service at Darlington Hall. It became a film in 1993, produced by Merchant Ivory, and earned eight Oscar nominations. Anthony Hopkins starred as the butler and Emma Thompson played Miss Kenton, Darlington Hall’s former housekeeper, with whom Stevens is reunited. The novel was inspired by PG Wodehouse’s Jeeves and, more surprisingly, as Ishiguro explained in an article for the Guardian, by Francis Ford Coppola’s The Conversation and the Tom Waits song Ruby’s Arms. The stage version will be directed by Christopher Haydon, who said “Norris has exactly the right theatrical understanding and delicate sensibility to turn this engaging and highly political love story into a moving and dynamic piece of theatre.” Norris said The Remains of the Day is: “One of those stories that appear every now and again which seem, almost as soon as they’re written, to belong to the world. It has entered the bloodstream of our culture. To work with such extraordinary material is a great gift.” The Remains of the Day is produced by Royal &amp; Derngate and the touring company Out of Joint, in association with Oxford Playhouse. It opens in Northampton on 23 February 2019.

The defence secretary, James Mattis, said an attack was “not yet in the offing”. France: Emmanuel Macron, who has declared that the proven and fatal use of chemical weapons in Syria was a red line for France, said Paris had evidence that the Syrian government carried out the Douma attack, reported to have killed more than 40 people, but it would not decide on a response until all the information was known. “We have proof that last week chemical weapons were used, at least chlorine, and that they were used by the regime of Bashar al-Assad,” the president said. He did not say what that proof might be, but warned that decisions would be taken “in due course, when we judge it most useful and effective … We cannot allow regimes that believe they can act with impunity to violate international law in the worst possible way.” UK: Theresa May recalled her cabinet from its Easter break to discuss joining a possible strike. The prime minister has said “all the indications are” that Assad’s forces were responsible and that the use of chemical weapons “cannot go unchallenged”. After reports that May was prepared to give the go-ahead for action without parliamentary approval, the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, demanded that MPs be consulted. The Ministry of Defence declined to confirm that Royal Navy submarines armed with cruise missiles had already been dispatched to within range of Syria. Backers Germany: Angela Merkel, who spoke to Macron on Thursday, has ruled out joining any strike, but said she backed “sending a signal” that chemical weapons use would not be tolerated. Saying there was “strong evidence” that Damascus had deployed poison gas, the chancellor said “a full spectrum of measures” would be considered. “Germany will not participate militarily, but we will provide our support if the representatives in the UN security council … were to take steps beyond diplomatic measures,” she said. The foreign minister, Heiko Maas, said Berlin expected to be consulted before any of the western allies conducted an attack, since it was important they were united. Germany has supplied reconnaissance and refuelling flights as part of the international anti-jihadist campaign in Syria. Italy: The prime minister, Paolo Gentiloni, spoke to several leaders including Merkel to say Italy would not play a direct role in a military attack, but “based on current international and bilateral accords, will continue to offer logistical support to allied forces”, according to a statement from his office. Urging caution Turkey: Recep Tayyip Erdoğan has said he is worried by the escalating tensions between Moscow and Washington. “We are extremely worried that some countries confident of their military power are turning Syria into a scene for arm wrestling,” the president said, before discussing ways of ending what he called “the chemical massacre” in Syria in a call with Russia’s Vladimir Putin. Opposed to any action Syria: Assad said western threats were based on “lies” aimed at undermining his forces’ recent advances, and they endangered international peace and security. Military action would only contribute to the “further destabilisation” of the region, the president said on Thursday. The Syrian government has denied carrying out the Douma attack. Russia: Putin’s spokesman Dmitry Peskov said it was “necessary to avoid any steps that may fuel tensions in Syria”, and any strike would have an “utterly destructive impact on the Syrian settlement”. The foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said western leaders had no authority to be “investigators, prosecutors and executioners” and should not assume the role of “global policeman”. She described claims around the attack as fake and urged western allies to carefully weigh the consequences of any action. Bolivia: The country’s UN ambassador, Sacha Llorenty Soliz, who called an emergency closed meeting of the security council for Thursday, said he wanted all members to agree that no unilateral action should be taken."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2018/apr/22/property-lionel-shriver-review","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-22T08:00:16Z","webTitle":"Property by Lionel Shriver review – assured and entertaining","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/apr/22/property-lionel-shriver-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/apr/22/property-lionel-shriver-review","fields":{"headline":"Property by Lionel Shriver review – assured and entertaining","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Lionel Shriver is a virtuoso at describing what it is to be uncomfortable in one’s own skin. It is only the young, in this phenomenal collection of short stories, who are thoughtlessly content. But their self-involvement (in Domestic Terrorism and Kilifi Creek) is shown to be outrageous, and entertaining too – up to a point. Liana is a vivacious, free-loading young woman who never asks herself whether she is taking liberties when she invites herself to stay with an elderly couple in Kenya. “Although Liana imagined herself undemanding, even the easy to please required fresh sheets, which would have to be laundered after her departure.” Liana persists in feeling that her vitality is doing her hosts a favour, unaware how tired the obligation to socialise makes them. Liam is a maddening young man (in a story that will alarm and amuse every parent saddled with grownup children at home) whose girlfriend defends his slothful existence to his mother: “This whole idea of ‘doing something’ with your life, it’s wrong-headed. Ask Liam – you maybe don’t realise, but your son, he’s into some profound shit. You are your life. It’s not outside you. You can’t ‘do something with it’ like a toaster on a table.” While Liam pursues the sensation of being himself, his parents do stuff – they put the toast on the table: he brings in no bread at all. And then they decide they’ve had enough. Shriver does not crack a smile – her deadpan quality is her forte – but she makes sure you do. The novellas and stories often seem to be in communication with one another in an unusual and pleasing way. She writes especially well about how the places in which we live affect us and sometimes shackle us. Our houses are a second skin, our carapace. A flat in Belfast (The Subletter) is a rum character: “The posture of the house on the hill was drawn up, bosom high, like a turn-of-the-century dowager a few too many cream teas on.” A jerry-built house in New York (Vermin) is free and easy – until the couple renting it buy it. The opening line is: “I don’t know if the moral of this story is that you should never buy a house.” A beautiful Georgian house (Negative Equity) with “slate flooring” and “funky lines of mismatched spice” refuses to extend its perfection to the people who occupy it. This is a collection about ownership in the larger sense, about how we do – and do not – possess ourselves. Sometimes, other people move in on us like squatters. Family can claim us too (there are two discomfiting stories about father-son relationships). The opening novella, The Standing Chandelier, is the collection’s not-to-be-missed highlight. It explores the idea that, given the will and words, any personality might be rewritten: “you could probably savage the personality of everyone on the planet if you wanted to”. (Shriver certainly could.) Jillian Frisk is an extrovert artist who, when people take against her, tends to take their views to heart. She has a best friend in her male tennis partner and ex-lover, Baba – but Paige, his wife-to-be, emerges as a bad fairy, determined to end their friendship. This is a story that turns on its own axis. One’s sympathies are with Jillian, yet Shriver insists that one also understand Paige’s reasons for finding her beyond the pale. The story proceeds with assured unpredictability and you recognise – fuming all the way – the artistic rightness of each development. When it comes to what Thomas Hardy called “life’s little ironies”, Shriver is ahead of the game. Her stories are filled with irony and psychological shafts of light. She understands the oddity of what it is to possess: “It is funny how you can covet what you have.” With most short story collections, it is an effort to keep restarting the narrative engine with each new story. But Shriver has the gift for making one instantly curious, entertained, involved and ready to move in – no matter what the property. • Property by Lionel Shriver is published by Borough Press (£14.99).

Now, with Elon Musk talking about getting his Mars colony up and running by 2040, this Netflix reboot doesn’t require such a giant leap of the imagination. I’m (just) too young for Lost in Space 1.0, but I found the first episode. Wow, it looks like the TV equivalent of cave painting. It’s atmospheric, with great John Williams music, but the robot looks like it was made from cardboard boxes and bits of plumbing equipment. The medium has travelled light years in half a century.There is nothing cardboard about the new one – a serious Netflix budget sees to that. The Robinsons, no longer the perfect nuclear 1960s family, have gained some 21st-century attitude and dysfunction. The parents aren’t really together; the kids have modern anxieties and mardiness. On the way to establish a new colony, they crash on a planet that looks like Canada but with even more extreme geography, weather and fauna. The opener is packed with nail-biting action and literal cliffhangers. Matriarch Maureen (Molly Parker) has broken her leg, Judy is trapped under the ice, time is running out, Will falls down a crevasse into a scary forest where he meets his robot (less plumbing, more CGI, same utterance: “Danger, Will Robinson”). The scene-setting continues over the next few episodes, with flashbacks to fill in the holes in space and time, and the introduction of other survivors, including wicked stowaway Dr Smith (Parker Posey – Dr Smith is now a woman). After that, it can settle into an orbit of family adventures. It looks great. I love the new Chariot. And it’s not unfun. But nor does it boldly go where no sci-fi show has gone before. Some of the characterisation is crude. Doc Smith, for example, is a two-dimensional comedy baddie rather than a proper villain to have nightmares about. The parents’ marital issues are touched on rather than explored. The kids are annoying, although, well, they’re kids, they’re allowed to be. But it’s all a bit shallow. I don’t feel myself getting lost in it. And if you put it next to a certain other family sci-fi programme that also began in the 60s and was reborn in the 21st century, and which also has a doctor – the Doctor – who recently regenerated as a woman, it lacks wit and warmth and wizardry. A missed opportunity then. But perhaps it’s also reassuring – not that there’s life out there, but that, when it comes to television drama, money isn’t everything."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"football/live/2018/apr/11/bayern-munich-sevilla-champions-league-quarter-final-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-11T20:40:26Z","webTitle":"Bayern Munich 0-0 Sevilla (agg: 2-1): Champions League quarter-final – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2018/apr/11/bayern-munich-sevilla-champions-league-quarter-final-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/live/2018/apr/11/bayern-munich-sevilla-champions-league-quarter-final-live","fields":{"headline":"Bayern Munich 0-0 Sevilla (agg: 2-1): Champions League quarter-final – as it happened","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"That’s it. Bayern move comfortably, if underwhelmingly, into another Champions League semi-final. Sevilla had a few chances and hit the bar, but for the most part Bayern kept them at arm’s length. Thanks for your company. NOW DO ONE AND FOLLOW THE GAME IN MADRID BECAUSE THERE’S A PENALTY! 90 min Four minutes of added time. 90+2 min There’s an almighty rumble on the touchline after a poor tackle from Correa on Martinez. It was so late that I think the referee missed it, but somebody told him and he eventually produced the red card. I think that’s slightly harsh; it was probably halfway between a yellow and a red. Anyway. 89 min The most striking thing about this Bayern side is their speed - the lack of it, both with and without the ball. Liverpool’s front three would cause them plenty of problems. 88 min Somebody’s going to use the phrase “German efficiency” in reference to this match, aren’t they. 86 min Another Bayern change. Rafinha, who has had a superb game, is replaced by Niklas Sule. 85 min “When’s the draw for the semi finals, Rob?” says Simon McMahon. “On the One Show tomorrow? I hope Liverpool and Roma are drawn together; the thought of them meeting in the final would bring back too many painful memories. Though to be honest, the idea of Dundee United being in the European Cup final, and of a potential nuclear holocaust, seems positively quaint compared to what’s going on today.” It’s on Friday afternoon. The draw for the final follows straight after. 84 min Sevilla are running out of time, and they look like a team who have accepted an honourable defeat. 81 min Banega holds off Javi Martinez, who goes down holding his face. Banega is booked. That was ridiculously harsh. 81 min Franco Vazquez is replaced by Nolito, the last Sevilla substitution. 80 min Robben’s cross loops across goal and is put behind for a corner by Jesus Navas. Nothing comes of it. I don’t know why I bother with corners. 78 min Bayern have controlled the game a lot more in the second half. They still haven’t looked particularly good, though, and there’s not much for Liverpool to fear. 77 min The wounded Lewandowski is replaced by Sandro Wagner. 76 min Hummels is robbed by Luis Muriel by his own corner flag. Eventually the ball runs back to N’Zonzi, who belts it into orbit from 20 yards. 75 min N’Zonzi, who has been booked, is penalised for an awkward lunge at James. That could have been a second yellow card. 74 min “Sticking with this match, not distracted by all the ‘noise’ and ‘goals’ in the other one,” says Zach Neeley. “No thank you sir.” 72 min Robben goes on the outside this time, beating Escudero with ease before slapping the ball into the side netting at the near post. Lewandowski was in a great position in the middle. 70 min A Bayern substitution: Thiago Alcantara replaces Franck Ribery. And Sevilla make another change too, with Sandro Ramirez on for Pablo Sarabia. 69 min The match and the tie are starting to peter out. Sevilla have had their moments but Bayern are in control now. 66 min Robben comes infield on his left foot, spanks it miles wide. 65 min Sevilla make their first change, with Luis Muriel replacing the willing Wissam Ben Yedder. 63 min James’s pretty curler from 15 yards is well saved - and caught - by the diving Soria. 62 min I know Barcelona and Real Madrid like to outdo each other but this is ridiculous. 61 min “Kane has completed his hattrick in Madrid,” says Marie Meyer. 60 min The excellent Banega pings a long-range shot a few yards wide. Meanwhile, it’s now Real Madrid 0-3 Juventus. No, I am not having a bubble. 59 min: Correa hits the bar! Sevilla almost take the lead. Banega’s curling free-kick from the right was won emphatically in the air by Correa, who flicked an excellent header off the face of the bar with Ulreich motionless. 57 min Bayern have been more dominant in the second half. Heynckes evidently owns more than one type of hairdryer. 55 min “Just remember,” says Peter, “that at this point Sevilla has outscored Bayern.” And own-goals count double in the event of a draw. 54 min Muller’s shot from 15 yards is punched away by Soria, who seems to be allergic to catching the ball. 53 min Ribery plays another crafty reverse pass – this time to Rodriguez, who drills a low shot from a tight angle that is kicked away by Soria. He was almost caught out at the near post. 51 min Rafinha makes his second goal-saving interception of the night! Ben Yedder, found in the area by Vazquez, came inside Boateng and was about to shoot when Rafinha picked his pocket. Brilliant defending. 49 min A lovely move from Bayern. Ribery plays a reverse pass to the overlapping Rafinha, who stands up a superb firs-time cross beyond the far post. Lewandowski hangs in the air for ages but can’t quite get round the ball and heads it into the side netting. 48 min Sevilla will have a hard-luck story to tell at the end of this tie, having had chances in both legs. The equivalent of the Bullseye Bus Far Home, I suppose, but it’s better than being plugged 10-2 on aggregate. 47 min “Possible semi-final draw: Sevilla – Juventus, Roma- Liverpool,” says Krishnamoorthy V. “How much you would have laughed if someone said this when the group matches started?” Don’t tell me they’re quantifying laughter as well? ARE NONE OF LIFE’S PLEASURES SAFE FROM THE NUMBERWANG MASSIVE? 46 min Peep peep! Sevilla begin the second half. “Are you sad to be missing Real v Juve,” says Adam Roberts, “or relieved you haven’t got another crazy comeback game to do?” I’d like to think the level of ambition evident in all my writing answers that question, Adam. I always want to do the boring easy game. Half-time chit-chat “Good evening Rob,” says Grant Tennille. “In the 37th-minute entry, I believe you mean ‘orgasmic’ rather than ‘orgiastic’. What is this minute-by-minute coming to...” See, I told you I suffer from premature publication. It’s an official medical condition, and frankly I’m getting a bit sick of being stickmatised! Peep peep! That was an interesting half, with both teams missing good opportunities. Sevilla are still in this, though you’d expect Bayern to play with a bit more aggression in the second half. See you in 10 minutes. 45+1 min Rafinha is beating treated after injuring himself making that tackle. I think Sarabia followed through onto his shoulder. 45 min Martinez gives the ball away to Vazquez, who cuts a pass into Ben Yedder. He pushes it ingeniously through to Sarabia, who just overruns the ball in the area. That allows Rafinha to come across and make a vital tackle. Sevilla have had some excellent opportunities in this half. 41 min Bayern are playing some good stuff now. Robben plays the ball to the overlapping Muller, who guides a lovely angled pass into the corridor of uncertainty that takes the keeper Soria out of the game. Ribery is waiting to put it into an open net at the far post when Jesus Navas appears to slide the ball behind for a corner. Terrific defending from the Spanish Ashley Young. 40 min Robben wafts over from the edge of the area. 39 min Oh my: it’s Real Madrid 0-2 Juventus (aggregate: 3-2)! You may wish to go elsewhere. 38 min Bayern’s best chance. Robben slides a ball across the face of the area to Ribery, who skips inside Jesus Navas and then Mercado before hammering a shot that is beaten away by Soria. It was a spectacular save, though Ribery should probably have scored. 37 min “Quantifying orgasms soon?” says Matthew Turner. “Doesn’t everyone always do that? It’s qualifying orgasms that’s the refined trick.” Ah, good point. I meant quantifying the orgiastic experience. Sometimes I suffer from premature publication. 34 min A Bayern corner is only half cleared and comes to Hummels, who marches into the box from the right and hits a left-footed heatseeker just over the bar. That was a tremendous hit. 32 min A Bayern goal wouldn’t be the end of the world for Sevilla, or even the end of the Europe, as they need to score twice anyway. A 2-0 win would put them through; a 2-1 win would take the game to extra-time. 29 min Bayern are playing with 0.00% oomph It’s a good job they’re a German side or I’d be tempted to accuse them of complacency. 26 min A patient move from Sevilla ends with a half chance for Escudero. Banega, Ben Yedder and Correa combined to release Escudero on the left side of the box. He slid his left foot around the covering Kimmich to shoot wide of the far post. It wasn’t much of a chance, but the move was lovely. Banega has played some classy, penetrative passes tonight. 24 min “Evening Rob,” says Simon McMahon. “Is talking about ‘conversion rates’ a thing in football now too? Joe Root will be relieved.” They’ll be quantifying orgasms soon. 22 min Robben combines well with Kimmich, whose dangerous low cross is kicked away at the near post. It’s been an interesting first quarter, with plenty to keep Sevilla interested. 20 min The age of this Bayern side, and the relatively ponderous speed of their play, will interest Liverpool should they play each other in the semi-finals. 19 min Ribery wins a corner off Jesus Navas. Nah, nothing. 17 min Replays suggests that penalty appeal wasn’t particularly strong. It hit Boateng’s arm but it was tight to his body. 16 min Sevilla will be pleased with how much of the ball they are having. Bayern have started in second gear - and they almost pay for it when Correa knees Jesus Navas’s cross towards goal from 10 yards. It’s blocked by a defender and Correa is harshly penalised for fouling Ulreich on the rebound. That was a decent chance too, though it came at an awkward height for Correa, who didn’t have time to adjust his body. 15 min Sevilla appeal unsuccesfully for a penalty when Sarabia’s shot hits Boateng, possibly on the arm. That looked a quietly decent shout, though we haven’t seen a replay. 14 min Kimmich receives the ball on the right, Robbens infield onto his left foot and shoots wide from 25 yards. This is a pleasant, open game. 12 min “Robben cutting in from the right to shoot with his left, death and taxes,” says ‘Our’ Ian Copestake. 11 min: Great chance for Sevilla! Banega played a sharp angled pass into the area for Sarabia, who skipped smartly inside Rafinha to create a shooting chance - and then whacked it high and wide. 10 min A promising attack for Sevilla, with Correa’s cross booted clear from inside the six-yard box by Hummels. N’Zonzi, meanwhile, is booked for embedding his studs in Lewandowski’s foot. 9 min “Amazing that Bayern reached the semis seven times in nine seasons and they only have one trophy to show for it,” says David Brennan. “A very poor conversion rate. Germany under Low have fine trophy to show from five semi-finals (six if you count his Klinsmann assistance in 2006).” That’s what fascinates me about Real Madrid – they win as many European Cups as La Ligas, whereas Bayern/Guardiola/pretty much everyone else have nothing like the same ratio. 7 min Lewandowski strains his neck muscles to loop a header towards goal that is tipped over by Soria. A comfortable save. Bayern look like they can score whenever they want. 5 min Bayern are happy to let Sevilla have the ball and hit them on the break. Robben does just that, working the ball onto his left foot and curling a few yards wide of the far post. 4 min “My prediction,” says Marie Meyer. “Your inbox filled with Harry Kane jokes as soon as someone scores.” That really was a bit … odd, wasn’t it. 3 min James curls the free-kick just over the bar. 2 min Mercado is lucky to stay on the pitch after taking down Lewandowski 25 yards from goal. He was the last man and, though I’m probably missing something obvious, I can’t understand why he was only booked. It looked a clear goalscoring opportunity for a donkey, never mind Lewandowski. 2 min “I can’t hold it in any longer, Bobby my boy,” says Ian Copestake. “WE AE IN THE EFFING SEMI-FINALS!“ You a Roma fan, blud? 1 min Peep peep! Bayern, in red, get the match under way. Sevilla are in white. It’s nearly time for kick off. Any predictions? I can’t see comeback lightning striking twice: Bayern 4-1 Sevilla (agg: 6-2) I know this is old, but as we’re on the subject of old managers Sevilla are aiming to reach the semi-finals of this competition for the first time in their history. Bayern hope to do so for the seventh time in nine seasons. It’s hard to believe that, between 2001 and 2009, they didn’t reach the last four at all. Bayern Munich (possible 4-1-4-1) Ulreich; Kimmich, Boateng, Hummels, Rafinha; Javi Martinez; Robben, Muller, James Rodriguez, Ribery; Lewandowski. Substitutes: Starke, Wagner, Sule, Thiago Alcantara, Bernat, Rudy, Tolisso. Sevilla (4-2-3-1) Soria; Jesus Navas, Mercado, Lenglet, Escudero; N’Zonzi, Banega; Sarabia, Vazquez, Correa; Ben Yedder. Substitutes: Rico, Daniel Carrico, Pizarro, Muriel, Nolito, Arana, Ramirez. Referee William Collum. If you type “best football managers of all time” into Google, the first thing that comes up is a row of photos. There are 51 managers in total. Scroll across and you’ll see everyone from Sir Alex Ferguson to Bob Paisley; Arrigo Sacchi to Helenio Herrara; Sam Allardyce to Diego Maradona. Yep. Jupp Heynckes is not on the list. Nobody really talks about him as one of the great managers. He’s certainly not one for the hipsterati. He doesn’t talk in philosophies; he knows how to use a razor; and his hair looks like a Phil Leotardo tribute. But in six weeks’ time he could become only the third coach to win the European Cup three times, after Paisley and Harry Kane Carlo Ancelotti. He will be leaving Bayern at the end of this season, which in some cultures would be considered a good omen. Each time Heynckes has won the Champions League, he has left the club at the end of the season: Real Madrid sacked him in 1998, eight days after he won their first European Cup for 32 years, and he retired after winning the Treble with Bayern Munich in 2013. Bayern have not reached a Champions League final since he was replaced by Pep Guardiola. At the age of 72, having been persuaded out of retirement, Heynckes could become the oldest coach to win a Uefa club competition. The first job is to finish off Sevilla’s intrepid voyagers. Bayern lead 2-1 from the first leg in Spain and should go through, though Sevilla will take encouragement from a few different sources: Roma’s win last night, their own performance in the first leg, and their win at Old Trafford in the last 16. But Bayern are Bayern are Bayern. They have been in brutal form since Heynckes returned to the job in October – 28 wins, two draws, two defeats - and have just claimed their annual Bundesliga title with five games to spare. Heynckes is managing side are in his own image: old and underrated. All hail the geriatricos! Kick off is at 7.45pm."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"higher-education-network/2018/apr/13/why-are-students-faking-attendance-they-feel-cheated-by-the-system","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-13T06:30:30Z","webTitle":"Why are students faking attendance?

They feel cheated by the system","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"My university has introduced a new method of monitoring student progress, a digital apparatus for tracking class attendance. Instead of students putting their initials on a register, they tap their ID cards on a card reader. The lecturer then navigates the university website to retrieve the tally – which is far more cumbersome than glancing at a sheet of paper. But that’s not the worst problem with the new system. The digital attendance system is an educational software product, given a ridiculous tech startup-inspired name. It’s been bought in at considerable cost to the university to cover things like the installation of card readers in teaching rooms across the campus. Despite its high price, it has glaring flaws. It doesn’t seem to communicate with other software, like Moodle, the open-source learning platform that provides students with resources for their modules. There are disparities between the number of students registered on each module and the number this system says attend classes. This disempowers lecturers from properly monitoring attendance – especially that of the more elusive students. To make things worse, the system sometimes lists students as attending when they’re not. A technical glitch? Not this time. It turns out the system is open to abuse – by students. One colleague raised the issue in an email to members of the department, reporting that he arrived to start a class to discover a student tapping in and then leaving. Another responded: “This is definitely a thing. In fact, I’m fairly certain I’ve spotted individuals carrying a stack of other students’ IDs walking from class to class around the turn of the hour, tapping in for them.” Yet another colleague said he’d seen it happening in other departments. The system is also enabling universities to pull together a troubling amount of data on students, building a picture of their performance as individuals, and benchmarking it against peers with similar profiles. I don’t imagine students give much thought to the way this is used, any more than people who use Facebook do – though we may be witnessing that tide turning. Lecturers are concerned by the new system too. Colleagues are wondering what happens if class attendance drops off. Someone in the upper echelons of university management might argue that their teaching isn’t good enough to keep students’ attention, though these metrics are a weak proxy for student engagement. I’m talking about a minority of students abusing the system, but I still ask myself: what makes them behave that way? The trouble is, the student isn’t a customer, what they’re paying for is not a commodity and, in my view, that they’re having to pay for it is a con trick, a way of sucking private debt into the system to replace public funding. But if this is how the system treats them, this is what we’re going to get. When we discussed these issues at a departmental meeting, another colleague reported a conversation she’d had with a group of students hanging around outside in the cold who admitted they were skipping class. When she pointed out they were wasting the money they were borrowing to be there, they said they didn’t care because they were sure they were never going to pay it back.

Often following ultimatums, they are measured and regretful for the simple reason that even the most gung-ho leaders are painfully aware that conflict brings consequences that are hard to control, and that exultation and bitterness are two sides of the same coin, separated only by the experience of violence. At the outbreak of the first world war, Kaiser Wilhelm II attached himself to these ritual formalities, declaring: “With heavy heart I have been compelled to mobilise my army against a neighbour at whose side it has fought on many a battlefield. With genuine sorrow do I witness the end of a friendship, which Germany loyally cherished. We draw the sword with a clean conscience and clean hands.” But conflicts, and the language of propaganda attached to them, are coloured by the personality of leaders and by the nature of their regimes. This produces what Luis Veres, a researcher into the language of fascist Spain, memorably described as “lexical arsenals”. The lexical arsenal of Donald Trump has become wearily familiar in his time at the White House. Delivered usually on Twitter, it has long summoned up an image of a grandiose and unedited narcissistic id, in dialogue not with the US or the international community, but with cable television. Responding to a Russian warning that it would shoot down US missiles fired on Syria in response to the latest suspected gas attack on Douma, Trump railed: “Russia vows to shoot down any and all missiles fired at Syria. Get ready Russia, because they will be coming, nice and new and “smart!” You shouldn’t be partners with a Gas Killing Animal who kills his people and enjoys it!” The danger is not simply in the schoolyard language, but Trump’s signature sloppiness and lack of detail. Even if he is not (in his own mind at least) issuing a threat to target Russian forces directly, his tweet can be read like that with his “get ready Russia” and exultant gloating. Why all this matters is because in diplomacy – especially the diplomacy of war – the niceties of language are employed in defence of the legal status of armed conflict between states. What is said – and how it is said – matters when justifying the use of force. In Trump’s remarks, the appeal to international law and ethics emerges as nothing more than an expression of his personal outrage, and the dangerous diplomacy of “ya, boo, sucks”. Perhaps we should not be surprised by such comments from a political leader who has long ignored the counsel of his own lawyers, and for whom the world appears as a binary struggle, with those challenging him portrayed with nicknames and in the crudest terms of otherness. Most dangerous of all is how this message can be read both wilfully and in visceral terms in Moscow as a deliberate threat with no room for compromise, not least if there are Russian casualties in any US airstrikes on Syria. If a sense of escalation has been palpable in the past few days, first in the Russian threat to shoot down US missiles, then Trump’s knee-jerk response, what is clear is that in his tweet, Trump has dangerously widened the scope of the crisis, from frustration among the international community at Moscow’s shielding of Assad, to hinting at the possibility of a clash with Russia. That plays into deeper and darker themes of a competition between Putin and Trump – both thin-skinned populist nationalists who have vowed to make their countries “great again”. Two men with fragile egos who have each yoked to their national ambitions. What is abundantly clear is that in just over three dozen ill-conceived words, Trump has added a new a sense of peril to the war in Syria. • Peter Beaumont is a Guardian reporter and former Jerusalem correspondent"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"sport/2018/apr/11/chris-gregory-jake-sheaf-team-gb-commonwealth-games-beach-volleyball-semi-finals","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-11T14:34:33Z","webTitle":"Heart surgery, cold and no cash fail to curb England duo’s liking for sand","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/apr/11/chris-gregory-jake-sheaf-team-gb-commonwealth-games-beach-volleyball-semi-finals","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/apr/11/chris-gregory-jake-sheaf-team-gb-commonwealth-games-beach-volleyball-semi-finals","fields":{"headline":"Heart surgery, cold and no cash fail to curb England duo’s liking for sand","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The white sands and turquoise waters of Coolangatta on the southernmost tip of the Gold Coast are a long way from the ice-cold hangar at a Dorset school where Chris Gregory and Jake Sheaf usually play their beach volleyball. The pair have overcome severe financial strain, heart surgery and the freezing conditions of their training base but they are not in Australia to enjoy the weather, much as they might. Winning the bronze medal on Thursday against the New Zealand brothers Ben and Sam O’Dea would not only be the biggest victory of their career, it could prompt a meaningful change to the sport’s future in Britain. Beach volleyball is making its Commonwealth Games debut in Australia. When the next Games are held in Birmingham in 2022 there are 13 sports guaranteed a place, with beach volleyball among another 13 sports fighting for the four remaining spots. While Birmingham may not have such a stunning backdrop as the Gold Coast, London 2012 proved volleyball can draw the crowds on home shores, proving one of the hits of the Olympics when it was played on Horse Guards Parade. Gregory and Sheaf know an English medal could prompt Birmingham 2022 organisers, who decide which sports to include, to look kindly on beach volleyball. “I’m obviously biased,” Gregory said, “but the atmosphere, venue, crowd and everything they do around beach volleyball is incredible and it would only be an asset to a Commonwealth Games at home, so I hope we can keep it in. A medal for us would go a long way to convincing them. It was our goal coming here to give ourselves a chance to win a medal and we have done that. Of course it’s not gold but it’s always good to look at the positives.” Their semi-final was the Ashes on sand as the third seeds faced Australia, with the home nation ranked No 1. England won the first point but it was the only time they were ahead. Gregory, who at 6ft 9in is the tallest member of Team England, made several excellent blocks but Australia won the first set 21-13. Dancers dressed as lifeguards provided the entertainment between sets as Feeling Hot Hot Hot by the Merrymen blared around the arena but it did little to inspire an comeback. England called a time-out at 18-12 down in the second set and it briefly revived them as they got back to 18-15 but Australia’s class showed. “We wanted to do better,” Gregory said. “It’s been really tough just getting here. We’ve had a lot of ups and downs on and off the court but we knew we were going to face them.” To say they have faced obstacles on the route to the Gold Coast would be an understatement. Gregory was identified as part of the Sporting Giants programme, a nationwide talent search that began in 2007 with the London Olympics in mind. It counts the world champion rowers Helen Glover and Vicky Thornley among its alumni. Gregory did not make it to a home games but the scheme encouraged him to address an irregular heartbeat. “I kept having these episodes,” he has said. “During matches or training I’d get this fast heartbeat. I was aware but left it for a while but they kept getting worse. Eventually, they diagnosed it as supraventricular tachycardia.” He had heart surgery at Kings College hospital in London. “It was four hours on the operating table,” he said. “I was awake the whole time. There was a risk I’d need a pacemaker and that would have meant no sport at all but thankfully it went well.” While many athletes in Team England have a comfortable existence on UK Sport funding, Gregory and Sheaf have had to use industry and imagination, funding themselves for most of the last four-year cycle. Their rise up the world rankings, from outside the top 300 to 65th in the world by last March was enough to secure £40,000 of Sport England funding, which allowed them to compete internationally for the last year. For most of the year the duo, both 28, practise inside what is little more than a shed in the grounds of a school in Bournemouth, enduring freezing cold in the winter, a huge contrast to the Gold Coast heat. “This is an incredible arena,” Gregory said after the semi-final, “by far the best we’ve ever played in. We’re disappointed not to be in the final but it’s always good to reflect on what you’ve achieved and it’s not over yet.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/live/2018/apr/11/real-madrid-juventus-champions-league-quarter-final-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-11T20:49:46Z","webTitle":"Real Madrid 1-3 Juventus (agg: 4-3): Champions League quarter-final – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2018/apr/11/real-madrid-juventus-champions-league-quarter-final-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/live/2018/apr/11/real-madrid-juventus-champions-league-quarter-final-live","fields":{"headline":"Real Madrid 1-3 Juventus (agg: 4-3): Champions League quarter-final – as it happened","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Real have escaped into the semi-finals! Juventus hit three goals to cancel out the first-leg score and move to the brink of a sensational, historic triumph. But then Michael Oliver awarded a penalty following an untidy tackle by Benatia - but was it a foul? - and Ronaldo seized his moment. This tie will be talked about - argued about - for years. 90+9 min: Ronaldo gets a booking. And apparently several Italian journalists have been ejected from the Bernabeu press box after complaining about the remarkable late twist to this tie! Ronaldo, looking nerveless, steps up and guides a spotkick beyond Szczesny and into the top corner. Then he runs off and undresses with joy. Real are saved! Juve are disgusted. Juve substitution: Szczesny on, Higuain off. 90+2 min: It could be a while before the penalty gets taken. Juve have to introduce a goalkeeper - Szczesny - and the ref has to disperse players who are continuing to rail against his decision. The more replays that are shown, the less clear the penalty decision becomes. Benatia puts his hands momentarily on the Real player’s back and wrap his leg around him to try to get at the ball - but does he apply any force, or enough to justify the player’s fall? It’s a tough decision for the ref. I’d have waved away the penalty claims on the basis of an overall interpretation of justice in the game’s context. Michael Oliver has made a hugely contentious decision here! he showed a straight red card to Juve’s goalkeeper, who ran towards him to protest at the penalty decision, which was given against Benatia. Vazquez went down after being pushed from behind when Ronaldo nodded the ball back to him in front of goal 90 min: Benatia makes two rash challenges on half-way, almost forcing the ref to issue a yellow card. Ramos, by the way, is now sitting in the Real dugout minus his hat. Are they going to slip in to a jersey and try to sneak him on? That might work if they hadn’t made all their substitutes already. OK, it wouldn’t work. 89 min: Real are in charge in terms of territory now, but Juve are defending reasonably comfortably. They love this. And they know that if they can nick one more goal on the counter, Real will need to score twice... 88 min: Marcelo loops a useless cross into the box. Ronaldo tries to make something of it but jumps and falls to the ground like an uncoordinated pogo dancer. It’s as if last week never happened. 87 min: Carvajal curls a cross in from the right, much like Lichtsteiner’s delivery to Mandzukic in the first half. But Ronaldo is no Mandzukic tonight - he donks his header over the bar. 86 min: Pjanic takes the freekick quickly and tries to play in Mandzukic. but the Croat wasn’t expecting that move. 86 min: Vallejo booked for clattering into Higuain. Freekick to Juve from nearly 30 yards, dead centre. Pjanic has scored from here before ... 84 min: This is taut. Every challenge is intensely contested and both sides are thinking twice about taking risks that could prove fatal. 82 min: Juve relieve the pressure by finding Costa, who sprints past Marcelo before being hacked down by the Brazilian. An obvious yellow card. 80 min: The home crowd are becoming a little more buoyant, in response to a spell of pressure rom their team. Varane goes close when the ball breaks to him in the box and he sends a sidefooter just wide of the target. 79 min: Isco lets fly from 20 yards. Benatia tries to block but his deflection makes matters more difficult for Buffon, who springs to his right and touches the ball around the post! 78 min: Marcelo hares down the left but his cross is easily cleared at the near post by Benatia. 77 min: Ronaldo heads away Pjanic’s corner. 76 min: Sandro pumps the ball into the Real box rom the left. Real hastily whack it away. But it soon comes back and Juve have a corner ... Real substitution: Kovacic on, Modric off after he, too, had a quiet game. 74 min: Ronaldo scurries into the Juve box from the left wing. There is a forest of bodies in front of him but he essays a shot - and it’s deflected just wide. 72 min: Pjanic juggles with the ball in the centre circle before spinning away and setting up another attack. But Real win the ball back and start a counter, which Costa brings to an abrupt end by lunging at Asensio. That’s a deserved yellow card. 70 min: There is a lull, as both team consider their next moves. Question: if Juventus win this, does Ronaldo’s goal in the first leg become less great? 69 min: To answer a question posed by several of you: if the scores remain the same at 90 minutes, this tie will proceed to extra-time, and potentially a penalty shootout. You’d have to fancy the team with Buffon if it goes that far. 68 min: Freekick to Real in a dangerous position, a couple of yards outside the area and to the right. Ronaldo allows Asensio to do the honours and the younger man curls a shot several yards over the bar. 65 min: Alex Sandro booked 62 min: Real don’t seem to know quite what to do. Juve, in contrast, look very measured: they haven’t had to work up a storm to get back into this tie. Rather they have been controlled, attacking only at the right times and to devastating effect. 61 min: The camera keeps picking out Ramos, who is sitting in the posh seats with a smart hat. Real are almost visibly pining for him on the pitch. Unbelievable! Costa curled in a cross from the left. It should have been easy pickings for Navas but the goalkeeper dropped it at the feet of Matuidi, who didn’t pause to say thank you: he just flipped the ball into the net and wheeled away to celebrate with ecstatic team-mates! This is historic! 59 min: Modric loses possession in his own half. Matuidi begins a Juve attack, which culminates with Higuain having a shot on the swivel from 20 yards. It lacks power but still demands an awkward save from Navas. 57 min: After a spell of slow possession lay by Real, Vazquez bursts own the right wing and picks out Ronaldo with a low pass. Ronaldo fires off a low shot from the edge of the area. Buffon gets down to save. It has, by the way, been seven years since since Real failed to score at home in a European match. 55 min: A sloppy pass by Matuidi gives the ball to Real, who have a chance to break forward. But they do not commit many players to the attack, such is their wariness. The move peters out. 54 min: Carvajal goes down holding his nose, trying to fool the referee into believing he’s been elbowed in the gob by Mandzukic, who, in reality, merely brushed against him with a fair shoulder challenge. The referee awards a freekick. Even that seems severe. 53 min: Ronaldo tries to take charge of matters all by himself. He goes on a run that that takes him into the Juve box. He nudges the ball past the last defender and goes around him to collect it. but Chiellini gets a cross to block the shot at the expense of a corner. 51 min: The crowd are becoming increasingly edgy - because Real’s players appear to be. They keep giving the ball away. “I’m stuck in an airport that must be the only place in the world not showing this game, Paul” frets Justin Kavanagh. “If Juventus do pull off The Miracle in Madrid, it is your solemn duty to describe the look on Ronaldo’s puss as he walks off. There will be a wibbly lower lip, at least!” I’m assuming you’re in Madrid airport, right? 48 min: Costa collects a pass to feet and dart past Marcelo, who dived in. He bears down on the box and then decides to unload with a left-footer from 20 yards. But he skies it. 47 min: Asesnsio skips down the left and plays in Vazquez, who ties to glide past Chiellini in the box. But Juve’s defence stands firm. “Looking at this potential comeback, I can’t help but think of Marca’s gleeful front page from this morning, with both Barca and Pep labelled as ‘total failures’,” notes Shaun Wilkinson. “What do you think they are going to go with tomorrow if Juve get one more?” Traffic news? 46 min: Zidane is not about to tolerate what happened in the first half. He’s made two changes for the second: Vazquez and Asensio on, Bale and Casemiro off. The first half completely passed Bale by and he’s not being given a chance to make amends. Here are Real’s biggest ever home defeats in Europe’s premier competition. Juve are going to have to inflict a record beating: 2-4 v Bayern Munich in 2000. 1-3 v Spartak Moscow in 1991 At half-time Juve are two-thirds of the way to an outlandish comeback! They have not dominated in the way that Roma did against Barcelona last night but they have played smart and taken their chances emphatically. Mandzukic is tormenting Real’s defenders in the air and will fancy his chances of bagging a hat-trick: the biggest question, probably, is whether Juve can stop Real from scoring. We have ourselves a bona fide cliffhanger! 45 +1 min: Ronaldo slips out on the left wing. Chiellini spots an opportunity to nick the ball but Ronaldo puts his body in front of it and wins a freekick. Kross curls it in. Varane jumps to get a header to it from seven yards .. and the ball canons back off the crossbar! 44 min: Isco leads a break forward. after scampering for 40 yards he nips a pass in to Ronaldo at the left-hand corner of the Juve box. Ronaldo shakes and shimmies but that don’t impress Benatia much: the Moroccan steps in and relives the Portuguese of the ball. He’ll be aiming to reprise that at this summers World Cup. 42 min: Juve rumble forward again. Khedira tries to thread a cute pass through to Mandzukic, but Varane reads it and intercepts well. “Wonder how much this game will be decided by subtitutes,” parps Alexander Scrutton. “While Juventus do not really have much firepower of the bench other than maybe Cuadrado, Madrid have got players such as Asensio, Vazquez and Benzema. Could they decide the game?” Yes, they could. But will they? At the moment the key from a Real viewpoint is that Ramos is missing: without him Real’s defence look extremely fragile in the air, certainly no match for Mandzukic. 39 min: Marcelo sends a cross over from the left but he’s put too much power on it and it rolls out for a throw-in on the far side. By the way, I should probably point out that Bale has exerted very little influence on proceedings so far. He’s not a first-choice starter at Real any more and he’s not exactly taking the chance to re-establish himself here. So far. It’s on! And what a routine goal it was for such an extraordinary scenario. Lichtsteiner curled over a cross from the right and Mandzukic leapt above Carvajal at the far post and nodded into the net from six yards! 35 min: Lichtsteiner booked for pulling down Ronaldo as the forward to roll away from him and go on a run. 34 min: As the Juve defence stops and appeals for offside, Isco ruins on to a pass from Kroos and finds himself one-on-one with Buffon .... and the goalkeeper makes a splendid save! 33 min: Isco lifts a shot over the bar from 12 yards. Another goal for Juve would make this very interesting indeed, but Real are looking the more likely scorers now. 32 min: Casemiro wins possession in midfield and threads a nice low pass to Isco inside the area. Isco thinks about trying to dribble around Benatia but then knocks the ball back to Kroos at the edge of the area. The German’s shot is blocked by Chiellini. 30 min: Mandzukic booked for clipping Carvajal. It looked clumsy rather than a malicious reprisal for the Spaniard’s tackle on him a couple of minutes ago. Kroos floats in the freekick from the right. It’s headed out to the left, where Marcelo arrives and tries to smash a half-volley into the top corner, missing by a couple of feet. 28 min: Juve are pressing vigorously but Real are slick enough to be able to play their way out. This is becoming more comparable to the City-Liverpool game than Roma-Barça. 25 min: The tempo has dropped a tad because Real are curbing Juve’s vivacity. Having said that, Pjanic has just won the ball back in midfield to instigate another counter-attack. But Real regroup and snuff it out pronto. “Swap Barça for Real and Roma for Juve and just copy &amp; paste from last night’s mbm,” suggests Val. But that would entail making Messi and Ronaldo synonymous, thus triggering a war. 22 min: Mandzukic goes down clutching his ankle after being caught late by Carvajal, who cops a yellow card from Michael Oliver. 19 min: Ronaldo draws a foul from Benatia to five Real a freekick mid-way inside the Juve half. The home team have established a measure of control after Juve early blitz, but how they’d like to capitalise on that and score. 18 min: “Football,” says Moustafa Meligy via email. Thanks Moustafa, good point. Juve substitution: Lichtsteiner on, De Sciglio off. Presumably that change is due to injury, although there was no obvious sign that De Sciglio was struggling, apart from wounded pride after Ronaldo nutmegged him in the opening seconds. 17 min: Pjanic booked for pulling back Isco to abort a Real counter-attack. 16 min: A Juve corner is flicked on by Khedira at the front post. It falls to the feet of Mandzukic, three yards out! But the striker was taken by surprise and can’t adjust his feet quickly enough to do anything other than turn it goalwards softly, and straight at Navas. 14 min: Kroos zips a pass in to Ronaldo at the left-hand corner of the box. Ronaldo ducks and twists to fool two defenders and create just enough chance for a shot, which he bangs in low and hard. Buffon gets down to save. Isco nudges the rebound into the net - but he was fractionally offside. Hats off the linesman for keeping up: this game is unfolding at a breathless pace. 12 min: Chiellini makes a super last-ditch intervention to deprive Isco of the chance of tapping the ball into the net from close range after another sweeping Real attack. 10 min: Ronaldo backheels a pass to Modric, who does a stepover in the box before flipping it on to Bale. The Welshman, arriving at speed, takes a touch before trying to poke it past Buffon, who saves well with his feet. Bale tries to convert the rebound with a backheel lob - naturellement - but it hits the sidenetting. Real have woken up! 9 min: Bale goes on a gallop for the first time, charging down the right. He chops back on to his left foot and sends a high ball to the far side of the box, where Ronaldo retrieves it. He unloads a shot from 18 yards but it’s blocked. 8 min: Costa pounces on a mistake by Varane and charges down the right wing again. He sends over a low cross that Navas palms towards Higuain, who slides and tries to send it goalward. but he can’t lift it above the recovering keeper. 6 min: Costa releases De Sciglio again. The cross is badly over-hit this time. But Juve are wreaking havoc down the right, where Marcelo is regularly outnumbered. Zidane will have to sort that out if the players don’t do something about it themselves. 5 min: De Sciglio curls another vicious cross in from the right. But this one is a tad too long for Mandzukic. 3 min: Juve storm forward again. Real are rattled! But they recover enough wherewithal to scramble the ball away. But the way Juve have started suggests they’ll be banging on the door again in no time. Well, well, well! That’s a lovely goal and a dream start for Juve! Costa created it with a dash down the right and a pass to Khedira, who floated a dainty cross to the back post. Mandzukic jumped to guide an expert header into the net from five yards. Game on!? 1 min: Real get the game going. And Ronaldo’s first touch is a nutmeg on De Sciglio. He’s merciless. While Real are wearing their familiar great white kit, Juve are clad in all yellow. It’s like watching Leeds home v Leeds away. The teams enter the arena and see a giant banner of a shark being held aloft by Real fans. Th slogan emblazoned above it? “Great White”. And there was Benjamin Mendy lamenting the elimination of the “shark team”. 10 managers* have won the European Cup/Champions League two years in succession. No one has done it three years in a row (though Bob Paisley and Carlo Ancelotti do have a trio of victories to their name). Zinédine Zidane is aiming to make history. And still there is legitimate debate as to whether he’s a very good manager, let alone a great one. (* apart from Zidane, they are Brian Clough, Bob Paisley, Dettmar Cramer, Stefan Kovacs, Arrigo Sacchi, Bela Guttman, Heleno Herrera, Luis Carniglia and José Villalonga, although Harry Kane is claiming to have been the decisive influence over Real Madrid’s victories in 1956 and 57) Vallejo comes in for the suspended Sergio Ramos, while Gareth Bale gets a start ahead of Benzema. Ronaldo apparently didn’t fancy being rested. as for Juve, with Dybala out because of last weeks red card, Mandzukic comes in. Real: Navas; Carvajal, Varane, Vallejo, Marcelo; Kroos, Casemiro, Modric, Isco; Ronaldo, Bale Subs: Casilla, Benzema, Hernandez, Vazquez, Llorente, Asensio, Kovacic Juventus: Buffon; De Sciglio, Benatia, Chiellini, Alex Sandro; Khedira, Pjanic, Matuidi; Costa, Higuain, Mandzukic Subs: Szczesny, Cuadrado, Marchisio, Asamoah, Rugani, Lichtsteiner, Stuaro Referee: M Oliver (Northumberland) Hello and welcome. Juventus got some compatriots do their team-talk for them last night, but will Roma’s performance inspire them today to what would be an even more extraordinary comeback than the one produced by Eusebio Di Franceso’s men against Barcelona? Real Madrid may be 15 points behind their Catalan chums in the Spanish league but they have looked a more complete side in recent months, at least in the Champions League. What is more, unlike Barça, Real are at home in the second leg. Juventus have twice been crowned kings of Europe, and have been runners-up twice in the last three years, but overturning a three-goal deficit at the Bernabeu today will probably require a performance to surpass any the club has previously produced. Real, then, are a step away from an eighth Champions League semi-final in a row. They are already favourites to win the tournament this year, which would be a fourth coronation in five seasons – which would be quite ridiculous bearing in mind that the Champions League is Europe’s most open league. And how satisfying it would be for Cristiano Ronaldo, in particular, if Real completed their progress to the last four today: the best player in the world practically ensured Real’s progress with that outrageous overhead kick in Turin, a week before Lionel Messi went to Italy and failed to find a way of his hotel room. Ronaldo turned 33 years old on February 5 - in the 10 matches he has played since then, he has scored 20 goals."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"money/shortcuts/2018/apr/12/that-friday-feeling-should-weekend-start-day-earlier","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-12T05:30:23Z","webTitle":"That Friday feeling: should the weekend start a day earlier?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/shortcuts/2018/apr/12/that-friday-feeling-should-weekend-start-day-earlier","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/shortcuts/2018/apr/12/that-friday-feeling-should-weekend-start-day-earlier","fields":{"headline":"That Friday feeling: should the weekend start a day earlier?","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"In the Routledge guide British Civilization, the weekend is defined as “Saturday and Sunday” – but try telling that to anyone who has ordered a takeaway as they are leaving the office on a Friday so that it arrives as they get home, or has gone three Woo Woos deep into the Friday happy-hour deal at a Be At One. We all know the weekend really starts at some point on Friday, but when exactly? BBC Radio 1 has announced that it is going to start the weekend at 6.30am on Friday, by moving all its weekend hosts on to three days a week, creating “a four-day week and a three-day weekend”. One of the big winners from the decision is Mollie King from girlband the Saturdays, who will now host on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays. Explaining the decision, Ben Cooper, the station’s controller, said: “Fridays are different from the rest of the week. You are in a better mood. You are planning how to have fun.” If you have tried to organise an important meeting after lunch on a Friday, you will know that most workers have checked out mentally by then. Studies suggest that productivity and output on Fridays is significantly reduced, with one arguing that we are in weekend mode by 10.19am. Many companies acknowledge this by offering dress-down Fridays, giving out free booze in the afternoon or allowing employees to leave earlier during the summer. Where does it stop, though? If no one is going to take Fridays seriously, maybe we should take them off completely. The Labour party has hinted loosely that it may start fiddling with the working week, with Jeremy Corbyn talking about the “gateway to a new settlement between work and leisure” in response to the growth of automation. The problem is this: if we all followed Radio 1’s example and made the official weekend three days long, people would just start bunking off on Thursday afternoons. Far better for Friday to be an illicit day of sort-of-work and for King’s radio show to be broadcast on only two days of the week."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"technology/2018/apr/11/mark-zuckerberg-congress-testimony-five-questions-ask-facebook-ceo","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-11T13:42:45Z","webTitle":"Five questions Mark Zuckerberg should be asked by Congress","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/apr/11/mark-zuckerberg-congress-testimony-five-questions-ask-facebook-ceo","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2018/apr/11/mark-zuckerberg-congress-testimony-five-questions-ask-facebook-ceo","fields":{"headline":"Five questions Mark Zuckerberg should be asked by Congress","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"1) You’re abusing your power as a global monopoly.

Pivot to rodeo Nothing says “I went to Nashville for a fortnight now I think I’m Dolly Parton” quite like a “country”-inspired comeback album. Kylie, Miley Cyrus and Lady Gaga have all used Nashville recently. Soundbites about Nashville’s history provide great source material for promo interviews, despite the fact that recording studios in Nashville are pretty much like recording studios anywhere else in the world: if you give them money, they let you in. Fearne Cotton could miraculously discover her authentic country roots if she chucked enough cash around. Who’s next If you see Dua Lipa on Skyscanner, grab her laptop and chuck it out of the window. The bait and switch None of us want our favourite pop personnel to just keep making the same album for ever (newsflash: actually we kind of do), but some shifts in sonic direction are pop’s equivalent of a handbrake turn. This can be an act who’ve achieved popularity through electronic pop music “going real” (as on Pet Shop Boys’ Release, Goldfrapp’s Seventh Tree, the Harry Styles album or Gaga’s Joanne) but, less testingly, this move can sometimes involve a semi-famous, semi-peripheral artist waking up one morning and thinking, as Nelly Furtado did with Maneater, that it’s time to have a massive No 1 single. Who’s next On the Maneater front, Janelle Monáe’s just teamed up with the writers behind Justin Bieber’s Sorry and is clearly not messing about. The greatest latest hits Streaming means the conventional greatest hits album is dead for artists who don’t shift most of their music via supermarkets, but the streaming world’s constant thirst for one-off single releases can result in a massive backlog of hits that don’t seem to belong to an album. By the time an album does eventually appear, it’s at least 50% smash. Who’s next It’s almost four years since Clean Bandit released an album. There have been five hits – including two No 1s – since then, but the band’s second album hasn’t yet been announced. The definitely-not-an-album album Charli XCX’s last album came out in 2014. Or did it? In the last year she’s actually released two albums, except they’re not albums because they’re mixtapes. The songs aren’t mixed together. The album-length collections are for sale, like albums. XCX recently said that one liberating thing about making a mixtape is that it’s easier to get guest vocalists – labels don’t get their contractual knickers in a twist if they’re not dealing with a “proper” project. It’s a decent marketing angle, too: mixtapes are taken less seriously than albums by most over-35s but they’re greeted more enthusiastically, and are seen as more authentic blasts of creativity by their target audience. Who’s next Stefflon Don’s about to follow up her 2016 mixtape Real Ting. The new one’s called Real Ting II. Guys! This is the real me! Anyone who’s enjoyed a hit album before their 18th birthday will at some point be keen to point out that they’re actually very musical and interesting. The modern queen of “Guys! This is the real me!” has to be Miley Cyrus, who in a six-album career has presented her definitive self no fewer than six times: with 2007’s Hannah Montana 2: Meet Miley Cyrus (which braced a generation for the news that Miley was an actual human), 2008’s Breakout (she was breaking out from Hannah!), 2010’s Can’t Be Tamed (which presented that old favourite – the More Mature Direction), 2013’s Bangerz (no hang on, this was the more mature direction), 2015’s Miley Cyrus &amp; Her Dead Petz (Christ knows what that was), and last year’s “pivot to rodeo” masterpiece Younger Now. Who’s next Miley Cyrus."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"environment/2018/apr/13/have-you-changed-your-opinion-on-climate-change-share-your-experiences","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-13T11:26:32Z","webTitle":"Have you changed your opinion on climate change?

He was also a poet and collaborated with a number of French contemporaries, translating the work of André Frénaud and Louise Herlin. Peter was born in Melton Mowbray, Leicestershire, to Walter Broome, a warehouseman, and his wife, Lily (nee Jepson). He attended the town’s King Edward VII grammar school and after a BA and a PhD in French at Nottingham University, in 1962 was appointed to a lectureship in French at Monash University in Australia. He returned to the UK in 1966 to take up a post in the French department at Queen’s University Belfast, where I had the good fortune to be one of his undergraduates and where he remained until his retirement, as a professor of French, in 2002. For generations of students at Queen’s, Peter was a passionate and devoted teacher. Standing in class with a volume of French poetry as his only prompt, he would deliver inspirational lectures on Baudelaire, Mallarmé and Rimbaud. His attentiveness as a reader extended to his marking of students’ work, and undergraduate translations and essays would invariably be returned with copious marginal comments and corrections, beautifully crafted and pointing to a close and generous engagement with his students. He was also admired by colleagues for his professionalism and loyalty – and for what one of them, in a preface to a collection of studies and poems in Peter’s honour published in 2005, called “his magnificent example over the years”. He was a regular participant in the annual French departmental play and relished the team work that came with it. Beyond university life, Peter and his wife, Di (nee Walker), a nurse, whom he had met at school and married in 1959, were keen ballroom dancers. He spoke of that pastime with the same zest and seriousness that he brought to his work as an academic and teacher. On retirement he continued to publish extensively. He and Di moved to rural Burgundy for a number of years, living in what had been Frénaud’s home, before later returning to Britain. He is survived by Di and by their two sons, Jeremy and Tim."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"science/2018/apr/12/tests-on-captain-cooks-sweet-potato-fuels-row-over-how-crop-reached-polynesia","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-12T16:00:12Z","webTitle":"Tests on Captain Cook's sweet potato fuel row over how crop reached Polynesia","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/apr/12/tests-on-captain-cooks-sweet-potato-fuels-row-over-how-crop-reached-polynesia","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2018/apr/12/tests-on-captain-cooks-sweet-potato-fuels-row-over-how-crop-reached-polynesia","fields":{"headline":"Tests on Captain Cook's sweet potato fuel row over how crop reached Polynesia","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The sweet potato is ubiquitous enough to seem almost mundane – but its origins have long been shrouded in mystery. Now scientists say they have solved the puzzle, in the process scotching the idea that people in the Americas were in touch with Polynesians before the Europeans turned up in the New World in the 15th century. The research reveals that the sweet potato evolved just once, probably in central or northern South America, and originated from a single ancestor. What’s more, an analysis of part of a 250-year-old sweet potato plant collected during Captain Cook’s voyage to the South Pacific on HMS Endeavour suggests the spuds arrived in Polynesia by means of ocean currents. “I think we have proved that there is no need to claim human transportation of the sweet potato across the Pacific – there is much more powerful evidence for naturally driven dispersal,” said Pablo Muñoz-Rodríguez, a PhD student and first author of the research from the University of Oxford. It’s the latest blow to the theory of early contact between Polynesians and the Americas: researchers looking at chicken DNA have recently dismissed the idea that the birds travelled across the ocean aboard vessels from the South Pacific islands, hundreds of years before Columbus, although the findings have been hotly disputed. To delve into the sweet potato’s past, Muñoz-Rodríguez and colleagues analysed genetic material from almost 200 specimens of the plant and its 14 closely related wild species to reconstruct a sort of “family tree”. The results reveal that the sweet potato is more closely related to one wild species, known as Ipomoea trifida, than any other, suggesting that both evolved from a common ancestor. “All the evidence points to Ipomoea trifida being the only species with a role in the origin of the sweet potato,” said Muñoz-Rodríguez. The team add that this branch in the family tree occurred long before humans walked the Earth, with one estimate putting it at least 800,000 years ago. Moreover, the analysis suggests the sweet potato interbred with Ipomoea trifida at some point within 56,000 years of the two species evolving from their common ancestor. The research, published in the journal Current Biology, also unpicks the longstanding mystery of how sweet potatoes cropped up in Polynesia before the Europeans set foot in the Americas, where the plant evolved. While some have suggested that the plant’s presence points to communication between inhabitants of the two regions, the latest study suggests it is more likely that seeds of the sweet potato simply floated across the Pacific on sea currents. That, they write, is backed up by the fact that a wild relative of the sweet potato found in Polynesia, but not America, appears to have split from American species more than a million years ago – ruling out human transport. The seed pods of this plant, the authors note, are very similar to those of sweet potatoes, suggesting that it, too, could have travelled around the world on the waves. Further evidence for the idea came from a sweet potato plant collected by the naturalist Joseph Banks during Captain Cook’s voyage to Polynesia in 1769. “[It is] the oldest sweet potato specimen known from Polynesia,” said Muñoz-Rodríguez. This variety is only found in Polynesia, but the genetic data shows that it split from its closest relative, an American variety, more than 100,000 years ago – long before modern humans colonised the islands. “It removes the last remaining potential evidence for contact,” said Prof Alan Cooper, director of the Australian Centre for Ancient DNA, who was not involved in the study. “Of course, that doesn’t mean that no contact occurred – just that there is no evidence for the idea.” But others said questions remain. Prof Lisa Matisoo-Smith from the University of Otago noted that the study looks at just one historical sweet potato sample whose DNA might have degraded over time, and said the study ignores linguistic evidence of contact between the populations. “I think given the nature of the likely contact – being sporadic, small scale and of limited duration (and likely only contact made by men) – that the evidence is going to be patchy and minimal,” she said. “That doesn’t mean that it didn’t happen.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/apr/11/many-reasons-to-be-grateful-to-bristol-tobacco-women","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-11T16:59:22Z","webTitle":"Many reasons to be grateful to Bristol’s tobacco women | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/apr/11/many-reasons-to-be-grateful-to-bristol-tobacco-women","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/apr/11/many-reasons-to-be-grateful-to-bristol-tobacco-women","fields":{"headline":"Many reasons to be grateful to Bristol’s tobacco women","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Jane Nation (Letters, 9 April) gives proper attention to the thousands of women workers who fuelled the success of WD &amp; HO Wills in their Bristol tobacco company, providing the profits for which Bristol University can be thankful. In fact the Wills family ploughed money into a number of much-valued public and civic projects in the city, including Bristol Museum and the zoo, as well as charitable institutions such as sheltered housing schemes for older people across the city. However, the city is squeamish about celebrating the contribution that the tobacco industry (it was not just the Wills company) and its workers made to the city’s economic prosperity and growth from the late 19th century until Imperial Tobacco’s massive Hartcliffe factory closed in the 1990s. The city’s museums make very little mention of tobacco and its impact on working families and whole communities in south Bristol. The official reticence may be about indirect links with an agriculture which was built on slavery in the US, or about the health impact of tobacco consumption: either way you could easily never know that much of Bristol’s wealth was the result of the tobacco industry. If the city won’t recognise these facts, the community can. An oral history project in 2013/14 produced a fascinating collection of stories, mainly from women workers, who recorded both the hard work and sometimes harsh conditions in the Wills factories in Bedminster and Ashton, but also the social benefits and community value which workers derived from the firm. The project culminated in a book, Bedminster’s Tobacco Women, which celebrates their stories and makes some redress for their lack of recognition in the city. Helen Thomas Bedminster Tobacco Women Project • Jane Nation says Bristol University provided “the education of privileged students from upper-middle-class backgrounds”. My father and I both attended the university. He was the son of a small farmer and a village shopkeeper and was one of the first children from his village to obtain a secondary education, let alone university. After his first year he had to apply to a hardship fund to continue his course. Thanks to his education, my background was more privileged but hardly upper middle class. Only a few of my contemporaries at Bristol could have been categorised thus. Nonetheless I am grateful to the hard-working Bristolian women and girls who enabled our education. Hilary Johnson Malvern, Worcestershire • According to friends who worked at WD &amp; HO Wills in the 1960s and 70s, the effect of inhaling the fumes of shredded tobacco necessitated many and urgent toilet trips, so having to ask permission was a cynical company ploy to discourage shirking. Luckier than my friends, I was one of very few Bristol working-class students at the Wills-funded Bristol University at the time and wonder how many children with local or Caribbean origins the university has admitted since – there doesn’t seem to be much evidence of them these days. Reckon their presence would be better than a plaque for acknowledging their ancestors’ input.

However, while elsewhere in the Etihad Stadium Pep Guardiola was combusting and getting himself sent to a padded seat, Jürgen Klopp was silent. He had a victory against the finest team in the land to plot. Klopp the gurning, manic cheerleader is an image the Liverpool manager regrettably accepts he cannot shake but, as Virgil van Dijk said before the second leg: “He is much more than that.” Another demonstration that teams do not reach the last four of European football’s elite competition on pure emotion was served at half-time at the Etihad. Klopp initially let his players do the talking, or the shouting in Dejan Lovren’s case. “I told the lads to wake up because it was not good enough and I said we were sitting too deep,” the centre-back said after one of the most commanding matches of his Liverpool career. His manager listened, waited for order to descend on the dressing room and began his tactical instructions for the second half with some pointed advice for Lovren. “Yes, we are sitting too deep,” Klopp said, “because you are not pushing up.” Lovren elaborated: “He wanted me and Virgil to be more compact and push the team up but it was quite difficult to push up when City had the ball. It was all positive, nothing negative, but I needed to remind the guys we had 50 minutes to be in the semi‑finals of the Champions League and we needed to give more. The first 10-15 minutes wasn’t good enough. “When you see the second half, again they had a couple of chances but nothing too serious. We did much better in the second half – we were higher, we were much more compact and we were better organised defensively.” City, without their conductor on the sidelines for guidance, still managed seven attempts on goal in the second half – 13 in the first – but found no way to add to Gabriel Jesus’s second-minute opener. Liverpool had three after half-time and converted two. Klopp’s team were evidently more clinical in both games but also more disciplined, organised and mature. They had luck, too, especially between the 41st and 42nd minutes of the second leg when Bernardo Silva struck a post and Leroy Sané’s tap-in was wrongly disallowed for offside, changing the complexion of the tie and that of the City manager. In a contest billed as the calm, brilliant precision of the Premier League champions-elect versus the ferocity of Klopp’s attacking game, it was Liverpool who displayed the former, and more besides. Had they beaten the runaway leaders of the Spanish or German league 5-1 on aggregate there might be wider recognition of what Liverpool’s European Cup-winning captain Phil Thompson called “one of the great European results in our history”. As Lovren put it: “When you concede one goal and score five against Manchester City, I think we should respect Liverpool more.” Liverpool are unbeaten and the highest scoring team in this season’s competition. The versatility they displayed over two legs against Guardiola’s side also bodes extremely well for what lies ahead on the road towards the final in Kiev. Roberto Firmino and Sadio Mané dropped deep and wide to create a five-man midfield as the visitors regained their composure and executed Klopp’s second-half gameplan to perfection. His defence, as per the instruction to Lovren and Van Dijk, were far more compact. Encouragingly for Klopp, the shape of his team changed around the half-hour mark as players took responsibility for combating City’s breathless approach. “It was a difficult situation for us in the second minute but I was calm,” Lovren said of Jesus’s early goal. “If I’m not calm then we have a big problem. We talked on the pitch, a few of us, and said: ‘We need to keep our heads and stick together because this is a crucial moment and if we are not calm we will concede another one.’ We had luck, we had luck in a couple of moments to be honest, but when you look over the two games we have been brave and when you are brave the luck goes with you.” Lovren looked forward to next season in the aftermath of Liverpool’s third consecutive victory over City – Klopp’s eighth win in 14 matches against Guardiola – and said the Premier League title race will be much closer. “It was weird this season because we didn’t catch up well from the beginning,” he said. “I’m definitely confident that next season we can push everyone, even ourselves to do better, from the beginning to the end.” Next season can wait. Europe is again full of possibilities for Liverpool, improving Liverpool, in the present. The Croat added: “The competition is wide open and anything is possible now. From a personal point of view I don’t want Real Madrid in the semi-finals. They have a lot of experience in the Champions League, a lot of records and over the past three seasons it is always them, but whoever we get will find it difficult to come to Anfield and score.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"film/2018/apr/13/scream-for-me-sarajevo-review","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-13T11:00:36Z","webTitle":"Scream for Me Sarajevo review – rock stars recall unwitting gig in war zone","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/apr/13/scream-for-me-sarajevo-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/apr/13/scream-for-me-sarajevo-review","fields":{"headline":"Scream for Me Sarajevo review – rock stars recall unwitting gig in war zone","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"In 1994, Iron Maiden frontman Bruce Dickinson got a call from a bloke at the UN in Bosnia – fancy popping over to do a gig in Sarajevo? Being a bit foggy on the details of the war and the hell-on-Earth siege of Sarajevo, then in its third year, he said: “Yeah, why not.” An entertaining whiff of Spinal Tap hangs over Dickinson’s anecdotes about his semi-clueless road trip to Sarajevo in this music documentary – an interesting if minor footnote in the history of both the Bosnian war and heavy metal. Interviewed now, Dickinson (who these days looks more rugby club than rock’n’roll) pokes fun at his shambolic schlep across a war zone with Skunkworks, a couple of musicians he’d been recording with. When the armoured helicopter they were expecting didn’t turn up they bummed a lift to Sarajevo in the back of a van, with a couple of sleeping bags and two crates of beer to keep warm. Slightly surreally, the gig was pulled together by an awfully posh ruddy-faced British major, now retired, interviewed here as if dressed for a shooting party in tweeds and a corduroy waistcoat. The band’s reminiscences are deeply felt as well as comical. But the doc belongs to the Bosnian metalheads at the gig, now in their 30s and 40s. As teenagers during the siege, every day they were convinced they were going to die. In photos taken at the gig their faces are wild with energy and life. Dickinson’s bassist remembers a musician from the young Bosnian support act asking if he’d brought any drugs with him. Some heroin maybe? Err, no. Drugs are bad for your health. Matter of factly, the guy told him that, with most of his friends dead, “my life expectancy is pretty short already.” • This article was amended on 15 May, to clarify that the Dickinson band that played Sarajevo in 1994 was called Skunkworks, not Iron Maiden (as said in a subheading, due to an editing error), and to correct the rank of the British soldier interviewed in the film from general to major."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"artanddesign/2018/apr/14/big-picture-new-york-racial-divide-1960s","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-14T17:00:27Z","webTitle":"The big picture: Window Nurses, NYC, 1966","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/apr/14/big-picture-new-york-racial-divide-1960s","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2018/apr/14/big-picture-new-york-racial-divide-1960s","fields":{"headline":"The big picture: Window Nurses, NYC, 1966","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"When Mario Carnicelli landed in New York in 1966 and saw the city’s skyline, it brought to mind “Edward Hopper, Elia Kazan’s On the Waterfront, the notes of Gershwin – it seemed as if Humphrey Bogart would appear at any moment from a side street,” he remembers. He had won a photography competition in Italy at the age of 29 and the prize was a trip to America. “It was a dream.” Once there, however, reality intruded on this fantasy: the restaurants all produced the same nauseating smell and there was a sense of loneliness. “As a European, you imagined all this enormous wealth, but walking around there was also a lot of poverty.” Influenced by the humanist approach of New Deal photographers such as Dorothea Lange, Carnicelli focused his lens not on the skyscrapers but on what was happening at street level: on commuters, builders, shopkeepers, passersby. This photograph, showing a man walking past a shop window full of white nurses’ outfits, was taken in the outskirts of New York. Malcolm X had been assassinated the year before and race relations were “practically nonexistent – you could see a clear difference in the way [African American and white] people acted”. The moment was captured by chance. Carnicelli had been struck by the mannequins in the display when the man just happened to pass by, but, he feels, he “tells you everything with his eyes, his clothes, his way of moving. You understand immediately who he is, where he’s from, where he wants to go.” Carnicelli retired from photography in the 1970s to run his own business and the images from the trip – depicting Chicago, Detroit, Boston, Dallas – lay untouched in a cellar for almost 50 years until they were discovered again last year by curator Bärbel Reinhard. When they were first exhibited in Milan in the 1960s, the working title was I’m Sorry, America. He explains: “I’m sorry, America, but this is how I saw you. I thought you’d be better than my dream. The dream remains, but my outlook was a critical one.” American Voyage: Photographs by Mario Carnicelli will be on show from 20 April to 8 June at David Hill Gallery, London W1.

He did not appear with the group on that year’s Christmas tour, but returned to the stage in July 2017.

Matley had been due to perform a skydive in aid of the Royal Marsden hospital in Chelsea, where he had received pioneering treatment, on 4 May. His fundraising campaign has raised in excess of £5,000. On his JustGiving page, launched in January, Matley wrote: “My latest scans look really positive, with most of the cancer in regression, and I’ve got my fingers crossed that when I have my next full scan at Christmas, I will be diagnosed NED (no evidence of disease).” The Overtones, comprised of Matley, Mike Crawshaw, Mark Franks, Darren Everest and Lachie Champman, are a platinum-selling doo-wop vocal harmony group.

The record has sold more than 500,000 copies. The Overtones have released five albums, often incorporating covers of popular standards. Their last release was Good Ol’ Fashioned Christmas in November 2015, which reached No 24 on the UK album chart.

The raid on the offices of 21st Century Fox’s subsidiary Fox Network Group, which has its European headquarters in Hammersmith, London, was understood to include officials from the UK regulatory body the Competition Markets Authority. The CMA sent a separate team to the one that will deliver its verdict to Matt Hancock, the culture secretary, on whether to clear the £11.7bn Sky takeover bid by Fox, the company founded by Rupert Murdoch. “News that Fox offices in London have been raided by EU officials is concerning,” said Watson, the shadow culture secretary. “Given the CMA is currently preparing its final advice for the secretary of state on the proposed Sky deal, it is important they establish the facts of what has happened here and take it into consideration in their judgment. If Fox has done something to violate EU laws then that should have a bearing on whether the deal receives approval.” Fox has said that its subsidiary was “cooperating fully” with the investigation, which the EC said did not mean its targets had necessarily committed anti-compeititive behaviour. Sources close to the company stressed that the raid had nothing to do with the Fox/Sky deal. “Unannounced inspections are a preliminary step into suspected anticompetitive practices,” the European commission said. 21st Century Fox’s offices have not been raided and a spokesman for Sky, which is a big player in the European sports rights market, also said that none of its offices had been involved in the raids. Legal experts say the European commission’s investigation into a separate Fox subsidiary is outside the direct scope of the CMA’s investigation, which is looking at media plurality issues relating to the Murdoch family adding Sky News to its control of the Sun and the Times newspapers, and at Fox’s commitment to broadcasting standards. However, as the Fox businesses are the ultimate responsibility of the 21st Century Fox chief, James Murdoch, whose connection to the phone hacking scandal at the family’s UK newspapers partly derailed the 2010 bid for Sky, the emergence of another potential scandal could not have come at a worse time. The CMA is due to deliver its final recommendation to Hancock by 1 May, who then has 30 days to decide whether to approve the deal. “In reality, the [European commission] probe is not going to mean any delay to the Fox/Sky deal,” said one competition lawyer who wished to remain anonymous. “This kind of raid happens near the start of a case, so it is probably two to three years from a decision even if it turns out there is an open-and-shut case. “At this stage, Fox has to be presumed innocent and there is nothing the CMA is going to be able to look at anyway. It is also hard to see how any competition law violation is relevant to broadcasting standards or media plurality. The CMA already said the historic ‘bad behaviour’ was not at the heart of their evaluation.” However, public and political campaigners such as Watson, the former Labour leader Ed Miliband, and Vince Cable, the Liberal Democrat leader, have managed to successfully pressure the government into calling for extensive scrutiny against the recommendations of the media regulator Ofcom. Fox Network Group distributes Fox Sports in a number of markets across Europe and also owns a controlling stake (51%) in the media company that holds the broadcast and sponsorship rights to the Eredivisie, the Dutch premier league. The remaining stake is owned by the Eredivisie – and Endemol Shine, the creator of Big Brother, which produces the matches and is 50% owned by Fox. As a result of the arrangement Fox Sports broadcasts all Eredivisie games exclusively in the Netherlands. Fox Sports also has operations in Italy, as does Sky, where the Italian football league Serie A has so far failed to sell its rights at the price it wanted. Ziggo Sports has the Dutch rights to sports including the English Premier League, Spain’s La Liga and Formula 1."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2018/apr/15/even-when-i-fall-review-circus-kathmandu","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-15T07:00:08Z","webTitle":"Even When I Fall review – remarkable trafficking documentary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/apr/15/even-when-i-fall-review-circus-kathmandu","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/apr/15/even-when-i-fall-review-circus-kathmandu","fields":{"headline":"Even When I Fall review – remarkable trafficking documentary","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Shot over six years in Nepal, this compelling documentary looks at the successful rehabilitation of two female survivors of human trafficking. At the start of the film we witness a covert rescue operation carried out in darkness. It’s a brief, thrilling action scene that many film-makers would use as a climax, but by placing it here, directors Sky Neal and Kate McLarnon signal that their film is more interested in how people live after experiencing trauma, rather than the apex of its drama. The film follows Saraswoti and Sheetal, two women who were sold to the circus as children. As young adults, they are members of Circus Kathmandu, an advocacy group made up of men, women and children who have been rescued from the same grim fate, and the country’s only legitimate circus. Here, survivors are able to repurpose their skills, performing all over the world and using storytelling to spread awareness about trafficking. At times it’s stingingly tough to watch, but a privilege to hear these women tell their stories in their own clear-eyed words."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/apr/12/turnbull-says-ministers-not-cabinet-discussed-migration-numbers","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-12T01:57:34Z","webTitle":"Turnbull says ministers, not cabinet, discussed migration numbers","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/apr/12/turnbull-says-ministers-not-cabinet-discussed-migration-numbers","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/apr/12/turnbull-says-ministers-not-cabinet-discussed-migration-numbers","fields":{"headline":"Turnbull says ministers, not cabinet, discussed migration numbers","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Malcolm Turnbull has attempted to clean up a public difference of opinion between himself and Peter Dutton, acknowledging that ministers did discuss the composition of Australia’s migration program. The spat was triggered by a report in the Australian on Tuesday saying the home affairs minister had previously suggested capping Australia’s immigration intake at 170,000 a year – which would have meant a cut of 20,000 people last year – but the proposal was quashed by the prime minister and the treasurer, Scott Morrison, before it made it to cabinet. Turnbull subsequently declared the report “false” and “completely untrue”. Dutton then contradicted the prime minister, essentially confirming that he had discussed the issue with colleagues. On Thursday morning Turnbull attempted to argue during an interview on 3AW that the initial report had referenced a cabinet deliberation, which it hadn’t. “What was initially said in media, I think in the Australian, that there had been a submission brought to cabinet by Peter Dutton to reduce the ceiling of permanent migration ... and that he had been rolled by me and Scott Morrison,” he said. He said the issue had not gone to cabinet, but “if you are asking me, do ministers discuss migration and migration levels and the composition of the migration program – well of course we do. “It would be strange if we didn’t. And I might say the permanent migration ceiling, which has been set at 190,000 for some time, and which we were well below last year and we expect to be below this year, that is reviewed every year.” The row is connected to a bout of positioning connected to the government’s loss of its 30th Newspoll this week, a metric which assumed oversized significance because Turnbull had invoked it as one of the rationales to dump Tony Abbott from the Liberal leadership in 2015. The government attempted to respond to the loss with a full court press of the cabinet, with all the key senior figures deployed in media interviews to decree the prime minister’s leadership was safe. As the key players expressed loyalty, two conservatives also articulated their desire to lead the Liberal party if the top job became vacant – Dutton and Morrison. Some government figures believe Tuesday’s story in the the Australian is connected to leadership positioning by Dutton, but others believe it is connected to a broader fight within the government about the policy direction required to turn around the government’s stubbornly negative poll trend, or to save the furniture. Some government conservatives believe cutting the migration rate would be popular in the regions and in outer metropolitan areas, delivering the Coalition a poll bounce, because voters associate high rates of migration with congestion in the major cities, and suboptimal infrastructure and service delivery. Turnbull and Morrison have resisted the arguments which have been articulated publicly by Abbott and in a more muted fashion by Dutton. During a separate interview on 2GB on Thursday morning, another senior conservative, the finance minister, Mathias Cormann, said there had been “no suggestion that we should be reducing the overall net permanent migration further”. On 3AW, Turnbull was asked whether there was a case to freeze the current rate. The prime minister said the trends driving an increase in foreigners in Australia were temporary modes of entry: students, tourists and business visitors. Turnbull said there are 200,000 more foreign students in Australia than there were a few years ago. Implicitly referencing the internal view points, Turnbull said: “If you feel there are more foreigners on the tram and you can’t get a seat on the tram, if that’s your perception, they are most likely students and visitors.” He repeatedly ducked questions about the desirable rate of population, arguing it wasn’t about a number, it was about maintaining the level of population consistent with a decent standard of living. He said the government was focused on city planning to ensure liveability. He was planning infrastructure projects “in a way no previous prime minister has done”. Alan Tudge, the citizenship minister, said the migration rate would be the same this year: “I think the important thing about this debate about population policy is we need to make sure the infrastructure is there to cater for population growth. “It’s why it’s so pleasing to see the prime minister announce the Melbourne airport rail link. It’s a link we have wanted for decades. That will take a huge amount of congestion off the Tullamarine freeway.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2018/apr/18/california-mudslides-montecito-undocumented-immigrants","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-18T10:00:21Z","webTitle":"California mudslides: as wealthy town recovers, undocumented are left behind","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/apr/18/california-mudslides-montecito-undocumented-immigrants","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/apr/18/california-mudslides-montecito-undocumented-immigrants","fields":{"headline":"California mudslides: as wealthy town recovers, undocumented are left behind","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"After wildfire and mudslides ravaged Montecito, the little California town had at least one consolation: the trauma united the community. Everyone had suffered in some way. Flames scorched the hillsides last December in the biggest wildfire in California’s modern history. Weeks later torrential rain unleashed huge mudflows, killing at least 21 people, destroying dozens of homes and forcing thousands to flee. The grief and devastation prompted an outpouring of solidarity for this bucolic town, one of America’s wealthiest communities, which nestles in Santa Barbara county on the Pacific coast, 90 miles north of Los Angeles. “We’re going to come together and do what great Americans do all the time. We’re going to help each other,” said Oprah Winfrey, one of many celebrity residents. Now, three months after the mudslides, normality is returning. Roads and businesses have reopened. Insurance companies have started paying some of the claims totalling $421m. Tourists are back. The town’s carved, hand-painted street signs are being repaired. “Signs of recovery,” the Montecito Journal declared on its front page last week. One segment of the population, however, is struggling to recover: the largely Latino service workers – maids, nannies, gardeners, caregivers, cooks, waiters, busboys – who earn near minimum wages and live in the shadows, paycheck to paycheck. Many recently returned to work after enforced layoffs and discovered they would not be paid for any lost time. “Not a cent,” said Zita Nevarez, 38, a barista and single mother who lost six weeks of work. She was unable to pay rent or her daughter’s school fees. “I had hoped for some compensation from my employer, some help, but nothing,” said Serafin Torres, 45, a maintenance worker who lost seven weeks. He has kiboshed a plan to buy a computer for his children. Angelica Garcia, 30, a florist and single mother, could not pay utilities after losing three weeks’ salary, resulting in her gas and electricity being cut off. “I have three children. It was very difficult,” she said, tears welling. Few such workers have spoken out publicly, to avoid antagonising their employers. However, a handful spoke to the Guardian on condition the employers not be identified. Another reason some are unwilling to speak out: they are undocumented and fear deportation. Lacking legal status also bars them from seeking emergency relief from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema). Those with US-citizen children are eligible for federal help but have hesitated to apply lest their details be passed on to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice), said Frank Rodriguez, of Cause, a grassroots advocacy group for California’s central coastal region. “In this political climate, people don’t want to take the risk.” The solidarity is no myth, though. Some businesses have paid full or partial salaries for lost weeks. Residents have also helped workers, who tend to live out of town, by establishing a fund gifting individuals up to $600. It has raised tens of thousands of dollars. Nevarez, the barista, received $500. “A huge help, more than I expected,” she said. It helped her catch up on rent and school payments. Such efforts are welcome but do not offset systemic forces that marginalise service and agricultural workers, forces amplified by the natural disasters, said Rodriguez, of Cause. “There is a huge class divide. The gardeners and maids and others who make this city thrive are still struggling. We feel there hasn’t been enough support.” Cause, with other not-for-profit groups, including MICOP and Future Leaders of America, has launched its own fund to help some of the estimated 126,000 undocumented immigrants in Ventura and Santa Barbara counties affected by the wildfires and mudslides. It has distributed $359,500 to people like Torres and Garcia and seeks an additional $2.4m. Ben Romo, a community recovery and engagement coordinator with Santa Barbara county’s emergency management office, said a philanthropic surge from foundations and individual donors had helped not-for-profit organisations to help low-income families. “This disaster has really brought this community together in remarkable ways. People are stepping up.” However, the fire and mudslides had greatly strained poor families who were struggling even before the disasters, Romo said. “Their needs have far exceeded our resources for many years.” The inability of undocumented people to access some government assistance posed further challenges, he said. Montecito, which means “little mountain” in Spanish, is busy rebuilding. Landscapers are repairing and replacing damaged eucalyptus, juniper, pepper and pine trees, which ring many properties. Realtors, interior decorators, kitchen designers and wealth planners are pitching for contracts. Yet some residents remain in shock, especially those who lost relatives, said Steven Blum, a local lawyer who specialises in landslide litigation. “It’s a slow process psychologically. Some of my neighbours still wander around in a daze.” Employers who received business interruption insurance payments had a moral but not legal obligation to help cash-strapped employees. “That’s if you want to show you care about them.” Service workers, however, were muffling any grievances. “If they speak too loudly, they become more visible and they don’t want Ice raiding any of their employers.””"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2018/apr/16/cannabis-marijuana-parenting-children-drugs","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-16T07:01:13Z","webTitle":"'Cannabis strengthened our bond': can pot make you a better parent?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/apr/16/cannabis-marijuana-parenting-children-drugs","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/apr/16/cannabis-marijuana-parenting-children-drugs","fields":{"headline":"'Cannabis strengthened our bond': can pot make you a better parent?","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"An Oregon mother posted a photo last year of herself breastfeeding her baby while she took a bong hit. Naturally, the image went viral. Amid the expected backlash, some much milder criticism came from Jenn Lauder, an Oregon cannabis activist who co-founded Splimm, a newsletter on pot and parenting, with her husband. Lauder chided the breastfeeder for exposing the baby to smoke and for the “optics” of the image. “That mom could have made better choices,” Lauder told me recently. The former teacher has said that while she did not use cannabis when pregnant with her daughter, she resumed shortly after giving birth, and while breastfeeding, to mitigate postpartum depression. Lauder added: “I’ve yet to see compelling evidence that a lactating mother’s cannabis consumption produces any negative effects for a nursing child.” Doctors would not agree. THC, the active ingredient in marijuana, is transmitted in breastmilk, according to a recent study. And while the effect on newborns hasn’t been intensely studied, the chemical is widely believed to impair brain development. Yes, it’s jarring to see a woman in a quintessential act of motherhood, with her face in a bong. But the reality is some parents believe cannabis improves their child rearing. That number is bound to increase as cannabis use becomes more acceptable with legalization. And vape pens and edibles make it easy to do discreetly. No cannabis brand I’m aware of directly markets to pregnant women, but scores promote themselves as health and “wellness” products, a message pregnant woman can absorb as easily as anyone else. Aside from the more fraught area of breastfeeding, marijuana, as cannamoms and cannadads see it, relieves the tedium of parenting while helping them engage with their children. The phrase that keeps coming up is “being present”. With marijuana, “I’m able to sit and play Legos for an extensive period of time or make dinner and make it more fun rather than something functional,” said April Pride, founder of Van der Pop, a line of stylish cannabis accessories for women. She said it also helped break up the monotony of spending more time at home. The drug’s complex legal status makes it difficult for researchers to study the phenomenon of parents who use cannabis or what it might mean for the children. As with so much else in the marijuana world, supporters see parenting and interactions with other parents as an opportunity to destigmatize weed and draw a favorable comparison with alcohol. A New Jersey restaurant owner and dad, who asked that his name not be printed, said he had continued to use cannabis in moderation as a parent, but didn’t involve his “super well-adjusted” kids in it. “There’s too much taboo about it. It’s the equivalent of having a couple glasses of wine in my life.” Pride said: “For me, alcohol feels more like an escape … And cannabis feels like something I participate in because I want to be more involved in what I’m doing.” Living in Seattle, Washington, a liberal city in a legal state, Pride says it’s not especially awkward to discuss weed with the other parents. “People are more curious than judgmental,” she said. “I’ve found if people have opinions they keep it to themselves.” As with many things marijuana related, one of the worst things that can happen when one combines responsible use while parenting is to get caught with it. Even in some legal states, evidence of pot smoking by parents is enough to call in child protective services. And when parents split, cannabis use can be used against them in custody hearings. When a parent is an open cannabis user it can also change the tenor of conversations with kids about drug use. “Cannabis has strengthened the bond I have with my daughter because I’m honest about something that’s important to me,” Lauder said. “At age 10, she’s incredibly social justice minded.” Lauder doesn’t give cannabis to her daughter because of the risks it poses to brain development, but she hopes when her daughter gets older she’ll consider marijuana as an alternative to alcohol. “For her, it’s just another kind of medicine.” Garyn Angel, CEO of MagicalButter, a company which makes devices for infusing cannabis into cooking ingredients like butter and oil, said: “Parenting is about consciousness and cannabis makes you very conscious.” If nothing else, he said, it cut down on alcohol consumption, which he says improved his parenting. As for what other parents think, he isn’t concerned. “If my kids were screw-ups that would be a different situation,” he said. “But my kids are amazing.” For a different perspective, I reached out to an old friend whose father is a daily pot smoker. As a kid, he said, his father was unhappy with his work. He knew after dad came home and spent some time in the basement, he’d be in a better mood. “He was a lot chiller,” my friend said, and “more likely to give in to stuff.” My friend saw other individuals use different drugs and suffer dire consequences but the only negative side-effect my friend noticed with his father was that he had a “memory like a Wiffle ball. I never knew if he was going to remember if we had a conversation or not.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/apr/13/hungary-journalists-state-tv-network-migrants-viktor-orban-government","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-13T04:00:26Z","webTitle":"Hungarian journalists admit role in forging anti-migrant 'atmosphere of fear'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/13/hungary-journalists-state-tv-network-migrants-viktor-orban-government","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/apr/13/hungary-journalists-state-tv-network-migrants-viktor-orban-government","fields":{"headline":"Hungarian journalists admit role in forging anti-migrant 'atmosphere of fear'","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"A leading editor at Hungary’s state television network punched the air in jubilation as he took a phone call on Sunday evening. Shortly afterwards, his subordinates realised what he had been told: Viktor Orbán had secured a resounding victory in the parliamentary election. Orbán and his Fidesz party achieved a third consecutive supermajority in the Hungarian parliament after a campaign primarily fought on an anti-migrant platform. International monitors would later complain about the campaign’s “intimidating and xenophobic rhetoric” and note that public television “clearly favoured the ruling coalition, at odds with international standards”. The Guardian spoke to several employees of the taxpayer-funded MTVA network to hear the inside story of how its channels pumped out government messaging, and at times false stories, with the goal of winning support for the prime minister’s anti-immigration message. The journalists recalled how the network would focus on negative stories about refugees and migrants, linking them to crime and terrorism. Even on the eve of polling, there was no letup, as the M1 channel incorrectly reported a van driving into a crowd of people in Münster, Germany, as an Islamist terrorist attack. “I’d never experienced anything like that, even at MTVA: it was a clear lie,” said one of the journalists, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The government message that millions of dangerous migrants are waiting to enter Hungary is reinforced on TV and thousands of billboards across the country. The Hungarian-born financier and philanthropist George Soros, who has put billions of dollars into promoting civil society in central and eastern Europe, is portrayed as being part of a plot with Brussels and the political opposition to destroy Hungary by letting in foreigners. “I think it created an atmosphere of fear. Pavlov reflexes have been created for words like danger, terrorism, migrants, opposition, Soros and Brussels,” the journalist said. News programmes regularly show archive footage from 2015 of migrants walking in Budapest, clashes between refugees and riot police at the Hungary-Serbia border, or terrorist attacks in Europe. “Tolerance is regularly criticised, while anti-immigration sentiment is presented as the only valid opinion,” the journalist said. The journalists believe the anti-migrant messages often come directly from the government. People who work on stories directly involving Orbán receive a list of keywords to use. “Sometimes the editor will come into the office on the phone and dictate a whole story to us, word for word. We do not know who is on the other end of the phone,” said one. Documents sent in error to junior MTVA staff and seen by the Guardian appear to confirm direct governmental involvement. Editorial directives produced by staff at the prime minister’s office are cut and pasted to give journalists talking points with which to carry out character assassinations of Hungarian citizens who are openly critical of the government. One directive produced by the office last year targeted the activist Márton Gulyás, as well as a former Green party MP and a university professor. Another document focused on Soros. An evening of debate organised by Gulyás entitled “resistance, disobedience – without violence” is spun as proof that Gulyás was preparing for unrest and clashes with police. “It was completely ridiculous,” Gulyás said, recalling the subsequent coverage. “We had these plans to protest against the government, but our intentions were of course completely non-violent. But pro-Fidesz outlets were constantly accusing us of creating violence and scandals.” When asked about the government directives, a spokesperson for Orbán said the government does not answer media queries as it has no control over the media. MTVA did not respond to a request for comment. The state-run media conglomerate has an annual budget of about 80bn forint (£223m). Over the past eight years, the government has moved to consolidate its hold over Hungarian print, TV and radio networks, with many media resources being bought by government-linked figures. Origo.hu, a popular news website, is one of many resources that changed hands, moving from a subsidiary of Deutsche Telekom to ownership by the son of the governor of Hungary’s central bank. András Pethö, who was the deputy editor but left in 2014 to co-found a new wesbite, direkt36.hu, said: “It was a really good place to do journalism, but then they started putting pressure on us to ignore certain stories. We didn’t comply, and my editor was forced out. “I looked at Origo in the weeks before the election, and every second story had the word migrant in the headline.” Meanwhile, the government-friendly media largely ignores corruption scandals that broke in the run-up to the election involving leading Fidesz figures. Orbán has four more years to rule, with a two-thirds majority in parliament that allows him to change the constitution, and there are fears that the government may move against the remaining islands of critical media. The final edition of the daily, Magyar Nemzet, one of the few outlets to run critical stories before the election, was on Wednesday. The newspaper’s owner, a businessman who fell out with Orbán, decided to stop funding it. In the aftermath of the vote, TV2, a television channel owned by a government-friendly businessman, ran a report naming 24 alleged Soros agents, including Gulyás, independent journalists and NGO leaders. On Wednesday, the pro-government weekly Figyelő also ran a list of supposed Soros agents. The journalists said they had decided to speak out “from a sense of decency and truth”, and said some state TV employees were thinking of resigning after the election result. “I felt terrible, because I could see that we can and did influence people,” said one. “Some of us had reassured ourselves that nobody watches us, that we don’t matter. It turns out that we do – awfully.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/live/2018/apr/12/commonwealth-games-2018-day-eight-beach-volleyball-gymnastics-and-more-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-12T12:53:41Z","webTitle":"Commonwealth Games 2018 day eight: Zharnel Hughes disqualified and more – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2018/apr/12/commonwealth-games-2018-day-eight-beach-volleyball-gymnastics-and-more-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/live/2018/apr/12/commonwealth-games-2018-day-eight-beach-volleyball-gymnastics-and-more-live","fields":{"headline":"Commonwealth Games 2018 day eight: Zharnel Hughes disqualified and more – as it happened","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Enjoy some of the best day 8 photos here. Day eight has been a real blast, maybe not for Zharnel Hughes who had that 200m gold crown taken off him, owing to him stumbling into the adjacent lane, one belonging to Trinidad’s Jereem Richards. Whether he will be disqualified or not remains to be seen – England have appealed. Elsewhere, another great day for the hosts, although they were denied a clean sweep in the beach volleyball. Another gold in the pool for Jack Laugher in the diving, and an appearance from Usain Bolt to boot. Thanks for your company. Here’s our report from the Gold Coast: Melissa Wu takes the final medal of day eight, edging out Meaghen Benfeito, of Canada, and England’s Lois Toulson, who takes bronze. Wu’s score of 360.40 is enough to take gold from Benfeito, who registered 359.75 points. It’s not been dull on the Gold Coast! Day eight is almost done and dusted, with just the women’s 10m platform to be finalised. The images of Zharnel Hughes being told about his disqualification, a few minutes after completing a full lap of honour, was absolutely excruciating. The medal ceremony has been postponed until tomorrow, as the panel assess England’s appeal. That was a stonking run by Langford, though. Meanwhile, England are reportedly appealing Zharnel Hughes’s disqualification ... No drama, this time. Wycliffe Kinyamal wins fair and square. Kyle Langford, of England, is shaking his head, gutted after taking a close silver. Kinyamal gets over in 1.45.11min, while Luke Mathews bags bronze for the host nation. In the diving, the 10m platform is coming to its climax. Meaghan Benfeito looks set to claim gold for Canada, while Melissa Wu, of Australia and Lois Toulson, the girlfriend of fellow diver Jack Laugher who has two golds to his name already on the Gold Coast, could yet also get on the podium. Back to the men’s 800m final ... Dina Asher-Smith, who unsurprisingly is in great spirits, speaks, after nabbing bronze in the 200m. “I was running my race plan, I knew I had more to give down the home straight,” she says. “I would never say never to [doing 400m] but if you asked my coach now, he would tell you I’d be complaining and moaning the whole way.” Confusion reigns, with Zharnel Hughes still out on his lap of honour ... who’s going to tell him? You or me? He will be gutted. But, hang on a minute ... Zharnel Hughes has been disqualifed! He’s been penalised for running right on the edge of the lane, impeding into Jereem Richard’s lane, and not necessarily for his arms appearing to make contact with the Trinidad athlete. That’s gutting for Hughes, after a corking run. The one positive is that Leon Reid sneaks on to the podium, for bronze. Zharnel Hughes steamrollers towards the line, he almost loses it at the last as he tired but an incredible race by the 22-year-old, born in Anguilla, means he clinches England’s 29th gold of these Games in some style. Trinidad’s Jereem Richards is neck and neck alongside him, with his arms flailing. Aaron Brown, of Canada, finishes third. Richards did not look best pleased with Hughes about that ... The men’s 200m final is on the way now. Usain Bolt, who holds the world record 19.19sec for this discipline, is among those watching on. Zharnel Hughes, of England, and Leon Reid, representing Northern Ireland, both run at the Carrara Stadium. It’s always a showpiece event ... Dani Stevens smashes the field with a Games’ record of 68.26m, ahead of India’s Seema Punia and Navjeet Dhillon to sit top of the podium. Before the men’s 200m final and 800m final, let’s take a look at the diving. In the women’s 10 platform, Canada are looking good, with Benfeito and Toth leading the way, ahead of England’s Robyn Birch. Shaunae Miller-Uibo gets over the line fastest, in 22.09sec, setting a new Commonwealth Games record, while Thompson, the Olympic champion, misses out but her Jamaican compatriot, Shericka Jackson nabs silver. England’s Asher-Smith gets bronze in a great 200m field. The women’s 200m final is imminent, followed by the mens’ event. The field for the women’s event includes Dina Asher-Smith, as well as Bianca Williams representing England. Jamaica’s Elaine Thompson will probably start as the favourite after a blistering heat, finishing in 21.66sec. Pavan and Humana-Paredes, the top-ranked pairing in the world, deny Australia a double win on the sand on day eight. KJT, sitting pretty in top spot in the heptathlon after day one, speaks. So Johnson-Thompson is the overnight leader, while 18-year-old Niamh Emerson finishes the day in a very respectable fourth. The long jump is first up on Friday morning, on day two. “I’m happy to finish day one in the lead but it’s been a bit of a ropey day. I didn’t expect to be in my best shape in April but I think I underestimated just how hard it would be.” Emerson adds: “I always expect more [of myself] but I’m really pleased. I just want to enjoy it tomorrow as much as I did today because I can get nervous.” Kurtis Marschall with a beautiful third and final jump to clear 5.70m. He celebrates deliriously, high-fiving fellow competitors and his coach along the way in front of 30,000-odd Aussies. Great scenes. Shawn Barber, of Canada ends up clinching silver, with Cutts taking bronze. A great moment for England’s Sophie Hahn, up on the podium, as she collects her gold medal from the T38 100m after a bursting sprint earlier. Still to come? The women’s 200m final, men’s 200m final and the men’s 800m final, so plenty of medals still up for grabs. Elsewhere, there’s the 10m platform women’s final while the beach volleyball is coming towards a close, with Canada looking good for victory in the gold-medal match. They hold a very slender 1-0 lead on the sand. Christabel Nettey takes top spot, with a mammoth first leap ultimately securing victory. Brooke Stratton earns silver, and England’s Shara Proctor a bronze, with the latter pulling out, presumably through injury, of having a final jump, a last tilt towards toppling Nettey. In the pole vault, Shaw Barber cannot clear 5.70m. Can Kurtis Marschall? Elsewhere, we’re in the final round of the long jump, with Lorraine Ugen registering a mighty 6.69m, to move up to fourth for now. KJT storms her heat, with a lightning time of 23.57sec, leaving the rest of the field in her wake. That’s over 1,000 priceless points to take into tomorrow, when the heptathlon comes to a climax. The heptathlon continues, with the final event of day one on the track. Katarina Johnson-Thompson is among those looking for a timely boost in the 200m heats at the Carrara Stadium. Here we go ... On the beach, Australia trail Canada early on the women’s finals after losing the first set. Taliqua Clancy and Mariafe Artacho del Solar have it all to do. Meanwhile, England captain Alex Danson has been speaking after a galling defeat to New Zealand in the hockey semis. “We are devastated,” Danson says. “We played a fantastic game and I’m so proud of how we came out. We have to hold our head and come out fighting for the bronze.” It is the end of the Commonwealth road for England’s Luke Cutts, he fails to clear 5.55m but his hair-themed colleague, Shaw Barber, of Canada, clears that height with his third and final attempt, to leave him in with a sniff of a medal. Adam Hague, another Englishman, also fails to clear 5.55m. Cutts is line for a bronze medal in the pole vault as it stands but he may get bumped down the pecking order. Marschall goes one better! He’s just cleared 5.55m to jump to the top of the leaderboard. In the long jump, Shara Proctor has registered an impressive 6.75m but it’s Canada, through Christabel Nettey, who leads with 6.84m. Back towards the track and field, and the pole vault, where Kurtis Marschall, the 20-year-old Australian, has just quite comfortably cleared the 5.45m. He’s all smiles. Adam Hague, of England, also flies clear. New Zealand have done it! They prevail against England on penalties, winning 2-1, with Stacey Michelsen’s superb, dinked finish eventually getting the better of Maddie Hinch in goal. NZ will compete in the final for gold or silver, while England will have to settle for a place in the bronze-medal match. England and New Zealand are level pegging, but if the Kiwis can score with their fifth and final penalty then they’ll progress to the final ... England are up and running, Martin scores the first ... These are penalties with a twist, Maddie Hinch, the England keeper is playing the role of Jerzy Dudek ... no one has scored yet. In the hockey, it’s quite the stalemate between England and New Zealand, with Maddie Hinch making a stunning save to deny the Kiwis victory. Normal time ends 0-0, after a breathless match, which means we are heading for another penalty shootout. When England ousted NZ in Rio, that was also on penalties. “Both teams will have done huge amounts of homework,” says Kate Richardson-Walsh, the former skipper. Two medals in two days! Jack Laugher wins by 66.70 points, smashing the 3m springboard in the pool. Phillipe Gagne takes second for Canada, James Connor earns Australia bronze. Ross Haslam, one of the brothers from Sheffield, has to settle for fourth and Heatly, of Scotland, fifth. Not as fast as his qualifying time but gold for Ndodomzi Ntutu. Langenhoven makes it a South Africa one-two – they are speed merchants, aren’t they – while Malaysia earn bronze. In the diving, Jack Laugher has established an unassailable lead, he’s a few minutes away from a fourth Commonwealth Games title. Laugher’s on 519.40, way ahead of second-place James Connor on 438.00. In the pole vault, things are looking good for Luke Cutts, who has cleared a season’s best 5.45m to stay in medal territory. Ah, drat. Shara Proctor’s first attempt in the long jump final ends in a foul. Still 0-0 as such, and a helluva way to go yet. Lorraine Ugen set a 6.35m while Jazmin Sawyers is up next ... “The Pocket Rocket does it again, in blistering form – absolutely unstoppable,” emails Chris Page, of the electric Sophie Hahn. “She has the full set of titles at this distance.” Sophie Hahn earns England’s first gold on this track at Carrara. “I’m so, so happy,” she says. “The key thing is to be consistent.” Australian Rhiannon Clarke took silver and Olivia Breen claimed Wales’ 25th medal at these Games after earning bronze. Now, for the long jump final, with Shara Proctor among those competing ... Katarina Johnson-Thompson looks pretty nonplussed out there, throwing a 11.54m in her third and final throw. Whether that’s going to be enough to keep her dreams of gold alive remains to be seen. In terms of the shot put itself, that score sees her way down in ninth. After three events, she’s down in third and with it all to do if she wants more than that. In the diving, Jack Laugher is on top spot as it stands, with a 345.20. James Heatly, of Scotland, had jumped into second, only for Phillipe Gagne, of Canada, to go one better. Matthew Carter is trying to redeem himself after that earlier mistake in the pool. The Aussies breeze past Scotland 21-12 to clinch triples gold. The Scots take silver, while England beat Canada for bronze. Kyron McMaster earns the island country’s first medal of these Games, running a time of 48.25sec. The Bahamas take silver, Jaheel Hyde bags bronze for Jamaica. It is some story for McMaster, the 21-year-old who lost his coach, Xavier Samuels, last year, who died in Hurricane Irma. “I still think and talk about him every day,” McMaster said. “I even got a tattoo on my inner arm made of his favourite phrase, which was ‘guidance’. Every day I look at it and it acts as motivation.” Jack Green, of England, takes a very respectable fourth. “I run for a living which is ridiculous,” Green says. “I’m very lucky to do what I do.” It’s not massive, Johnson-Thompson appears to play it a little safe but she gets the white flag and registers a 11.36m. She could do with finding the 12m mark in her third and final throw but she’s still primed for a tilt at a podium finish in the heptathlon, which finishes on Friday. Here comes KJT, for take two in the shot put ... A couple of untimely errors in the diving has left Jack Haslam and Matthew Carter with work to do. A false start for the former and a messy exit from the somersault means Laugher is sitting pretty at the top. Janieve Russell runs a slick 54.33sec. Eilidh Doyle takes silver for Scotland while Wenda Nel, of South Africa, earns bronze. Russell had to settle for bronze four years but this time she has gone not one better but taken the top prize. A great run by Russell, the 24-year-old. In the diving, after two of six attempts: Laugher scores 94.50 with his second dive (3.5 reverse somersaults) to take a big lead. James Connor of Australia and Ross Haslam are in second on 141.90. James Heatly is 4th on 140.70, with Yona Knight-Wisdom just behind. Ah, that’s not the start Johnson-Thompson was after in the shot put, fouling with her first effort (of three). Time for the women’s 400m hurdles ... In the pool, Jack Laugher has work to do. Matthew Carter, the 17-year-old Australian leads the way with a stonking 81.60 score. In the shot put, the heptathlon is back under way, with Niamh Emerson registering a 11.86m, with Katarina Johnson-Thompson and co still to come. “How’s England getting on in women’s triples lawn bowls medal match?” tweets Jennifer. They lead Canada 16-12 after 14 ends. They led 10-3 after seven ends but have been pegged back a little. It’s looking good though in the bronze-medal match for Sian Honnor’s team. Jack Haslam kickstarts the 3m springboard, with a healthy score of 63.00. He is one of three Englishman in the final, alongside Jack Laugher and his brother, Ross. In the hockey, it’s still 0-0, with three minutes left of the 1st. In the lawn bowls triples, Australia are heading for a 60th gold. There is plenty of athletics, all manner of medals on the way but first England are under way against New Zealand in the hockey. A few minutes into the first period, England are enjoying a decent spell of possession. Everybody’s limbering up, from Jack Laugher, ready for his 3m springboard final in the pool to England’s hockey team, who are preparing to do battle – again – with New Zealand in the women’s semis. Alex Danson will make her 300th international appearance in that duel. The 10m platform complete the day, as far as diving is concerned anyway. On Danson, the 32-year-old from Southampton, her former team-mate and captain Kate Richardson-Walsh tweeted: “A true inspiration, authentic leader and best striker in the world. A lioness on the pitch, her desire to better herself has never lessened.” High praise indeed. So, the men’s pole vault final will be upon us in no time. Adam Hague and Luke Cutts will compete for England, but Australia’s Kurtis Marshall will enter as the favourite. Another event, wrestling, has finished for the day, with joy for Georgina Nelthorpe and Curtis Dodge, who both bag bronze medals. Meanwhile, here’s a story to warm the cockles a little: As thought, Kumar Sushil notches another success for India at the Carrara Sports Arena, this time in the men’s 74kg freestyle. He batters South Africa’s Johannes Botha, to clinch victory inside all of 90 seconds. Lovely jubbly. A little earlier, Curtis Dodge bagged a bronze for Wales, with a win over Nigeria’s Assizecourt. KJT speaks about being numero uno. “I’m never normally in this position, normally heptathlon’s on the first day or one of the first events,” she says, given her lead after two events and the shot up next. “I’ve been itching to get going in the village, watching everybody. I like being the favourite because that means everyone rates you and I’m enjoying it.” The big one is coming up in the hockey shortly, with England taking on New Zealand in the semi-finals. The Kiwis are unbeaten in the tournament so far and are the top scorers but England sent them packing, via a penalty shootout in Glasgow in 2014. A couple of sightings, if you like, today: Prince Edward is casting his eye over the lawn bowls, where it’s Australia v Scotland in the gold-medal match, and on the adjacent green, it’s Canada v England in the triples bronze-medal tie. Elsewhere, Usain Bolt is limbering up to dish out the 200m medals a little later on, that gets started approaching 1pm (BST). It is less than an hour until Katarina Johnson-Thompson, one of England’s favourites to boost the medal haul, continues her assault on ensuring a podium finish in the heptathlon. The 25-year-old leads after two events, with the shot put up next after a brilliant 1.87m in the high jump and fourth-place in the 100m hurdles. Nothing will be wrapped today, however, with the the long jump, javelin and 800m not until Friday. In the badminton doubles, Gabrielle and Chris Adcock are taking to the court, ready to duel with Singapore in the round of 16. At the Oxenford studios, that’s the squash courts, Wales’ double-act of Creed and Evans are taking on India in the men’s quarter-finals. It could be a good day for Wales, who are also in action in the wrestling as we speak, with Curtis Dodge vying for bronze in the 74kg freestyle. Diana Weicker clinches victory in the 53kg Nordic system wrestling – that discipline sounds lively. Silver for India, bronze for Nigeria. And Canada promptly rack up another gold moments later, albeit in the 76kg, as Erica Wiebe retains her title, with a mammoth arm throw doing the business. The Australians are in for a real feast in terms of beach volleyball action today, with the women’s singles taking place in a little over an hour. That’s after the men have already bagged a gold medal on the sand. Just before then, all eyes will be on Jack Laugher, in the 3m springboard after a sterling day in the pool after that immaculately clean dive yesterday in the 1m. Around the same time, the men’s pole vault gets under way. A flurry of medals ... as Rahul Aware bags the top prize, ahead of Steven Takahashi of Canada, in the 57kg freestyle. I make that a 13th gold of the Games for India on the Gold Coast. The men’s 74kg event is coming up in around an hour, with Sushil Kumar competing for another India gold. It’s joy for Diamanto Evripidou in the individual all-around event. Canada take silver through Katherine Uchida while Malaysia seal bronze. Down in seventh, a remarkable feat for England’s Hannah Martin, with 15-year-old making a big impression at her maiden Games. England return to action in the netball, v Jamaica, on Saturday: From a frenetic finish on the sand to the calm, serene surrounds at the lawn bowls, where Australia are on the hunt for more silverware, against Scotland, in the women’s triples gold-medal match. The Aussies are in front and looking good. Elsewhere, England’s Paul Drinkhall is out of the men’s singles table tennis although Liam Pitchford has progressed to the last eight, as has team-mate Samuel Walker. Wow, some finish, with McHugh and Schumann taking victory. Jubilant scenes around the court. Ice running through their veins in what was a mightily nervy, tense finish. That’s gold number 59 for the Aussies ... Another magic moment as Schumann nips over the net to pull Australia back into it, before rifling an ace over to get the scores back to 12-12 in the third set. It’s going to be a nervy finish, with both nations locked on points in this gold medal match on the sand. A reminder that England won their first ever Commonwealth Games medals in the women’s mountain biking this morning, with Annie Last taking gold. “This an amazing feeling,” she said. “Thank you to everybody who has helped me along the road.” That beach volleyball clash between two heavyweights, Australia and Canada, is still unfolding. Canada take the second set 21-18 with Chris McHugh struggling to deal with a smashing forehand. His partner, Schumann has played a blinder, though, and it’s level at 1-1. There’s a toss of a coin to see who will win the serve, and decide the ends. Hello. What’s coming up in this bumper day eight? The main focus is again, like yesterday, in the track and field, with 10 medals to come at the Carrara Stadium alone, including the men’s 200m and 800m finals. There’s also more diving, with the 3m springboard and the 10m platform final, with Jack Laugher, of England, the Olympic champion returning in the former after victory yesterday in the 1m. Plus, beach volleyball and wrestling. Talking of the sand, here’s a dispatch from Martha Kelner: Well look, it’s all too much for your humble correspondent here. Richard Parkin signing off to go bathe my typing fingers and enjoy a nice crisp glass of milk. You’ll be in excellent hands though as the indefatigable Ben Fisher takes over the joystick. Thanks for your company today; from the lawn bowls to the mountain biking and now to the beach volleyball – what a day of close encounters it has been! A huge night (in Australia) still in store, so keep that sly browser open and your alt-tab fingers at the ready in the office this morning wherever in the world you’re following this coverage. Men’s beach volleyball – gold medal match Well, it’s the type of encounter you’d hope for with gold on the line, so far. We’re halfway through the first set and it’s Australia leading 11-10, in a contest that’s ebbed and flowed. Sam Pedlow has been really firing in his serves today, cracking 80+km on multiple occasions, but the Aussie duo are scrambling well. A bit of verbals here with Canada challenging the umpires call, with the score blowing out to 15-12 to the host nation. The reply shows Pedlow was absolutely correct, it’s just touched the tape – how crucial could this prove?! The point is revoked, and then Canada move to lock it up at 14-14. And they’ve got a bit of momentum here, taking the lead 16-15. Australia respond with a tactical time out. It’s a vocal home crowd, but McHugh and Schumann need to make sure they don’t get too overwrought by the energy on the Coolangatta beachfront. Very delicately poised here now as Damian Schumann conceals a delicate drop shot, before Chris McHugh fires an unstoppable serve. They head back into the lead, 18-17! Wowee – what a point that was; Australia leading 19-18 and the teams have produced the rally of the game! It ends with a Schumann spike, and Australia go 20-18. Pedlow then saves one set-point; but it’s there! To the delight of the home crowd, Canada have conceded their first set of the tournament, and Australia go to their seats for a well-earned drink, grabbing the first 21-19. Back at the Coomera Indoor Sports Centre where Cyprus’ Evripidou has navigated her third rotation with aplomb in the rhythmic gymnastics. A slight fumble with the clubs, but not obvious errors and the Cypriot has come through with a very credible 13.850. She won’t top the round, but she doesn’t cede too much ground to Canada’s Uchida, with one apparatus left to complete. Some fascinating choices of music in this round too – Canada’s Sophie Crane with the classic styles of the Can Can, as performed by London’s Philharmonic Orchestra, Singapore’s Aiko Tan feeling a little bit more Pitbull &amp; J-Lo inclined. No deductions from the judges for that error though, you’ll be relieved to hear. Well, they started strongly and they finished in similar fashion, the brothers from Aeteroa have ended the run of England’s Sheaf and Gregory, 21-13, 21-15. Some terrific fight from the English duo who at one stage looked like they were out of answers, as Messieurs O’Dea wracked up 6-7 unanswered points, to finish more respectably. Sam O’Dea leading the way from the net with eight blocks – the 6 ft 6 and taller of the two has led the tournament for blocks, so a sense of reprieve for the Kiwis after a disappointing loss in the semi-final with Canada. Canada are on the sand now as they take on Australia’s Chris McHugh and Damien Schumann in the gold medal battle. Watch this space! Rhythmic gymnastics – individual all-round final Well, what a routine that was! Already sitting nicely after the hoop routine, Cyprus’s Diamanto Evripidou has blown away her opponents with a stunning performance with the ball. She impressed in qualification and came in as the favourite but it’s one thing doing it away from the cameras and doing it when it matters. It’s an apparatus the Cypriot favours but the judges have awarded her a 15.100 – for context the next best was Wales’ Laura Halford with a 13.300 – so at the halfway point Evripidou sits with 28.900, with Canada’s Uchida a full 1.650 points behind and Malaysia’s Sie Yan Koi in third. Men’s beach volleyball – bronze medal match, England v New Zealand We’re nearing the end of the first set in the men’s beach volleyball, where English duo Chris Gregory and Jake Sheaf have a battle of their hands in the form of Kiwi brothers Ben and Sam O’Dea. If you missed Martha Kelner’s piece, there’s been quite a remarkable road to get here for the English team, and there are definitely plenty in the crowd here roaring the popular duo on. It’s 12-19 to the Kiwis however who are looking to round out this first set. New Zealand miss a chance or two to close it, but a big block by Ben O’Dea at the net and they’ve clinched it 21-13. A big twenty minutes coming up here on the sands of Coolangatta. Around the grounds – and a Bolt from the blue! So, a quick skirt around what else is currently going down. We’re down to the round of 16 clashes in the badminton, Wales has edged Ghana for 9th place in the women’s hockey after a 2-0 shoot out victory, South Africa has shaded England for the bronze in the triple’s para lawn bowls 16-13, 5th-10th places have been resolved in the netball with South Africa ending the tournament of surprise packets Uganda to claim 5th, Malawi have grabbed 7th over Northern Ireland and Scotland have just downed Barbados to finish 9th. In the rhythmic gymnastics Canada’s Katherine Uchida is the provisional leader at the conclusion of the hoop element, with the Cypriot duo of Viktoria Skittidi and Diamanto Evripidou in second and third. England’s Hannah Martin and Australia’s Enid Sung are in 5th and 6th respectively, with a plethora of squash and table tennis events still on the go. In terms of medals, the only breaking news is a gold to Singapore’s appropriately named Martina Veloso who made quick work of her opposition in the women’s 50m rifle prone final. India’s Tejaswini Sawant and Scotland’s Seonaid McIntosh claimed silver and bronze, but it was Veloso with a Games record score that won the day, backing up her earlier win in the 10m rifle to deliver Singapore its second gold of the Games! Oh, and breaking news that half of the Games journalists have been seen abandoning their posts with news that Usain Bolt has made an appearance at the media centre. We’ll await to see if our eyes at the scene, the redoutable Mike Hytner, will be able to secure a selfie or at least ask a question like “Mr Bolt, where did you learn to run so fast?” etc. You do not want to go to the bathroom any time soon. Women’s heptathlon – disaster for Stainton, KJT leads An update now from the track where we’re two events down in the women’s heptathlon. Gold medal favourite England’s Katarina Johnson-Thompson has taken an early lead with the conclusion of the 110m hurdles and high jump elements. Australian Celeste Mucci led after the hurdles from Canada’s Angela Whyte with Johnson-Thompson finishing fifth, but disaster for her compatriot Katie Stainton, whose entire event was over inside five seconds after a very nasty fall. A distraught Stainton was comforted by KJT as she discovered that she’d been subsequently disqualified for not finishing. KJT then cleared 1.87m in the high jump to take the overall lead from Canada’s Nina Schultz, with Mucci in third. What a battle this has become. We were all waiting for the fireworks between the defending champion and the silver medallist from the Glasgow Games, but it took a very unexpected turn, with Sam Gaze suffering a mechanical! The last thing you want as three cyclists close at the medals end of the race. Cooper attacks, he sees the opportunity and he drops Hatherly to see if he can ride to the finish; there’s still about a circuit left to race. Gaze loses about 30 seconds, and he’s staring at now having to come through the South African to get back on the tail of Cooper. It looks Cooper’s from here; but would you believe, Gaze is going for this! Hatherly very sportingly allows his opponent past him – he could have used the narrow section of the course to block and frustrate, but he’s left him past. Nervous times for Cooper now as Gaze is absolutely mowing him down. What a ride this is turning into! They’re into the velodrome now, it’s elbow-to-elbow, the two Kiwis are really throwing their machines about, who has the top end pace to finish this? Gaze is the quicker of the two, but has he expended too much energy with that remarkable catch up ride! They’re on the final stretch; and it’s Gaze, it’s Gaze with the jump! What a remarkable ride; he’s mown his compatriot down and now he’s grabbed the gold! What an awkward busride home that’s going to be – but it’s New Zealand gold and silver, with South Africa’s Hatherly grabbing the bronze. High mountain-biking drama in Nerang! Wowee. What a spectacular finish to the gold medal antipodean clash over at Broadbeach! We left it with the Kiwis deliberating long and hard; but would you believe with the very last bowl of the match Australia have snatched the result! It was the veteran, Ken Hanson, on the 15th end with a clutch bowl. Sixty-eight years young; he’s become Australia’s oldest ever Commonwealth Games gold medallist! Commiserations to the Kiwi trio, they fought so valiantly, but they’ll have to settle for the silver. High bowling drama! Men’s cross-country mountain bike We’re back with the men’s cross-country mountain biking, where it’s turned into a three-horse race with third of the Kiwi triumvirate Oliver off the back. Ciao, Lepidus, it’s time for Octavian and Mark Antony to battle out the rest of this one. South Africa’s Hatherly continues to be the fly in the ointment on a New Zealand 1-2-3, he’s lurking with intent with the medallists from Glasgow appear to be more concerned with marking each others’ attacks. Australia’s McConnell appears to have slipped off the chasing pack, so the Glasgow bronze medallist is out of the reckoning here. England’s Clacherty and Canada’s Bouchard remain locked around a minute back as they joustle for fourth and fifth. It’s Cooper still leading, with Gaze on his shoulder, Hatherly sitting back, patiently watching them both. Lawn bowls – open B6/B7/B8 triples gold medal match We’ve got a humdinger over at Broadbeach Bowls Club as well, as two other tiny islands with great sporting antagonism are locked in a classic. With only one end to play it’s Australia 12, New Zealand 13 here. The Kiwis took an early lead, before Australia pushed out to a very comfortable lead, 10-3 after seven ends. A remarkable five-point end brought New Zealand charging back into this contest, and they’ve really quietened this parochial home crowd snatching the lead, right at the death! How will this one unfold?! There’s some tense tactic talk happening between every bowl. Do the Kiwis drive? Do they bowl close? Do they protect the shot ball? Men’s cross-country mountain bike And we’re about half-way through the event over at Nerang, where it’s New Zealand poised nicely at this stage to dominate the medals. South Africa’s Alan Hatherly is the odd one out with a Kiwi trio of Anton Cooper, Sam Gaze and Ben Oliver hunting as a pack. There’s almost a minute between our leading pack and the rest of the field, with England’s Fraser Clacherty, Australia’s Dan McConnell and Canada’s Leandre Bouchard leading their nations’ hopes respectively. Tasty little Guernsey v Jersey subplot here by the way, with the battle for the channels taking place about 3 minutes back in 10-12th place. Some great names on some of the technical elements of this course, by the way, let’s hope none of the riders come unstuck on ‘Grumpy Wombat Hollow’ etc. Cooper and Gaze battled it out for gold and silver at the Glasgow Games, will we see a repeat of that battle here today? And to take stock of where the overall medal tally is presently at: It continues to be a brighter than perhaps even expected showing for the host nation, with local reporters crowing over Australia’s dominance in the pool, even against the various countries of Great Britain when combined. Over thirty nations have now got among the medals, but there are plenty of intriguing battles within battles. Which of the channel islands, you ask, will breakthrough first, as Guernsey and Jersey resume their ancient hatred. Don’t expect any assistance on that front from Sark – they didn’t even front for the games, the slackers. Still, plenty more action to come – and as we’ve seen already, dramatic upsets are never far away, such is the drama of the Commonwealth Games. Kia ora koutou! It’s another day of radiant sunshine Down Under and there’s plenty more gold to go around today. If you missed some of the overnight action it was a terrific night led by Australia’s field athletes, a strong night for England’s diving team, with Tracey Neville’s netballers also daring to dream of gold. Martha Kelner’s also got a lovely write-up of England’s beach volleyball duo Chris Gregory and Jake Sheaf and the adversity they’ve overcome even just to make the Games, plus Kate O’Halloran’s terrific feature on how these Games have strived for LGBTI inclusivity. Coming Up Here’s what’s still to come on day eight. Remember, all times are local – the Gold Coast is GMT +10:00 and EST +14:00. Our first gold of the morning has gone to England in the women’s cross-country mountain bike, and right now (very now) their male counterparts are taking to the course over in Nerang. Rhythmic gymnastics is underway from 2pm local, and Chris Gregory and Jake Sheaf (see above) will be fighting for bronze in the men’s beach volleyball from 3.30pm, with the gold-medal clash between Australia and Canada starting around 4.30pm.

Abdel-Magied was due to speak at the PEN World Voices festival in New York, but she was denied entry to the country at Minneapolis airport. She was put on a plane bound for Amsterdam. A spokesperson from the US Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) said Abdel-Magied was – as all international travellers are – assessed for entry into the country. “During the inspection, CBP officers determined this individual did not possess the appropriate visa to receive monetary compensation for the speaking engagements she had planned during her visit to the United States.” “As such, she was deemed inadmissible to enter the United States for her visit, but was allowed to withdraw her application for admission. The traveler is eligible to reapply for a visa for future visits.” Abdel-Magied live-tweeted her brief stay on US soil. She was advertising on twitter her appearance at the NY festival, speaking on a panel titled “The M Word: No country for young Muslim women”. But her first tweet offered the caveat: “If they will let me in. I’m currently at the border and they’ve said I’m being deported. This should be fun. What are my rights?” Abdel-Magied then tweeted: “They’ve taken my phone, cancelled my visa and are deporting me. Will follow up on messages once I understand what’s going on.” Abdel–Magied wrote that within a few minutes of looking at her case, the border security officer told her she was being sent back. Sudanese-born Abdel-Magied is a mechanical engineer and rose to prominence as the founder of the Youth Without Borders organisation. She was named the 2007 young Australian Muslim of the year. She has been an prominent advocate for Muslim women, but attracted controversy in Australia over an Anzac Day tweet juxtaposing attitudes towards the Anzac legend with Australian and international policies towards refugees. She is based in London. The Guardian has attempted to speak directly with Abdel-Magied. Chief executive of PEN America Suzanne Nossel said she was dismayed by Abdel-Magied’s sudden deportation. “The very purpose of the PEN World Voices Festival, founded after 9/11 to sustain the connectedness between the US and the wider world, is in jeopardy at a time when efforts at visa bans and tightened immigration restrictions threaten to choke off vital channels of dialogue that are protected under the First Amendment right to receive and impart information through in-person cultural exchange.” Nossel said Abdel-Magied was travelling on her Australian passport. “We understand that Yassmin was traveling on a type of visa that she had used in the past for similar trips without issue. We call on Customs and Border Patrol to admit her to the US so that she can take her rightful place in the urgent international conversation to take place at the festival next week.” A spokeswoman for the department of foreign affairs and trade said it was aware an Australian citizen had been refused entry to the US. “Like Australia, the United States administers a strict entry regime. The decision on who can enter the United States is a matter solely for the US Government.” Australia’s citizenship and multicultural affairs minister, Alan Tudge, said similarly, US visas were a decision for the American government. “I just don’t know the details underpinning this and whether or not it was that she had a tourist visa, that perhaps there was evidence she was planning to do other things other than being a tourist there.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2018/apr/11/fact-checking-mark-zuckerberg-testimony-congress","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-11T23:13:15Z","webTitle":"Fact-checking Mark Zuckerberg's testimony about Facebook privacy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/apr/11/fact-checking-mark-zuckerberg-testimony-congress","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2018/apr/11/fact-checking-mark-zuckerberg-testimony-congress","fields":{"headline":"Fact-checking Mark Zuckerberg's testimony about Facebook privacy","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Facebook’s CEO Mark Zuckerberg remained calm and composed as he sat through more than 10 hours of questioning by members of Congress on Tuesday and Wednesday. His strategy appeared to be to show remorse and deference, highlight the changes Facebook had already made and pledge to do more to protect user privacy and prevent foreign interference in elections. However, when it came to the nuts and bolts of Facebook’s business model, the 33-year-old deflected scrutiny through a combination of declared ignorance, amnesia, and world-class public relations spin. Here are five responses that don’t stand up to scrutiny. The existence of shadow profiles Several members of congress asked Zuckerberg about the data Facebook collects about people who aren’t already members of Facebook. These are known as “shadow profiles” and explain why, if you were to sign up for the first time to Facebook right now, it would already know who all your friends are – thanks to Facebook slurping your friends’ full address book from their phones, photos and other data sources. Firstly, Zuckerberg said he was “not familiar” with the term “shadow profiles”. Given the widespread media coverage of the phenomenon, led by Violet Blue at ZDNet and Gizmodo’s Kashmir Hill, this seems difficult to believe. Everyone consents to giving Facebook their data Zuckerberg was pushed further on shadow profiles by congressman Ben Luján, who asked whether people who don’t have Facebook accounts can opt out of Facebook’s involuntary data collection. “You’ve said everyone controls their data, but you’re collecting data on people who are not even Facebook users, who never signed a consent or privacy agreement and you’re collecting their data,” Luján said. This seems like a big problem for Facebook because getting consent to collect data about an individual is part of data protection 101. That’s before we’ve considered whether the consent people give when the sign up to Facebook could be considered “informed”, since it’s unlikely many people read the 2,700-word data policy. Facebook has plenty of competition When asked by the Republican senator Lindsey Graham to name Facebook’s biggest competitor, Zuckerberg struggled and dodged the question by saying: “The average American uses eight different apps to communicate with their friends and stay in touch.” What Zuckerberg didn’t mention is that Facebook, with 2.2 billion users, is by far the biggest and that many of the other most popular apps – WhatsApp, Instagram and Messenger – are also owned by Facebook. Snapchat, Skype, Houseparty and others are picking up the scraps. “You don’t think you have a monopoly?” asked Graham. “It certainly doesn’t feel like that to me,” replied Zuckerberg, to a ripple of laughter. Plenty of academics disagree with that assessment, arguing that Facebook’s dominance and network effect means it skews the marketplace by sucking investment capital and profits away from smaller businesses. Just take a look at how Facebook went after Snapchat. Tracking users’ web browsing behaviour even after they log out Zuckerberg gave a vague response when asked by Senator Roger Wicker whether Facebook can track users after they had logged off from the platform. At first he said he’d get his team to follow up for accuracy’s sake. “I know that people use cookies on the internet and that you can probably coordinate activity between sessions. We do that for a number of reasons, including security and including measuring ads to make sure that the ad experiences are the most effective, which of course people can opt out of.” The Australian internet security blogger Nik Cubrilovic first discovered that Facebook was apparently tracking users’ web browsing after they logged off in 2011. Responding to Cubrilovic, the Facebook engineer Gregg Stefancik confirmed that Facebook has cookies that persist after log-out as a safety measure (to prevent others from trying to access the account). However, in 2014 Facebook started using web browsing data for delivering targeted “interest-based” advertising – which explains why you see ads for products you have already been looking at online appear in your Facebook feed. The collection of transaction data When asked whether Facebook’s tools on external websites collected transaction data, Mark said: “I don’t think any of those buttons collect transaction data.” Details on Facebook’s own site about its “pixel” tool appear to directly contradict that statement. Advertisers who want to track which of their Facebook ads make people buy their products can install a small piece of computer code (the pixel) onto their websites and this will tell which Facebook users visit which page of their website, which ones put items in their shopping basket and which ones make a purchase."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/apr/11/sunderland-newcastle-fans-celebrate-relegation-stadium-of-light","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-11T21:36:48Z","webTitle":"Sunderland block Newcastle fans’ plans for ‘relegation celebration’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/apr/11/sunderland-newcastle-fans-celebrate-relegation-stadium-of-light","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/apr/11/sunderland-newcastle-fans-celebrate-relegation-stadium-of-light","fields":{"headline":"Sunderland block Newcastle fans’ plans for ‘relegation celebration’","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Sunderland have taken discreet steps to prevent gleeful Newcastle fans from turning up at the Stadium of Light and mocking Chris Coleman’s struggling side during their final two home games of the season. With Sunderland looking certain to drop into League One, chatter on social media and fans forums suggested Newcastle fans had planned to attend the home matches against Burton and Wolves in order to gloat. Aware of this Sunderland – seemingly bound for a second successive relegation – had no cash turnstiles open for Tuesday’s 1-1 draw with Norwich and are expected to do likewise for their next two home fixtures. In 1987, when the Wearsiders were demoted to the third tier for the first time in their history, more than 1,000 Newcastle fans appeared at Roker Park to cheer on Gillingham during the play-off second leg which they won on away goals, consigning Sunderland to the old Third Division. In order to prevent a repeat, tickets for the Burton and Wolves games will have to be bought through the ticket office where staff are likely to insist on evidence of a history of attending games at the Stadium of Light. This policy should screen out mischief-making Newcastle supporters. With Sunderland’s crowds having dropped sharply – (a crowd of only 24,894 attended the Norwich game at a ground which averaged well over 40,000 a match during its decade in the Premier League) – it represents a fairly drastic measure. Yet although relations between fans of the rival north-east clubs have improved significantly in recent years, seats were smashed during a Tyne-Wear altercation at an under-23 game at Sunderland last month. Six points adrift of fourth-bottom Bolton, Coleman’s team are second bottom of the Championship and have only four matches in which to save themselves."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"music/2018/apr/16/eminem-at-coachella-review-career-spanning-set-is-a-perfect-nostalgia-hit","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-16T11:32:32Z","webTitle":"Eminem at Coachella review – career-spanning set is a perfect nostalgia hit","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/apr/16/eminem-at-coachella-review-career-spanning-set-is-a-perfect-nostalgia-hit","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/apr/16/eminem-at-coachella-review-career-spanning-set-is-a-perfect-nostalgia-hit","fields":{"headline":"Eminem at Coachella review – career-spanning set is a perfect nostalgia hit","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Paris Hilton is in the crowd at Eminem with her fiance, but are the millennials? I am standing between her and a sixtysomething white-haired man who will soon be swaying his hips to every bar. Before Em appears, Paris – who became infamous during that same weird late-90s MTV era as the rapper – takes selfies with everyone, happy to be recognised: like Eminem, she’s fighting to stay around. Hilton tells me about the time she was in an Eminem video for 2004’s Just Lose It. “I had to punch him and I was nervous,” she says. “He kept making me do it harder and harder. Eminem’s just so real.” A man behind us collapses. “Is he OK?” Hilton asks. “Did a guy just die as we were taking a picture? I’ll say prayers for him. Imagine missing Eminem and dying. Double buzzkill.” You wonder: is Eminem’s first ever Coachella headline set unmissable? Oddly, in America it’s a rarity to see Eminem live on a stage like this, unlike in Europe, where he often headlines major festivals. “We ain’t ever been on this stage. This is the best fucking time Eminem has ever had,” says his hype man after the opening number. “It feels great to be back in motherfucking America!” adds Em, as the Stars and Stripes drape the screen and he launches into White America, one of his more political songs from 2002’s The Eminem Show. “We need to start this shit off right,” he says. He doesn’t seem at all fazed by following Beyoncé’s #GOAT slot. The set takes place with a DC Comics-looking version of an industrial town – probably Eminem’s own home of Detroit. In front is a full orchestra that adds melodrama to the doomsday soundtrack that dominates his career and tonight’s career-spanning set, which contains rap-alongs for the likes of Kill You, Sing for the Moment and Soldier. Eminem plays many characters: angry dude, humorist, loser, but in the second third he posits his most relatable character: the emo outsider. He invites a guest vocalist to take on both the hefty drama of Love the Way You Lie (originally featuring Rihanna) and Stan (which featured Dido). As rain pours down on the backdrops during the latter, Hilton turns and asks if it’s real. As the clock strikes 11:11 she shouts: “Make a wish!” And just like that 50 Cent comes out, with a grin on his face like it’s 2003 and his bestselling album Get Rich Or Die Tryin’ just dropped. He spits a lethargic flow along to a trio of Patiently Waiting, I Got Money and – to the ecstasy of all here – In Da Club. “Go shorty! It’s your birthday,” hollers everyone. These blockbuster hits now feel old enough to be heritage classics. Eminem’s place here probably warrants a vintage classification, and yet he brings out the likes of emerging pop star Bebe Rexha on The Monster to bolster his relevance. He’s not afraid to confront the critics, though. US late-night host Jimmy Kimmel makes a cameo appearance on the backing screens: “I love Eminem but not everyone does,” says Kimmel, before inviting Em and his MC to do an Eminem special of Kimmel’s “mean tweets” series. His MC reads tweets aloud: “No one’s been paying attention to you since 2003.” “Remember when Eminem was actually dope?” Em takes it all on the chin. “He kinda has a point,” he says. “Coachella, can I take you back to a time when I was actually good?” From here on, the show is a masterclass in throwback entertainment. It begins with My Name Is – as sharp, fun and non-PC as it was when jostling for attention with the millennium bug. He segues into The Real Slim Shady, which stops abruptly with a record scratch when he raps the line: “Dr Dre’s dead. He’s locked in my basement.” The crowd realises that the legendary Compton rapper is going to come out. He unites with Eminem for a slew of era-defining classics: Still Dre, Nuthin’ But a G Thang and, of course, Forgot About Dre. “Y’all know who that is?” says Eminem, pointing at Dre. “I know y’all did not forget who this man is.” The crowd raps all the parts as perfectly as Slim Shady. When Em delivers the high-pitched bars of “Slim Shady, hotter than a set of twin babies / In a Mercedes Benz with the windows up when the temp goes up to the mid-80s” you’re reminded why he was once the most ferociously funny and cutting-edge in the game. Dre says a perfect goodbye with a rendition of California Love. “You know what’s next,” says Em, before letting the voice of a non-holographic Tupac Shakur carry Pac’s classic verse. He ends the set by dedicating his final songs, including Lose Yourself, to anyone who’s ever struggled; this week is the 10th anniversary of his sobriety, he says. Tonight it doesn’t look like Eminem is vying for his old throne, rather that he’s grateful to have ever held it."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"us-news/2018/apr/11/oklahoma-teachers-110-mile-march-for-jobs","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-11T21:19:46Z","webTitle":"'It's a turning point': Oklahoma teachers buoyed by success of 110-mile march","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/apr/11/oklahoma-teachers-110-mile-march-for-jobs","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/apr/11/oklahoma-teachers-110-mile-march-for-jobs","fields":{"headline":"'It's a turning point': Oklahoma teachers buoyed by success of 110-mile march","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"“Uh-oh, Trojans coming through! Uh-oh, Trojans coming through!” shouted the three dozen members of the Douglas high school marching band as black and Latino teenagers banged on drums and set the beat. Oklahoma’s teachers may not have won their call for increased wages and funding for education – yet. But after completing a 110-mile march from Tulsa to Oklahoma City to highlight the parlous state of their school system there was an air of expectation and excitement as they and their supporters reached the state capital. For the teachers, their chant – “Rain, snow, earthquake, lightning / Nothing can stop us from doing the right thing” – had a special resonance for those who had endured freezing rain and debilitating blisters. The marchers were quickly mobbed by a sea of supporters, workers from the state’s department of human services, clapping and clutching bottles of water to hand out to their teachers. “Pump, pump, pump it up!” shouted the procession. “Pump that school funding up! Pump, pump, pump, it up! Pump that school funding up!” “I am just overwhelmed. I knew this was going to be a big deal, but what it turns out to be is historical,” said Radonne Broeffle Musgrove, a 31-year veteran of the classroom who thinks the teacher’s movement is a game-changer for the traditionally conservative state. Teachers in Arizona, Tennessee and other states are also taking action. And educators in West Virginia have already won significant concessions after years of cuts. “I think it comes at a great time with the #MeToo movement and everything with women being able to finally take a stand and say: no more of this kind of treatment,” said Broeffle Musgrove. Steven House, a sunglasses-clad local barbershop owner in his late 40s with a large scar on his right cheek, hopped out of his BMW holding peace signs in the air. “I love it, dude. I’ve been incarcerated, and we people who have been incarcerated, we need education,” said House, who served nine years in the 1990s before going back to school to get his BA in psychology. “I’m down with this, man. We should have been doing this!” The band marched on, passing one of the many oil wells that dot Oklahoma City’s skyline as two competing media organizations flew overhead with their news helicopters. Throughout the march, the news copter helped to draw supporters to the side of Route 66 to cheer on the marching teachers. As the parade passed the governor’s mansion, the marching band burst out in a rendition of the O’Jays’ Back Stabbers. A middle-aged African American woman dressed in a floral dress sang along: “They smile in your face, all the time they want to take your place.” Finally, the 38-year-old marching band director, Justin Morgan, called the band to order when a police escort arrived to greet the column as they entered the state capitol grounds. Morgan, who is on strike himself, said that in his nearly decade as a marching band instructor that he had never seen energy like it. At the front of the column, struggling to hold on to the March for Education banner, was math teacher Sharon Raines, who often pays for her students to have sneakers when she sees them coming to school with duct tape over their shoes. For young African American women like 15-year-old baritone horn player Jonetta Williams, seeing teachers like Raines lead the strike has been an inspiration. “It’s just so empowering for me to see women standing up and making a change,” said Williams. As the march slowly weaved its way through the crowd, activists took the stage. One of the first speakers was the Tulsa schools superintendent, Deborah Gist, whose decision to close Tulsa schools during the first week helped persuade other superintendents from around the state to also close their schools in solidarity with the teachers. “I love y’all! I love y’all!” said Gist as she struggled to catch her breath and wipe tears from her face. Gist said: “This is not a rally. This is not a protest. This is a movement. Movements are made up of moments so here what it is important this moment cannot be the moment it has to be part of a bigger movement.” Gist called on the crowd to run for office to replace the state legislators, who are refusing to increase taxes on wealthy Oklahomans to pay for public education. Her call came as dozens of teachers from around the state have filed paperwork to run for state representative in the fall’s elections. Although the teachers are excited to be done with the grueling march, they know the fight isn’t over: the Oklahoma state house has declined to take up a bill already passed by the Republican-dominated state senate to increase capital gains taxes to pay for increased education funding. “It feels good, but I dunno: I’m kinda left with this question of what do we do next,” said 25-year-old elementary teacher Madeline Jacobson. “We are here and it’s not fixed so what are we doing next.” However, teachers said the fight would continue. Cindy Gaete, the daughter of Chilean immigrants, said: “Public education is a social justice issue, and it’s a civil rights issues. It’s day nine of the teacher walkout, but it started with West Virginia, it continued in Oklahoma, and now it will continue in Arizona and the rest of the states that want to join along.” “This is a struggle that will continue for years,” said Gaete. “I think this is a turning point in our history for public education.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/apr/11/arsene-wenger-arsenal-cska-moscow-europa-league-quarter-final-second-leg","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-11T19:31:12Z","webTitle":"Arsenal to heed ‘good warning’ from Rome before CSKA showdown","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/apr/11/arsene-wenger-arsenal-cska-moscow-europa-league-quarter-final-second-leg","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/apr/11/arsene-wenger-arsenal-cska-moscow-europa-league-quarter-final-second-leg","fields":{"headline":"Arsenal to heed ‘good warning’ from Rome before CSKA showdown","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"With Roma’s extraordinary comeback against Barcelona fresh in the mind, Arsène Wenger said there will be no complacency among his Arsenal players as they take on CSKA Moscow with a healthy 4-1 lead from the first leg and desperate to reach their first European semi-final in nine years. Wenger described the remarkable events in the Stadio Olimpico on Tuesday, where Roma won 3-0 to go through on away goals, as a “good warning” for Arsenal, who find themselves in exactly the same position as Barcelona were in before the second leg and determined to avoid similar ignominy. With the Europa League now the priority for Arsenal by virtue of the fact that winning the trophy is their only realistic chance of qualifying for the Champions League, Wenger will not take any chances in Moscow and is set to recall six players who were rested for the 3-2 win against Southampton on Sunday, even though his team are in a commanding position. “The best way to build on the advantage is to try to win the game, so we will play with our best possible team and have a positive attitude,” said the Arsenal manager, who revealed Granit Xhaka will be absent with flu. “We are in a position where I don’t think we are under threat of complacency. It is an important target for us to go as far as possible [in the competition]. Tuesday night [in Rome] may be a good warning for us but let us not go overboard as well. Yes, we have a big job to do but we are in a strong position and it is how we approach the game that will be vital.” For all their toils this season, Arsenal arrive in Moscow in good shape. Wenger’s side have emerged from the “negative spiral” Laurent Koscielny talked about before the game in Milan last month, when four successive defeats left them in a tailspin, to put together their best run of the season. The restorative victory at San Siro that followed Koscielny’s remarks heralded the start of a six‑game winning sequence that has delivered 18 goals, lifted confidence and put a few smiles back on faces. Yet there is still no getting away from the fact Arsenal’s season will be defined by what happens in the Europa League. Asked whether his own future also depends on success in the competition, Wenger did his best to avoid the question. “The Europa League is important for us, everyone knows that,” he replied. “We are at a stage where we focus on it because in the Premier League we have a very, very, very slim chance to move further up, so the Europa League is one of the big targets now.” The game against CSKA, who have failed to win any of their past six home fixtures against Premier League opposition, takes place against a backdrop of political tension between the British government and the Kremlin, and only 300 or so Arsenal supporters have made the trip. “Sport can always play a positive role in life and between countries as well. That is why football is a good opportunity always to facilitate relations,” Wenger said, when asked about diplomatic relations. “I am convinced that [tonight] will be absolutely normal and the World Cup will be perfectly well organised. I have no problem about that. But maybe sport will have a more active role during this period than ever.” CSKA Moscow (3-1-4-2, probable) Akinfeev; V Berezutski, Ignashevich, A Berezutski; Natkho; Nababkin, Dzagoev, Golovin, Kuchayev; Musa, Wernbloom. Arsenal (4-2-3-1, probable) Cech; Bellerín, Koscielny, Mustafi, Monreal; Ramsey, Elneny; Özil, Wilshere, Welbeck; Lacazette.

In the statement published on Wednesday, she said her father remained seriously ill and that she was still suffering from the effects of nerve agent used against them. She also addressed comments made by her cousin Viktoria in the Russian media, asking her not to contact or visit her in the UK. Skripal confirmed that she was safe and had specially trained officers available to her during the recovery. She also said she would give interviews to the media in time, but asked the press to have patience while she recovers. The statement comes two days after she was discharged from Salisbury District Hospital. Just over a month ago, she and her father were found collapsed on a park bench in Salisbury, Wiltshire, after being poisoned with a nerve agent. Sergei Skripal, 66, is also making progress and doctors hope he will be able to leave hospital “in due course”. Skripal, 33, flew to the UK on 3 March, the day before she and her father are believed to have been poisoned with the nerve agent novichok. The testimony of the Skripals will be crucial in establishing the credibility of the British government’s claim that it was “highly likely” that the Russian state had targeted them with the nerve agent. The Russian embassy in the UK has dismissed the statement and said there was “no possibility to verify it”, adding it “only strengthens suspicions that we are dealing with a forcible isolation of the Russian citizen”. Moscow has waged a furious media battle in an attempt to discredit this account of events. It is likely that it will want to bring Yulia Skripal back to Russia. The news of Yulia Skripal’s statement comes as residents in the Skripals’ street in Salisbury and in the surrounding area report a breakdown in the relationship with the investigation team in the last few days. At a meeting between authorities and local people on Wednesday evening, one man, who was speaking on behalf of a resident living near the Skripals, said investigators had entered a woman’s home on Sunday and asked for the mobile phone numbers and car registration numbers of the occupants. He said: “The police officers told her that because her garden backed on to the spy’s house, the perpetrators could have jumped over the garden.” Another complained that police had been entering residents’ gardens without permission. The nerve agent used on Yulia and Sergei Skripal has been tested by the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), and a report has been passed to the Cabinet Office. An executive summary will be published on Thursday. In a statement release by the Met on Wednesday, Yulia said: “I was discharged from Salisbury District Hospital on the 9th April 2018. I was treated there with obvious clinical expertise and with such kindness, that I have found I missed the staff immediately. “I have left my father in their care, and he is still seriously ill. I, too, am still suffering with the effects of the nerve agent used against us. I find myself in a totally different life than the ordinary one I left just over a month ago, and I am seeking to come to terms with my prospects, whilst also recovering from this attack on me. “I have specially trained officers available to me, who are helping to take care of me and to explain the investigative processes that are being undertaken. I have access to friends and family, and I have been made aware of my specific contacts at the Russian embassy, who have kindly offered me their assistance in any way they can. At the moment I do not wish to avail myself of their services, but if I change my mind, I know how to contact them.” “Most importantly, I am safe and feeling better as time goes by, but I am not yet strong enough to give a full interview to the media, as I one day hope to do. Until that time, I want to stress that no one speaks for me, or for my father, but ourselves.

The Guardian article on the punk-looking turtle has been shared tens of thousands of times. Interestingly, a new study suggests that because “charismatic” species (such as panda and tiger) are so visible in pop culture, the public doesn’t appreciate how endangered they are. So here are some lesser-known eccentric endangered species which deserve their moment in the spotlight. Remember: leave them alone, and do not try to buy them online as pets. And maybe consider donating to a conservation charity, too. Aye-aye As well as a someone awkwardly hitting on you in a bar, “aye-aye” is also a freakish-looking animal – with the creepiest fingers of all time. Its middle finger, in particular. We’re talking an ET finger, but longer. Not only that, but the aye-aye’s teeth grow in perpetuity. A species of lemur, the aye-aye is nocturnal, spooky (lemur is Latin for “spirits of the dead”), and has a similar way of finding food to the woodpecker: poking into trees to source grubs (but with the long finger, not a beak). I would recommend this YouTube film, which opens with the following narration: “Much like the pug, the aye-aye walks the delicate tightrope between radically ugly and cute as hell. The aye-aye resembles a cat that was bitten by a vampire and then halfway through the transformation just said ‘screw it’.” Yangtze finless porpoise It’s really sad that the Yangtze finless porpoise is endangered, because it always looks so happy, with both a sweet closed and open-mouthed smile. This type of finless porpoise, found on the Yangtze river, is a cousin of the baiji dolphin, which in 2006 became the first dolphin species to be entirely wiped out by human activity. It is estimated there are up to just 1,800 Yangtze finless porpoises left in the wild. Penis snake Yup. I am afraid you read that right. And for those sniggering at the back, the penis snake is a real limbless amphibian (it is not actually a snake, strictly speaking) which is found in the Madeira river, a tributary of the Amazon. Apart from, well, looking like a penis, the snake is also unusual in that it has no lungs. Though initially discovered in the late 1800s, the penis snake lay low, until it was rediscovered in 2011. It’s proper name is atretochoana, but that is less fun. Tonkin snub-nosed monkey Honestly, I feel like naming a species “snub-nosed” is rude. And perhaps dying out is a form of protest by the Tonkin snub-nosed monkey. The monkey is black and white and has puffy lips and blue patches around the eyes, so it sort of looks hungover. In the 1990s, it was thought that the monkey had died out, but a small population was then discovered in Vietnam. The species remains under threat from both poaching and habit loss from encroaching human activity. It is listed as critically endangered with an estimated population of just 200. Pig-nosed turtle GUYS. If we keep insulting species can we blame them for not wanting to live? Coming off as just as offensive as “snub-nosed”, “pig-nosed” is part of this northern Australian turtle’s official name. Some kinder folks however refer to it as the fly river turtle instead, but it can’t be denied that it sports a bonafide snout. Little is known about the pig-nosed turtle’s behaviour in the wild, because it is so rare. But it is known to be extremely aggressive in captivity. Unfortunately, the pig-nosed turtle has become part of the exotic pet trade, and in 2013 almost 700 of them were seized at an airport bound for the black market in Hong Kong. Saola Pretty much all you need to know about the saola (pronounced sow-la), is that it is known as “the Asian unicorn”. Although the saola in fact has two parallel horns, so … that nickname doesn’t make a lot of sense, but never mind. The saola was only discovered in 1992, and there have only been four confirmed sightings since, despite its dashing white markings. Saolas are found (or as seems to be the case, not found) in just one location: the Annamite mountains of Vietnam and Laos. Given the current global political climate, they’re probably better off out of it. Largetooth sawfish A quarter of all sharks and rays are endangered, and unfortunately the largetooth sawfish falls into this category. It can grow to 6 metres in length, making it one of the biggest fish, and it is adaptable to many habitats, moving from estuaries to creeks and billabongs over the course of a lifetime. As for the name, well, it is a sort of Ronseal name – because its rostrum (the proper name for the snout) looks like a saw. This also means it is easily caught in nets, which has contributed to its peril. Leaping lesbian lizard The impressively alliterative “leaping lesbian lizard” (or to give its proper name, the New Mexico whiptail), is a female-only species which reproduces asexually by a process known as parthenogenesis. This means that embryos can be formed even when eggs are unfertilised. Essentially, any offspring are clones of the mother. New Mexico whiptails still engage in sexual activity with each other, however, hence the lesbian label. Technically, the leaping lesbian lizard is not endangered, but it is found in just New Mexico and Arizona. So, it’s rare, and you know, that’s good enough for us when it is called the leaping lesbian lizard."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"business/shortcuts/2018/apr/13/david-schwimmer-could-he-be-any-more-in-charge-of-the-stock-exchange","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-13T11:54:50Z","webTitle":"David Schwimmer – could he BE any more in charge of the stock exchange?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/shortcuts/2018/apr/13/david-schwimmer-could-he-be-any-more-in-charge-of-the-stock-exchange","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/shortcuts/2018/apr/13/david-schwimmer-could-he-be-any-more-in-charge-of-the-stock-exchange","fields":{"headline":"David Schwimmer – could he BE any more in charge of the stock exchange?","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Name: David Schwimmer.

After surviving a scare to come from two goals down to draw 2-2 against CSKA Moscow on Thursday, Arsenal will play the first leg at the Emirates on 26 April before the return game on 3 May. Marseille and Salzburg were paired together in the other semi-final. The competition represents Arsenal’s only chance of winning silverware and is their only realistic opportunity of qualifying for the Champions League given their poor domestic form. They are sixth in the Premier League, 13 points behind fourth-placed Tottenham. Alexandre Lacazette believes winning the Europa League would “save” Arsenal’s season and could lead to Arsène Wenger staying on for another year. Asked about the significance of the competition and his manager’s future, which appears to be intrinsically linked with the Europa League, the striker replied: “It will save our season because in the Premier League we are not doing well. Winning a cup would be good. It can be the way to keep the manager, because he did so much good for the club.” With the final taking place in Lyon, where Lacazette made 275 appearances for his hometown club before joining Arsenal for £46.5m last summer, the Frenchman has extra motivation to get through the semi-final. “I really want to be in the final to play in front of my family and friends,” he said. “But it’s not only that – I came to Arsenal because I want to win trophies.” Petr Cech, who endured a difficult match against CSKA before Arsenal eventually advanced 6-3 on aggregate, admitted the players are under pressure to deliver Europa League success. “You can feel it,” the goalkeeper said. “There is a big responsibility for everyone because we know with the position we are in the league, it is difficult. “Someone would have to have a big meltdown to give us a chance to sneak into the top four through the league. We know this is our chance to book our Champions League spot but not only that, you play a European competition for a cup and for a cup the club has never won. This is another opportunity to add a great trophy to the cabinet.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/live/2018/apr/13/europa-league-semi-final-draw-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-13T10:27:06Z","webTitle":"Europa League semi-final draw: Arsenal handed Atlético test – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2018/apr/13/europa-league-semi-final-draw-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/live/2018/apr/13/europa-league-semi-final-draw-live","fields":{"headline":"Europa League semi-final draw: Arsenal handed Atlético test – as it happened","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Arsène Wenger’s side must get past Atlètico over two legs to prevail to the final in Lyon next month, while one of Marseille or Salzburg is guaranteed a spot there after being drawn against each other in the semi-finals on Friday. So, you’ve already digested the draw. Now get your teeth into this: First legs, Thursday 26 April Arsenal v Atlético Madrid, Marseille v Salzburg, Second legs, Thursday 3 May Atlético Madrid v Arsenal, Salzburg v Marseille, Europa League final, Wednesday 16 May Winner of Marseille/Salzburg v Arsenal/Atlético Madrid Arsenal will play Atlético Madrid, then. That is probably the draw Arséne Wenger had most feared but they will, at least, entertain them first at the Emirates before travelling to the Spanish capital for the second leg. And, in the other tie, Marseille and Salzburg who faced each other in the group stages, will meet each other in the last four. Another note, the winner of Marseille v Salzburg will be the nominal home team, not that that matters an awful lot, given the final will be in Lyon. Might be nice for Marseille to trudge into the home dressing room at the Groupama Stadium. Meanwhile, if you’re not already, why not sign up to our daily football email, The Fiver? Oh, well, just in case. And Arséne Wenger’s side will do battle with Diego Simeone’s team. The Ligue 1 team host the Austrians. The talking’s done ... here we go! Uefa’s director of competitions, Giorgio Marchetti, gives a little spiel about the drama of the previous rounds, and wishes the four teams in the semis the best of luck for the draw. Everybody is just itching to get on with it, though. He welcomes former France international Éric Abidal to the stage, who will draw the balls out of the hat, so to speak. Here we go ... just a few pleasantries and formalities to get out the way, and then we will know who’s playing who, and we can make presumptions about who has the best chance of reaching the final at Stade de Lyon on Wednesday 16 May. A reminder that the semis will be played on two Thursdays: 26 April (first leg) and the 3 May (second leg). Arsenal, Atlético, Marseille and Salzburg are settling down for the draw. Meanwhile, the Marseille captain these days, Dimitri Payet, has dodged a question about which team’s full-back he, if given the chance to choose, would wring inside out. “When you’re at this level, you know that the final is close. You know too that standard keeps improving. Whoever we face, we’ll have to put in twice as much effort to treat ourselves to a final.” Héctor Bellerín, Arsenal defender, has had his own say on he fancies playing. “Right now with the teams in the Europa League,” he says. “With Atlético Madrid and Milan, who we beat, these teams are Champions League teams, so for us to win this competition would mean the world.” His team-mate, Alexandre Lacazette, has gone one better; he reckons lifting the trophy in Lyon would be enough to keep Wenger in the job. No wonder Arsène can’t bring himself to predicting who his side may face, instead preferring to accept his fate. “Maybe it’s better I don’t wish for anybody and just wait for the draw,” Wenger says. “Atlético are the strongest, but let’s just play well against the team we get. Let’s prepare well for the semi.” “Who do I want to get in the draw?” says Valon Berisha, the Salzburg midfielder. “Arsenal.” His manager, Marco Rose, lifted the Uefa Youth League last season with the club’s Under-18s. Can the German upgrade to securing the Europa League time around? “I think Atlético are in a class of their own,” adds Salzburg’s defender, Stefan Lainer. “They would be the toughest opponent.” Arsène Wenger’s side avoided a scare in Moscow to reach the last four of the Europa League – but who will they face? They will surely hope to dodge drawing Atlético Madrid, while Salzburg and Marseille will be regarded as underdogs, unless they draw each other, of course.

For Josie Long and Jonny Donahoe Are Having a Baby (With You), the couple take to the stage to chat, joke and desperately seek advice on the imminent arrival of their first child. They’re taking one of the most intimate experiences a couple can have, and making it public when Long is eight months pregnant – heavy, exhausted and, she says, “physically vulnerable”. What are they thinking? This isn’t the first time the couple have smudged the line between art and life. Long is a revered art-comic, activist and queen of indie standup; Donahoe is one half of bluesy lefty musical act Jonny and the Baptists. They met when she saw him perform the acclaimed solo theatre show Every Brilliant Thing. Impressed, she invited him to co-author a new project together – about a couple falling in love. “The plan was to have intimate conversations with each other,” says Long, “a very vulnerable writing process, and what came out of it would be very unusual.” But a few months in, both parties were deeply confused. “I remember saying to [the comic] Bridget Christie, ‘I think we might be in love with each other. But it might not be real, it might just be for the show’,” Long remembers. “And she was like: ‘Fuck the show! What do you want, a show or a baby?’ And I was like: I want a baby!” And so it came to pass – albeit earlier than intended when accidental pregnancy interrupted their meticulous schedule. The couple were touring together in the political cabaret Lefty Scum. Then Long had planned to write a new standup set “about welcoming someone to the whole world. I thought it’d be such a beautiful thing, and I’d tour it loads, then we’d start trying for a baby, and I’d feel in a really good place.” Instead, the couple found themselves unexpectedly expecting on the back of few “tricky” years, as Long describes them, when she’d been ill and “not writing as much as I’d like”. “So we’re in a position of uncertainty and unpreparedness,” she says. “We’re excited and happy, but it’s frightening and unusual too. That’s where the show comes from. We wanted to have fun with that – and to ask advice from people who are parents too.” They staged an early version in Brooklyn in March, with Daily Show contributor – and parent – John Hodgman as special guest. (In London, it’s Christie.) They posed fretful questions like: “What happens if you lose the kid?” Hodgman and the audience supplied soothing counsel in response. And in return for the advice, what will their show (and the podcast that may follow) offer audiences? Having read “lots of bad books on the subject”, in Donahoe’s words, the pair aim to puncture some of what Long calls the “unhelpful, unscientific or deep-rooted in sexist bullshit” myths surrounding pregnancy. “To do a show,” she continues, “about becoming parents from – what I now realise is – our unconventional perspective. We want to coparent and we’re aware of how unusual that is.” Their job helps with this aspiration. “As comedians, we’re quite time-rich,” Donahoe says. “We can both take time off. Standup is a very flexible job.” “And also,” Long adds, “we’re both very open in our work and like to talk about what’s happening in our lives.” On the ethics of making their pregnancy public property, she admits “it’s really tricky. As comedians you want to share – but you want to share what you want to share. And there will always be people who cross the boundary in the wrong way.” Last month, in what became a comedy cause celebre, standup Louise Reay was sued by her ex-husband for breach of privacy. But “I’m not going to sue you,” Jonny promises Josie. “What would I get if I sued you? I haven’t even paid you back for half the sofa.” Long admits to anxieties, too, about how parenthood may affect her career in a still-sexist industry. “I miss having my brain being my own,” she confesses. “And I hope that once we’ve had our little maternity period I can write another show, tour it, and we can travel as a family.” Finally, that prospect – of new adventures, new horizons – eclipses any anxiety. “I’ve been writing shows that say, ‘I feel like I’m not growing up enough’ – and I don’t want to do that for ever. I want to write shows that say, ‘This is what life is like for me now,’ that tackle the world in a new way. So I’m really up for it. I think having a baby will change our perspective and be difficult and new and unusual. And I embrace all of that.” Josie Long and Jonny Donahoe Are Having a Baby (With You) is at the Underbelly festival Southbank, London, on 25 April."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/apr/14/northern-territory-town-camps-need-77m-for-urgent-repairs","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-13T22:11:47Z","webTitle":"Northern Territory town camps need $77m for urgent repairs","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/apr/14/northern-territory-town-camps-need-77m-for-urgent-repairs","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/apr/14/northern-territory-town-camps-need-77m-for-urgent-repairs","fields":{"headline":"Northern Territory town camps need $77m for urgent repairs","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The Northern Territory government will invest $25m to upgrade town camps, starting with urgent repairs to housing and infrastructure, as part of its response to a review into the Indigenous communities. But the report found that $77.7m was needed just to bring dilapidated housing up to a standard that complied with the Residential Tenancy Act. Further costs were required to address the identified problems, including infrastructure and opportunities to improve governance. “Various governments over the years had failed to provide an efficient and effective public housing service to Aboriginal people living in town camp communities,” the report said. The report found that a combination of ageing houses – the majority were more than 20 years old – as well as neglect by tenants and a lack of appropriate maintenance meant almost one in five was in “poor condition” or worse. The NT government has gsupported most of the recommendations in a 16,000-page review of town camps but it pushed back against recommendations to encourage people to move away from their homes for “economic opportunities”. The review assessed more than 700 households, as well as essential services and other infrastructure, and service-delivery arrangements. In housing refurbishments and rebuilds in Darwin alone, the estimated cost was $15.6m, with a further $32.4m for infrastructure maintenance and upgrades to meet current design standards. Alice Springs required $34.8m in infrastructure improvements to meet design standards and $24.3m for new or improved housing. In Borroloola the cost estimates were $36.3m and $14.4m for infrastructure and housing. The cost of maintaining and upgrading infrastructure in Katherine’s town camps was set at about $34.4m, with $11.2m for housing refurbishments and rebuilds. In Tennant Creek $2.8m is needed for infrastructure and $10.5m for housing. There were further costs, also in the millions, for other areas including Elliot and Jabiru. The NT government called for the federal government to match its $25m investment dollar-for-dollar. The territory has 43 town camps, mostly on the outskirts of Alice Springs and Darwin. While some have been developed or improved, others have been left to degrade, and governments have been accused of abandoning some of Australia’s most vulnerable people. The One Mile Dam town camp, bordering the Darwin city centre, has had long-running housing problems, with about half the residences having no water or electricity, and many of them being little more than fenced sheds. Bagot community on the outskirts of Darwin has reported overcrowding and social problems. The report recommended against building more homes in the camps, which it said would just “perpetuate the current cycle”. Instead it urged investment in “sustainable social housing” in regional centres which offer job and training opportunities and sustainable services. “By incentivising migration to economic centres with robust economies through sustainable social housing programs and equipping residents of town camps, who choose to transition, with the skills to participate and the means to access employment, over time, we can make a real difference,” the report said. In the meantime, housing had to be upgraded to meet the standards of the tenancy act, it said. The NT housing and community development minister, Gerry McCarthy, said while the government supported most of the recommendations it did not back the idea of encouraging people to move away from their homes to pursue economic opportunities. “We will support residents to stay in their homes and develop a sustainable future for town camps,” he said. The NT opposition leader, Gary Higgins, welcomed the review’s release but questioned the government’s commitment to improvements, since it had received the report in August last year. “I continue to question the Labor government’s commitment to truly listen to the concerns of some of the territory’s most disadvantaged people, given its ongoing inaction in relation to town camps,” he said. The report is the result of an inquiry announced by the previous Country Liberal party government in 2016 after complaints from town camp residents and the launching of unprecedented legal action by several remote communities. The Labor government received the report from Deloitte in August. The firm had been given several deadline extensions owing to the complex nature of the inquiry. In its introduction it noted this complexity and the impact it and a lack of Indigenous involvement in policy development had on Indigenous communities in the NT. “Aboriginal people are not an ongoing problem to be resolved, they are part of the solution,” it said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2018/apr/13/dua-lipa-review-pop-hydro-glasgow","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-13T10:36:51Z","webTitle":"Dua Lipa review – bouncing, ballads and full-bore pop bangers","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/apr/13/dua-lipa-review-pop-hydro-glasgow","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/apr/13/dua-lipa-review-pop-hydro-glasgow","fields":{"headline":"Dua Lipa review – bouncing, ballads and full-bore pop bangers","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Can anything stop Dua Lipa? After a patient build-up, 2017 was such a breakthrough year for the bewitching London-born singer – selling over a million copies of her self-titled debut album and cruising past some of the world’s biggest pop stars to be crowned the most-streamed female artist in the UK – that she could probably take a few months off. But Lipa has continued her vertiginous career ascent in 2018, claiming two Brit awards in February, teaming up with dancefloor genie Calvin Harris for sleek new club banger One Kiss and insouciantly cracking a billion YouTube views for New Rules, her signature hit that warns against backsliding into a lousy relationship with a stern but moreish checklist-style mantra. While impressive on paper, racking up record-breaking streaming stats can sometimes feel like an intangible, almost passive form of success. But Lipa’s industrious workrate and gruelling tour schedule (including a stint supporting Coldplay) have clearly brought palpable real-world benefits. When she last played Glasgow six months ago it was in a crammed 2,500-capacity venue. Now she is packing them to the rafters in a giant arena bowl made for 13,000. Her core fanbase skews young and female but while the screams are as loud and piercing as at any Bieber show, the crowd seem keen to reflect back some of Lipa’s worldly sophistication. Compared to most full-bore pop gigs at the Hydro, there is a distinct lack of strobing deely boppers. On magazine covers and in impeccably styled promo shots, Lipa often looks aloof or simply nonplussed. But the 22-year-old kicks off by imploring fans to “be your most unapologetic you” and “dance the night away”, and promptly leads by example through Blow Your Mind (Mwah), a slice of futuristic disco that slyly incorporates an actual kiss-off into its chorus. For sustained stretches of her 90-minute show, Lipa is in perpetual motion, bouncing and reeling round the stage in billowing black joggers, springy trainers and aquamarine bra. She is flanked by four equally tireless dancers while her long-serving backing trio of a drummer and two multitasking keyboard/guitarists jam away atop oversized stage cubes. A massive projection screen showing artfully stylised visuals and pulsing hyperspace starfields is arena-show standard but otherwise there is a distinct lack of large-scale staging gimmicks. It makes it all the more impressive that Lipa is able to sustain so many winningly jazzercise-style dance routines without missing a note. There are moments of delirious communion, as when Lipa hoists herself up on the front-row stage barrier to conduct a singalong to the yearning Be the One. But there are also moments of spine-tingling spotlight: the stripped-down obsessional ballad Thinking ’Bout You, with just her and guitar, showcases her voice at its smokiest. Strip away the headstrong beats and synthy stabs of her biggest hits and Lipa would remain a potent, intuitive torch singer. The biggest laugh of the night comes toward the end when a title card pops up dedicating IDGAF to “all the fuckboys who have done you wrong”.

The cases focus on two businessmen, convicted of offences more than a decade ago, whose criminal backgrounds are the subject of articles online. They wanted Google to take down links to those articles over what was essentially an issue of privacy. They argued that the information within the stories is no longer relevant, causes distress and goes up against the principles of rehabilitation laws. Google is arguing over the issue of the public’s right to know. It says the men are attempting to rewrite history and removing access to important information about their “serious” offending. Ben Rose, co-founder and partner at Hickman &amp; Rose, sums it up: “There is an inherent tension between an individual’s right to privacy and what information the public interest requires be available. One of the many arenas in which this issue plays out is in access to information about someone’s previous criminal convictions. “The Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974 sought to strike a balance on this thorny topic. That held good until the internet and Google’s powerful search engine rather undid matters. The right to be forgotten litigation requires the courts to once again consider where that balance lies, a question which has implications for us all.” The “right to be forgotten” principle was given a considerable lift by a 2014 ruling by the European court of justice (ECJ) – the highest court of the EU. The ruling escalated from a legal battle launched by a Spanish citizen, Mario Costeja González, who wanted search results to a 1998 newspaper article which detailed that some of his property had been sold to pay debts. The ECJ ultimately ruled in González’s favour – but with some conditions attached. The ECJ specified that search engines operating in Europe must find a balance between offering information in the public interest and protecting people’s rights to privacy and protection of personal data. The ruling – in language that has been subject to great criticism for its obscurity – suggests links should be taken down when the information or articles to which they lead appears “inadequate, irrelevant or no longer relevant”. In a key paragraph of the ruling, it effectively states that privacy outranks “the economic rights of the operator of the search engine, but also the interest of the general public in finding that information upon a search relating to the data subject’s name”. However, it does add that a “preponderant interest of the general public” in accessing the information could trump the privacy rights in certain cases and cites “the role played by the data subject in public life”. Writing for the Conversation, George Brock, professor of journalism at City University of London, said the ruling was vague and opaque. Jim Killock, executive director of the Open Rights Group, said: “The right to be forgotten is meant to apply to information that is no longer relevant but disproportionately impacts a person. Spent convictions are rather different. The people’s right to rehabilitation is an important one.” When an agreement cannot be reached, the ECJ ruling said the matter can be taken to a local judge or regulator."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"membership/live/2018/apr/14/weekend-reading-splitting-up-sydney-and-the-truth-about-your-favourite-foods","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"membership","sectionName":"Membership","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-14T07:00:15Z","webTitle":"Weekend reading: Splitting up Sydney and the truth about your favourite foods","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/membership/live/2018/apr/14/weekend-reading-splitting-up-sydney-and-the-truth-about-your-favourite-foods","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/membership/live/2018/apr/14/weekend-reading-splitting-up-sydney-and-the-truth-about-your-favourite-foods","fields":{"headline":"Weekend reading: Splitting up Sydney and the truth about your favourite foods","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The ultra-processed truth about 10 of our bestselling foods From Cherry Bakewells to Fray Bentos pies, do we really understand the cocktail of ingredients in our favourite brands?

Today’s rags suggest those plans have not changed too much, with Pep Guardiola wanting only a defensive midfielder and a winger – not an entirely new defensive concept. He has a number of targets for both positions. Midfield possibilities include Borussia Dortmund’s Julian Weigl, Napoli’s Jorginho and São Paolo utility player Éder Militão. Chelsea and Manchester United are also keen on Militão. The wingers for whom the new Tinder partners would swipe right, left, whatever include Riyad Mahrez, Monaco’s Thomas Lemar and the Jamaican sensation Leon Bailey. City aren’t the only big club who will splashing the cash this summer, even if that phrase is a bit redundant in an age of digital bank transfers and contactless payments. Not that you could use contactless for a £50m payment. For some unknown reason, José Mourinho is still unconvinced about the long-term potential of wild-tackling 32-year-old converted winger Ashley Young at left back, so he is keeping a keen one on Spurs’ Danny Rose. Spurs are resigned to losing Rose, and are preparing to click the mouse on a £20m move for West Ham’s Arthur Masuaku. Chelsea, who are able to read the mind of their as yet unknown new manager for next season and make transfer plans accordingly, also want Masuaku. In a post-Pep world, full-backs are the new sex, and there’s plenty to go round. Southampton’s Ryan Bertrand is being monitored by Spurs, Manchester United, Newcastle and Everton. United are also among those who are keen on Benfica’s attacking sensation Joao Felix. He has a £52m release clause even though he has never played for the first team. Arsenal, Milan and PSG are also keen. PSG fancy their chances of luring Thibaut Courtois from Chelsea, though Real Madrid might have something to say about that. Any other business?

Have a good weekend! Jaguar Land Rover, Britain’s biggest carmaker, is to cut 1,000 contractor jobs in Solihull in the Midlands, after a fall in sales it attributed to uncertainty caused by the Brexit vote and the government’s diesel policy. Here is our story: Europe’s major stock markets are all up as tensions between the US and Russia over Syria appear to have eased. UK’s FTSE 100 up 0.18% Germany’s Dax up 0.77% France’s CAC up 0.45% Italy’s FTSE MiB up 0.5% Spain’s Ibex up 0.92% However, Wall Street has opened slightly lower, despite strong first-quarter earnings from JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup and Wells Fargo. The latter faces a $1bn payment to settle regulatory investigations. Oil prices have edged higher and are on track for their biggest weekly gain since July. Brent crude in London is 0.3% higher at $72.22 a barrel while US crude is 0.2% ahead at $67.21 a barrel. Both have risen about $5 this week, in gains of about 8%. The pound is still trading 0.2% higher against the dollar at $1.460. Here is the statement from Jaguar: As is standard business practice, Jaguar Land Rover regularly reviews its production schedules to ensure market demand is balanced globally. On Monday we will be cascading our 18/19 production plans for the next fiscal year to our workforce. In light of the continuing headwinds impacting the car industry, we are making some adjustments to our production schedules and the level of agency staff. We are however continuing to recruit large numbers of highly skilled engineers, graduates and apprentices as we are over-proportionally invest in new products and technologies. We also remain committed to our UK plants in which we have invested more than £4bn since 2010 to future proof manufacturing technologies to deliver new models. We are not renewing TEMPORARY contracts of a number of agency staff at Solihull. Jaguar Land Rover has confirmed that it will cut 1,000 contractor jobs at its Solihull factory. Britain’s biggest carmaker blamed a fall in sales due uncertainty caused by the Brexit vote along with confusion over the government’s diesel policy. Back to Jaguar Land Rover. ITV is reporting that Britain’s biggest carmaker will announce production cuts and 1,000 job losses on Monday, and blame Brexit. The company has told Reuters that it is making some adjustments to its production schedules and the level of agency staff. It added that it would unveil its 2018-19 production plans to its workforce on Monday. Jaguar also said that it regularly reviews its production schedules. Wells Fargo faces a $1bn fine to settle outstanding regulatory investigations related to car insurance and mortgage lending abuses, the bank said. This means it may have to revise its quarterly results to reflect the final settlement. Over in the US, Citigroup has reported a 13% increase in quarterly profits, fuelled by lower taxes and higher revenues from consumer banking. The fourth-biggest American bank by assets said net income rose to $4.6bn in the first quarter to 31 March, compared with $4.1bn a year earlier. Earnings per share climbed to $1.68 from $1.35. Analysts had expected $1.61. Wells Fargo, another US bank, posted a 6% rise in first-quarter profits to $5.5bn. Earlier today, America’s biggest bank JPMorgan reported a 35% jump in profits. US companies have benefited from the Trump administration’s corporate tax cuts. In January, Jaguar said it would temporarily scale back production at its factory in Halewood near Liverpool in the second quarter. The factory builds three Range Rover models and employs around 6,000 people. Britain’s biggest car manufacturer blamed faltering sales after the Brexit vote and a tax crackdown on diesel vehicles. Here’s our story at the time Breaking news: Joel Hills at ITV is tweeting that Jaguar Land Rover will cut production and around 1,000 jobs after a slump in sales. The company is expected to blame Brexit and the slump in demand for diesel vehicles. Meanwhile, in Italy, the eurozone’s third-largest economy, talks to form a government are still deadlocked. President Sergio Mattarella has declared that there has been “no progress” after a second round of talks with political parties. JPMorgan Chase, the biggest US bank by assets, has kicked off the US bank reporting season with strong figures. It has posted a 35% jump in first-quarter profits, boosted by higher interest rates on loans and lower taxes. The bank’s net income rose to $8.7bn or $2.37 a share, in the three months to March from $6.5bn, or $1.65 a share, a year earlier. Analysts had pencilled in $2.28 a share. Further detail on the comments made by Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov at a press conference this morning, courtesy of Reuters. He said he hoped there would be no repeat of the experience of Libya and Iraq in the Syria conflict, in a veiled warning to US president Donald Trump. God forbid anything adventurous will be done in Syria following the Libyan and Iraqi experience. He said even the smallest miscalculation in Syria could lead to new waves of migrants and that ultimatums and threats do not help the dialogue. More reassuringly, he said Russia and the US are using their channels of communications on Syria. European stock markets have taken the comments in their stride and are still trading higher, with the exception of the FTSE 100 in London, which remains flat partly due to the strengthening pound. Germany’s Dax is up 0.67% while France’s CAC is 0.3% higher. On a lighter note, the appointment of Goldman Sachs banker David Schwimmer as the new chief executive of the London Stock Exchange has prompted a lot of Friends jokes. There are some snaps on Reuters quoting the Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov as saying that the atmosphere around Syria is very alarming, and that ultimatums and threats do not help the dialogue. He also said that the channels of communication with the US are being used. Gold prices are up for a second week as concerns over the conflict in Syria remain. While Donald Trump has back-pedalled on the threat of US missile strikes in Syria following last weekend’s chemical attack on civilians, the situation with Syria’s main ally Russia remains tense. Russia’s deputy prime minister Arkady Dvorkovich said international relations should not depend on the mood of one person when he wakes up in the morning. More on our politics blog. Gold is seen as a safe haven investment. Spot gold is trading 0.4% higher at $1,340.79 an ounce. And here are Mahony’s thoughts on China moving to trade deficit in March for the first time in a year. Chinese trade data has been the big focus for markets after the biggest economy in Asia posted its first dollar-denominated trade deficit in a year. A sizeable downward shift in Chinese exports will certainly provide heightened anxiety over where we go from here, with the threat of a trade war looming large over an economy which is still heavily reliant upon international demand for their products. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at at online trading firm IG, has taken a closer look at the UK stock market and the pound. Sterling has hit 10-week highs against the dollar and 11-week highs against the euro, partly related to diverging interest rate expectations for the UK and the eurozone. The Bank of England is widely expected to raise interest rates next month. The FTSE has continued to underperform its peers this morning, with the index trading in the red despite gains across German, Spanish and French indices. Dovish minutes from the European Central Bank yesterday, coupled with a wider story of dollar weakness has ensured the pound continues to outperform against its main peers. With the pound hitting a two-month high against the dollar and ten-month high against the euro, it comes as no surprise that the internationally focused FTSE 100 suffers, while the domestically focused FTSE 250 joins its European counterparts in the green. In other data just out, the eurozone’s trade surplus increased to €21bn in February from €20.2bn in January. Exports in the 19 countries sharing the euro declined by 2.3% but imports fell more, by 3.1%, month on month, according to the European Union’s statistics office Eurostat. The euro is broadly unchanged versus the dollar after final German inflation figures met economists’ expectations. In March, German inflation rose to a 1.6% annual rate from 1.4%. Spanish inflation also increased, to a four-month high of 1.2%, as did French CPI, which was released yesterday. It was confirmed at a 5 1/2 year high of 1.7% in March. Madden says: The rise in the cost of living in major eurozone countries points to an increase in demand, which is good for economic growth. David Maddden, market analyst at CMC Markets UK, says: Stocks are mixed this morning with traders cautious about being overly long going into the weekend. President Trump’s rhetoric in relation to Syria has dialled down and this has removed some of the fear in the market, but as the situation is yet to be resolved, investors aren’t particularly optimistic. We are expecting the Dow Jones to open up 22 points at 24,505 and we are calling the S&amp;P 500 flat at 2664. Oil prices are now heading higher again and are on course for their biggest weekly gain since July. Brent crude in London is up 0.7% at $72.53 a barrel, taking its gain this week to around 8%. US crude is also trading 0.7% higher, at $67.53 a barrel, and is up nearly 9% this week. European stock markets are rising, with the exception of the FTSE 100 in London, which is flat at 7,252. Germany’s Dax up 0.4% France’s CAC up 0.2% Italy’s FTSE MiB up 0.15% Spain’s Ibex up 0.37% On currency markets, sterling has extended gains, rising nearly 0.5% above $1.4292 to 10-week highs. The dollar, for its part, has touched a six-week high against the yen as fears over an imminent US strike in Syria faded and investors anticipated strong US corporate earnings. Banks JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup and Wells Fargo will report first-quarter results before Wall Street opens today. The dollar rose 0.3% to 107.620 yen, its highest level since late February. Paul Donovan, global chief economist at UBS Wealth Management, has sent us his thoughts on trade. US president Trump suggested that there may not, in fact, be any new tariffs imposed in the Sino-US trade dispute, and that the US might apply to join the TPP. Markets have given cautious welcome to this news. Welcome, because avoiding a trade war is a clear economic positive. Cautious, because market trust in US presidential announcements is, perhaps, a little limited. Re-joining the TPP could be construed as anti-Chinese. The TPP is a preferential trade deal, meaning that those outside the deal are at a competitive disadvantage to those inside the deal. On the Sino-US trade dispute, the US does seem to be pushing hard for a tweetable “we won” moment. The substance of any deal seems less important. Donovan noted that China’s trade surplus turned into a deficit in March but said this is “seasonal and temporary”. The eurozone will be publishing its trade figures for February soon. The London Stock Exchange has picked Goldman Sachs banker David Schwimmer as its new chief executive, succeeding Xavier Rolet, who was forced out in November. The 49-year-old American is due to start at the LSE on 1 August after a 20-year career with the US investment bank, most recently as global head of market structure and global head of metals and mining in the investment banking division. He has also served as chief of staff to Goldman CEO Lloyd Blankfein, then chief operating officer. Schwimmer will be paid an annual salary of £775,000 plus a potential bonus of 225% of salary, pro-rated for 2018 as he joins half way through the year. The size of bonus depends on the company’s financial performance. He will also bank a one-off payment of £1.05m to compensate for the “forfeiture of cash compensation for 2018 from his previous employer” – dubbed a “golden hello”. Schwimmer is also entitled to a 2018 long-term incentive plan grant of 300% of salary, which will vest based on performance over a three-year period. In addition, he will get a cash allowance of 15% of salary instead of pension and standard UK benefits, as well relocation support including housing allowance. Frenchman Xavier Rolet stood down as LSE boss in November 2017 after reported boardroom clashes over his management style. LSE chairman Donald Brydon said about Schwimmer: He is well known for his robust intellect and partnership approach with clients and colleagues alike. David Warren, who has been the LSE’s interim chief executive, will stay on as finance chief. Rolet was chief executive for more than eight years, when the LSE’s stock market value soared from £800bn to almost £15bn. However, the company suffered a severe setback when the planned £21bn merger with Germany’s Deutsche Börse was blocked by the European Commission in March 2017. It was the third botched attempt at a tie-up between the two stock exchange operators. Trading is lacklustre this morning on European stock markets, but they are near one-month highs. The Stoxx 600 index is on track for its third consecutive week of gains, its longest winning streak since January. Most of the first-quarter results released by European companies were positive. However British software firm Sage saw its shares plunge 19% after it cut its full-year revenue outlook. It is leading losses on the FTSE 100 index in London. British aircraft engine maker Rolls-Royce is another big faller on the Footsie, with the shares down nearly 2%. It said it needs to ramp up inspections on its problematic Trent 1000 engines, leading to extra disruption for customers and additional costs. The company is in a the middle of a restructuring led by chief executive Warren East, but its turnaround has been held back by problems with some turbine blades that have worn out faster than expected. The company said it had decided to increase the number of inspections after coming across a new problem with the compressor on Trent 1000 engines, which are installed on Boeing 787s. East said: We sincerely regret the disruption this will cause to our customers. Our team of technical experts and service engineers is working around the clock to ensure we return them to full service as soon as possible. We will be working closely with Boeing and affected airlines to minimise disruption wherever possible. The FTSE 100 index is slightly negative, trading down some 6 points at 7251.70, while the FTSE 250 is also down, by 0.2%, or 41 points to 19732.13. Shopping centre operator Hammerson is the biggest faller on the FTSE 250 index after bigger French rival Klépierre abandoned attempts to buy the company behind Birmingham’s Bullring and Brent Cross in London. Hammerson shares are down 12.7% at 454.1p, while Klépierre rose 4.3%. Two days ago, Hammerson rejected a revised 635p-a-share proposal from Klépierre, up from its initial offer of 615p a share, to be paid in cash and shares – valuing the company at around £5bn. But Hammerson said the new proposal was only 3% higher and still undervalued its business. The French company said it was walking away because Hammerson failed to provide “meaningful engagement” after the sweetened proposal this week. The board of Hammerson did not provide any meaningful engagement with respect to the increased proposal and, after careful consideration, Klépierre has concluded that it does not intend to make an offer for Hammerson. This means Hammerson can push ahead with its planned £3.4bn acquisition of smaller UK rival Intu to create Britain’s biggest property company worth £21bn. Intu owns the Trafford centre in Manchester. But what do shareholders think? Oil prices are slipping after Trump toned down his threat of missile strikes in Syria on Thursday. Brent crude in London is down 0.2% at $71.89 – but is up 7% this week – while US crude has edged down 0.15% at $66.92 a barrel. Both benchmarks have risen about $5 this week, putting them on track for the biggest weekly gains since July. They hit their highest level since late 2014 on Wednesday after Trump warned “missiles will be coming” in Syria after a chemical attack on civilians and Saudi Arabia said it intercepted missiles from Yemen over Riyadh. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. As tensions over Syria ease, trade is back in focus today. US president Donald Trump has held out the prospect of rejoining the Trans Pacific Partnership, a multinational trade pact his government walked away from last year – but only if it offered “substantially better” terms than those provided in previous negotiations. His comments on Twitter came just hours after he told Republican senators that he had asked US trade representative Robert Lighthizer and White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow to re-open negotiations. Trump’s comments were greeted with caution in the Asia-Pacific region. Japanese finance minister Taro Aso told reporters after a cabinet meeting, before Trump’s tweet: If it’s true, I would welcome it. He added that Trump “is a person who could change temperamentally, so he may say something different the next day”. New Zealand’s prime minister Jacinda Ardern also expressed some scepticism. If the United States, it turns out, do genuinely wish to rejoin, that triggers a whole new process. The TPP, which has 11 members, was set up to lower trade barriers in the Asia-Pacific region and to counter China’s growing clout. Trump pulled the US out of the pact in early 2017, citing concerns about US jobs. The news came as new data showed China’s exports unexpectedly fell in March, the first drop since February 2017. The country ran up a rare trade deficit of $4.98bn for the month, also the first since February last year. Chinese exports dropped 2.7% last month from a year earlier while imports grew 14.4%, more than expected, according to customs data. Analysts had been expecting a surplus of $27.2bn, following February’s surplus of $33.75bn. The export outlook has been clouded by an escalating trade dispute with the US. China’s trade surplus with the US fell to $15.3bn in March from $21bn in February. In the first quarter, its trade surplus with the US rose 19.4% from a year earlier to $58.25bn. US bank earnings will also be in focus today, with JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup and Wells Fargo reporting first-quarter results.

Freaky Friday tells the story of Lil Dicky mystically swapping bodies with black guest vocalist Chris Brown, and is an extreme extrapolation of a line in Lil Dicky’s 2013 song White Dude, in which he lamented not being able to use the N-word. The upshot is that in 2018 Lil Dicky, now voiced by Chris Brown in the song’s body-swap concept, is finally “allowed” to say the N-word 11 times. It’s all very amusing, if you sidestep the fact that Chris Brown is a woman-beater with whose plight both the video and song suggest the audience must sympathise, and if you sidestep the video’s racial stereotyping, and if you sidestep the ramifications of the N-word bonanza (such as the all-white women’s lacrosse team who caused a minor storm last month when they uploaded video of themselves singing along). That’s enough sidestepping to take you off the pavement and into the path of an out-of-control excuse juggernaut, but then you still face other tracks in Lil Dicky’s catalogue such as White Dude and White Crime, which tackle white privilege and male privilege. One assessment of Lil Dicky’s travails was offered in the headline to a 2015 car-crash interview: Lil Dicky Isn’t a White Supremacist, He’s Just an Asshole. Either way, Freaky Friday is the biggest hit yet from 30-year-old David Burd, who grew up in an upper middle class Jewish family in Philadelphia and worked – of course! – as an advertising creative before recording his first mixtape in 2011. By 2013, he had a viral video on his hands with Ex Boyfriend, and he followed it with a barrage of audio and video content. He has since been embraced by a number of big names: his debut album, 2015’s Professional Rapper, saw collaborations with Snoop Dogg, T-Pain and Fetty Wap. Freaky Friday is the latest in a long line of comedy rap hits, which more recently include Macklemore’s Thrift Shop and the assorted works of the Lonely Island, and date back to the 1980s with acts such as Weird Al Yankovic. Lil Dicky’s success once again raises the question of why rap and hip-hop are so apparently hilarious: is it simply that there are multiple, strong visual and sonic reference points that make parody easy, making comedy rap no different from the way metal has given the world Spinal Tap, Bad News, the Darkness and Muse? Or do the roots of hip-hop, and grime in the UK, mean that if you’re parodying them, you’re making a joke out of far more than just music? Over at BBC Radio 1Xtra, where Freaky Friday has been playlisted, presenter Yasmin Evans remembers first seeing the video on YouTube after seeing it shared on social media. The next time she went into work a listener had requested the track, which, divorced from its scene-setting video and without knowledge of its performers, can be baffling. “When I play it on air, I know people are listening going, ‘I don’t get it. I don’t understand,’” Evans accepts, “but we wouldn’t be doing ourselves justice as broadcasters if we didn’t cover the things being spoken about, or that are viral or trending. Chris Brown’s a good singer! It’s all entertainment.” She says that she has also hosted appearances with the Kurupt FM crew, from the BBC’s pirate radio mockumentary People Just Do Nothing, “and people think they’re genuinely real people. I mean, I guess people think that with [Leigh Francis’s fictional character] Keith Lemon as well.” What Kurupt FM – and Michael Dapaah, whose Big Shaq character and Man’s Not Hot track blew up after a 1Xtra Fire in the Booth session – have in common is that neither base their humour on outsiders looking in. It’s hard to question their authenticity, and it’s a similar authenticity that Lil Dicky has been shrewd in acquiring by drafting in collaborators such as Brown and Snoop Dogg. At Sony’s Relentless Records, general manager Ben Coates takes a similar view when he talks about his label’s decision last year to sign Love Island double act Chris &amp; Kem. On paper their track, Little Bit Leave It, bore all the hallmarks of a novelty single, but by drafting in producer Zdot – who has worked with Stormzy and Wiley – the finished article was not the shambles it might have been. Even the rapper Lethal Bizzle, who was initially unimpressed with the duo hijacking his catchphrase, eventually conceded: “You know what, it’s not too bad. It’s quite cool.” Coates adds that he was comfortable working on the project as “the guys had a real knowledge and love for the UK urban music scene. They weren’t trying to take the mick or culturally appropriate. They were just huge fans, doing what every other young man up and down the country who’s into grime or hip-hop was doing – and they were having fun with it.” We do seem to be a long way from the explosion of rap novelty hits of the 1980s, such as Liverpool FC’s Anfield Rap or Mel Brooks’s Hitler Rap. One of the earliest UK examples came from the children’s TV puppet Roland Rat, who hit the charts with Rat Rapping. Steve Jeffries was a house writer at Chappell Music when, in 1983, the phone rang with news that the fabric rodent wished to make a single. “It’s still one of the most hilarious sessions I’ve ever been in,” he says today, but despite the project’s ridiculousness he recalls one key point about the music: “We were keen that it sounded like the real thing. We didn’t want to take the piss.” One of that era’s biggest novelty rap hits was Morris Minor &amp; The Majors’ Stutter Rap (No Sleep ’Til Bedtime), which pastiched the Beastie Boys’ own approximation of hip-hop, and went Top 5 in 1988. “I was on a train with a friend talking about rapping,” explains comedian and writer Tony Hawks. “And the idea just came up that rapping when you’re born with a stutter would be funny.” He started performing the track on the UK comedy circuit, and in New York, where he says it received a – slightly nonplussed – standing ovation. Though Hawks says he didn’t receive any feedback from the rap community, he quickly came to acknowledge that his single’s subject matter was not entirely helpful to anyone with a speech impediment. “When you do something in a comedy set, you don’t expect it to be under the same scrutiny as when it’s Top 5 in the charts. Suddenly it’s in the playground, and then you think, ‘Well, we didn’t make it for playgrounds.’ I issued, quite rightly, an apology.” There is a parallel here with that women’s lacrosse team chanting lines from Lil Dicky’s Freaky Friday: the song’s context may involve multiple layers of it’s racist / no it’s not / yes it is / no it’s not, but when that context is ignored, all you’re left with is a load of white people chanting the N-word. An object lesson in how you can easily run roughshod over these ideas of authenticity and context is 2016 X Factor contestant Honey G. While to varying degrees tracks such as Man’s Not Hot, Freaky Friday and Little Bit Leave It are respectful to rap, Honey G’s output was not. On a very plain, objective level, she could not rap. Her act seemed to have been made deliberately bad, either by Honey G herself or by the show’s producers. It was hard to see her inclusion as anything other than reductive and exploitative. When the Guardian calls Honey G – 36-year-old Anna Gilford – she’s at home in her flat. She’s standing, she says at one point, in front of a photograph of the X Factor judges giving her a standing ovation; she says we can call her Anna, so it seems she’s not in character today. Gilford talks about a planned range of actual honey, her dreams of Hollywood stardom and her forthcoming tour – there will be kids’ dates, with a free buffet. Beyond that, our time on the phone goes badly, falling at the first hurdle when she refuses to accept that she is a joke act: “It’s quite insulting for people to refer to me as a comedy act.” But The X Factor presented her as one for cheap laughs, right? “I don’t think that’s true at all, in any way, shape or form.” It’s hard to move past that curveball. She insists that she loves hip-hop, and dismisses questions about how it would be possible for someone who truly loved hip-hop to present it, as she did, as something to be ridiculed. “It’s an insult when someone says I’m appropriating black culture,” she says later in the conversation. Her defence is this: “Of all the songs I performed on the live shows at X Factor, a lot of them came from black artists.” Honey G’s third single, released last Christmas, has been streamed on Spotify only 2,981 times. Its predecessor had about 24,000 streams, while her first release sits at around 275,000. She is losing 90% of her audience every time she releases a song: a cautionary tale that suggests an artist needs sophistication, humour, authenticity – or at least self-awareness – to make comedy rap work in 2018. Lil Dicky, though, seems to be just getting started. “People want to be entertained by uplifting music and I can’t really criticise that,” is how Ben Coates sees Dicky’s success. “He’s so smart – it seems to stem from someone who’s hugely creative, and has a complete understanding of where the market is right now, and has capitalised on it.” At 1Xtra, Yasmin Evans adds that the key to pulling off a comedy rap act – and getting it right – is straightforward. “People get the balance right if they’ve lived what they’re portraying,” she reasons. “There are things you need to be aware of. You have to be 100% real. You can’t really fake it. To do it well and represent it right, you have to do it justice.”"},"isHosted":false},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/apr/12/good-friday-agreement-mo-mowlam","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-12T14:40:15Z","webTitle":"Why deny Mo Mowlam, my stepmum, credit for the Good Friday agreement? | Henrietta Norton","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/12/good-friday-agreement-mo-mowlam","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/12/good-friday-agreement-mo-mowlam","fields":{"headline":"Why deny Mo Mowlam, my stepmum, credit for the Good Friday agreement?","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"As I watched the 20-year celebrations of the Good Friday agreement play out, my frustration and anger began to boil over. “Where the fuck is she?” I wanted to shout at the television and radio. As the day went on I decided to just avoid the media altogether; it was only going to make me cross, and that’s not what the day was about. It was a day to celebrate something extraordinary, the impossible becoming possible. Mo Mowlam was my stepmum, but for most people she is remembered for the work she did helping to bring peace to Northern Ireland. When Mo arrived as Northern Ireland secretary in 1997, the job was reputed to be a “poisoned chalice”. However, Mo not only brought the opposing parties to the table but also helped persuade a country of divided communities to come together for the sake of peace and progress. I missed Mo more this week than I do on the anniversary of her death, or her birthday. Her absence was everywhere in the British media’s coverage of the anniversary of the agreement. I felt powerless as I watched the old guard being paraded across our screens. In their defence, Mo can’t be there of course. She died from cancer back in 2005. On Tuesday, Tony Blair gave his speech in Belfast on the anniversary of the agreement signing. It was a stark oversight that he didn’t even mention her name. He made no acknowledgment of her role in the negotiations at all. Perhaps he was afraid that he might get another standing ovation about someone else in the middle of one of his speeches? I would go so far as to say that without Mo there would be no peace process in Northern Ireland. She applied her own distinctive personality and approach to the job. She demonstrated empathy and understanding. She recognised and listened to victims and survivors. She worked closely with the men but also very importantly the women – mothers, daughters, girlfriends and wives – of Northern Ireland in order to achieve peace. Mo was from a family of strong women; her father was an alcoholic which meant her mother and older sister held her family together. Her inclusion of women was imperative to the peace process – she knew that without help from the women in the community, there was no way she was going to be able to persuade the men to join the conversation. She had to find the humanity in and commonality between families and relationships from all sides, in order to help people find hope. Some have argued that Mo was not able to actually “seal the deal” in the end, and that things began to unravel on her watch. Or that there’s a “myth of Mo” and her role in the peace process. In 2005 when Mo died, Blair said of her: “It is no exaggeration to say she transformed the politics not just of Northern Ireland itself but crucially of relations between the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom, and it was this transformation that created the culture in which peace-making could flourish … suddenly nationalist, republican and Catholic Ireland had every preconception of the English up-ended and rendered out of date. She didn’t have to talk about equality. She exuded it, naturally and with an absence of affectation that was marvellous to behold … she bowled everyone over.” As a director of documentary films, I’ve spent a lot of time in Northern Ireland and the republic since Mo died. The island is a second home to me, having been so formative in my teenage years and early 20s. In anticipation of the rewriting of the history books (or at least the omission of certain characters!) I’ve been pitching a film to commissioners at various broadcasters: an authored, personal story in Mo’s memory that would celebrate and explore her legacy for contemporary women. I’ve been told “no one would be interested”. That they “couldn’t see who would watch it”. Seemingly a fitting narrative when you look at what played out on the media over the past few days. The only place I have seen Mo remembered as she should be this week was in the middle of a documentary presented by the comedian Patrick Kielty in which he recalled her honesty and straight talking. It made me smile watching the archive of a show he had hosted, with her as a guest. As he said, Mo was “greeted like a rock star, not a politician” when she entered the TV studio. A testament to her humanity and ability to connect with all walks of life. Everyone has a story about Mo, and I am constantly amazed by how many people she met in the world. How many people she touched. You can’t just erase that memory, however hard they try. She never just “flew in when the cameras were turned on” – if anything she snuck out and went to see people when no one was watching. The thing about Mo was that it came to her instinctively. She didn’t think about it, it wasn’t a strategy, it was instinct, it was passion and it was sheer determination. Mo knew the Good Friday agreement was just the beginning, she knew it was a process and when she died she hoped that whoever took over those reins would honour that, would work at that and would help the people of Northern Ireland to progress to true peace. It wasn’t the finished article, and this is where I believe people are going wrong. They are celebrating an end, a solution; but it was a beginning, a starting point. Neil Kinnock at her memorial started his speech about Mo with a very simple statement: “A light has gone out.” I often think of those words. A light did go out when Mo left the stage, and while many people will attempt to live in the afterglow of her memory, they cannot remove her from the memories of the people. • Henrietta Norton is a documentary director and writer.

Mounk writes, “One possible explanation for why young people are disenchanted with democracy is that they have little conception of what it would mean to live in a different political system.” Today most of the millions who fought against fascism in the second world war have since passed on, their children are in their 70s and 80s, and Remembrance Day is held only once a year. Confronted by this huge, and ultimately tragic, memory gap, Mounk suggests that “civic education … should spend more time pointing out that ideological alternatives to liberal democracy, from fascism to communism, and from autocracy to theocracy, remain as repellent today as they have been in the past”. Richard Orlando Westmount, Quebec, Canada We can all make a difference I read Kim Stanley Robinson’s proposal to empty half the earth of its human population (30 March) and found that, although it makes sense, there is a high chance of such a plan resulting in dystopia. Moreover, there are things that can be done now: for example, the Tesco megastore near Streatham Common in south London. There is a cluster of video advertising screens, worthy of Terry Gilliam’s film Brazil, busily bombarding the public with offers they can’t refuse. Although I agree with Robinson that, for example, it is better to have city rather than suburbia, so long as we are hooked on the consumption and growth dogma, hopes for the planet will remain slim. So, yes, let’s formulate policy to progressively switch from suburb to city, but let’s also take drastic action against our runaway consumerism. Alan Mitcham Cologne, Germany • Anna Turns quotes film-maker Chris Jordan’s despairing comment that “… individuals cannot make a difference. When 100 million people decide to do something differently, that’s when change happens” (The plastic plight of the albatross, 23 March). It is not a huge mass of 100 million that will make a difference, but individuals deciding where they can make a change, whether it is taking shopping bags into the supermarket, reusing plastic bags as bin liners, refilling their drink bottles with tap water or dropping them into the recycling. Then you will see the difference. Kitty Monk Auckland, New Zealand Canada’s monarchy fatigue About half of Canadians have monarchy fatigue, which will rise with Prince Charles as king (Unhappy and inglorious? 30 March). It’s not just his years of mistreatment of Diana, but more his pompousness and privileges, such as having his shoelaces ironed and toothpaste squeezed on to his toothbrush. Can the man not do anything for himself? A British monarch who lives in a foreign country was never popular with many French-Canadians. Canada has become a rainbow nation of immigrants and refugees who have no connection to Britain. Skipping succession one generation and making William king and Kate queen consort would give the monarchy in Canada a huge boost. But Charles has been unemployed for too long waiting for his job, and he will get it. With the Queen gone, Canadians may decide to scrap the monarchy. But for now, the Queen remains loved by many, tolerated by others, and we will miss her. Reiner Jaakson Oakville, Ontario, Canada Hit Putin where it hurts The article UK allies turn the screw on Russia (30 March) and the accompanying analysis by Patrick Wintour describe how the west has rolled up its sleeves to huff and puff in the face of Vladimir Putin’s arrogant disregard for what the west deems to be “the rules”. He has done this before with absolute impunity. On top of withdrawing western diplomats, the UK has proposed the killer blow of not sending a royal to the World Cup in Russia: something that will undoubtedly humiliate Putin in the eyes of the Russian people to a level that will have him trembling in his bed at night. If they want to hurt Putin’s pride, why don’t they just boycott the World Cup altogether? It seems inconceivable that the west is still happy to endorse Putin, legitimise his actions and reinforce his credibility by sheepishly participating in the World Cup. A cancellation of the World Cup is not something Putin could hide. I guess Fifa hasn’t got the balls. Ian Alexander Madrid, Spain Briefly • In regard to We tore the cover off an American city by Dorian Lynskey (30 March): thanks for the attention to The Wire TV series. My wife and I watched this series fully twice. It changed my thinking about many aspects of the US. It felt uncommonly honest – both in its stories and its characters. The only other television series of similar power and depth that I recall is Upstairs, Downstairs from the BBC in the 1970s. Quite different in many ways from The Wire, yet for me it shared that current of honesty, and changed my worldview.

While its parent company, Facebook, had announced a suite of GDPR controls, which Mark Zuckerberg emphasised during his testimony to Congress this week, Instagram had been quiet on the issue. GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) brings with it a number of rights for individuals, including to demand deletion of data, to opt out of future data collection, and to view the personal data a company possesses and to download it in a format that can be moved over to competitors. These were the requirements Instagram would fulfil shortly, the company confirmed to TechCrunch. “We are building a new data portability tool,” a spokesperson said. “You’ll soon be able to download a copy of what you’ve shared on Instagram, including your photos, videos and messages.” The tool will be helpful for users who want to extract what they have uploaded to Instagram. Treasured photos and videos can sometimes get lost in their original form, but currently there are few ways to easily access the high-resolution originals if they have been posted on the social network. It is unclear whether the company will also include details of a user’s advertising profiling in its data download. The wealth of information included in Facebook’s equivalent service shocked some users, who were unhappy to discover that the company had tracked metadata of their text and phone conversations. GDPR comes into effect on 25 May, which means the coming month will probably include a flurry of announcements similar to Instagram’s. Many large tech companies, including Google, have yet to confirm whether they are altering their products to comply with the regulation. A number of data breaches may also be made public next month as companies race to beat the GDPR deadline. When the regulation comes into effect, the maximum penalty for a breach multiplies vastly from £600,000 to €20m (£17m), or 4% of global turnover. According to EUObserver, the European commission intends to police that deadline according to the date of disclosure, not the date of the underlying breach. This means any company that has been withholding knowledge of a successful hack will need to disclose that fact sooner rather than later, or risk a hefty penalty."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2018/apr/18/murmer-by-will-eaves-review-alan-turing","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-18T06:30:17Z","webTitle":"Murmur by Will Eaves review – inside the mind of Alan Turing","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/apr/18/murmer-by-will-eaves-review-alan-turing","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/apr/18/murmer-by-will-eaves-review-alan-turing","fields":{"headline":"Murmur by Will Eaves review – inside the mind of Alan Turing","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The premise is startlingly ambitious: what if we could think our way into Alan Turing’s dreams? It’s the sort of thing Turing himself might have attempted as he tried to move between minds, questing for the limits of shared comprehension. But a novelist imagining the unconscious of a genius and finding words for his visions – can that be wise? Yes, if the writer is Will Eaves. Scrupulous, humane, sad and strange, this fifth novel by the author of The Oversight and The Absent Therapist is as bracingly intelligent as it is brave. Murmur is based on Turing’s experience during the period of his punishment for gross indecency, when he went to hospital weekly and quietly submitted himself to the injection of hormones that effected chemical castration. As his body and mind underwent disturbing changes, he talked to the Jungian therapist Franz Greenbaum. In the sessions of analysis and outside them, in sleep and waking, Turing pressed towards an understanding of singular and multiple identity, memory and desire. The cryptanalyst who, at Bletchley, had programmed machines to break the German naval code now applied himself to the cipher of his own trance-like visions. It’s hard to imagine a more challenging subject for a novel. The nature of consciousness is at the heart of it, inseparable from the exploration of sexuality and artificial intelligence. But in fact there is nobody called Turing or Greenbaum in the novel. Instead there is a fictional Alec Pryor and his analyst Stallbrook (who doubles, in the book’s mirror world, as a schoolmaster who in Pryor’s youth played an analogous role as observer and examiner). Eaves liberates himself from the ethical difficulty of giving people words they did not use and works with a kind of shadow history. Like the many reflected or “transposed” images in Turing-Pryor’s dreams, these characters have lives of their own but they emanate from real people and bend the light back to illuminate history’s questions. The first part of Murmur, which was shortlisted for the BBC national short story award, invents Alec Pryor’s personal journal. There follows a series of dream narratives framed by letters to and from Alec’s former fiancee, June (a movingly portrayed version of the woman who was briefly Turing’s fiancee, Joan Clarke). Each of these sections might work autonomously, though the novel accrues and arcs to become much more than the sum of its story’s parts. The most beautiful section is Alec’s dream of watching himself as a boy at school, swimming across a lake by night with the fellow pupil he loves. Shivering in their nakedness they reach the far shore, where raspberries grow, and spend the night side by side in a summerhouse. As Pryor’s body changes, he examines the constancy of this first and defining love, which has been sent underground, “culverted”, buried like Roman bullion. All the novel’s allusions to Ovid’s Metamorphoses concern the steadfastness with which love persists through bodily transformation. They are also about loneliness. Pryor considers the possibility of a shared mind, but he is an unreachably lonely ghost haunting his own past. There is little expression of anger at what is being done to him, and no thought of revenge. There is no self-pity. Everything about Pryor is more generous and far-sighted than that – so far-sighted that his thoughts move back through geological time (“ice calls to ice”) even as he hears the murmur of the future’s machines holding their secret council. The mechanical arm of a funfair octopus ride is also a primeval mollusc, scooping him up and away through time. “Progressives and atavists are aspects of the same person and ghost each other,” he observes. He understands the death of the man he loved as both an ancient tragedy and as the “set of instructions” that programmed the machine of his mind. The dreams are themselves instructions, reconfiguring the brain. The imagery is extravagant, as one might expect from a novel engaged with Jungian analysis. The boy in the forbidden garden puts on a deer’s skull, turns to the rising sun, and becomes a chimerical shaman. In the ordinary family house, where the parquet flooring matches the chevrons on Pryor’s socks, his mother appears in a red cape, mixing henbane. Some of these passages, painted, might resemble the vividly intricate surrealist work of Leonora Carrington or Dorothea Tanning. But what’s most gripping is the careful, calm, modest voice in which these weird scenes are related and analysed. One hears, at every turn, the formal grammar of a Latinist and the strenuous logic of the exceptional mathematician. Huge efforts are being made in contemporary universities to foster dialogues between arts and sciences. In this, as in most things he touched, Turing leapt over boundaries, barely noticing that they were there. He was a philosopher and a psychologist, as well as a computational mathematician and biologist. Eaves conducts narrative experiments that honour that legacy. He knows that Turing’s theories of consciousness have implications for fiction, and that fiction can operate at the frontiers of what we know about the workings of our minds. • Alexandra Harris’s Weatherland: Writers and Artists under English Skies is published by Thames &amp; Hudson.

Or the wasted time anxiously wondering if the invitation to play Trivia Crack from an ex is actually a message. Hours are lost poring over the ins and outs of lives you barely recall meeting. That’s the thing about having an account for over a decade, as I have: people who’d usually be relegated to the crevices of memory are kept in full view, as you are to them. Supposedly, that’s keeping in touch, but in reality it’s keeping score. And then, of course, there’s the family. You can’t deny your mum’s friend request, or her right to share your holiday photos to her profile, while mistagging all your relatives – so instead of flagging your pic to Uncle Abbas, she’s let everyone in the ABBA fan page know you ate a pizza in Italy. (Side story: a few years ago, a friend told her mum that “FML” – internet slang for “F*** my life”, a sign of exasperation – stood for “From Mum with Love”. That really livened up her Facebook statuses. “Nan came over for dinner, FML.”) Ergh… that little red notification box, the little red box of horror. It has controlled me for too long, especially with its most vicious feature: event invitations. “You have been invited,” reads Facebook, in its distinctly chipper Californian voice, “to the engagement party of your ex. Good job!” Or it’s an acquaintance’s uninspiring birthday bash involving a long journey, when the sofa is calling. My finger hovers over the “not attending” button when, lo and behold, I see it, the invite list, full of familiar faces. “Perhaps this will be the party to end all parties,” I think. “I can’t miss out… Maybe this party will fortify the friendship of my friends between each other, and I will be left in the cold. I can’t miss out.” But no more. If being an adult is about not giving a damn about what people think, then sign me up. No more attending events on the off-chance they might be OK. No more fretting about missing things. No more RSVPing “maybe” when you really mean no, lest you stop getting invited to things you don’t actually want to go to. It’s time to end the cycle.

Before me are two doors, marked with logos. One is a circle with a crossed line pointing down; the other, a circle with an arrow pointing off to the right. Of course, I should be able to tell which is which. But down here in the gloom, I am uncertain. I look at my phone, anxiously. Naturally there’s no signal down here. I can’t check. All I want is a pee. But I stand now on the threshold of an incident. Choose the wrong logo – the wrong door – and I’ll be the perv who barged into the ladies’ loo. I don’t want to be that perv.

I rush off through the other door. Relief. There are myriad ways by which restaurants complicate things. We know what they are: non-plate serving items, menus with print so small you need a torch to read it, waiters taking orders without notebooks and so on. But there should be a special place reserved in hell for those that, in a desperate effort to look smart or interesting, manage to complicate the simple business of using the loo mid-meal by using wacky or, worse, completely indecipherable markings on toilet doors. Anything – anything at all – that makes you pause, even just out of irritation, should be punishable by a massive fine, or at the very least extreme tutting. It starts with the most simplistic of pictograms, the ones that are so familiar we barely notice them any more, by which I mean those that insist women are instantly recognisable because they always wear skirts. (I’m rather taken by the oppositional re-engineering of that image online, which shows it was actually a superhero’s cape all along.) Then the silliness begins. At York’s Star Inn the City – a place with form; they used to serve bread in flat caps – the doors are marked “Olafs” and “Helgas”, presumably because of the city’s Viking heritage or because the management hates its customers. Really! Stop it! Stop it now! At the venerable River Café the men’s toilets are defined as such by being blue. The women’s are obviously, therefore, pink. A ballpoint pen manufacturer pulls that kind of stunt, and social media explodes. There are so many more: the myriad Japanese places that mark them “samurai” and “geisha”, which manages the neat trick of being annoying, a cultural stereotype and misogynist all at the same time; the gastropub which marks them “dolls” and “pistols”; the seafood restaurant that marks them “gulls” and “buoys”, which barely makes sense. And then there are all the graphic ones, giving topographical views of genitalia. God help us. Apart from the fact that these are all the worst ideas from Planet Stupid, there’s another concern: that women will become as confused as I was, inadvertently walk into the men’s and discover the dreadful truth. All men’s toilets are disgusting. Men have issues with aim. It’s tragic but it’s true. The solution is obvious and, happily, already being adopted by some. We don’t have gender-defined toilets at home so why have them in restaurants? Scrap the word “men”. Get rid of the word “women”. Just give us a bunch of cubicles marked “toilet”. It will do the job. What’s more it will save me both from the fear and, more importantly, extreme embarrassment."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/apr/12/finland-homelessness-rough-sleepers-britain","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-12T12:12:37Z","webTitle":"Finland has found the answer to homelessness.

It couldn’t be simpler","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"“I was born in Liverpool and grew up on a council estate. I had a clean home, toys and nice meals as a kid. When I was nine years old, the sexual abuse started. My abusers made me feel special. They gave me gifts, moneys, cigarettes and sweets. When I was 13 I ran away from home and soon found myself in the murky world of prostitution on the streets. My life was out of control.” This is how it all started for Simon. I met him 23 years later at SCT, a local charity I help to run in east London that offers support to people who are homeless and face alcohol and drug addiction. He used to make me coffee every morning at the social enterprise cafe we run. In the intervening period he had spent years in and out of hostels and institutions, as well as long spells on the streets. When I met him, Simon was sober and working for the first time in years. He said at the time that SCT “offered me the opportunity to get my life back on track. Life is worth living now. I’m looking forward to my future.” Tragically, this future wasn’t to be: soon afterwards he decided to return to the streets and died as a result. I would like to be able to say that Simon’s story is an exception. But in reality it is all too familiar, as new statistics published by the Guardian showed on Wednesday. The number of homeless people dying on the streets or in temporary accommodation in the UK has more than doubled over the past five years to more than one per week. The average age of a rough sleeper when they die is 43, about half the UK life expectancy. The tragedy is that it’s entirely within our power to do something about it: homelessness is not a choice made by the individual, it is a reality forced by government policy. As homelessness has rocketed in the UK – up 134% since 2010 – it has fallen by 35% in Finland over a similar period of time. The Finnish government is now aiming to abolish it altogether in the coming years. I recently travelled to Finland to understand how it had done this. It turns out its solution is painfully simple and blindingly obvious: give homes to homeless people. As Juha Kaakinen, who has led much of the work on “housing first” in Finland, explained to me when I met him in Helsinki, “this takes housing as a basic human right” rather than being conditional on engaging in services for addictions or mental health. This is fundamentally different to our model in the UK, where stable accommodation is only provided as a “reward” for engaging in treatment services. The problem with this is obvious if you stop and think about it: how do we expect people to address complex personal problems while exposed to the chaos of life on the streets? Sceptics will argue that giving homes to homeless people is a recipe for disaster. Aren’t we just subsidising addiction? Won’t we end up with huge bills when it all goes wrong? Don’t people need an incentive to get their lives back on track and engage in services? Actually, no. The evidence from Finland – as well as numerous other pilot schemes across the world – shows the opposite is true. When people are given homes, homelessness is radically reduced, engagement in support services goes up and recovery rates from addiction are comparable to a “treatment first” approach. Even more impressive is that there are overall savings for government, as people’s use of emergency health services and the criminal justice system is lessened. At the last election, the government committed to pilot a housing first approach in the UK. This isn’t good enough – we don’t need another pilot. During my time in Finland I didn’t see one homeless person. Within a few hours of coming back to London I walked past more than 100 rough sleepers queuing for food in the rain, just a few minutes from parliament. What we need is action. Ending homelessness is eminently achievable if we have the moral capacity and will to take proper action. We must overcome our prejudices and our apathy. The status quo is simply not good enough. • Harry Quilter-Pinner is director of strategy at SCT, a homelessness and addictions charity in east London.

At the last count in September 82 “ghost wards” were recorded containing 1,429 empty beds, the equivalent of two entire hospitals, according to data provided by hospital trusts across England. It represents a sharp increase on the 32 wards and 502 beds that were unused four years earlier, statistics obtained under freedom of information laws show. The closures, often a result of hospitals not having enough staff or the money to keep wards open, have occurred at a time when the health service is under unprecedented pressure and struggling to cope with demand for beds. Doctors’ leaders reacted with disbelief to the revelations, which come after the NHS endured its toughest winter for many years, during which many hospitals ran out of beds. “Given the pressures on the whole system, which suggest the NHS is 5,000 beds short of what it needed this winter, [this situation] is amazing and is almost always caused by not having enough money or staff,” said Dr Nick Scriven, the president of the Society for Acute Medicine. This winter there was widespread alarm that the NHS’s policy of constantly cutting beds had gone too far, with A&amp;E units full of patients on trolleys and people being looked after by paramedics in ambulances. Bed occupancy ran at 95% for much of December, January and February – far above the 85% “safe” level – as flu, cold weather and breathing problems led to unprecedented numbers of patients being admitted as medical emergencies. Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow health secretary, who obtained the figures, demanded that ministers investigate why so many hospitals are using a practice that he called a scandal. “We’ve just had doctors warning that the ‘winter crisis’ is likely to stretch into the summer and now our research reveals the extent to which beds that could be used to care for sick patients have been locked away. Given Tory ministers have allowed 14,500 beds to be cut from the NHS in the past eight years, to now learn that wards and beds have been left empty and unused is a scandal. Ministers should be ensuring beds are used at this time of crisis for the NHS,” said Ashworth. Chronic shortages of nurses and doctors and the NHS budget squeeze are forcing hospitals to shut beds, Scriven said. “These findings will not surprise any clinical staff in the NHS. It reflects issues around staffing hospitals safely – in any equation the biggest cost is staff. In years and years of trying to balance books and achieve ‘efficiency’ savings, many hospitals will have taken the opportunities to shut clinical areas if they at all can.” North Tees and Hartlepool NHS foundation trust said a lack of doctors and nurses meant it had nine wards comprising 270 beds lying empty in 2014, 2015, 2016 and 2017 – the highest number in England. Overall 92.7% of its beds were occupied last winter, well above the 85% level that health experts and A&amp;E doctors believe is necessary to reduce hospital-acquired infections and ensure good care. Last September one of its nine wards had been mothballed for 1,460 days – four years. “In 2013, the trust implemented its transformational plan which involved optimising the use of space in our hospitals to improve patient pathways. As a result, we moved a proportion of inpatient activity from University hospital of Hartlepool to University hospital of North Tees. As with many NHS organisations, the shortage of specialist medical staff to fill vacancies and our unwillingness to compromise on patient safety meant that we feel this was the right decision to make,” a trust spokeswoman said. Acute bed shortages this winter forced NHS trusts to open up an estimated 4,000 “escalation” – extra – beds, to help them cope. But staffing them proved difficult and many trusts had to hire costly agency personnel to look after patients. Dr Chaand Nagpaul, the chair of council at the British Medical Association, said: “At a time when patients are facing unacceptably long waits to be seen and the indignity of being treated in hospital corridors, it is illogical for hospitals to have extra beds available but also unavailable, because they have been taken out of use. It is vital to look at why these aren’t being used when the NHS is under such pressure.” Chris Hopson, the chief executive of NHS Providers, which represents hospital trusts, said: “Funding and staffing constraints mean it isn’t always possible to keep beds open. This is far from ideal given the NHS has at times been operating at full capacity, with some patients left waiting longer than they should for treatment given the lack of available beds.” The NHS’s beds crisis was highlighted last week when the IT manager Martyn Wells revealed that he was put on a trolley in a windowless hospital store cupboard in Birmingham to recover after an operation to tackle a stage four malignant melanoma cancer that had spread to his stomach. The Department of Health and Social Care said: “It is misleading to say hospital beds are being mothballed – trusts control the number of beds to meet demand and that’s why they were able to open 3,000 more at peak periods this winter.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2018/apr/12/edf-energy-announces-14-bill-increase","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-12T11:38:02Z","webTitle":"EDF Energy announces 1.4% bill increase","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/apr/12/edf-energy-announces-14-bill-increase","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/apr/12/edf-energy-announces-14-bill-increase","fields":{"headline":"EDF Energy announces 1.4% bill increase","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"EDF Energy has become the second of the big six energy suppliers to raise prices this week, announcing a 1.4% increase for more than a million customers. The French state-owned supplier will raise dual fuel bills for 1.3m customers on standard variable tariffs, increasing the average bill by £16 to £1,158. The increase is relatively modest compared to the above-inflation 5.5% rise that British Gas announced on Tuesday, triggering government criticism. Comparison sites said the move by British Gas had paved the way for other suppliers to put up prices, and urged households to switch. “Clearly the price rise from British Gas earlier this week has opened the floodgates and we’re now officially in price rise season,” said Stephen Murray, at price comparison site MoneySuperMarket. EDF blamed the rise on a significant increase wholesale energy costs, as well as government policies such as clean energy subsidies, which have to be paid through energy bills. It said the rollout of smart meters, a government policy carried out by energy suppliers, had also contributed. Béatrice Bigois, managing director of customers at EDF, said: “We know that price rises are not welcome and we have worked to offset rising energy and policy charges by cutting our own costs.” The firm added that 59% of its customers would not be affected, limiting the rise to 1.3m households, because they are on fixed or protected tariffs. The increase comes ahead of the government’s plans for a price cap on standard variable tariffs, but that is not expected to take effect until the end of the year. While relatively small compared to British Gas in terms of customer numbers, EDF is a big player in UK electricity generation. The government has guaranteed the company twice the current wholesale cost of power for electricity from the Hinkley Point C nuclear power station, which EDF hopes to complete by 2025, a timetable experts said this week was in doubt because of problems at a similar French plant."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2018/apr/27/from-lee-and-dean-to-this-country-are-uk-sitcoms-too-sentimental","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-27T07:00:39Z","webTitle":"From Lee and Dean to This Country: are UK sitcoms too sentimental?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/apr/27/from-lee-and-dean-to-this-country-are-uk-sitcoms-too-sentimental","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2018/apr/27/from-lee-and-dean-to-this-country-are-uk-sitcoms-too-sentimental","fields":{"headline":"From Lee and Dean to This Country: are UK sitcoms too sentimental?","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Following two best mates as they work and play, Channel 4’s mockumentary Lee and Dean, which ends tonight, takes the bromance trope to a whole new level. Not only do the titular pair spend all their time together – whether they’re grafting on a building site or getting stuck into a bit of brass rubbing (not a euphemism) – they act like a couple in the first flush of love, continually stealing affectionate glances at each during the genre’s obligatory to-camera interview segments. Male bonding may have strong foundations in classic British sitcoms, from The Young Ones to Peep Show, but the heartwarming nature of these relationships tended to be buried under layers of irritation, miscommunication and resentment. In Lee and Dean, however, affection sings out from the screen: it’s a sitcom designed to make you go soppy at the sight of brotherly love. But Lee and Dean aren’t the only ones injecting a very soft-centre into the sitcom shell. A quick scan of the iPlayer reveals a roster of awww-inspiring comedy. There’s Man Like Mobeen, which follows a 28-year-old man conscientiously and single-handedly bringing up his teenage sister. Then there’s People Just Do Nothing: the rowdy mockumentary about the men-children behind a pirate radio station. This Country, the Cotswolds-set, Bafta-nominated mockumentary follows the spectacularly uneventful lives of cousins Kerry and Kurtan Mucklowe and their interactions with the local population. It’s an extremely lovely portrait of the pair’s deep bond, most movingly rendered in Kurtan’s kind-hearted attempts to protect Kerry from her selfish father. It’s true that the sitcom has always had a sturdy thread of sentimentality running through it. Over the past couple of decades, the gloriously mundane naturalism of British comedy has made it the ideal showcase for life’s little disappointments and minor tragedies – something shows such as Only Fools and Horses, The Office and The Royle Family took advantage of in their warm, tear-jerking Christmas specials. The difference with these new shows is that they don’t save their moving moments for high-stakes seasonal fare. Instead they weave them throughout, ensuring the predominant air is one of misty-eyed but ultimately cockle-warming cheer. There’s only one real candidate for the position of soppy sitcom godfather, and that’s Gavin &amp; Stacey. Created in 2007 by Ruth Jones and James Corden – and setting the latter on the path to global stardom – it was a genial, sweet and very funny portrayal of two sets of inlaws that stressed the importance of family and the life’s run-of-the-mill joys. It was like a Mike Leigh film without the sadness – and with sicker jokes. Because Gavin &amp; Stacey was careful to counter the schmaltz with ribald and sometimes rather horrible humour (the families – the Shipmans and the Wests – were named after serial killers). Striking a balance between comfort and crudity is something many of these new shows have picked up on. Lee and Dean is packed with bawdy jokes, while This Country is speckled with gross-out gags. In fact, the beauty of the soppy sitcom is that they are often meticulously funny – which is lucky because if they didn’t have a cracking joke every 90 seconds they’d probably dissolve into a pile of unbearably sentimental mush. Despite the ubiquitous use of that very 21st-century format, the mockumentary, those weaned on a diet of dark TV comedy – League of Gentlemen, Nighty Night, Peep Show, anything Chris Morris ever involved himself in – may find these soft-centred shows conservative, if not backwards. And compared with the dramedy trend (a strain of hard-hitting and sometimes subversive comedy-drama that skimps on the jokes in favour of sensitive and intellectual discussions of identity politics and mental health), the sentimental sitcom is determinedly mainstream. It’s non-threatening comedy that hammers home what we already know: the importance of family, friendship and caring for one another. On the other hand, considering the current TV landscape – a place where drama is bleak, comedy even bleaker and the news is off the bleakness scale – these shows feel like a welcome respite. While their emotional button-pressing may look like the easy option, the soppy sitcom offers something that is currently extremely hard to come by: a large dose of niceness, comfort and joy."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"artanddesign/2018/apr/13/art-exhibitions-beuys-brazil-bomberg-the-week-in-art","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-13T14:36:05Z","webTitle":"Beuys keeps swinging and Brazil burns bright – the week in art","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/apr/13/art-exhibitions-beuys-brazil-bomberg-the-week-in-art","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2018/apr/13/art-exhibitions-beuys-brazil-bomberg-the-week-in-art","fields":{"headline":"Beuys keeps swinging and Brazil burns bright – the week in art","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Exhibition of the week Beatriz Milhazes: Rio Azul Dazzling abstract explosions of colour that update the modernism of Sonia Delaunay to 21st-century Brazil. • White Cube Bermondsey, London, 18 April-1 July.

In Alma Katsu’s The Hunger (Bantam, £14.99), a hint of the supernatural is added to the proceedings to create an absorbing, menacing thriller that had me digging into the history behind this tale as soon as I’d read the last page. Katsu opens her novel as a rescue team arrive at an abandoned cabin the summer after George Donner’s party set off. They find nothing but “a scattering of teeth”, and “what looked like a human vertebra, cleaned of skin”. She then leaps back in time, as the long wagon train makes its way across the vast empty spaces of the American prairie. Her descriptions of the land are movingly beautiful, but there is danger even here, as we learn that a child has vanished. “A young boy might be swallowed up in all this vastness, in the unrelenting space that stretched in all directions, in the horizons that yoked even the sun down to heel.” As the wagons, filled with old people, children and babies, roll onwards, Katsu imparts a sense of urgency: winter is coming, mountains lie ahead, and the food is running out. When Donner makes a bad mistake, choosing the untested, apparently shorter route through the virtually impassable, tree-choked hills, and the children start disappearing, the survivors start to realise it isn’t only the elements that are against them. This nerve-jangling, persuasive story of survival and desperation stands alongside The Terror, Dan Simmons’s excellent supernatural take on Sir John Franklin’s doomed 1845 expedition to find the north-west passage. Peter Swanson’s All the Beautiful Lies (Faber &amp; Faber, £12.99) is a slice of classic crime, a dark, atmospheric read that takes place on the coast of Maine. Harry has just graduated from college when he learns that his father, a book dealer with a rather lovely penchant for making lists (“five best campus crime novels”, etc), has unexpectedly died. He returns home to his stepmother Alice, his father’s young second wife whom Harry barely knows and for whom he now develops disturbingly sexual feelings. Harry – beautifully drawn as an adolescent on the brink of adulthood – soon discovers that his father’s death on a cliff path was not an accident. Swanson shifts his narrative between past misdemeanours and present ones, and between Harry and Alice, in the process conjuring up one of the most believable, unsettling murderers I’ve encountered for some time. Harry is hard to forget as he reels in the grip of a “revolting sense of pure grief”, which “swept through him like an attack of nausea, an absolute knowledge that he was all alone and life was meaningless and devoid of joy”. Julia Heaberlin’s unnamed protagonist in Paper Ghosts (Michael Joseph, £12.99) is also bereaved: her sister Rachel vanished 12 years ago, and she has been looking for her ever since. “It took a long, long time to find the man I believe killed my sister. Years. Dozens of interviews. Hundreds of suspects,” she says. “It’s been a singular, no-holds-barred obsession since I was 12 and my sister’s bike didn’t make it the three miles from our house to her summer babysitting job.” Her suspect is Carl Feldman, a photographer who was tried for murder and acquitted, but who our heroine believes has links, through his photographs, to a series of dead girls. Carl is now elderly and suffering from dementia; Heaberlin’s protagonist pretends to be his daughter and breaks him out of the home where he lives to take him on a disturbing, creepy road trip in the hope it will jog his memory and lead him to reveal what happened to Rachel. “I’d remember if I ran around killing people. That’s what dementia patients do,” Carl tells her. “They remember the past like it was fucking yesterday. I remember the first picture I ever shot, and I sure as hell remember what iced tea is supposed to taste like. So I’m pretty sure I’d remember what it was like to slit a throat.” But Heaberlin, author of the impressive Black-Eyed Susans, plays her cards close to her chest, careful to give away little about the motivations of either of her characters, as her heroine edges closer to the truth.

The gesture would, I told myself, be both meaningless and totally unrealistic. I have never successfully given up a single bad habit – bacon, Milky Ways, leaving the dishes in the sink overnight – so why would the urge to check Facebook work out any different? And in bald outline, the Cambridge Analytica story wasn’t enough of an impetus to change. After the news broke, most people I know, while tutting and fretting over how awful it all was, also believed themselves to be entirely immune to the effects of propaganda and ad targeting. For idiot racists, data harvesting is a prelude to mind control; for the rest of us it’s an abstract political problem. Or at least it was until this week. I have occasionally had sympathy for people who create something that becomes much bigger than anticipated and then have to scramble to explain what they’ve done. (I always thought Simon Cowell was a stark example of this, someone who, while no doubt appalling in lots of ways, was made to answer too widely for bad taste in primetime TV). If I had given Mark Zuckerberg much thought before now, I would probably have put him in a similar category, as someone I considered with vague distaste but no real animosity. Then several things happened in rapid succession to recategorise Facebook in my mind from a simple bad habit – in which the onus was on me, the addict, to seek help or move on – to something else: an entity whose sole purpose is to take the piss out of its users. It was a piece in the New York Times last week that articulated this fact more clearly than I have seen elsewhere and in a way that finally drove the point home: we, as Facebook users, are not the company’s customers but the company’s product. The other lightbulb moment came courtesy of Zuckerberg’s appearance before the Senate committee, which not only provided a handy and highly personalised visual on which to hang one’s dislike – the bland face, the android expression, the cult-like choice of Facebook-blue tie – but also offered cast-iron proof of the company’s bad faith. It was Lindsey Graham, the Republican senator for South Carolina, who finally flushed out the disingenuousness at the heart of Facebook’s utopian mission statement. Graham invited Zuckerberg to remember an internal memo that circulated at Facebook in 2016 in which the author, Andrew Bosworth, a vice-president of the company who once taught Zuckerberg at Harvard, jocularly noted that while maybe Facebook “costs a life by exposing someone to bullies” or “maybe someone dies in a terrorist attack coordinated on our tools”, hey-ho, “anything that allows us to connect more people more often is de facto good”. No action was taken against Bosworth, and even though Zuck assured the senators he didn’t agree with the memo’s statement, he also added, in a winsome aside: “Boz is what we call him internally.” For some reason it was the chummy cuteness of “Boz” that put the final nail in the coffin.

The recent report of the Commission on London at King’s College London set out how to start tackling this. The mayor of London – and the regional mayors across England – need to be given new powers to manage the delivery of skills provision in their area. London should first be given a share of the unspent apprenticeship levy to manage as it sees fit. This will build on the current plans for the adult education budget to be given to the mayor. The mayor should then be given the job to provide strategic coordination to skills and apprenticeships across London, targeting crucial shortages, including construction, hi-tech and creative industries. Making skills a top priority for the mayor will help tackle the lack of status and esteem for apprenticeships and level the playing field in London with universities. Tony Halmos Director, Commission on London • There is much truth in Polly Toynbee’s article. But the real lie is that apprenticeships are somehow superior to FE college courses. Even in practical subjects such as servicing motor vehicles or the construction trades, a college course offers a carefully structured progression through the elements of the subject, supplemented by development of practical skills in college workshops. Students are taught by staff who are dedicated to developing people and skills, rather than finishing a job to a given timescale. After a couple of years of a college course, students are ready for skilled employment or to go on to develop higher skills. It is a myth that an apprenticeship automatically offers better preparation. The companies praised by Polly Toynbee for the quality of their apprenticeships are large enough to have dedicated training schools that do much the same job as a FE college, but they are few and far between. Many of the remainder contribute to the problem of low-quality apprenticeships identified in the article. It is to be regretted that many excellent college courses have suffered from transfer of funding to apprenticeships and from being portrayed as inferior to them. Mike Lee Rossendale, Lancashire • Polly Toynbee is too kind to the government’s design of the apprenticeships scheme, 9 April), which was wrecked by “consultations” – for which read meetings with lobbyists, who castrated the scheme from the start by failing to impose sufficient obligations on employers to make apprenticeships work when they disliked them. She recognises the value of good schemes by a very few firms, but it is no accident that many firms think they can avoid them. The scheme is a failure of imagination, modelled on a much watered-down version of good French and German training programmes, rather than something that would be effective in the context of British education before 18. Polly is also too kind on those firms which she criticises, but not fiercely enough, that would much rather imagine their future poaching skilled workers from rivals than training their own, a habit so ingrained in British business that it requires very serious commitments to reverse it. Finally, although Polly hints at this, the apprenticeship scheme was never going to work without a thorough overhaul of FE. This is absolutely not only about training and skills for 16- to 19-year-olds. It is about having an FE sector capable and resourced to provide lifelong learning for adults aged over 16 to meet their needs and interests, as well as those of employers. But even if enough money were found to meet the needs of FE, the sector has been so badly run down and so ill-targeted that it would not have the capacity to absorb the money until a good deal more was done first. This is a long-term problem at the root of the failure of UK productivity, economic performance and the culture of unambition among (some) younger people outside the A-level/university enclave, not a “mere” education problem to be shoved on the bottom of the spending list. Real investment in training, FE and apprenticeships would offer hope and prospects to so many people. It might even reduce youth violence, but would certainly contribute to greater national wealth and wellbeing. Chris Farrands Nottingham • The reality is that in post-industrial Britain, where low-skilled service-sector employment is increasingly becoming the norm, most employers don’t need apprentices. Neither do they want to spend money training higher-level apprentices when there is a surplus of graduates. Toynbee is right to be pessimistic about the new technical-level qualifications, but it’s not just a question of the lack of a “parity of esteem” and differences in funding between vocational and academic education. Providing another round of specialist “alternatives” in sectors of the economy where employment trends are at best uncertain will not help many of those young people unable or unwilling to progress to university. Instead, Labour should be campaigning for a good general education for all, up to the age of 18. There is no reason why this would not include the development of relevant vocational skills required in the 21st century, but it could also allow the reform of narrow academic learning, thus increasing opportunities and enthusiasm for further study.

For lawyer Laila Dupuy, it was her divorce. “After being married for 10 years, and having four children, my husband just left to be with a woman in Dubai,” she says. “That really catapulted me into action.” Dupuy started doing freelance legal work, reviewing contracts and leases for friends and offering basic advice. But she quickly got bored with working from home and in local cafes, and found co-working spaces like WeWork too expensive. “There were so many times I just wanted to run something past someone else. I missed the community and sense of interaction that you get from being in an office – even though I didn’t want to be stuck in an office. I thought, why can’t I create a co-working space from home? And it just built from there.” Her app, Kitchin Table, aims to build a network of self-employed women happy to host and attend female-only co-working groups in their homes. Users can search based on location, skill or industry, and time, and there is a review system to rate hosts, who set their own prices. Dupuy expects most will charge between £10-£15 per day, putting it in line with many mid-price co-working spaces. Currently, Kitchin Table deducts 10% of that as a fee. Since being soft launched earlier this year, there has already been significant interest – Dupuy exhibited at South by Southwest, a conference in Austin, having been selected as one of the 30 most promising startups, and will be attending the Web Summit in Lisbon in November as part of the Alpha programme for innovative startups. “Women have said they’re really excited about the idea of using it when they travel,” Dupuy says. “And there’s been a lot of interest from women in rural areas. They know there are loads of entrepreneurs around them, but they don’t know where to go to meet them.” Academics point to the financial crisis of 2007/2008 (pdf) as the reason behind the rise of co-working. After this, increasing numbers of freelancers, particularly in creative industries, found themselves working alone on project-based work. Deskmag, which runs a global co-working survey each year, found there were 703 co-working spaces in February 2011; that had increased to 2,072 by October 2012. It estimates that by December 2018 there will be 1.7 million people working at 19,000 co-working spaces around the world. Those who use co-working spaces point to the benefits, cited in research published by the Harvard Business Review. The majority (84%) of respondents said that working in a co-working space improved their work engagement and motivation, made them happier (89%) and less lonely (83%). Two-thirds said co-working had been an important source of work and business referrals. But the monthly membership fee of co-working spaces, or lack of provision in their area, means many entrepreneurs work from home instead. Rachel Thornhill, a Surrey-based photographer and mum of two small boys, has been one of the early testers of Kitchin Table in the UK. She says the flexibility of having no monthly commitment, and being close to home, has appealed to her. She’s planning to become a host in the future. “It’s a lovely way to network,” she says. “I’ve had jobs, leads and advice from people I’ve met. You never quite know what conversation you’re going to have with somebody.” There have been other organisations exploring the concept of co-working at home. Hoffice started in Sweden in 2014 and now has more than 120 groups registered on its website. The not-for-profit organises its groups via Facebook, with the most popular locations being Sweden, Denmark, Norway and Belgium. Co-working at home has had little traction in the UK so far, despite the high proportion of self-employed people working from home in this country – figures from the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, show 59% of businesses with no employees are home-based. Annabelle Wilkins, a research fellow at the University of Southampton has been investigating why as part of the Workandhome project. “I think we will see more [co-working at home] in the UK. Airbnb took a few years to become established here,” she says. “There are also a lot more commercial membership-based co-working spaces – especially in cities like London. And one of the things we’ve been looking at is how co-working might affect the idea of home – usually it’s a family space and the people coming into it are people you know.” Some interviewees in Wilkins’ research have expressed concerns about using Facebook to organise groups, where the barriers to creating a fake profile are relatively low. Security is part of the reason why Dupuy decided to make Kitchin Table a female-only network. The launch also comes on the back of a wave of female-only co-working spaces, such as the Wing, which launched in the US in 2016, and has since raised more than $40m in investment. In the UK, Lola Hoad launched One Girl Band in Brighton last year, the investment firm AllBright – which funds female founders – now has a physical space, and We Heart Mondays opened in east London in 2017. The challenge for Kitchin Table, Dupuy admits, is developing good local networks, initially in the UK. It’s still early days, but to kickstart host sign-ups, the company will train 25 hosts across London. “But I think women like being with women,” she adds. “What I really wanted to do was build a global network so wherever you are in the world, there’s always someone you can meet, chat to, and work with.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"education/commentisfree/2018/apr/12/the-open-university-is-about-more-than-who-is-in-the-top-job","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-12T16:17:39Z","webTitle":"The Open University is about more than who is in the top job | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/education/commentisfree/2018/apr/12/the-open-university-is-about-more-than-who-is-in-the-top-job","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/education/commentisfree/2018/apr/12/the-open-university-is-about-more-than-who-is-in-the-top-job","fields":{"headline":"The Open University is about more than who is in the top job","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Your editorial (10 April) rightly notes that the problems facing the Open University are far greater than Peter Horrocks. You refer to the UCU vote of no confidence and our claim that he has lost the respect of staff. That is indeed the case. But it needs to be emphasised that over the past two weeks I have been part of the greatest single mobilisation of virtually unanimous feeling within a university that I have experienced in over 30 years working in higher education. “No confidence” and calls to resign with immediate effect have been articulated orally and by votes in a plethora of meetings, in letter-writing and via petitions in every quarter of the university – at every level. The message is unequivocal: if the Open University is to survive, a necessary condition is the resignation of the current vice-chancellor. Professor Steve Tombs Department of social policy and criminology, the Open University • You are right to draw attention to the inadequacies of the present vice-chancellor and to draw a contrast with the deep loyalty and commitment of the staff of the OU. But in pointing to central government as being mainly responsible for the current difficulties, an important dimension of the OU is missed. It is a UK-wide organisation and governments, learners and citizens in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have a claim on the institution and its progressive mission. In Wales, where the OU has been very well led in recent years, the Welsh government and the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales have supported part-time opportunities for adult learners through the maintenance of public teaching funding and have a wider view of the purposes of HE, in line with the OU’s mission. No doubt ministers there (and in Scotland and Northern Ireland), not to mention learners, will be looking closely at how failures of leadership and a neglect of part-time provision in England are causing damage to an institution that they have invested in and upon which they have come to rely on in sustaining an open and progressive vision for higher education. Ceri Phillips Cardiff • I had the privilege of working for the OU for more than 40 years. In that time, it had five vice-chancellors, with very different philosophies, personalities and styles. Looking back, I do not believe the way I worked was ever affected by how inspiring or otherwise I found the VC of the day, and the same was true of the majority of my colleagues. Our loyalties were to the university and its students, not to the person in the top job.

Those who think a glass of red wine every evening will help keep the heart healthy will be dismayed. The paper, published in the Lancet medical journal, says five standard 175ml glasses of wine or five pints a week is the upper safe limit – about 100g of alcohol, or 12.5 units in total. More than that raises the risk of stroke, fatal aneurysm (a ruptured artery in the chest), heart failure and death. The risks for a 40-year-old of drinking over the recommended daily limit were comparable to smoking, said one leading scientist. “Above two units a day, the death rates steadily climb,” said David Spiegelhalter, Winton professor for the public understanding of risk at the University of Cambridge. “The paper estimates a 40-year-old drinking four units a day above the guidelines [the equivalent of drinking three glasses of wine in a night] has roughly two years’ lower life expectancy, which is around a 20th of their remaining life. This works out at about an hour per day. So it’s as if each unit above guidelines is taking, on average, about 15 minutes of life, about the same as a cigarette. “Of course, it’s up to individuals whether they think this is worthwhile.” There is still a small benefit to drinking, which has been much flagged in the past. It does reduce the chance of a non-fatal heart attack. But, said Dr Angela Wood, from the University of Cambridge, lead author of the study, “this must be balanced against the higher risk associated with other serious – and potentially fatal – cardiovascular diseases.” The big international study supports the new UK recommended limits of a maximum of 14 units a week for both men and women, which were fiercely contested when introduced by England’s chief medical officer, Dame Sally Davies, in 2016. Other countries with higher limits should reduce them, it suggests. They include Italy, Portugal and Spain as well as the US, where for men the recommended limit is almost double. The study included data from nearly 600,000 current drinkers included in 83 studies carried out in 19 countries. About half the participants reported drinking more than 100g per week, and 8.4% drank more than 350g per week. Early deaths rose when more than 100g per week, which is five to six glasses of wine or pints of beer, was consumed. A 40-year-old who drank up to twice that amount (100 to 200g) cut their life expectancy by six months. Between 200g and 350g a week, they lost one to two years of life, and those who drank more than 350g a week shortened their lives by four to five years. Tim Chico, professor of cardiovascular medicine at the University of Sheffield, said smokers lost on average 10 years of life. “However, we think from previous evidence that it is likely that people drinking a lot more than 43 units are likely to lose even more life expectancy, and I would not be surprised if the heaviest drinkers lost as many years of life as a smoker. “This study makes clear that on balance there are no health benefits from drinking alcohol, which is usually the case when things sound too good to be true.” Spiegelhalter said it was “a massive and very impressive study. It estimates that, compared to those who only drink a little, people who drink at the current UK guidelines suffer no overall harm in terms of death rates, and have 20% fewer heart attacks.” Prof Jeremy Pearson, associate medical director at the British Heart Foundation, which part-funded the study, called it “a serious wakeup call for many countries.” Dr Tony Rao, visiting lecturer in old age psychiatry at King’s College London, said the study “highlights the need to reduce alcohol related harm in baby boomers, an age group currently at highest risk of rising alcohol misuse”. It did not take into account the possibility of mental disorders such as dementia, which could accompany the other health problems drinkers incur. In a commentary in the Lancet, Profs Jason Connor and Wayne Hall from the University of Queensland Centre for Youth Substance Abuse Research in Australia, anticipated that the suggestion of lowering recommended drinking limits will come up against opposition. “The drinking levels recommended in this study will no doubt be described as implausible and impracticable by the alcohol industry and other opponents of public health warnings on alcohol. Nonetheless, the findings ought to be widely disseminated and they should provoke informed public and professional debate.” • The headline on this article was amended on 13 April 2018 to clarify that the extra glass of wine applies on a daily basis."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"cities/2018/may/03/could-bradford-be-the-shoreditch-of-yorkshire-or-is-it-the-next-detroit-","type":"article","sectionId":"cities","sectionName":"Cities","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-03T06:30:34Z","webTitle":"Could Bradford be the Shoreditch of Yorkshire – or is it the next Detroit?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2018/may/03/could-bradford-be-the-shoreditch-of-yorkshire-or-is-it-the-next-detroit-","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/cities/2018/may/03/could-bradford-be-the-shoreditch-of-yorkshire-or-is-it-the-next-detroit-","fields":{"headline":"Could Bradford be the Shoreditch of Yorkshire – or is it the next Detroit?","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"I first fell in love with a long lost Bradford. The city I worked in briefly in my youth still had mills towering over its hillsides and tycoon mansions lining Manningham Lane. The centre was a tight group of Victorian palaces and wool warehouses. It could just echo TS Eliot’s assurance, sitting “like a silk hat on a Bradford millionaire”. There were fashionable shops in Darley Street, once the Bond Street of the north, which was jammed with Rolls-Royces. Today this Bradford is unrecognisable. A third of adults are out of work; 40% of the city’s wards are in the poorest 20% in Britain. It has the country’s youngest population and the highest level of child poverty. Few would believe that Bradford is bigger than Bristol or Newcastle, yet it must endure regular citation as “most struggling city” and “Britain’s Detroit”. Bradford council’s chief executive, Kersten England, is a woman on a mission. She burns with a determination to pull the city around, and aims “to make Bradford the Shoreditch of Yorkshire”. She declines to join the northern chorus for more grants, subsidies and attention from London. She has given up on competing with her neighbouring rival, booming Leeds. She wants “not to do things, but to help others to do them” – to facilitate the revival of an “alternative Bradford”. England has a job on her hands. The once-noble Darley Street is appalling. The place is dead, its facades boarded up or squatted by charities, and upper floors lie empty. Adjacent Ivegate, Hustlergate and Westgate are occupied by pound shops or To Let signs. In central Bradford 90% of property is reported to be vacant. This is comparable to Detroit. Undaunted, England led me through a maze of deserted alleys to her micro-Shoreditch, a subterranean warren of old storage tunnels and caves. Here a local developer, Graham Hall, has bravely invested £2m in craft beer pubs, gin bars, artisanal food outlets and music venues, cluttered with railway junk and industrial antiques. Sunbridgewells is a hipster cliche, but England sees it as ground zero of Bradford’s “creative hub”. She was so proud of it that last year she persuaded Princess Anne – hardly a hipster – to declare it open. The Shoreditch model requires others to flock to Sunbridgewells, but this has yet to happen. Waterstones has converted the old Wool Exchange into what must be its most exotic shop. A few pubs, such as the famous Sparrow, cling to life nearby. The Little Shop of Soaps briefly showed its artisanal face next to Sunbridgewells but is closing “for lack of footfall”, says its owner Tracey Lavelle. Up the road from Rawson Square is David Craig’s Assembly warehouse, host to a group of freelance designers and publishers. Craig reckons the space costs roughly half what it would in suburban Saltaire, and a fifth what it would in Leeds. But he is a pioneer. He admits he was drawn to Bradford by its underdog status and “gritty, do-it-yourself nature”. He and his colleagues “have a passion for the city”, even though only a few live there. As yet they are less a hub than an oasis. Another champion of the new Bradford, Amir Hussain, is an architect with an expanding practice in the city’s Goitside district. He wants to persuade second- and third-generation Asians to come out of their suburban enclaves into the “centre of the donut”, bringing with them some of the ethnic vitality of the high streets and bazaars visible in the city’s encircling “villages”. Bradford has long been victim of half a century of crisis in British town planning. Already in the 1970s the local council was committing suicide. As if to eradicate its past as capital of the wool trade, it began the demolition of its Victorian core and drove a road through the wreckage. Sites were cleared for blocks of what the Pevsner guide calls “mind-numbing banality”. In the 1980s the city toyed with Thatcherism under the leadership of Eric Pickles. A third of people on the council payroll were sacked, some 9,000 jobs, with no compensating upturn in private employment. Tory Whitehall gave the city a meagre reward in the form of a photography museum and a tax office. One failed – its photographs were carted off to London’s V&amp;A – and the other is closing. In 2003 the post-modern architect Will Alsop attempted a rescue. He boldly proposed to demolish the centre’s new buildings, but instead of restoring the intimacy of the old street pattern, he wanted the opposite – a “dispersed centre” and a giant lake “to let Bradford breathe”. Dispersal was the last thing central Bradford wanted. The council answered with a killer punch of its own. It cleared a 12-acre swathe of land behind the city hall for a giant, introverted shopping mall, Broadway. When it opened a few years ago, it killed all other retail activity in the city centre like a plague. I have never seen such commercial devastation caused by a single planning decision. It is hard not to warm to the determination of England and her team. Yorkshire cities are notoriously bad neighbours, and Bradford’s rivalry with Leeds, 10 miles away, is the stuff of history. But the city planner, Bhupinder Dev, knows his future lies in finding a relationship with Leeds. The contrast is almost obscene. Leeds seems rich. It has drawn big government investments in universities and hospitals. Towers of luxury flats line the old canal. Smart shops define the Headrow. Council leader Judith Blake told me her chief challenge was “an acute shortage of skilled labour”. To her, Bradford’s value to Leeds was almost humiliating – its unemployment rate and its output of school leavers. Dev and England want Bradford to be “alternative” and creative. “We simply must make central Bradford a place in which people want to live, not from which they are desperate to move,” says Dev. Successful Asians, he says, are drifting away to Pudsey on the Leeds road to avoid a Bradford postcode. Bradford has tried this before. Across the centre of town is Little Germany, a neighbourhood of handsome sandstone warehouses next to the cathedral. It was given a conservation makeover 10 years ago, and is home to the Bradford Playhouse and a scatter of studios and galleries. A large portrait of the city’s favourite son David Hockney adorns a building exterior. But Little Germany lacks critical mass and residents are wary of the place. The revival of Bradford as “creative” will take a Herculean effort. Even tidying up the city centre must fight cuts of 40% to the council budget over the past decade. The City Park cost more than £20m. The Art Deco Odeon cinema is being refashioned as a 4,000-seat venue. The city’s troubled museum of photography has undergone various mutations, now devoted to “science and media”. At least Bradford’s literary festival is a star of the north. While music venues and arts festivals draw audiences, they do not draw residents. Somehow life must be breathed into dead Victorian streets and old mills. The spirit that once revived San Francisco’s Haight-Ashbury, Manhattan’s Greenwich Village and the ever-cited Shoreditch must be found somewhere. These places recovered by sucking activity and enterprise from adjacent areas of wealth. Bradford must do that from Leeds. The Shoreditch/Detroit model requires extreme measures. It requires unused buildings to be released by their owners into a “down and out” economy. They must gradually attract artists, designers and writers, people who appear to find inspiration in dereliction. They in turn hand over to digital entrepreneurs and other “creatives”. Bradford may not be as desperate as Detroit, but the longer it sits and hopes, the more its centre will depopulate and deteriorate. The Yorkshire economy has been tortoise to the hare of Manchester’s northern powerhouse. It has depended on the employment hotspots of Leeds and Sheffield, on prosperous farming and on tourism to York, Harrogate and the Dales. This has left “cold spots” in the old mining and mill towns, Barnsley, Rotherham, Wakefield and Huddersfield. The pits and the looms have disappeared and nothing has taken their place. Bradford is the most challenging by far. It is lucky to have in England, her council leader, Susan Hinchliffe, and Leeds’s Judith Blake, leaders of stature and intelligence, who seem to get the point of Yorkshire’s future. They are well-placed to capitalise on a promised new dawn in Yorkshire politics, with Labour MP Dan Jarvis who will run for mayor of South Yorkshire. He is rumoured to have his eye on becoming mayor of all Yorkshire, of “God’s own county”. He might start by declaring Bradford “God’s own Shoreditch”.

In a speech short on detail, but long on colour and allusion, Mordaunt evoked images of past glories and wartime Britain. She also announced the launch of a new “great partnership” that, she said, would “connect all that our nation has to offer, its talents, its people and communities, its expertise and knowledge, and its resource to those in the developing world”. She portrayed the UK as “the cradle for democracy, the fight against slavery and for universal suffrage”, as well as the birthplace of the Paralympics, Leonard Cheshire and Live Aid, adding that she voted for Brexit because she believed British values should be projected on to the world stage. Speaking at the Wellcome Collection in London, Mordaunt said: “Britain stands for free trade and cooperation, the rule of law, justice and human rights. We believe in bravery, in service and in sacrifice. We believe in the potential of the people … We’re unselfish because we believe in freedom.” Mordaunt praised the British press, which had uncovered the scandal of sexual misconduct at the charity Oxfam. “Remember, we only learned about that from journalists, operating in a free press, in our democratic country. Our national values and institutions are unselfish,” she said. However, a question and answer session scheduled to follow the speech was cancelled. Responding to critics of aid spending, Mordaunt promised to ensure money was spent wisely: “To those who say please put up a shield, I say, we are … It’s a shield called UK Aid.” Development, alongside diplomacy and defence, was a key element of Britain’s strategy, said Mordaunt. “We know we can only talk softly if we carry a big stick,” she added. “And we know that without diplomacy and the 0.7% on aid we are going to need an even bigger stick.” Mordaunt promised better collaboration between government departments and tools that will allow the public to track the progress of initiatives. She also said that a new partnership with the City of London would bring down the barriers to trade and unlock investment for emerging markets in Africa and Asia. The partnership, claimed Mordaunt, would help in “achieving the global goals and delivering financial returns, innovation and markets for the UK”. Alex Thier, executive director of the Overseas Development Institute, said that while partnerships with the private sector have been talked about for some time, they are not easy to implement. “There are reasons why it’s not done now, so they’re going to have to be intensely focused on finding out where the blockages are and creating new tools and instruments and relationships to unblock that,” he said. A number of development groups warned that UK aid should not be used simply to further the country’s commercial and security interests. Tamsyn Barton, chief executive of Bond, the UK network for organisations working in international development, said further policy details were needed, but added: “Evidence clearly shows that if aid and development are used to serve the UK’s national interests, it will be less effective and poorer value for money. UK values are better reflected by keeping those we seek to help at the heart of what we do.” Nick Dearden, director of Global Justice Now, also raised concerns. “We’ve clearly seen the dangers that the big financial corporations in the City of London have done to the world over the last 10 years,” he said. “What the developing world needs is the control and regulation of these institutions so they can gain some control over their own economic development. Unfettered free trade and free markets will not solve poverty. They will make the world more unequal, more insecure, more dangerous.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2018/apr/12/family-mounts-legal-challenge-to-northamptonshire-library-cuts","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-12T14:24:48Z","webTitle":"Family mounts legal challenge to Northamptonshire library cuts","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/apr/12/family-mounts-legal-challenge-to-northamptonshire-library-cuts","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/apr/12/family-mounts-legal-challenge-to-northamptonshire-library-cuts","fields":{"headline":"Family mounts legal challenge to Northamptonshire library cuts","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Northamptonshire county council is facing a series of legal challenges over plans to close 21 libraries, after a young resident applied for a judicial review of a decision campaigners say will have a “devastating impact” on families. The action joins a separate case launched by residents in support of local libraries, as well as a formal complaint submitted to the secretary of state for culture, Matt Hancock, by the libraries body Cilip, which suggests the council has failed to meet its statutory duty to provide a “comprehensive and efficient” library service. The closures, which councillors approved in February, have been branded “monstrous” by the Northampton comics author Alan Moore. Law firm Irwin Mitchell said on Thursday that it had issued an application for a judicial review and an urgent hearing after being instructed to act for a child and their family. “Many people using the library services are children, or are elderly, disabled, or from low-income households, and they may struggle to access the library provision in larger towns,” said Irwin Mitchell’s Caroline Barrett. “These cuts are extensive and our client is concerned that this will have a very significant impact upon their ability to access a library service and the impact on local residents, many of whom live in rural areas. Our clients believe that, if implemented, these cuts will have a huge detrimental impact on the local community in Northamptonshire.” Barrett said her client believes the council “failed to carry out a lawful public consultation into the proposals and has not conducted a full and lawful assessment of how vulnerable people will be affected”, has also “not considered how to promote and safeguard the welfare of local children”, and is failing to provide the statutory requirement of a comprehensive public library service. The child’s mother said: “These cuts are not fair. They will have a devastating impact on families like ourselves, but also on the most vulnerable people within our community. The libraries offer us so much more than just books. They offer residents access to the relevant district council’s one-stop shop, blue badge and bus pass renewal, children’s services and plenty more services that residents rely on.” The law firm Watkins and Gunn, which is representing local campaign groups in the second legal challenge, has also applied for a judicial review. Watkins and Gunn’s Michael Imperato said there were “several holes” in the council’s decision. Hancock is currently considering whether to launch a government inquiry into the situation in Northamptonshire, which declared itself effectively bankrupt earlier this year. The closures would leave Northamptonshire with eight large and seven medium branches – one library for every 60,000 residents, according to the all-party parliamentary group for libraries."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/ng-interactive/2018/apr/15/satellite-pictures-airstrikes-syria","type":"interactive","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-15T19:40:51Z","webTitle":"Before and after: satellite pictures of airstrikes in Syria","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2018/apr/15/satellite-pictures-airstrikes-syria","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/ng-interactive/2018/apr/15/satellite-pictures-airstrikes-syria","fields":{"headline":"Before and after: satellite pictures of airstrikes in Syria","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The governments of the US, UK and France say 105 missiles were launched at three sites in Syria as part of a coordinated operation early on the morning of 14 April, at around 4am local time. The air and sea strikes were a response to an alleged chemical attack in Douma a week before, which killed at least 42 people and injured hundreds. Him Shinshar chemical weapons storage site The chairman of the US joint chiefs of staff, Gen Joseph Dunford, said Him Shinshar was “the primary location of Syrian sarin and precursor production equipment”. A total of 22 missiles from France, the United Kingdom and the United States hit this site, including eight British Storm Shadow missiles and nine American Tomahawk missiles. The MoD said the facility was a former missile base, located around 15 miles west of Homs, where the Syrian regime was believed to keep a stockpile of chemical weapon precursors, which can be used to make blister agents such as mustard gas or nerve agents such as sarin. Him Shinshar chemical weapons bunker The site west of the city of Homs was an alleged underground chemical weapons storage facility, doubling as a command post. Seven SCALP missiles hit the bunker, according to the US military. The image below, released by the US Department of Defense, shows the damage up close. Barzah research and development centre Damascus The scientific research facility in Barzeh, north of Damascus, was purported to be the centre of Bashar al-Assad’s chemical weapons programme. Footage and photographs after the raid showed destroyed concrete office blocks and Syrian soldiers picking their way through the rubble. According to Lt Gen Kenneth McKenzie, who directs the US military’s joint staff, 76 missiles were fired at the research centre in the Syrian capital, comprising 57 Tomahawk cruise missiles and 19 air-to-surface missiles. In May last year, the BBC reported that the Barzah site was being used by the Syrian regime to install chemical weapons on long-range missiles, violating the 2013 agreement to eliminate chemical weapons from the country.

Parents had already been advised in January to limit their children’s two permitted daily snacks to less than 100 calories each, which made some of them quite cross. Now they were being told that their lunches and dinners should not exceed 600 calories each, or 400 for breakfast. Many were left scratching their heads about why the plan leaves men with 900 spare calories – and women 400 – within their daily recommended allowance. But, furthermore, you could live off booze-sodden bacon butties and Haribo and still stick within these calorie counts – and that almost certainly wouldn’t save the NHS any money. Could this strategy end up backfiring as badly as abstinence-based sex education policies – which lead to an increase teen pregnancies? Or the old advice that low-fat products trump foods naturally high in saturated fat, which led to everyone ditching butter for margarine full of transfats. Eventually, of course, the latter was outed as the least healthy type of fat a person can consume. No matter how much groundwork policy wonks do, the risk of unintended consequences is always lurking. To be fair, the government is taking a multipronged approach with obesity, asking food companies to reduce calories by 20%, either by reformulating products or changing portion sizes. And the sugary-drinks levy now in effect means any high-sugar beverage-makers who haven’t reduced levels will have to swallow the tax. In response, AG Barr, makers of Irn Bru, has devastated fans by halving added sugar, although – unintended consequence alert – the drink now contains sweeteners, too, which are also linked with weight gain, diabetes and heart disease. With drinks companies passing some of their high-sugar levies on to consumers, there is yet another potential unintended consequence studied by researchers: more boozing. A study published in the Journal of Epidemiology and Public Health has found that if prices of high-sugar drinks rise, people could end up buying more beer, cider and wine, along with juices (some as sugary as fizzy pop) and diet drinks (sweeteners again). Oddly though, alcohol sales were projected to decrease if “medium sugar” (as opposed to “high sugar”) drinks go up in price. The researchers, who used economic modelling techniques based on reams of consumer data, don’t as yet know why any of this would be. It’s complicated. Meanwhile a second research paper has spotted a flaw in the government’s “responsibility deal” with drinks makers. The industry agreed on reductions in alcohol levels by 2015, but while more low-alcohol products are on offer, things aren’t panning out as expected. Cambridge University researchers have scrutinised how low-alcohol drinks are being promoted by Tesco, Asda, Sainsbury’s and Morrisons and found that consumers are being prompted to buy these beverages in situations where they wouldn’t ordinarily hit the bottle. The drinks are presented as a perfect lunchtime treat, and as healthy options next to pictures of fruit. “Lower-strength wines and beers appear to be marketed not as substitutes for higher-strength products, but as ones that can be consumed on additional occasions with an added implication of healthiness,” wrote the researchers. Make that an “irresponsibility deal” then. The trouble is that industry, the wider world and people themselves present an unpredictable landscape, says Gaby Judah, a researcher in behavioural change at Imperial College London. “You don’t know how drinks companies are going to pass on that price rise in the longer term. There are actually a number of different tools that can be used and you need to look at everything that’s available, like restrictions in portion sizing, advertising, price promotions, better health labelling, not having unhealthy products at the checkout or end of aisles.” At least researchers such as Judah have back catalogues of failures in the literature to inform them, but sometimes, when an idea feels like a no-brainer, initiatives can be rolled out unchecked. She cites an unfortunate example: “One university campaign tried to highlight how terrible it was that students were binge drinking, but in fact this seemed to normalise it, and the campaign actually increased binge drinking.” Research, testing and monitoring for unintended consequences are key, she says. “They could have predicted that [outcome] from the literature, which shows that making a behaviour seem like a social norm encourages more people to do it. You need to try to normalise the behaviour you want – in this case that would be that people don’t actually drink that much.” Perhaps this is a failing in obesity messaging, too, in which it is hammered home just how increasingly common being overweight is. Not that you can fake it to make it in a health campaign and pretend that most people live on vegetables and pulses alone, or that sobriety is more common than binge drinking at certain universities. “You can’t lie,” says Judah. “It may just be that a social-norm intervention is not right in this situation.” And yet, it worked wonders for late taxpayers. When HRMC trumpeted the fact that most people settle up on time, the stragglers started coughing up. “Also with handwashing, in hospitals and in the general public,” says Judah. “Making it seem like everybody is washing their hands when they’re supposed to is likely to have an impact on handwashing behaviour. You have to work out what’s an appropriate approach for the population.” The blindingly obvious stumbling block with lifestyle-related public health campaigns is that consuming unhealthy foods and drinks is, of course, still the social norm, and is often the cheaper and more accessible option. Half of the UK’s shopping baskets currently contain “ultra-processed foods” – the nation’s tastebuds are attuned to them. As it stands, as far as vegetable consumption goes, we are living in the 1970s. Intended consequences, it seems, are a long way off."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/apr/12/clara-ponsati-catalan-academic-lawyer-accuses-spain-abusing-european-arrest-warrant-extradition-hearing","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-12T12:40:11Z","webTitle":"Catalan academic's lawyer accuses Spain of abusing legal process","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/apr/12/clara-ponsati-catalan-academic-lawyer-accuses-spain-abusing-european-arrest-warrant-extradition-hearing","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/apr/12/clara-ponsati-catalan-academic-lawyer-accuses-spain-abusing-european-arrest-warrant-extradition-hearing","fields":{"headline":"Catalan academic's lawyer accuses Spain of abusing legal process","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Lawyers for Clara Ponsatí, the Catalan academic facing extradition from Scotland to Spain on charges of rebellion, have accused the Spanish government of abusing the European arrest warrant. At a hearing on Thursday morning at Edinburgh sheriff court, Gordon Jackson QC said: “The fundamental position which is taken here is the abuse of process. This is wrapping up in legalistic form something which is purely a political decision.” Ponsatí faces charges of rebellion and misusing €1.6m (£1.4m) of public funds in her role in the Catalan regional government, which organised an illegal independence referendum in October. The 19-page warrant blames her in part for injuries it claims members of the Spanish security forces suffered as they attempted to close down polling stations. Making a brief statement to the press after the hearing, Ponsatí’s lawyer, Aamer Anwar, said: “Scotland has a proud history of protecting those who face a grave risk of injustice and oppression, and we will argue that Spain is guilty of abusing the European arrest warrant, which was never meant to be used as a tool of political repression.” The highly regarded head of St Andrews University’s economics school returned to Scotland via Belgium when she fled Spain along with the former Catalan president Carles Puigdemont and three other members of his team after their government was forced from office. Jackson told the court that a substantial amount of preparation remained to be done on the case for the full hearing, which he estimated would last at least eight days and require witnesses from outside the jurisdiction, raising the possibility of Spanish authorities being called. The next procedural hearing was postponed until 15 May, with the full hearing provisionally scheduled for 30 July. A crowd of about 50 supporters gathered outside the court, waving saltires and Catalan flags, and chanting “Carla! Carla!” as Ponsatí emerged following her appearance. A crowdfunding appeal to support her legal costs has reached more than £234,000. Last week, a German court rejected rebellion as grounds for Puigdemont’s extradition from the country and released him on bail. Continuing attempts to form a new Catalan government suffered another setback on Thursday after the supreme court once again refused to authorise the release of an MP who has been put forward as a presidential candidate. The judge argued that Jordi Sànchez, who has been in prison since October, might resume his secessionist efforts if allowed to attend the investiture debate on Friday. The region has been without a government since late December, when pro-independence Catalan parties retained their parliamentary majority in an election called by Madrid after the Spanish prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, sacked Puigdemont and his cabinet. Also on Thursday, a judge at Spain’s national court ruled that the organiser of the grassroots Catalan pro-independence group Committeesfor the Defence of the Republic should not face charges of rebellion and terrorism over her alleged role in Easter protests that saw roads and railways blocked. The judge ordered the woman, who was arrested by the Guardia Civil on Tuesday on suspicion of terrorism, freed on bail and said she should instead be investigated for public order offences.

The first resort from the Greens leadership, in public at least, has been to blame the party’s internal divisions for the Batman byelection defeat. Richard Di Natale opened the batting on Monday by calling for the expulsion of members responsible for leaks against the candidate, Alex Bhathal. The Victorian Greens co-convenors, Rose Read and Colin Jacobs, issued a statement noting the campaign had been “marred by the actions of a person or persons who … [leaked] confidential information regarding an internal dispute in order to damage the campaign. It is an attack on the very mission of the Greens. It can have no place in our party.” The Batman campaign was certainly marred by leaks, and by personality conflicts, which hampered the party’s ground operations. But if you are inhabitant of the real world, not a stressed-out occupant of the political hothouse, Di Natale’s swingeing public response to the skulduggery looked brittle and over the top. If you take a moment to stand in his shoes, the reaction becomes more comprehensible. Obviously there will be a lot of angry true believers to console, party activists and volunteers who spent their weekends door knocking and phone canvassing for a lost cause. There’s another point that may not be obvious if you’ve had no exposure to the Greens internal culture. From the vantage point of Di Natale, the culture of the Victorian Greens has been largely collaborative, unlike the riven and punishing party culture that exists north of the border in New South Wales. In the mind of the leader, sending a strong public message that Victoria needed to avoid succumbing to the NSW disease was an important and necessary component of the Batman wash-up. Wanting Victoria to avoid the roiling mess of NSW is doubtless a worthy objective. The problem with it, though, is the dissent has already begun, and if you want to chase down the thought criminals, that is a course of action that carries its own consequences. You can identify the leakers, perhaps, if they’ve been naive enough not to cover their tracks, but even if you find people to purge – if your crack investigative team unearths the People’s Front of Judea – that process will inevitably open questions, such as how did the internal disaffection get so bad in the country’s largest Greens branch that activists were motivated to sabotage their own campaign? There’s also the problem that your leakers have already made it abundantly clear that going to the media is an accepted part of the toolkit. Hmm. Let’s think about this. What could possibly go wrong? The other problem with fixating on the leakers is the risk of missing the real lesson. Let’s be blunt. The Greens didn’t lose in Batman because colleagues were nasty to Bhathal, although obviously that didn’t help. Anyone watching the Greens at the moment can see a party that doesn’t really know where to position itself. It’s hard for people to buy what you are selling if you don’t quite know what that is. Let’s consider the challenges, one by one. First problem. Labor in the current period of opposition federally has tilted left. That shift has a crowding-out effect. Second problem. Di Natale’s early disposition as party leader – which was about growing his political movement by positioning the Greens as a serious player capable of doing legislative deals on their merits – wasn’t universally loved. Unfortunately for the leader, there is still a strong faction within the Greens that believes politics is about protest and pragmatism is to be avoided at all costs. Third problem. The decline in the major party vote is generating fragmentation across the spectrum. There are “anyone but the major parties” popup political insurgencies proliferating across the country. Even if the party was 100% clear about its mission, the crowded political market place makes it harder for the Greens to be heard. Their collective response to date from the Canberra crew has been to shout louder, and pick fights in the parliamentary chambers with all the subtlety of a bunch of internet trolls. Not that encouraging, frankly. Problem three leads us to problem four. What are the Greens about nationally in 2018? That’s something for the party to determine, self-evidently, but the NSW Greens MP David Shoebridge expressed some views immediately after Batman. “In recent years we’ve seen how campaigns without an effective social justice agenda have failed to excite the public. In Tasmania, for example, Greens support at a state level has halved from 21.6% in 2010 to 10.3% in 2018. “In comparison the Queensland Greens in the recent state election made a deliberate shift to campaign on economic issues and the environment, and they scored the highest Green state election vote that Queensland has ever seen plus their first MP. We can hold true to our environmental record and principles and also prioritise fixing a system that is causing dangerous social and economic inequality and fuelling climate change and environmental devastation.” While it would be deeply silly to conclude that Labor has cracked the code of how to hold out Greens insurgencies in the inner-city, ipso facto, the Greens have hit a representative ceiling in the lower house – Batman demonstrates that the ALP is watching, learning and adapting. Labor cleared a significant barrier for soft-left swinging voters in Batman by choosing Ged Kearney, a candidate they could actually vote for – someone who wasn’t Martin Ferguson, a leftwinger who did deals with the right, or the right’s defence-obsessed David Feeney. Labor picked up many of the local issues Bhathal had campaigned on in the 2016 federal election, when she almost grabbed the seat, and Kearney launched an empathy offensive on the ground, sending a clear message the ALP was listening. If you want to listen in retrospectively on just one focus group – a lively conversation between a group of progressive voters in Melbourne trying to make up their minds about who to back – have a look at the Facebook page of the Melbourne writer Tony Wilson. The thread that follows contains interesting exchanges as locals debate whether the best means of advancing progressive causes would be another Green in the House of Representatives, or a motivated representative in the Labor caucus – if only on a trial basis. One participant in the thread says: “Never been so conflicted in my life as I have at the last two by-elections! I can’t believe I’m also leaning towards Ged after 20 years of green voting ... same reasons as you Tony. “How can Labor ever change their appalling stand on refugees and the environmental issues if the same old dicks keep getting voted in. Ged is an excellent candidate and would fight hard from within. But the greens have the policies I support. What a dilemma!!! To send a message or to try and actually change the party? I think I have to go red. Particularly since it’s only for a year or so ... test drive red?” So while the Greens have a significant task ahead to reposition in light of changing circumstances and to develop some genuine cut-through, the conversation in Wilson’s Facebook thread also underscores the fact that the new Labor member for Batman is absolutely on notice from the swinging voters in the south of her constituency. After all, it’s one thing to win a campaign. It’s another thing entirely to deliver on the expectations you have raised."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/mar/22/nicolas-sarkozy-denies-crazy-monstrous-libya-funding-allegations","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-22T20:50:49Z","webTitle":"Nicolas Sarkozy denies 'crazy, monstrous' Libya funding allegations","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/22/nicolas-sarkozy-denies-crazy-monstrous-libya-funding-allegations","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/mar/22/nicolas-sarkozy-denies-crazy-monstrous-libya-funding-allegations","fields":{"headline":"Nicolas Sarkozy denies 'crazy, monstrous' Libya funding allegations","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The former French president Nicolas Sarkozy has denounced allegations that he received millions of euros in illegal election campaign funding from the regime of the late Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi as “crazy” and “monstrous”. “There is no proof ... not even the slightest beginning of any proof,” Sarkozy told French TV after he was placed under formal investigation for illegal campaign financing, accepting bribes and the misappropriation of Libyan state funds over allegations that he received the illegal funding from Gaddafi for his election in 2007. “I have never betrayed the trust of the French people,” Sarkozy told TF1 news in an angry TV appearance. The former French president said Gaddafi was a “crazy man who likely used drugs”, a bloodthirsty dictator whose “band of killers, crooks and mafiosos” were now slandering Sarkozy because he had helped topple the Gaddafi regime in 2011. Sarkozy said he had never taken “one cent” and denounced the case as a plot aimed at stopping him from serving a second term. The Sarkozy investigation is France’s most potentially explosive political financing scandal in decades. The allegations are unprecedented and are the most serious accusations levelled at a former president in recent French history. The investigation raises questions, not just about the workings of French democracy, but also about the country’s leading role in the 2011 intervention that led to Gaddafi’s death, which at the time in France was dubbed “Sarkozy’s war”. Investigators are examining claims that Gaddafi’s regime secretly gave Sarkozy €50m overall to illegally finance Sarkozy’s successful 2007 campaign against the left’s first female presidential candidate, Ségolène Royal. Millions of euros were allegedly channelled to Sarkozy from the Libyan regime – some delivered as bundles of cash in leather briefcases, including directly to Sarkozy’s office. The €50m sum would be more than double the legal campaign funding limit, which was €21m at the time. The alleged payments would also violate French rules against foreign financing and declaring the source of campaign funds. Sarkozy was released from custody on Wednesday under special judicial supervision, after he was questioned for 25 hours by police. He denied all allegations. Under French law, being put under formal investigation means there is “serious or consistent evidence” that points to probable involvement in a crime. It is a step toward a trial but investigations can be dropped without proceeding to court. If the case were to go to trial, Sarkozy could face prison. The case accelerated this year after Ziad Takieddine, a wealthy French-Lebanese businessman who was close to Gaddafi’s regime, told Mediapart in 2016 that in three trips between Tripoli and Paris in 2006 and 2007, he had personally delivered suitcases stuffed with millions of euros in €200 and €500 notes from the Libyan leader as payments towards Sarkozy’s campaign. Takieddine is under formal investigation in the case. Takieddine was “highly suspect”, Sarkozy said, an unstable “crook” and a “liar”. He said he was not in Paris when Takieddine allegedly made a delivery to him and had not met him after 2002. Sarkozy had a complex relationship with Gaddafi. Soon after becoming the French president, he invited the Libyan leader to France for a state visit and welcomed him with high honours. But Sarkozy then put France in the forefront of Nato-led airstrikes against Gaddafi’s troops that helped rebel fighters topple his regime in 2011. The investigation is focusing on documents, testimony and a vast cast of characters, amid dramatic twists. One key Libyan figure, the Gaddafi loyalist and former oil minister Shukri Ghanem, was found drowned in the Danube river in Vienna in 2012. Documents belonging to Ghanem allegedly refer to three payments in 2007 to Sarkozy for at least €6.5m. Bashir Saleh, who ran Libya’s sovereign wealth fund under Gaddafi, is wanted for questioning in France. He was injured in a shooting in South Africa last month, but survived. Alexandre Djouhri, a French businessman suspected by investigators of funnelling money from Gaddafi to finance Sarkozy’s campaign, was arrested in Britain in January and is in detention in London pending an extradition request by France. Investigators are looking at whether Sarkozy’s 2007 campaign was awash with cash that was unaccounted for. Mediapart, an investigative website which first broke the story in 2012, a year before the official investigation opened, reported that police had looked at why Claude Guéant, Sarkozy’s close ally, had rented a large, walk-in safe at a central Paris bank during the 2007 campaign. Asked what it was used for, Guéant had said it was for archives and storing Sarkozy’s speeches.

John Bolton has made a career of deriding diplomacy as a sign of weakness, and has disparaged both the 2015 nuclear deal with Iran, and even the current administration’s use of sanctions as means of pressuring the North Korean regime to give up its nuclear arsenal. Instead, the soon-to-be national security adviser has repeatedly argued, nuclear disarmament in both cases is best achieved through regime change delivered by US military might. “A close look shows he’s genuinely one of the most extreme, irresponsible, and dangerous voices in the country,” said Adam Mount, a senior fellow and nuclear weapons policy expert at the Federation of American Scientists. Among Bolton’s recently published opinions, is a piece a month ago in the Wall Street Journal entitled “The Legal Case for Striking North Korea First”. While the 2015 agreement with Iran was being negotiated, he wrote a piece decrying the whole exercise in the New York Times. That was headlined: “To Stop Iran’s Bomb, Bomb Iran.” Bolton has repeated these lines repeatedly on television, and Trump is widely reported to have chosen him because of his on-screen performances (despite initial reservations about his moustache, apparently). So the implication is that the president is well aware of his policy prescriptions. He does not have to seek Senate confirmation for the White House post, which is just as well for Bolton. The last time the Senate was asked to confirm him, under the George W Bush administration, it refused on the grounds he was too extreme. Traditionally, the national security adviser convenes and chairs internal policy debates but Bolton’s record suggests that a moderating role is not his style. At the state department, he doggedly pushed the bogus evidence of Saddam Hussein’s weapons of mass destruction in the run-up to the Iraq invasion, and when the department’s own intelligence bureau expressed scepticism, Bolton had its officials excluded from meetings. Everything we know about Bolton’s past suggests he is coming to the White House to drive policy, not to broker it. That calls into question the continuing influence of James Mattis, the defence secretary, the last survivor from the group of moderating voices on foreign policy, the “adults in the room”. Rex Tillerson, gave his last goodbye speech as secretary of state on Thursday and will be formally gone by the end of the month, to be replaced by the far more hawkish and loyal CIA director, Mike Pompeo. Bolton takes over from HR McMaster early next month, which means that Trump will go forward with a new and bellicose team into two of the most consequential decisions of his presidency. If Trump does not sign the next sanctions waiver on Iran in mid-May, the US will be in violation of the 2015 agreement, quite possibly triggering a new crisis in the Gulf, and opening a rift in relations with European allies. McMaster and Tillerson had both urged him sign the waivers for that reason. Bolton, by contrast, has spent the past three years urging the destruction of the nuclear deal. Bolton will also be at Trump’s side when he heads for his planned summit with Kim Jong-un, and his presence will inevitably colour that critical encounter. Bolton, a former lawyer who like Trump avoided going to Vietnam, has advocated three different military options against North Korea: against nuclear facilities, bringing down a missile test, or an assassination of Kim Jong-un. Bolton has acknowledged the likely devastating North Korean reprisals against South Korean civilians but has argued “no foreign government, even a close ally, can veto an action to protect Americans from Kim Jong-un’s nuclear weapons”. The conventional wisdom about Bolton was that he would not be a natural choice for Trump as he was hawkish on all fronts, including Russia. However, he has shown himself quite flexible when it comes to Trump’s relations with the Kremlin, playing down the significance of the president’s congratulation of Putin for his election victory, and he has suggested that the hacking of the Democratic party’s emails (said by US intelligence to have been carried out by Russian operatives) could have been a false-flag operation by the Obama administration. For a president looking to distract attention away from the investigation into his campaign and its Moscow links, by seeking confrontation on the world stage, Bolton may be the perfect fit."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/postcolonial-blog/2018/mar/25/100-years-after-the-battlefield-looting-the-shellal-mosaic-remains-controversial","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-24T21:00:36Z","webTitle":"100 years after the battlefield looting, the Shellal mosaic remains controversial | Paul Daley","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/postcolonial-blog/2018/mar/25/100-years-after-the-battlefield-looting-the-shellal-mosaic-remains-controversial","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/postcolonial-blog/2018/mar/25/100-years-after-the-battlefield-looting-the-shellal-mosaic-remains-controversial","fields":{"headline":"100 years after the battlefield looting, the Shellal mosaic remains controversial","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"As the first world war’s endgame was unfolding across the European western front and Middle East a century ago, Australia and Britain were tangled in their own acrimonious fight over which had the right to the most prized battlefield loot. British and Australian officers freighted their correspondence with moral accusation, claim and counter-claim, over one of the war’s great battlefield treasures – the “Shellal mosaic”, which Australian soldiers took from Palestine as a supposed trophy of war at the second battle of Gaza in 1917. Australia even played what might be called the Elgin Marbles card – claiming that, if Britain insisted on its right to such a priceless treasure so questionably acquired from Greece, Australia’s claim to the stunning Byzantine mosaic should also go unchallenged. For context on this row over the mosaic (since 1941 set immovably into an internal wall of Canberra’s Australian War Memorial) it helps to understand the feverish, competitive spirit of collection that imbued the First Australian Imperial Force while it fought at Gallipoli, the western front and the Middle East. Charles Bean, the 1st imperial force’s historian, conceived of the war museum that became the memorial while witnessing the slaughter of Australian troops in France in 1916. Its genesis was the London-based Australian Records Section, established in May 1917. Britain, meanwhile, established the Imperial War Museum in 1917. Bean wanted to ensure the battlefield artefacts Australians had begun collecting were not given to Britain, even though Australia and Canada had indicated this could be the case. By September 1917 the Australian Records Section was feverishly collecting battlefield trophies; Bean liked to call them “relics”, consistent with the reverential language of “spirit”, “sacrifice” and “the fallen” he afforded his soldiers. Australian officer John Treloar, head of the records section, oversaw the collection of relics. Treloar asked soldiers to ensure they recorded the stories behind their trophies because “a good description transforms a piece of salvage into an interesting relic”. Such trophies would eventually include the flying boot of German air ace Baron von Richthofen (the Red Baron), killed when Australians shot him down near Corbie, France in 1918. (The collection also, incidentally, boasts a posthumous photograph of von Richthofen’s face, replete with wounds.) In his remarkable 1991 history of the Australian War Memorial, Here is their spirit, Michael McKernan writes how, by early 1918, Australia had collected 1,157 trophies in France and 324 in Britain but “impressive as this sounds it is a measure of the section’s determination and the AIF’s cooperation that by February, 1919, there were 25,000 trophies in the collection, excluding captured guns, machine guns and trench mortars”, of which there were also hundreds. In late 1918 the British inspector of trophies wrote to Sid Gullett, an Australian officer involved in battlefield collections, saying “your energetic people [in France] have swept the whole place clean”. Perhaps if a single photograph encapsulates the enthusiasm of the Australians’ battlefield trophying it would be of private John “Barney” Hines – known to the Germans as “the dirty digger” – of the Australian 45th battalion. Taken after the battle of Polygon Wood in late 1917 it depicts Hines in a German cap and surrounded by loot. Hines became the stuff of Australian legend: he had more than a healthy disrespect for authority; it was said he’d killed more of the enemy in some battles than any other infantryman in Australian uniform, and that the Kaiser was so outraged by this photograph that he put a price on his head. Today Hines would have been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder. He had a dislocated semi-hermitic and vagrant post-war life. Treloar, meanwhile, said of the Australian soldiers that “every man went into action with a pocketful of museum labels”. Which brings us to the Shellal mosaic, considerable portions of which were pilfered by the Australians after they discovered it at Besor Springs near Gaza in April 1917. Pieces of the mosaic have been found in a church in Brisbane and set into a step in a rural New South Wales farmhouse. In 1941, when the War Memorial was under construction, an appeal was sent out to ageing members of the light horse regiments to return the tiles they’d souvenired. There were few, if any, volunteers. In December 1917 Britain demanded the mosaic be sent temporarily to England from Egypt where it was held. But the Australians knew if they did so they’d never get it back. On February 25 1918, the acting commandant of the AIF in London, Tom Griffiths, wrote to the Secretary of Britain’s War Office that in view of “special circumstances” relating to the Australians’ discovery of the mosaic “I trust you will see your way clear to have the mosaic sent direct from Egypt to ... Melbourne”. “An additional reason for submitting this request is that we are advised from Egypt that up to the present no war trophies have been collected or allotted to the Australian troops in Egypt.” In March 1918 Britain again demanded the mosaic, with the implied threat: “I am ... to remind you that it is open to considerable doubt whether this mosaic can be regarded as a trophy of war as it was not captured from the enemy, and it is possible that it may ultimately be decided that the mosaic is to be restored to Palestine.” In 1917, Treloar and Bean had already apparently decided the AIF should raise, if necessary, the Elgin Marbles held in continuing questionable circumstances, by the British Museum. On March 19 1918, Griffiths responded indignantly to the War Office saying there was “every reason to look upon the Mosaic as a trophy of war”. ... it is difficult to see how a relic of this sort ... can be denied to the Museums of Australia when the Elgin Marbles, taken from a centre of world-wide pilgrimage such as Athens, are amongst the most prized possessions of Great Britain. In May 1918, the British wrote: His Majesty’s Government have taken exception to the acts of looting committed by the enemy ... but if valuable relics of artistic and archaeological interest are to be conveyed away from the theatres of war as trophies by British troops, it is open to question whether His Majesty’s Government will not be laying itself open to similar charges. On 16 February 1918 Bean went public with his disquiet, writing of how a “difficulty had arisen about the disposal of the trophies of the first Australian troops, which, unless swift steps are taken to rectify it, will wreck the whole scheme for the collection of Australian trophies and cause extreme indignation among all Australian troops”. Australian troops “from generals to privates display the greatest enthusiasm in bringing out from battle more and more interesting exhibits for the people at home”, he wrote. “A difficulty has already arisen over the very finest trophy captured by the Australians ... the ancient mosaic pavement that was carefully preserved and guarded by the Light Horse.” In late 1918, amid the euphoria of the war’s end, it was agreed the mosaic would be shipped to Australia. It left Egypt on the Wiltshire on Boxing Day 1918, arriving in Australia early the next year to be displayed in Melbourne and Sydney, still in its packing cases. The truth is, of course, that the Shellal mosaic ultimately belongs to the Palestinians, who lost so much beyond antiquities at war’s end. Some Arab nations have informally needled Australia about the propriety of keeping the mosaic. Some former senior War Memorial officials have privately expressed discomfort at the memorial’s display of the mosaic that, in recent years, has been partly obscured from view by an imposing partition. Which hardly seems like the way to show off to the world a prized supposed war trophy over which Australia took on the motherland.

I wanted to have some water but I was told I wasn’t allowed to drink.” Iizuka had been working for a family as a live-in housekeeper at the time. It was only later when she overheard her parents talking that she learned the shocking truth: she had become one of 16,500 people subjected to forced sterilisation under a Japanese law that was aimed at stopping the birth of “inferior” children. Her uterine tubes were tied in 1963 because she was suspected of having a mental disability. Fifty-five years on, her voice wavers as she describes the impact: persistent stomach pains and a heavy psychological burden. “I went to Tokyo to see if I could get the operation reversed but I was told it wouldn’t be possible,” she says. “They stole my life away.” Another victim of forced sterilisation, Yumi Sato*, was 15 when the procedure was done in 1972. Sato’s sister-in-law Michiko* says this ended up harming her prospects of marriage. “When she was about 22 or 23 there was talk of marriage, but then when she said that she couldn’t have children then the person who had proposed to her said that they didn’t want to marry her,” Michiko tells the Guardian. “At that time, normal thinking was that you’d marry to have children so it was hard to get married if you couldn’t have children.” Landmark case Sato recently launched a lawsuit seeking compensation from the Japanese government over the procedure, arguing the Eugenic Protection Law breached the country’s postwar constitution because it infringed on people’s right to the pursuit of happiness. It is the first such case in Japan and other victims hope it will help pave the way for a broader public apology by the government. Official records indicate Sato was sterilised because of a diagnosis of “hereditary feeble-mindedness”. However, her family disputes the claim of a hereditary condition, arguing that she had suffered brain damage because she was given too much anaesthetic when as a young child she received surgery for a cleft palate. Michiko, who has lived with her sister-in-law for more than 40 years, says Sato is a much-loved member of her family. When Michiko’s children were young, Sato helped to look after them and change nappies. Michiko speculates it might have been difficult for Sato to have raised children of her own, “but the fact that that right was taken away from her is really a crime”. At the first hearing at the Sendai district court on 28 March, the government’s representatives called for the lawsuit to be dismissed. The government is expected to argue the procedure was legal at the time, increasing attention on a law that remained in force for nearly five decades and was only taken off the books in 1996. Preventing ‘inferior descendants’ As Japan dealt with the shock of surrender in the second world war, some politicians spoke about an urgent need to “improve the quality of our nation”. “The object of this law,” according to its first line, “is to prevent birth of inferior descendants from the standpoint of eugenic protection and to protect the life and health of the mother as well.” The law targeted people who were deemed to have a hereditary mental illness or “hereditary mental retardation”. A later amendment cleared the way for the inclusion of people with non-hereditary conditions. Michiko says the fact the law was ever in force is “shameful” and “an embarrassment for Japan”. “That law basically was saying that there are people who should have children and people who shouldn’t have children,” she says. “It was basically designed to eliminate people with disabilities from society.” Between 1948 and 1996, about 25,000 people were sterilised under the law, including 16,500 who did not consent to the procedure. The youngest known patients were just nine or 10 years old. About 70% of the cases involved women or girls. Yasutaka Ichinokawa, a sociology professor at the University of Tokyo, says psychiatrists identified patients whom they thought needed sterilisation. Carers at nursing homes for people with intellectual disabilities also had sterilisation initiatives. Outside such institutions, the key people were local welfare officers known as Minsei-iin. “All of them worked with goodwill, and they thought sterilisations were for the interests of the people for whom they cared, but today we must see this as a violation of the reproductive rights of people with disabilities,” Ichinokawa says. After peaking at 1,362 cases in a single year in the mid-1950s, the figures began to decline in tandem with a shift in public attitudes. In 1972, the government triggered protests by proposing an amendment to the Eugenic Protection Law to allow pregnant women with disabled foetuses to have induced abortions. “In response to this, disability rights advocates, mainly people with cerebral palsy, protested and lobbied to prevent the bill from passing the Diet,” says Yoko Matsubara, a bioethics professor at Ritsumeikan University. “They claimed that the Eugenic Protection Law was similar to the Nazi sterilisation. This heavily tarnished the public image of ‘eugenics’.” Then, in 1984, a scandal over the fatal beating of two patients at a private mental hospital in Tochigi prefecture, north of Tokyo, triggered international scrutiny of Japanese care practices. The number of cases declined to fewer than five a year in the late 1980s. Although the forced sterilisation provisions were finally abolished in 1996, some believe the discriminatory attitudes behind the law still linger in parts of Japanese society. In July 2016, 19 people were stabbed to death at a home for people with disabilities in Sagamihara, south-west of Tokyo. The former employee charged with carrying out the massacre had previously written about dreaming of a world where people with disabilities could be euthanised. “This incident was a tremendous shock to Japanese people, especially people with disabilities and their families,” Matsubara says. “It was a wake-up call for us to recognise that stigmatisation of disability is still with us.” Slow to act Japan has faced several requests from United Nations bodies to deal with this dark chapter in its history. The most recent warning came from the UN committee on the elimination of discrimination against women, which called on the government in March 2016 to help victims access legal remedies, compensation and rehabilitative services. Dalia Leinarte, chair of the committee, says forced sterilisation is a violation of women’s human rights “and in some cases may amount to torture”. While the government has previously argued the procedures were carried out in line with the parliament-backed law of the land, there have recently been tentative signs of possible movement. Last month, Kyodo News reported the government was planning to work with regional authorities on a fact-minding mission that could pave the way for potential compensation in the future. Parliamentarians have also formed a non-partisan group to look at redress. There would be precedent for a public apology. Junichiro Koizumi, the then prime minister, apologised in 2001 for decades of mistreatment of leprosy patients, who were banished to remote islands and in many cases were also sterilised. Matsubara says the central government should take the problem seriously and “bears a heavy responsibility for having caused human rights violations of people with disabilities”. The pressure for action will continue to grow as more victims find their voice. In a lecture hall at the Tohoku Gakuin University in Sendai, victims speak to about 50 people about their experiences. Iizuka is there. It took her many years to muster the courage to talk openly about her forced sterilisation, but eventually she came to the realisation it was important to speak up. “I want everybody to know the truth about what happened,” she tells the group. “What I really want is for the government to apologise and give compensation to all those who have suffered.” * Names have been changed to protect privacy."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"artanddesign/2018/mar/23/national-photographic-portrait-prize-image-of-social-housing-resident-wins-50000","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-23T07:30:48Z","webTitle":"National Photographic Portrait prize: image of social housing resident wins $50,000","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/mar/23/national-photographic-portrait-prize-image-of-social-housing-resident-wins-50000","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2018/mar/23/national-photographic-portrait-prize-image-of-social-housing-resident-wins-50000","fields":{"headline":"National Photographic Portrait prize: image of social housing resident wins $50,000","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Canberra photographer Lee Grant has won the $50,000 National Photographic Portrait prize for her striking image of a resident in a social housing complex. Titled Charlie, the photograph chosen from 43 finalists and 3,224 entries, features one of the younger residents at the mostly male Ainslie Village. Grant met Charlie while working on an art therapy project there. She said it was imperative to represent the Australia outside the white, privileged mainstream. “I’m interested in themes of belonging, community and connection – what does it mean to be human, and what does it mean to be Australian in this day and age? Photography is a fantastic medium where we can explore some of these issues,” she told Guardian Australia. “I think we’re at a point in our history where we need to take a good look at ourselves in the mirror. I think there’s been some decisions made on our behalf that I personally find appalling and un-Australian.” Grant said she was “overwhelmed and chuffed” to scoop the prestigious $30,000 cash prize, as well as lighting equipment worth $15,000 and $5,000 worth of paper supplies. Victorian photographer Filomena Rizzo was highly commended for her portrait My Olivia, an image taken in the Redwood forest of her 11-year-old daughter who previously struggled with obsessive compulsive urges. She said the image “shows vulnerability and sadness, but mostly I see strength and a bond only we two share. My girls are by far my greatest teachers.” The photography competition is run by the National Portrait Gallery in Canberra. The gallery’s senior curator and co-judge of the prize, Christopher Chapman, said he was struck by the humanness of the two award-winning portraits. “I was looking closely at how the portraits spoke to me, how they conveyed their story uniquely,” he said. Co-judge and the curator at the Art Gallery of Western Australia, Robert Cook, said both portraits depict “brave” young people forging a path for themselves. “It’s like both subjects are facing futures that are uncertain. And they’re doing so bravely. It’s the bravery that you have when you’re afraid, when you yourself might crumble and you figure there’s only a 50-50 shot at making it through. “What the artists have done here is present this dilemma, one we all get on some level, with compassion, without artifice and without false heroics.” Grant is a multi-award-winning Korean-Australian photographer whose work often explores migrant identity in suburban Australia. She described the win as a “major validation” of her work. “[It] will encourage me to keep going and to keep sharing stories that are important to me and that I believe deserve to be in the national conversation.” Grant applauded the National Portrait Gallery for having “a good track record” on gender equality, but said despite having a “genderless” name herself, she found it “tough” being a woman in the photographic industry. “You have to have a super-thick skin. You’re constantly challenged on a daily basis, [things happen and you think] ‘This would never happen to a guy.’ “I still see a lot of photography done by the fly-in fly-out privileged white male. The industry has been improving, but there’s aways room for more inclusivity.” Grant’s win comes two week after the launch of Agender, a new collective and exhibition featuring top Australian female photographers. The founder and curator of the alliance, Cybele Malinowski, said the idea for Agender came about after she attended a photography event in Sydney and “there were only three female photographers and about 50 male photographers”. “There’s a boys club thing going on there,” she said. The work of all 43 National Photographic Portrait prize finalists will be on display at the National Portrait Gallery in Canberra from 24 March until 17 June, before touring the country. Voting opens online or at the gallery on 23 March for the people’s choice award."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/mar/24/australias-fierce-immigration-debate-is-about-to-get-louder","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-23T21:02:28Z","webTitle":"The changing shape of Australia's immigration policy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/mar/24/australias-fierce-immigration-debate-is-about-to-get-louder","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/mar/24/australias-fierce-immigration-debate-is-about-to-get-louder","fields":{"headline":"The changing shape of Australia's immigration policy","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"How many and whom? Australia is – again – seized by a debate about migration to this country, its size, shape and character. “Immigration is a defining feature of Australia’s economic and social life,” the productivity commission argued in a 2016 report that found, on current projections, the country’s population would reach 40 million by the middle of the century. From the post-war creation of an immigration department and the public catch-cry of “populate or perish”, successive waves of migrants, from different parts of the world, have shaped the country’s character, and influenced its development. But Australia’s broader migration program has been revolutionised over a generation, and with little consultative public debate. Australia does not have an explicit population policy or minister – it did briefly between 2010 and 2013 but the annual migration intake is set by government as part of the budget. “Australia’s immigration policy is its de facto population policy,” the productivity commission says. Since the prime ministership of John Howard, immigration experts argue, successive governments of both stripes have altered, almost beyond recognition from its post-war origins, the size, emphases, and nature of Australia’s migration program. In Guardian analysis of migration data from the beginning of Howard’s premiership in 1996, several key trends emerge: A massive increase in Australia’s annual permanent migration intake – from 85,000 in 1996 to 208,000 last year. The emergence of India and China as the largest sources – by far – of migrants. The movement away from family migration to skilled migration targeting national workforce needs. In 1996, family migration was about two-thirds of the program, and skilled one-third. Those ratios are now reversed. A huge increase in temporary migration to Australia – through short-term work visas (the soon-to-be-replaced 457) and international students. The rise of “two-step migration”, where those on short-term visas (usually 457 or student visas) gain permanent residency. The emergence of migration, rather than natural increase (i.e. births) as the primary driver of population increase. Publicly, the debate about migration rarely remains within the narrow confines of the number or origin of new people seeking to come to Australia to live. Rather it spills, with increasing vituperativeness, into all areas of public debate: to arguments about road congestion and house prices, to the availability of resources such as land and water, to social debates about integration, religion, and English as Australia’s primary spoken language. Migration is not just about those who arrive, but runs to national character: who is an Australian and who will become one. The migration of the past 20 years has shaped the nature of today’s Australia. And today’s migration will create the Australia of the next generation. The number of humanitarian migrants (mainly refugees being resettled) has remained fairly static since 1996, with a jump in 2012 and a trend upwards since 2015. Over two decades, India and China have emerged as, by far, the largest countries of origin for permanent migrants. The number from India has grown from 3000 migrants in 1996 to more than 40,000 by 2013. Three countries, India, China, and the United Kingdom, provide the majority of migrants to Australia. Since 1996, the balance of permanent migration has moved from family towards skilled. This has come as successive Australian governments sought to tie migration more closely to the needs of the labour market. Temporary migration to Australia has risen sharply over the past two decades, largely through two channels - international students and temporary work visas (457). The number of international students has more than trebled since 1996, from about 113,000 a year, to more than 340,000. Natural increase – babies being born – is no longer the primary driver for Australia’s population increase. Twenty years ago, the split was broadly 60% babies, 40% arriving migrants in increasing Australia’s population. Today, the inverse is true. The number of babies being born has increased, roughly in line with the rise in population, but against a hugely higher level of migration, its proportion has shrunk. The University of Technology Sydney professor Jock Collins has studied Australia’s migration trends for four decades. He told the Guardian that while Australia was indisputably a country of migration – 28% of Australia’s population was born overseas; of OECD nations only Luxembourg and Switzerland have higher proportions – migration has always been a matter of fierce public debate. “There has always been an immigration debate, it’s been a major feature of our nation – it’s always been controversial.” The profound changes to the size and shape of Australia’s migration program, began under the Howard government as he ramped up migration – permanent and temporary – in part as a response to the mining boom and a thriving economy. The trend has continued, both a result of and a factor in, Australia’s continuing economic prosperity. Previously, Collins argues, debates about migration have been closely linked to economic downturns. Recessions in the early 80s, and then again in the start of the 90s, sparked widespread questioning of the size and nature of Australia’s immigration program. “Now, economically, we are in this long-running boom, the argument is more about the social and environmental impact, instead of ‘they’re taking our jobs’, it’s about congestion and overcrowding, infrastructure and housing prices,” he says. Temporary migration has changed the nature of Australia’s migration program, with an increasing number of migrants now coming to Australia on a temporary visa and, via “two-steps” or more, moving towards permanent residency. “That is the big story of the last two decades of Australian immigration, the massive increase in temporary migration,” Collins says. “From 1947, the emphasis was settler-migration, bringing in new people to build the nation. But now, temporary migration far outweighs permanent: 700,000 or so temporary visas compared to 200,000 on permanent visas. And this has occurred without much debate or concern, it’s only been with the Fair Work commission investigation into the exploitation of international students and working holiday visa holders, or the problems with 457 visas, that we are having this debate around temporary migrants.” Debate, not demonisation Collins believes a debate about Australia’s migration program – how large it is, which migrants are prioritised and why – is a legitimate public policy discussion. “But I think the thing about the current debate, it becomes disturbing when you attack a particular ethnic group – ‘Chinese immigrants are destroying the housing market’, or talk about so-called ‘African gangs’. “I think you can have a reasoned debate about population size and accompanying issues, if you don’t attach that to a particular group. If it’s about ‘the Chinese’ or ‘African gangs’, then it becomes emotive and not evidence-based and develops a momentum of itself.” He says the debate Australia hasn’t yet had is around where immigrants move to. Australia is one of the most urbanised countries on earth, and the vast majority of immigrants settle in cities, overwhelming Melbourne and Sydney. “But one thing I’ve found that’s interesting: there is a massive appetite in the bush for refugees and also for migration more broadly. “I studied attitudes towards new immigrants to rural and regional, expecting to see some evidence of, to put it crudely, ‘redneck Australia’. But I found the opposite, the warmth of the welcome was overwhelming, towards both permanent migrants and humanitarian entrants. “I think this can be a ‘win-win’ situation if it is well managed. Australia can maintain its large migration levels, even increase its humanitarian program, but you can diffuse the urban congestion and address the house price issue, as well as addressing population decline and economic stagnation in rural and regional areas.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2018/mar/22/austin-bombing-suspect-confession-video-not-sorry","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-22T23:07:54Z","webTitle":"Austin suspect not sorry for bombings, reports on 'confession' video say","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/mar/22/austin-bombing-suspect-confession-video-not-sorry","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/mar/22/austin-bombing-suspect-confession-video-not-sorry","fields":{"headline":"Austin suspect not sorry for bombings, reports on 'confession' video say","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The Austin bombing suspect threatened to blow himself up in a McDonald’s and was unrepentant over the fatal attacks that terrorised the Texan capital, according to reports of a video “confession” obtained by police. “I wish I were sorry but I am not,” Mark Conditt said, according to the Austin American-Statesman, citing law enforcement sources briefed on the contents of the cellphone recording made hours before his death. Conditt described himself as a “psychopath” who had been disturbed since childhood, the newspaper added, and pledged that if he thought police were about to catch him he would kill himself with a bomb in a crowded McDonald’s restaurant. Police have said that the 25-minute recording provides no indication of Conditt’s motive or why he chose his targets. The Statesman also reported on Thursday that an unexploded package bomb intercepted at a FedEx facility on Tuesday was addressed to a woman who works at a spa in downtown Austin – but neither she nor her colleagues knew Conditt. Investigators say the 23-year-old Conditt blew himself up before dawn Wednesday as a Swat team closed in on him. They say Conditt is responsible for a series of bombs that killed two people and seriously wounded four others since 2 March but that his motives remain unknown.

Even if Manchester City do not wrap up the championship against Manchester United on 7 April, they will surely do so at Tottenham a week later or, if the wheels really fall off, at home to Swansea the week after that. They could almost certainly lose every game from now until the end of the season and still win the title. The ease of City’s success has brought out the sneerers – or perhaps, more accurately, the counter-sneerers. You see, they say, all that time you were saying La Liga or the Bundesliga were easy to win, you were wrong. This is just what happens when you have Pep Guardiola in your league. Perhaps there is some truth to that; perhaps fans who tend to watch the Premier League did not appreciate quite how good Guardiola is. The counter-counter-sneer is that although the Premier League has not had much of a title race (in terms of it being tight all the way to the end) since Brendan Rodgers’s Liverpool made their doomed pursuit of City in 2013-14, it has been different sides running away with it: José Mourinho’s Chelsea, Claudio Ranieri’s Leicester and Antonio Conte’s Chelsea. It is not Barcelona and Real Madrid wrestling for the title every year and it is not Bayern Munich winning with a crushing inevitability. It may be that City go on to win the title next season and perhaps beyond but if they do, their domination will not be for the same reasons. The wealth of Abu Dhabi distorts the picture but the latest Deloitte report into football finance shows that they are not the Premier League club with the highest annual revenue: Manchester United’s is 28% higher than City’s and there are three other Premier League clubs in the world’s top 10, and 10 Premier League sides in total in the top 20 (two of them, slightly oddly, could yet be relegated this season: West Ham and Southampton). Bayern’s revenues, by contrast, are 77% higher than the next highest Bundesliga club, Borussia Dortmund. Barça’s revenues are slightly lower than Real Madrid’s but still 138% higher than those of the third La Liga team, Atlético Madrid. That is not just domination but hegemony. This is not a case of a good manager and a good group of players coinciding so a team stay on top for a while; it is structural. In that sense, the Premier League is by some way the most competitive major league. But that is not the only measure of competiveness. The Premier League has had four different champions in the past five seasons, more than any of the other top four leagues in Europe. The Bundesliga and Serie A have both had one. Trace that back over a decade and a slightly more complex picture emerges. The Premier League has still had four champions while Ligue 1, which has had two champions in the past five years, has had seven. The picture in France is clear, of an evenly balanced league rendered one-sided by unprecedented investment in one club. But look a little further down the league and a different picture emerges. In the past five years each of the big five leagues in Europe has had seven or eight different sides finish in the top four. Take that back a further five years, though, and a little context is added to the comparative unpredictability of who wins the title in England. Over the past decade, there have still been seven different sides finish in the top four of the Premier League. In Spain that figure is nine, in Italy and France 10 and in Germany 13. Bayern have won seven of the past 10 Germany league titles but the flip side of having one dominant club is that a host of decent but not great teams can qualify for the Champions League (whether they have the resources to achieve much once they get there is another issue). The Premier League can boast an array of title winners in part because there is a small clutch of dominant teams (a putative big six now as opposed to the big four of a decade ago). That means that for a smaller side to win the title they need not merely to have an extraordinary season but for half a dozen big clubs to fail. It can happen, as Leicester showed, but a mid-sized club are still more likely to win the league in Germany, where they need one giant to falter. Which is preferable is largely a matter of taste and, perhaps, your relationship to the league. A fan of one of those mid-sized clubs probably appreciates the chance to qualify for the Champions League, to have the fun Leicester did last season; a more neutral observer is likely to be far more engaged by a battle to win the title than to finish in the top four. Either way, it seems, there is an awkward stratification in the distribution of wealth. The television rights deal in England is more equitable than elsewhere but there is still an unhealthy step between the elite and the rest."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2018/mar/27/world-cup-2018-russia-tickets-travel","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-27T09:00:01Z","webTitle":"World Cup 2018: what is a Fan ID and do I need one to watch games in Russia?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/mar/27/world-cup-2018-russia-tickets-travel","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/mar/27/world-cup-2018-russia-tickets-travel","fields":{"headline":"World Cup 2018: what is a Fan ID and do I need one to watch games in Russia?","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The World Cup is getting near and I’ve decided I can’t resist. How can I make to Russia? You will need to apply for match tickets – Fifa’s latest “first come, first served” phase is open until 3 April – and sort out your travel. But you might not get beyond the airport, and certainly won’t get into any of the stadia, if you haven’t got a Fan ID. What’s a Fan ID? You mean a ticket isn’t all I will need to attend a game? You’ll need your Fan ID and your ticket if you want to get inside. A Fan ID is a small, laminated document that you will probably wear around your neck. It will display your photograph and your name, and will be linked to your ticket purchases – considerably reducing the risk of touting. Do I need a visa as well? No – perhaps the best thing about a Fan ID is that it operates in lieu of a visa and means foreign-based supporters may circumvent a process that can be both expensive and time-consuming. Once you have your Fan ID in hand you will be able to enter Russia without a visa as long as you arrive between 4 June and 15 July, and leave between 4 June and 25 July. It allows multiple entries, itself a highly prized function. So how much does a Fan ID cost and how do I get one? It is completely free and the process is fairly simple. First you need to buy your match tickets – not necessarily having them on your person, but at least having the purchase confirmed electronically as you will need the ID code you are given. Then visit the official Fan ID application website and follow the steps. You will have to submit passport information, a mugshot and a few other details such as your date of birth, full name, citizenship and postal address. Processing time between application and approval should be around 72 hours; just make sure you select postal delivery rather than collection in Russia, which is possible in each of the host cities, if you want to make use of its visa-waiving properties. Helpfully it can also be sent to your local Russian visa centre rather than your home address if you prefer. Just don’t leave it all until the last minute, because delivery abroad takes an estimated 30 days. Are there any other benefits? Yes – if you have a Fan ID you will be able to travel to the stadia for free on match days via public transport, although be sure to check which routes this applies to. Even more excitingly, you will be able to book your place on extra train services between many of the host cities – which have been laid on entirely free of charge. Have a play around with the website and see what is available. And perhaps that brings us to the biggest benefit of all: you’re coming for the football but this, in tandem with the visa-waiving purpose, provides a freedom to explore Russia that simply has never been available before. It all makes sense – but how do we know it works? The Fan ID has never been used at a major tournament before but it was trialled at the Confederations Cup last summer and went down well – even if the sight of several thousand supporters wearing lanyards around their necks sometimes gave the impression of being at a conference rather than a football match."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"politics/2018/mar/23/owen-smith-calls-for-public-poll-on-final-brexit-deal","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-23T11:05:23Z","webTitle":"Owen Smith calls for referendum on final Brexit deal","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/mar/23/owen-smith-calls-for-public-poll-on-final-brexit-deal","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/mar/23/owen-smith-calls-for-public-poll-on-final-brexit-deal","fields":{"headline":"Owen Smith calls for referendum on final Brexit deal","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Owen Smith has broken ranks with Jeremy Corbyn to reopen the question of whether Brexit is “the right choice for the country”, and urge Labour to offer the public a referendum on the final deal. The shadow Northern Ireland secretary, who challenged Corbyn for his party’s leadership in 2016, was brought on to the Labour frontbench after last year’s general election. He has argued strongly for Labour to back a customs union with the EU27, something that has now become party policy, but in an article for the Guardian, Smith says his party can only “serve democracy”, by recommending a poll on the Brexit deal. “Labour needs to do more than just back a soft Brexit or guarantee a soft border in Ireland,” he argues. “Given that it is increasingly obvious that the promises which the Brexiters made to the voters, especially, not only their pledge of an additional £350m a week for the NHS, are never going to be honoured, we have the right to ask if Brexit remains the right choice for the country. And to ask, too, that the country has a vote on whether to accept the terms and true costs of that choice once they are clear,” he says. His intervention will reopen the split in Labour ranks, which has seen a series of rebellions in parliament since the referendum, including over customs union membership and the decision to trigger article 50, the formal process for leaving the European Union. It is understood that Smith will probably be called in by Corbyn’s team and reminded of his responsibilities as a shadow cabinet member. Similarly remain-minded Labour MPs were quick to praise Smith, with Chuka Umunna calling his argument “excellent”. Peter Kyle, the Hove MP, tweeted: “It’s a brave piece by a frontbencher, but this is exactly the time for bravery.” After a fraught internal discussion, Corbyn recently announced that the frontbench had agreed on a carefully worded compromise drawn up by the shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, which would see Britain remain in “a customs union” with the EU, and demand to be consulted on future trade deals with third countries. Demanding a second referendum was the most distinctive policy position on which Smith fought his leadership bid. He was convincingly defeated by Corbyn, but his views may chime with the party’s pro-remain base. When polled, members are strongly in favour of remaining in the single market and the customs union – and many would like to see Brexit stopped. Corbyn has repeatedly insisted it is not Labour’s policy to offer voters a chance to consider the final Brexit deal at the ballot box – though he argues that if Theresa May loses the key vote in parliament on the agreement she would have little choice but to call a general election. Smith says remaining in both the customs union and the single market are the only way of preventing what he warns would be the “hardest ever” border in Ireland. “The damage a disorderly and ill-thought-out Brexit could do in Ireland is enormous. We are often told Brexit threatens to ‘reimpose’ a so-called hard border on the island of Ireland, but that understates the problem. Because the economic border that a hard Brexit would create on Ireland would be the hardest ever,” he says. “If we insist on leaving the EU then there is realistically only one way to honour our obligations under the Good Friday agreement and that is to remain members of both the customs union and the single market. I’m pleased my party has taken a big step in this direction by backing continued customs union membership, but we need to go further.” His remarks are likely to embolden members of the vociferous backbench campaign for Labour to support single market membership, chaired by MPs Heidi Alexander and Alison McGovern. The policy of offering voters a say on the final Brexit deal has been championed by the Liberal Democrats. But at last year’s general election it appeared to have little traction with the public. The party, led at the time by Tim Farron, did increase its showing in parliament, from nine to 12 seats, but failed to make the gains it had anticipated by taking a vocal anti-Brexit stance."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2018/mar/22/rex-tillerson-state-department-goodbye-trump","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-22T20:36:09Z","webTitle":"Rex Tillerson says goodbye – but doesn't mention the man who fired him","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/mar/22/rex-tillerson-state-department-goodbye-trump","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/mar/22/rex-tillerson-state-department-goodbye-trump","fields":{"headline":"Rex Tillerson says goodbye – but doesn't mention the man who fired him","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Rex Tillerson has said farewell to the state department with a parting shot at Washington, a plea for integrity – and no mention of the man that fired him. Tillerson did not name Donald Trump as he spoke to several hundred state department workers who gathered at headquarters in Foggy Bottom to watch him depart. Nor did he directly address the icy manner in which he was dismissed last week after one of the shortest stints by a secretary of state in recent history. “This can be a very mean-spirited town,” Tillerson said, eliciting laughter at first and then applause. “But you don’t have to choose to participate in that.” When he arrived in the nation’s capital last year, Tillerson made no secret of his disdain for Washington gamesmanship. He later said he had been reluctant to take the post, and had been looking forward to retirement, but had been persuaded by his wife. Weeks into his tenure, Tillerson said he did not have any “appetite or hunger” to speak with reporters about US diplomatic missions. Others he soon found himself on the receiving end of negative press reports, leaks from his rivals and mounting speculation about his future – until he was abruptly fired last week, four hours after returning from Africa. Often at odds with the White House, he also lost the confidence and support of many of the state department’s 75,000 workers over his moves to cut the budget, leave key leadership positions vacant and downplay human rights and democracy-promotion as diplomatic priorities. Still, there was sustained applause for several minutes as he departed the marbled lobby of the Harry S Truman Building, the same lobby where Tillerson, the former Exxon Mobil CEO, introduced himself as “the new guy” in his hallmark Texas drawl 14 months ago. A few former staffers whose tenures were even shorter than Tillerson’s also returned to see him off. Then Tillerson set off for his home in Texas – “a more familiar climate,” the deputy secretary, John Sullivan, joked, “which I know suits him well.” If the Senate agrees, he will soon be replaced by current CIA director Mike Pompeo, who frequently bumped heads with Tillerson over Iran and other issues. Since his firing, Tillerson has pointedly declined to thank Trump. He made no explicit mention of the president in his remarks. “Never lose sight of your most valuable asset, the most valuable asset you possess: your personal integrity,” Tillerson says. “Only you can relinquish it or allow it to be compromised. Once you’ve done so, it is very, very hard to regain it. So guard it as the most precious thing you possess.” This report includes material from the Associated Press and Reuters"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/mar/23/raptors-rockets-or-revolts-the-biggest-threats-to-the-cavaliers-warriors-duopoly","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-23T09:00:50Z","webTitle":"Raptors, Rockets or revolts?

The biggest threats to the Cavaliers-Warriors duopoly","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Less than three weeks remain in the NBA regular season and the injury-ravaged Golden State Warriors have lost four times in two weeks and in the Eastern Conference the Cleveland Cavaliers are closer to ninth place than they are to first. Could this be it? Could this really be the year we don’t get the same NBA finals matchup we always do? Let’s take a look at all the things that could derail Warriors-Cavs, sport’s true tradition like no other. Injuries Warriors: The biggest threat to the Warriors, even more than facing the greatest player of this generation in the finals, has always been injury. Losing one of their stars wouldn’t doom the Warriors – recall they won an NBA title and then a record 73 regular-season games without Kevin Durant at their disposal – but it would make them much more vulnerable in the finals and even well before. Playing without two of their superstars, though? Or three? Then Golden State are just another playoff team. Steph Curry has missed the last six games due to a right ankle injury, the same ankle that he had surgery on earlier in his career. He is reportedly due back in action on Friday night, but he won’t be joined by Durant. Durant remains out with a rib injury at least until early next month, right around the same time the Warriors hope Klay Thompson will return from a fractured thumb. Without its full complement of stars, the Warriors have dropped four of their last six games. That’s a run that would see them bounced in a playoff series, and it’s just the second time they’ve lost four times in six games since the 2014-15 season. Verdict: Mild concern. Curry is almost back and Durant and Thompson will be in time for the playoffs. Barring any new injuries, opponents should get the Warriors at full-strength. Sorry, Western Conference. Cavaliers: There is one Cleveland player who is not injured and he’s really the only one that matters: LeBron James. Kevin Love broke his hand in late January but returned Monday night in a win over the Bucks and put up 18 points and seven boards in just 25 minutes – and was solid again against the Raptors on Wednesday. Tristan Thompson and Larry Nance Jr are also banged up, but those gentlemen are also not LeBron James. Verdict: No concern. The Cavaliers go where James takes them. As long as he’s healthy, Cleveland can get back to the finals even if he has to pull the rest of them along on a gurney. Coaching Warriors: The 53-18 Warriors already have three more losses than they have in any of their previous three seasons under Steve Kerr. But, no, Kerr is not exactly on the hot seat. Going 207-39 with two NBA titles in your first three years as a head coach brings a certain amount of job security with it. Ever since that record-setting 73-9 season ended in disappointment in the 2016 NBA finals, Kerr and the Warriors know their goals are all about the postseason. He’ll have them focused and ready to go. Verdict: Zero concern. The Warriors have a coaching advantage in most any playoff matchup. Cavaliers: Head coach Tyronn Lue is on an indefinite health leave, putting assistant Larry Drew in charge of the team. (That is, if you are of the belief that anyone other than LeBron has ever been in charge of the Cavaliers.) “For the most part we’ll do what we’ve been doing,” Drew said on Monday. “I don’t want to confuse the guys.” Verdict: Zero concern. Mike Brown, Erik Spoelstra, David Blatt and Lue have all been the head coach of teams that reached the NBA Finals out of the Eastern Conference over the past 11 seasons. What did all of those coaches have in common? James was on their team. There’s no reason Drew can’t join that (prestigious?) list if Lue’s absence continues. Internal dissent Warriors: If injuries didn’t befall the great basketball super-team of our era, another theory was that infighting could undercut their potential. No team with that many stars would be happy with one basketball to go around – or so the idea went. But nearly two full years of the Durant Warriors are in the books now and there are precious few signs of turmoil. Everyone looked happy at Curry’s 30th birthday party a week ago and any frustrations Durant has are able to be relieved via angry posts on his burner Twitter accounts. Verdict: Nothing to worry about. Kerr not only hired the best talent, but the people around him are happy to work together. Maybe he really should run for president. Cavaliers: Roster strife on LeBron’s teams always seems one passive-aggressive social media post or unfollow away. The Cavs had what was reportedly a contentious team meeting in late January in which Kevin Love was called out for pulling himself out of a game. But Love has since received full-throated support from James and others after revealing his struggles with anxiety and the Cavs cleared out Derrick Rose and Isaiah Thomas at the trade deadline, creating a more harmonious locker room. Verdict: Not a concern. LeBron seems to legitimately like his new team-mates. And even if he doesn’t, an angry LeBron is probably an even more dangerous LeBron come playoff time. Rivals Warriors: So what could give the Warriors and Cavaliers problems if not injuries, coaching problems or internal strife? The other teams that will take the court against them for a change. Barring a major collapse in the final weeks, the Rockets will have homecourt advantage throughout the Western Conference playoffs, the Trailblazers just ran off 13 wins in a row, Oklahoma City has been one of the NBA’s best teams since mid-January and the Spurs will be a hard out if Kawhi Leonard is able to return from injury. There is no easy path to the finals for the Warriors this year. Verdict: Moderate concern. The Warriors are still the favorites, but they won’t get through their conference this year without playing at their best. Cavaliers: As remarkable as James’ career has been, all but the most ardent LeBron fanboys and girls will admit that he has been aided throughout his career by soft competition in the Eastern Conference. Kyrie Irving is on a talented – if injury afflicted – Celtics team now and the No1 seed Raptors showed on Wednesday night that Cleveland can only beat them if James is playing at a superhero level. Yes, that’s only two teams with a legitimate shot of unseating Team LeBron, but that’s a significant increase over the usual crop of zero. While seeing LeBron lose an Eastern Conference finals may feel like the Earth stopped spinning, Irving would tell us that the Earth doesn’t even spin in the first place. Verdict: Legitimate concern. James might be having the best season of his career, yet’s he’s not a shoo-in to even make the NBA finals. That’s how much improvement the Eastern Conference has seen. Maybe next year it will be time for LeBron to give the West a try.

Her baby is stable but relying on a breathing machine, the medical team told the Guardian. The girl, who has not been named, had been hospitalized for 20 days because of pregnancy complications when she went into labor. A 37-year-old man who raped and impregnated the girl was arrested on Thursday, according to Ricardo González Borgne, the head of the the National Secretariat for Children and Adolescents (SNNA). Doctors attempted to deliver the baby vaginally until the young mother had a respiratory complication. They were attempting an emergency caesarean section when the girl suffered an embolism, three cardiac arrests and then died. “It was very sudden. They attempted advanced resuscitation in intensive care, but we could not save her. Her body was not ready for a pregnancy,” Hernán Martínez, the director of the National Hospital of Itauguá, told local media. The episode echoes an incident in 2015 when Paraguayan authorities prevented a 10-year-old from having an abortion after she was raped by her stepfather. In that case, the girl – who was given the pseudonym Mainumby to protect her identity – survived childbirth but has not yet received the housing that the government promised to give her, according to Amnesty International. Mainumby’s case put renewed focus on Paraguay’s strict abortion laws – and the prevalence of sexual abuse there. According to figures from the health ministry, 889 girls between the ages of 10 and 14 gave birth in 2015. Rosalía Vega, director of the Paraguayan section of Amnesty International, said: “We are a country that does not have a sex education based on science. The authorities take advantage of the Catholic majority in the country to promote laws based on religious convictions, not scientific.” This article was amended on 26 March 2018 to remove an image of a Red Cross facility which had no connection to this case."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2018/mar/22/cate-blanchett-woody-allen-speaks-out-dylan-farrow-abuse-allegations","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-22T19:09:49Z","webTitle":"Cate Blanchett on Woody Allen: 'I don't think I've stayed silent at all'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/mar/22/cate-blanchett-woody-allen-speaks-out-dylan-farrow-abuse-allegations","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/mar/22/cate-blanchett-woody-allen-speaks-out-dylan-farrow-abuse-allegations","fields":{"headline":"Cate Blanchett on Woody Allen: 'I don't think I've stayed silent at all'","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Cate Blanchett has addressed the allegations aimed at Woody Allen, claiming she knew nothing of them when they worked together. The actor won a best actress Oscar for her part in the film-maker’s 2013 comedy drama Blue Jasmine and is the latest star to talk about the claims of sexual abuse leveled at him. While appearing on CNN’s Amanpour, host Christiane Amanpour asked her how she could juxtapose being a #MeToo proponent with staying silent about working with Allen. “I don’t think I’ve stayed silent at all,” Blanchett said. “At the time that I worked with Woody Allen, I knew nothing of the allegations. At the time, I said it’s a very painful and complicated situation for the family, which I hope they have the ability to resolve.” Allen’s daughter Dylan Farrow has accused him of molesting her when she was a child, something that Allen denies. Despite a state’s attorney saying he had “probable cause” to prosecute Allen was never put on trial, a move intended to spare Dylan Farrow the trauma of a court appearance. Blanchett also talked about the importance of the justice system. “If these allegations need to be re-examined which, in my understanding, they’ve been through court, then I’m a big believer in the justice system and setting legal precedents,” she said. “If the case needs to be reopened, I am absolutely, wholeheartedly in support of that.” She also stressed that social media shouldn’t be seen as the “judge and jury” when it comes to these cases. “I feel that these things need to go into court, so if these abuses have happened, the person is prosecuted and so someone who is not in the shiny industry that I am can use that legal precedent to protect themselves,” she said. “Always, in my industry or any other industry, they’re preyed upon because they’re vulnerable.” Blanchett is the latest actor to address Allen’s alleged abuse of his daughter, following on from Mira Sorvino, Marion Cotillard, Greta Gerwig, Colin Firth and Ellen Page. His next film, titled A Rainy Day in New York, is currently awaiting release while its stars, Rebecca Hall and Timothée Chalamet, have announced that they will donate their salaries from the film to charities. Earlier this month, Michael Caine spoke to the Guardian and revealed that he too wouldn’t work with Allen again. “I am so stunned,” he said. “I’m a patron of the NSPCC and have very strong views about paedophilia. I can’t come to terms with it, because I loved Woody and had a wonderful time with him. I even introduced him to Mia [Farrow]. I don’t regret working with him, which I did in complete innocence; but I wouldn’t work with him again, no.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2018/mar/27/tuesdays-best-tv-come-home-one-strange-rock","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-27T06:00:07Z","webTitle":"Tuesday’s best TV: Come Home, One Strange Rock","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/mar/27/tuesdays-best-tv-come-home-one-strange-rock","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2018/mar/27/tuesdays-best-tv-come-home-one-strange-rock","fields":{"headline":"Tuesday’s best TV: Come Home, One Strange Rock","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Come Home 9pm, BBC One Why would a woman abandon her husband and three children after 19 years of marriage?

Is that why I’m the only person in 128 sq km of cool water on a very hot day? I later learn that this manmade lake (embalse), the mountain ranges to the south of it, and the cliffs, gorges, flower meadows, forests and caves all around are simply, for the most part, empty. Spain has a surplus of staggeringly beautiful wild spaces, but this one – almost 54,000 hectares north-east of Cadiz, overflowing into the province of Málaga – became the country’s first Unesco biosphere reserve in 1977. And Sierra de Grazalema became Andalucía’s first parque natural in 1984. Most foreign visitors, myself included, discover the park by accident while driving from Ronda to Seville, do a double take on spotting the lake and the fairytale village of Zahara, wrapped around its crag like a wonky wedding cake, slam on the brakes, make a detour, and end up staying – sometimes for a lifetime. I check into a casa rural at an old olive mill on the edge of a village called Molino el Vinculo, eat jamón and goat’s cheese at a local bar, imagine living here and, next morning, wake to the sound of cockerels, wood pigeons … and puffing. The heavy breathing comes from three runners and two cyclists heading up the mountain, a 600-metre climb over 11km of buttressed switchbacks to Puerta de las Palomas pass at 1,189 metres. I follow (by car, with burning clutch), heading for Grazalema village, 30 minutes to the south. I pause at the top of the pass to survey the park laid out below: verdant valleys, limestone pinnacles, pinsapo (Spanish fir) forests, more mountains. As I slam the car door, a stag jolts away down the scree. Grazalema is overshadowed by some serious peaks, most notably Peñon Grande. This is hiking country: many of the park’s 20 official trails start here, and most go upwards. Clearly it’s a weekend playground for Lycra-clad sporty Spaniards – the cafes in Plaza de España are packed with dogs, kids, bikes and people doing stretches. Following a map from the tourist office, I head up the one-hour Llanos del Endrinal trail, but inadvertently stray on to a longer loop, and wander puzzled through the boulder-strewn plains of Puerto de las Presillas for some time. The climb is amply rewarded by a stretch of cool pine forest, and an hour lying flat on a slab of rock, encircled by lofty peaks where ibex edge along ledges. Below me is a lush flower-filled valley, and above me are swirls of choughs. To British ears, one of the park’s claims to fame may explain its lack of visitors: it’s one of Spain’s wettest places. The rain falls mainly in winter, though. It also has Europe’s largest colony of griffon vultures, with a nesting site in a deep gorge just outside Zahara, the Garganta Verde. The trail to the base of the gorge is one of four where access is restricted. Even with one of the 15 permits a day issued by the park office in my backpack, I can’t believe I’m allowed here alone. It’s like a Spielberg film set after the crew has knocked off. As hefty vultures waft across the void, I hear their wings flap. Aside from that, the soft tack and clatter of a rock fall and bursts of bell-clear birdsong, the primeval gorge is eerily quiet. I slide down boulders at the bottom and, edging into the mouth of the Cueva de la Ermita, cautiously examine the underworld. If I was into caving, canyoning, and spelunking I’d be in luck: the park is made of porous limestone, and an underground world of interconnected tunnels and pools lies beneath. (Actually, it’s the place for exhilarating physical stuff in general: a major centre for paragliding, rock climbing, extreme triathlons, and serious riding.) But the caves are also of historical interest. In Cueva de la Pileta in the eastern section of the park, just above Benaoján and below Montejaque, a lantern-lit tour reveals stalagmites, stalactites and paintings of fish, goats and stick men, some dating back 25,000 years. Despite a smattering of walking tours and coach parties, Sierra de Grazalema feels pretty unknown. Yet it has been inhabited for a very long time. It is littered with signs of occupation, from megalithic tombs to Roman murals, necropolises and roads – the calzada romana to Ubrique, further to the south, is one of the most popular hikes in the park. The villages themselves, settled by Berbers, conquered by Christians (some invaded by Napoleonic forces), are built on layers of civilisations. Back in Zahara, the bars under the orange trees are well-patronised: neighbours catching up after an hour apart; older men in berets and shades drinking Pedro Ximénez; teenagers on their phones, sharing tapas; small boys with firecrackers; a table of touring cyclists studying maps. There’s a group of older women up by the cemetery, gazing out over the lake. Ironically, the jewel of this natural park is a dam, built just over 20 years ago – some villagers still call it the pantano, or swamp. But things are changing, slowly. Younger villagers decamp to the grassy lawns and icy waters of La Playita recreation area by the lakeshore south of Zahara on summer days. On the north shore, a young local couple, Javier and Maria, run El Mogote, a chic cafe and nautical centre with kayaks to rent and the world’s best view. Something similar further south may just open next summer. Or not. For now though, as I stand at the water’s edge, it feels pleasantly wild. Croc-headed fish or no, I jump in. • Permits from Sierra de Grazalema natural park Visitor Centre, El Bosque, juntadeandalucia.es Where to stay In Zahara de la Sierra, Al Lago Hotel Restaurant has doubles from €115 B&amp;B (al-lago.es).

His eerie, yodel-style baritone, somewhat reminiscent of Davids Bowie and Byrne, silences the audience in the tall space. His performance is set off playfully by amusing boxing footwork, bubbling trumpet notes and warm synthesiser riffs. Avi is a 26-year-old teacher of special needs children, the son of a rye farmer from Vara, in the far east of Estonia. He grew up on the remains of a former Soviet collective farm and is now a rising star of the “New East” music scene. I discover him on my first evening at Tallinn Music Week , just one of many offbeat surprises from a weekend in the Estonian capital. Now in its 10th year, the music week has established itself as one of Europe’s top city festivals, with multi-genre music showcases as well as some of the best arts, design, e-commerce (this is the home of Skype) and food that Estonia has to offer. There’s also a creativity conference, spanning subjects as diverse as innovations in Finnish education to Europe’s night tsars, and a design market. A glimpse of the gorgeous clothes – in unusual colours, cuts and fabrics – worn by local festivalgoers was all the lure I needed to make for the design market, where I found skilfully made and reasonably priced items ranging from culottes by Raili Nõlvak, which are artworks in themselves, to upcycled dresses and T-shirts by Reet Aus, now legendary in Estonia. This year’s festival, which runs from 2-8 April and coincides with festivities around the country to mark 100 years of the Estonian Republic, will host 250 musicians from 33 countries at venues across the city, from garages to stations and a former Soviet officers’ mess, but with the emphasis on eastern European sounds. To the unfamiliar ear it is, as one organiser puts it, “obscure stuff which we are brave enough to put on”. Musicians to look out for this year are Monetochka, a young singer-songwriter from Russia, and Kukla, a self-styled “Slavic gangster geisha pop artist” from Slovenia. The festival will kick off with what has become a mainstay of the cultural calendar, and a magnet for everyone from the president to open-minded lovers of traditional music and clubbing enthusiasts: a classical music rave headed by one the country’s most famous cultural exports. In the Kultuurikatel’s Black Box hall last year, I watched as conductor and composer Kristjan Järvi performed Steve Reich’s Radio Rewrite with his own band of classical musicians plus Beatbox world champion Bellatrix from London and Russian-born guitarist and rapper Gene Pritsker. Their shadows were cast large on the walls of a vibrantly illuminated, throbbing hall. The president herself, Kersti Kaljulaid, got up to dance, and later in the evening Järvi also proved himself a competent beatboxer. Afterwards in the cloakroom, it was culture minister Indrek Saar who was distributing the coats along with an aide. Late that night in Ungru, a pop-up restaurant on Pärnu Street in the city centre, Andrus Talvari, a chef who also runs the Ungru hotel and guesthouse 160km away on Hiiumaa, Estonia’s second-largest island, served a delicious snack of herring strips on rye bread with local white wine. This year, Keit Lillemäe, a “sparkly coffee gourmet” who runs the Renard Café in Tallinn’s buzzy Telliskivi area, will be given the chance to show off her kitchen talent. During the festival, parts of the city are given over to art students to redesign. A stroll towards the 24-hour rave at the Balti Jaam railway station (6 April) can be a bit of an adventure. Perhaps my most surreal experience, however, was wandering through Telleskivi Loomelinnak, an industrial estate that was once a Soviet weapons factory. It’s now a vibrant complex of restaurants and galleries, theatres and music venues, and so bustling that I find it hard to believe it was once so secret it was left off the map. Flights Ryanair flies from Stansted and Edinburgh from £48 return in April. EasyJet flies from Gatwick from £96 return.

In 1997, Tony Blair demonstrated the effectiveness of his “tough on crime, tough on the causes of crime” mantra. Twenty years later, Jeremy Corbyn pledged 10,000 extra officers on the streets of England and Wales, and attacked the cuts in funding and staffing imposed by Theresa May in her years as home secretary, when police numbers fell by around 20,000. What was thought to be safe territory for the prime minister proved more treacherous, especially in a climate of heightened fears over terrorist attacks. Last month the Labour leader returned to the fray, pressing Mrs May on the rise in recorded crime: gun and knife crime have seen particularly sharp increases in recent months. The personal experience and visceral fears of voters, as much as the statistics, make this an issue that resonates across regions and classes. On Wednesday, the police inspectorate warned that under-pressure forces are in some cases taking days to respond to 999 calls that should be dealt with in an hour. While the most urgent calls met an effective response, those deemed to need a “prompt” response within an hour – including potentially serious assaults – faced a much longer wait: an average of 15 hours in the case of Cambridgeshire, for example. The report warned that cracks are beginning to show due to the continuing financial pressures and sharp increase in demand; and that unless forces take urgent measures, the lives of vulnerable people could be at risk. The failure to respond efficiently to a report of domestic abuse, for example, not only compromises the chances of an effective investigation but threatens the safety of survivors and sends a message to perpetrators that they can get away with it. Of course, there is not a straight line between the number of officers and the prevalence of crime. As home secretary, Mrs May had to ask police forces to improve efficiency. Equally, however, you can only slash budgets so far before the effects are felt. This is particularly the case when the burden of work is increasing for reasons both good and bad: the threat of terrorism on one hand; a more serious commitment to tackling domestic abuse and sexual violence on the other. Police are now taking the strain caused by austerity in other areas, such as social services and mental healthcare and (as Mr Corbyn has pointed out) youth and community work. The sensible solution would be adequate resources for these services, so police are not diverted from core responsibilities. Where extra officers are indeed necessary, the right bodies – such as people with the technical skills to tackle online crime – would be more helpful than simply more bobbies on the beat. The government promises that its serious violence strategy, due in late spring, will stress early intervention and prevention, seeking to steer young people away from crime. This would be welcome, and certainly better than reverting to simplistic, failed strategies of more officers and longer sentences for offenders (even more worrying given the truly shocking state of prisons at present). But such promises must be translated into policies backed by funding, including for all the other services whose failures otherwise dump more crime at the door of the police. As the Guardian’s Beyond the Blade series has shown, a holistic approach is needed. This is a complicated message, perhaps harder to sell than tough talk. But it would do more to protect the public."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"us-news/2018/mar/22/parkland-students-congress-gun-control","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-22T17:57:47Z","webTitle":"Parkland students to Congress: tighten gun laws or risk 'killing America's future'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/mar/22/parkland-students-congress-gun-control","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/mar/22/parkland-students-congress-gun-control","fields":{"headline":"Parkland students to Congress: tighten gun laws or risk 'killing America's future'","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The students who have shaped a national debate over gun laws have warned the US Congress to take action or risk “killing the future of America”. As activists prepare to take to the streets in Washington and elsewhere on Saturday for the March for Our Lives, students from the Marjory Stoneman Douglas high school urged lawmakers on Capitol Hill to heed their calls and enact stricter gun laws. “We’re not trying to take away your guns. We’re trying to take back our lives,” said David Hogg, a survivor of the 14 February shooting in Parkland, Florida. “It’s not a Democrat problem. It’s not a Republican problem. It’s an American problem.” The Parkland shooting, which left 17 people dead, kicked off a wave of activism that is expected to gain momentum in Saturday’s march. As many as 500,000 protesters are expected to march in Washington to demand action, with as many as 800 parallel events organized nationwide and around the world. The last major debate on gun laws in Congress occurred in the aftermath of the 2012 Sandy Hook elementary school massacre in Newtown, Connecticut. But despite a national outcry over the shooting, which left 20 children and six educators dead, the US Senate failed to expand background checks after a Republican-led filibuster killed a bipartisan compromise. Although there was some initial discussion around tightening gun laws in the wake of the Parkland shooting, lawmakers have yet to hold a vote on any gun-related measures. Aalayah Eastmond, another Parkland survivor, fought back tears as she voiced the frustration at the inaction since her classmates were gunned down. “It’s been 36 days and nothing has happened. We have to move fast,” she said. On Thursday, Florida senators Marco Rubio and Bill Nelson were poised to unveil a so-called “red flag” bill, which would encourage states to adopt legislation allowing law enforcement officials or family members to file gun restraining orders to remove firearms from potentially violent individuals. Some states, including Florida, recently enacted such a law. The bill is also co-sponsored by the Democratic senator Jack Reed, whose home state of Rhode Island is considering similar action. Polling has repeatedly shown widespread support for stricter gun laws, with universal background checks ranking among the most popular proposals with the American public. On Thursday, a new USA Today/Ispos survey shed light on another consequence of gun violence in America: for the generation that have grown up in the aftermath of the 1999 Columbine high school massacre, the threat of mass shootings is a defining fear. According to the poll of young individuals aged 13 to 24, which included more than 600 students, nearly one in five respondents said they feel unsafe at school, while one in four said they thought it was somewhat or very likely that a classmate will bring a gun to school. The survey also found that more than one in three young people across the US planned to join the March for Our Lives protests on Saturday, either in person or via social media. Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat from Connecticut, said it was no surprise that young Americans were leading the movement for change. “That has always been the way change, particularly revolutionary change, has been accomplished in this country,” Blumenthal, whose constituents include the Sandy Hook families, said at Thursday’s press conference. “It’s in the great American tradition that they are marching in Washington and they are marching on our consciousness. ‘Our blood, your hands’: that’s what they’re saying.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/mar/22/tree-of-liberty-shortest-priced-loser-british-jumps-racing-history","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-22T17:52:18Z","webTitle":"Tree Of Liberty becomes shortest-priced loser in British jumps racing history","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/mar/22/tree-of-liberty-shortest-priced-loser-british-jumps-racing-history","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/mar/22/tree-of-liberty-shortest-priced-loser-british-jumps-racing-history","fields":{"headline":"Tree Of Liberty becomes shortest-priced loser in British jumps racing history","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Tree Of Liberty, trained by Kerry Lee and ridden by Jamie Moore, earned an unwanted place in racing’s record books at Ludlow on Thursday when he was beaten at 1-20 in a three-runner novice chase to become the shortest‑priced loser in British jump racing history. Tree Of Liberty’s two opponents in the two-mile event, one the 20-1 chasing debutant Cap’n, appeared hopelessly outclassed and the bookmakers duly priced him up as a prohibitive favourite, set to return just 5p in every pound to his backers. Moore set out to make the running on the market leader but could not carve out a significant lead and was just three lengths up on his pursuers turning in. Cap’n and the 25-1 chance Over To Midnight closed the gap in the home straight and all three horses were in the air together at the third-last. Over To Midnight took a heavy fall at the second-last but Cap’n stayed on strongly in the closing stages to beat Tree Of Liberty by two-and-a-half lengths. The upset completed a miserable 24 hours for Tree Of Liberty’s jockey and trainer, after they were found in breach of the “non-triers” rule by the stewards at Chepstow on Wednesday. Moore was banned for 14 days, including the Grand National meeting at Aintree, for his ride on Lee’s Kings Monarch in a novice hurdle, while the trainer was fined £3,000 for what the officials decided was a case of “schooling in public”. According to the respected Timeform organisation, Tree Of Liberty is the shortest-priced loser over jumps in Britain. Four horses had previously been beaten over obstacles after starting at odds of 1-14, the most recent being Nicky Henderson’s Zaynar, who finished a length behind Quwetwo in the Morebattle Hurdle at Kelso in 2010. The only horse beaten at a shorter price in Britain since the second world war was Royal Forest, with the champion jockey Gordon Richards in the saddle, who was sent off at 1-25 for the Clarence House Stakes on the Flat at Ascot in September 1948, but could finish only second. Richards was also beaten on Glendower, at 1-20, at Chepstow a year earlier , having been unseated when his mount whipped round at the start. Beaten favourites are usually good news for bookmakers but Tree Of Liberty may have been too short to attract any interest. “All the money we took was for the two outsiders,” Rupert Adams, of William Hill, said on Thursday. “As a result, we’ve actually ended up losing on the race.” Ludlow’s chief veterinary officer later said that Tree Of Liberty was found to be bleeding from his nose after the race."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"education/2018/mar/22/andrew-finch-obituary","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-22T17:38:39Z","webTitle":"Andrew Finch obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2018/mar/22/andrew-finch-obituary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/education/2018/mar/22/andrew-finch-obituary","fields":{"headline":"Andrew Finch obituary","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"My father, Andrew Finch, who has died aged 97, was a lifelong pacifist whose position as a conscientious objector during the second world war almost put paid to his career in education before it had begun. However, after being appointed head of Longslade college in Birstall, Leicestershire, in 1960, which then became one of the country’s first comprehensives in 1968, he was briefly in the spotlight as a pioneer of a new education experiment that swept aside the grammar and secondary modern system. Andrew wrote regularly about the comprehensive experiment in the national educational journals of the time and was an enthusiastic early advocate of school counsellors. Throughout his teaching life he maintained a second career as a semi-professional pianist, and gave more than 125 public recitals. He was born in Frascati, outside Rome, to Maxwell Finch, a former first world war captain and mountaineer, and Divna Gavrilovitch, a Serbian concert pianist who met her husband in France shortly before Armistice day. Andrew won a scholarship to Whitgift school in Croydon, then went to Exeter College, Oxford, in 1939. Due to war breaking out his modern languages degree was compressed into two years, with Andrew gaining a first in 1941. Registered as a conscientious objector, and assigned to work in Air Raid Precautions (ARP), he witnessed death and destruction when the V1 and V2 rockets pummelled south London. It was through this work that he met his first wife, Doris Wilkes, known as Wendy, with whom he had a son, Tony. Due to his pacifist ideals he was rejected for dozens of teaching jobs. However in 1945 he finally landed a position at Brighton college, in East Sussex, on the condition he did not try to influence the staff. In 1955 he became head of modern languages at Quintin grammar school, in London, until he was offered the new role of principal of Longslade. Music was an abiding love and his numerous public appearances included a 1977 concert at the De Montfort hall with the English Sinfonia, performing Saint-Saëns’ The Carnival of the Animals, narrated by the television presenter Johnny Morris. After taking early retirement in 1981, he gave regular recitals in aid of Mana (Musicians Against Nuclear Arms), published two volumes of poetry, and indulged his love of chess, food and the theatre.

Even with Oscar plaudits for Moonlight and Call Me by Your Name, with shows like Transparent, Looking and reboots of Will &amp; Grace and Queer Eye, progress has remained slow in the mainstream. In truth, the vacancy has gone pretty much unnoticed. One can find quality television in so many places that the cautious incrementalism with which the major US networks approach inclusion and diversity has become more or less a moot point. But still, since broadcast television is in many ways a reflection of what Instinct showrunner Michael Rauch refers to as “corporate apprehension”, Cumming’s character is certainly a step forward. In it he plays Dylan Reinhardt, a brilliant and quick-witted CIA operative-turned-college professor who studies abnormal behavior and published a Gladwellian best-seller called Freaks, about psychopaths, murderers and others on the fringes of society. One imagines Reinhardt’s own experience as a gay man allowed him to empathize with his subject’s sense of isolation, but no such reckoning is revealed. In what’s either a refreshing surprise or a kind of equivocation, his sexuality is mostly irrelevant, surfacing only in brief, domestic scenes with his husband Andy or offhand remarks to Lizzie, the intrepid cop with whom Dylan partners up to solve various heinous crimes in New York City. On one hand, it’s nice to see a queer character on TV whose sexual preference doesn’t define them. After all, Instinct (adapted from James Patterson’s book Murder Games) is a standard law enforcement procedural and thus most of the storylines involve the mechanisms of crime-solving and psychology-probing. On the other, the fact that Reinhardt’s sexuality bears so imperceptibly on the show will inevitably fan the flames of those who accuse CBS of fashioning the character in a way that’s conservative and palatable to its audience. With that, Instinct is in a bit of a catch-22, in that the show seems to want to pat itself on the back for featuring the first gay network lead while also making the character’s sexuality subordinate, and justifiably so, to his other qualities and responsibilities. “While I hope that some viewers do talk about Dylan’s sexuality, I’d like him to be judged by his virtues, flaws and quirks, not by who he loves,” wrote Rauch in a guest column for the Hollywood Reporter. “The success of every good TV show is built on the strength of the characters, and how dimensional and relatable they are.” Thanks to Alan Cumming, who brings to the character boundless personality and panache, Reinhardt is a new kind of TV sleuth: he invokes Lady Gaga in a college lecture, wears a colorful rotation of sweater vests, and approaches the job with cheerful, professorial determination. Outright mentions of his sexuality, though, are sparse, at least in the show’s first three episodes. “Most times when we see gay characters on American TV, their gayness is the prime thing,” Cumming, who’s openly bisexual, told THR. “And [being gay] is also the fourth or fifth most interesting thing about this character.” As a result, Reinhardt’s sexuality seems to matter more in network television’s greater, institutional firmament than it does in the actual show. Depending on how you look at it, this is either progress or passivity. But with visibility, of course, comes the question of its varying gradients. Gay people have been straining to be seen and, now that we’re finally in front of the camera, rightfully want to be seen in totality. Therefore, films like Call Me by Your Name and Love, Simon have fielded criticisms of sanitization, as members of the LGBT community regard their portrayals of gay men and gay romance to be too conservative, drawn with an eye toward what straight audiences will stomach. And naturally, more flamboyant depictions of homosexuality run the risk of being caricature-like and borderline farcical, evincing a rather thin and stereotypical notion of queerness. Somewhere in the middle of these poles is Cumming’s Reinhardt, who seems perfectly at ease with himself, even if questions of identity don’t really surface. But the fact remains that, for so long, Cumming’s character would have been a set piece in a crime show just like this one, consigned to the mostly ancillary, thankless task of delivering slick punchlines once or twice an episode. Without question, Cumming belongs here, at center stage, using cartomancy to solve crimes and chafing at feckless coroners. In that, there’s something worth celebrating. Instinct airs in the US on CBS on Sundays with a UK date yet to be announced This article was amended on Tuesday 27 March 2018. We mistakenly wrote that Alan Cumming was gay while he is actually bisexual. This has been corrected."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/mar/22/brexit-britain-norway-theresa-may-transition-deal","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-22T18:33:19Z","webTitle":"At last, good news on Brexit: Britain is heading for Norway | Simon Jenkins","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/22/brexit-britain-norway-theresa-may-transition-deal","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/22/brexit-britain-norway-theresa-may-transition-deal","fields":{"headline":"At last, good news on Brexit: Britain is heading for Norway","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Norway here we come. This is the good news on the Brexit front. It will take two years. The voyage will be stormy and the destination messy. But plus-or-minus Norway offers the only sensible way for Britain through the Brexit morass. Labour’s Jeremy Corbyn and Keir Starmer agree. Nick Clegg agrees. Most of the cabinet and the Tories’ remainers publicly or privately agree. So do those close to the Brussels negotiations. They still seem unable to shake hands on it, but they will soon. The week has been full of hopeful signs. On Monday the EU’s Michel Barnier – a secret “Norwegian” – could not conceal his glee at his cobbled-together transition deal, nor could his British counterpart, David Davis. The deal was a document of the most brutal realism. For now, the UK remains a non-participating member of the single market, with freedom of movement and right of settlement. Farmers and fishers are “as you were”. Britain can discuss “offshore” trade deals, but not agree them. Hard Brexiteers can go jump off a cliff. The smart money in Brussels was always on the Norway option. The so-called European Economic Area was a simple “off-the-shelf” basis for a bespoke deal with the UK. The challenge lay not in negotiating it but in overcoming Theresa May’s belief that her fate depended on some 50 backbench leavers and the editors of the Sun and the Daily Mail. She was terrified of them. Even so, the assumption was that, as the March 2019 deadline approached and the impossibility of a “frictionless” hard Brexit became ever clearer, Theresa May would be forced into a series of tactical retreats. The tough Lancaster House and Florence speeches, and Chequers last month, were dollops of fudge to keep hard Brexiteers on board. But this week’s transition deal would mark a parting of the ways. So it has appeared. The sight of Boris Johnson, Michael Gove and assorted friends shuffling miserably into line, whimpering over dead fish, was heart-warming. So in a sense has been May’s and Johnson’s distraction over Russian poison, hysterically comparing Vladimir Putin to Stalin and Hitler. A detailed analysis of the Norway option in last month’s Economist was unequivocally favourable. Norway in 1994 went through the same referendum debate as Britain, with the same drift towards compromise. The country remained in the European Free Trade Association (Efta). It stayed open to a single European market in goods, capital and labour, but it held aloof from the common fisheries and agriculture policies. Norway also stayed outside the EU customs union, to secure its own trade deals elsewhere. It is hard to see what substantive argument a Brexiter could have against this. Norway fiercely denies it is a “vassal state”. It is rated by the Economist Intelligence Unit as the “most democratic” in the world. It must abide by EU rules on trade in goods within the EU. But so must EU members, who can be overruled by majority voting. On matters of joint concern, such as energy, Norway is consulted and heard. Its lobbying office next to the Berlaymont building is more effective than any council vote. As for the European court, the Efta court liaises with it and is rarely in conflict. Trade in services and finance is more crucial to the UK than in goods, and here both Europe and the world would remain its oyster, as this EU single market is in its infancy. As for migration, Efta arrangements embrace a register of EU nationals, controls on their citizenship and property ownership and expulsion if they are out of work for six months. A mere 20% of Norwegians regret their Efta status. Of course Norway is smaller than the UK. But the issue is whether its model is practicable. It is. The one argument against the Norway option for Britain is that it would lie outside the customs union. How valuable this freedom is to Norway’s economy is moot. Efta has laboriously reached deals with 38 countries, including Canada. But it requires a hard border with Sweden to enforce country-of-origin controls. Since such a border is anathema in Northern Ireland, Norway plus customs union with the EU makes sense. I have seen no calculation that shows an advantage to UK trade in being outside one. Yes, Britain would pay into the EU for all this, as does Norway. But Norway’s money is carefully earmarked for grants, scholarships and projects. Likewise there are disciplines with “regulatory alignment” within an EU single market. But they did not worry Thatcher when she co-invented the market in 1985. Leaving the EU would usefully repatriate some controls, as over farming, construction standards, procurement and the environment. Britain, like Norway, could opt out of fish quotas. But these are trading practicalities not issues of principle. They are about how to make the best of “the decision to leave”, not about following a neo-imperial will-o’-the-wisp. What Britons thought they were “leaving” in 2016 remains opaque. No replacement question was asked. Britain will withdraw from the EU, but what takes its place must be a decision for parliament. Everything we read from polls and surveys suggests there is no majority for trade barriers at Calais or a ban on European care workers or plumbers. Public opinion wants soft Brexit. It wants Norway. The last time Norway featured prominently in the Commons was in 1940. British failure against the Nazis cost Chamberlain his job, but these events formed the basis for victory and reconstruction. Sooner or later, the Commons will debate Norway again: whether the UK should remain within a single market and customs union, however camouflaged. When that happens, May will drive her hard Brexiters into sullen acceptance or resignation. But she can tell them her hands have been tied to a Norwegian mast. If so, history could regard her twisting and tacking, her softly, softly Brexit strategy as the most brilliant of political manoeuvres. But I am not holding my breath. • Simon Jenkins is a Guardian columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"us-news/2018/mar/22/trump-sanctions-tariffs-china-trade-wars","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-22T19:38:58Z","webTitle":"Trump's China tariffs risk 'tit-for-tat protectionism' that threatens world economy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/mar/22/trump-sanctions-tariffs-china-trade-wars","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/mar/22/trump-sanctions-tariffs-china-trade-wars","fields":{"headline":"Trump's China tariffs risk 'tit-for-tat protectionism' that threatens world economy","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Donald Trump’s announcement of tariffs on $60bn worth of Chinese imports has raised the prospect of a trade war that threatens to engulf the global economy. The raft of trade sanctions will likely to trigger retaliation: even before the US president’s announcement, a spokesperson for China’s foreign ministry said that Beijing would “take all legal measures to protect our interest”. Analysts believe that not only will US and Chinese businesses and consumers suffer from dampened demand and higher prices of goods, but other countries will experience collateral damage. “US-China bilateral trade investment ties are integrated with global supply chains. So a US-China trade war is necessarily going to have an effect on companies and consumers in other countries,” said Scott Kennedy, an expert on Chinese economic policy at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. China is a major market for US agricultural products, cars, machinery and other products. In 2016, China was the third largest market for US exports. Conversely, more than 41% of clothing and 72% of footwear sold in the US are made in China, according to the American Apparel &amp; Footwear Association. “No one will gain from these protectionist policies. By implementing tariffs, prices will rise across industries which will hurt both producers and consumers,” said Ashley Johnson, project manager for trade, economic and energy affairs at the National Bureau of Asian Research in Washington. More significantly, analysts say, a trade war between the world’s two biggest economies threatens to erode the system of multilateral and bilateral trade rules that has governed global markets since the 1990s – promising a return to “a much more Hobbesian world of trade and investment,” according to Kennedy. “A rules-based system gives a basic sense of order to international economic relations. If that is gone, then when the next global financial crisis hits we could see a return to global tit-for-tat protectionism, a pattern of the 1930s that we should not wish to repeat,” said Gregory Shaffer, a professor at the University of California’s Irvine School of Law who has researched Chinese trade policy. Beyond trade, the dispute signals a shift in US-China ties where economic and political engagement is no longer seen as a way to encourage reforms and liberalisation in China – part of the rationale behind US detente with China in the 1970s. “The strategy has now changed. The US doesn’t care about whether there will be meaningful change within China,” said Henry Gao, an associate professor at Singapore Management University, who also researches Chinese trade policy. The tariffs could encourage domestic Chinese sentiment to turn against the US. The announcement comes after the passage of a law allowing top US officials to visit Taiwan, a measure that China strongly opposes. Beijing views the self-ruled island as a “rogue province” that belongs to China. An editorial in the state-owned Global Times warned the US against stoking Chinese patriotism, which could result in a mass boycott of US goods. It read: “At that point, it’s not the Chinese government fighting back, but Chinese citizens. It will become a people’s war. Try us.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/mar/22/does-eton-teach-this-inexact-science","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-22T18:15:10Z","webTitle":"Does Eton teach this inexact science? | Brief letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/mar/22/does-eton-teach-this-inexact-science","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/mar/22/does-eton-teach-this-inexact-science","fields":{"headline":"Does Eton teach this inexact science?","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"I’m wondering if that “top school”, Eton college, gives classes in terminological inexactitude?

The bill will now be sent to president Donald Trump for enacting into law and will mean Washington avoids a government shutdown at midnight on Friday, when existing funds are set to expire. The Senate voted 65-32 to pass the bill. The bill, which passed the House 256-167 on Thursday, funds government agencies through September, the end of the fiscal year, and delivers on a key promise by Donald Trump – to increase military funding – while bypassing much of his immigration agenda. The legislation does not include protections for young migrants known as Dreamers and only takes incremental steps to address gun violence. The House vote was not divided along party lines: 145 Republicans and 111 Democrats voted yes while 90 Republicans and 77 Democrats voted no. The bill faced opposition from the fiscal hawks of the conservative House Freedom Caucus. Vice-chair Jim Jordan summarized his members’ view in an interview with Fox News: “This may be the worst bill I have seen in my time in Congress and the worst bill our leadership has ever allowed to come to the floor.” Members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, meanwhile, said it would be “indefensible” to pass a spending bill that did not protect Dreamers. In a press conference before the House vote, Speaker Paul Ryan said negotiators had been working for months and argued that the bill contained no “big surprises”. “These things have been long works in progress,” he said. “The finishing touches came out this week and we have a hard deadline we’re working up against.” At least two senators had suggested they would delay proceedings, thereby forcing a brief government shutdown, as Senator Rand Paul did in February. “Shame, shame,” the Kentucky Republican tweeted about the new bill. “A pox on both Houses – and parties. $1.3tn. Busts budget caps. Two thousand two hundred pages, with just hours to try to read it.” He also posted a photo of himself looking unimpressed while holding the 2,000-plus paged bill that he proceeded to read page by page, tweeting what he sarcastically called the “highlights” of this “terrible, no good, rotten deficit spending bill”. Another Republican, Senator John Kennedy of Louisiana, suggested he too would object to bypassing consideration of the bill, which he called “a Great-Dane sized whiz down the leg of every taxpayer in this country”. On Thursday afternoon, the Republican majority leader, Mitch McConnell, moved to start debate on the legislation, setting up a vote for early Saturday morning unless he can secure an agreement to proceed earlier. Leaders of both parties claimed victories. Ryan said the bill fulfilled the Trump agenda, especially on increasing military spending and funding for barriers along the border, which he called a wall. “That’s probably the biggest victory here, is what we’re doing for our soldiers, our sailors, our airmen, our marines and our veterans,” Ryan told Fox. “This funds the wall, fixes the military, fights opioids, does the things that we said.” Trump rejected a deal with Democrats that would have protected Dreamers in exchange for $25bn for a border wall. The new budget includes $1.6bn for barriers along the border, money that is not authorized to be used on the wall prototypes that Trump recently viewed on a visit to California. Speaking at the White House, Mick Mulvaney, the head of Office of Management and Budget, insisted Trump supported the bill. “Is the president going to sign the bill? The answer is yes,” Mulvaney told reporters. He acknowledged that the omnibus was not ideal and contained compromises, saying: “This is what it looks like when you don’t have 60 votes in the Senate and Democrats get to take their pound of flesh.” Trump said on Twitter. on Wednesday night the bill “had to waste money on Dem giveaways in order to take care of military pay increase and new equipment”. Marc Short, the White House director of legislative affairs, said the administration’s real priorities were revealed in the proposed budget it unveiled in February. Democratic leaders touted increases in funding for infrastructure, education, opioids, mental health and childcare, priorities they had failed to achieve under Barack Obama. “It certainly doesn’t have everything Democrats want and it does contain several things Democrats are not thrilled about,” said Chuck Schumer, the Democratic leader, speaking on the Senate floor. “That is true of all good compromises,” he said. The bill includes a modest proposal to improve reporting with the criminal background check system for gun purchases as well as a measure to boost funding for school safety initiatives. It also clarifies language that would allow the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to conduct research on gun violence, a provision Democrats pushed hard to include. Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut said the gun provisions tucked into the budget bill were “small steps” and did little to answer the demands of the student survivors of the Parkland school shooting in Florida last month. The students, who have commanded the national debate on gun violence, will march in Washington this weekend to demand action. “If the small provisions in the budget are all that [Republicans] are willing to do,” said the Connecticut Democrat in a statement, “that would be a tragic insult to all the kids who are rising up across the country demanding that Congress end the gun violence epidemic.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/mar/22/syrian-rebels-and-families-begin-exile-from-besieged-ghouta","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-22T19:05:04Z","webTitle":"Syrian rebels and families begin exile from besieged Ghouta","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/22/syrian-rebels-and-families-begin-exile-from-besieged-ghouta","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/mar/22/syrian-rebels-and-families-begin-exile-from-besieged-ghouta","fields":{"headline":"Syrian rebels and families begin exile from besieged Ghouta","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Around 200 opposition fighters and family members have left the besieged enclave of Ghouta after agreeing with Russian and Syrian officials to be exiled to Idlib, in northern Syria. Up to 7,500 fighters and their families will be deported as part of the deal, which followed assurances from Russian military officers that other civilians in the Harasta neighbourhood could remain in their homes. The forced transfer follows the relentless month-long bombardment of Ghouta, on the outskirts of the Syrian capital, Damascus. Thousands of refugees have fled the enclave over the past week. Those being exiled on Thursday were rebels from the Ahrar al-Sham faction, which was dominant in Harasta over the last few years of the siege. Ghouta has been an opposition stronghold throughout much of the war, but large parts of it have now been recaptured by the regime. At least 1,500 people, most of them civilians, were killed in the airstrikes, which aid agencies described as a systematic annihilation. The transfer is the latest of many similar deals made elsewhere in Syria. All have followed intensive blockades and military attacks, and have led to those leaving being bussed to Idlib. All of Idlib province remains out of central government control. Along with an estimated 1.6 million local residents, at least another 1 million displaced people from elsewhere in Syria have ended up in the province. It is the one part of the country that largely confirms the regime narrative that the forces confronting it are dominated by jihadists. Extremist groups have held aegis in large parts of Idlib since 2013. And although Islamist and moderate groups have recently taken on the jihadists, ousting them from a swathe of territory, they retain influence over the way much of the region is governed. Mixing jihadists with rebel groups and civilians from elsewhere in Syria is seen by many opposition leaders – and deportees themselves – as a ploy to reaffirm the regime claims that the insurrection it faced was a foreign-backed plot using jihadist proxies. The danger, according to officials in neighbouring states, is that a war-weary international community will not be willing to draw a distinction, if and when the Syrian regime and its allies turn their guns on Idlib. Senior Arab officials in Amman, Jordan, and Beirut, Lebanon, have described conditions in Idlib as a “well-constructed killbox”, where civilians will enjoy few protections in what could be the last and most decisive phase of the war, which entered an eighth year nearly two weeks ago. What to do with the estimated 250,000 people who remain in Ghouta is yet to be determined. UN officials envisage that armed opposition groups and their families from two other areas inside the enclave will also be forced to leave in the coming weeks. At least 50,000 civilians have left Ghouta for elsewhere in Damascus since the siege started to wind down a week ago. The bombings have not stopped, however, with dozens of people since killed. Much-needed aid has been allowed into Ghouta in the past week."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"crosswords/quick/14947","type":"crossword","sectionId":"crosswords","sectionName":"Crosswords","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-03T23:00:07Z","webTitle":"Quick crossword No 14,947","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/quick/14947","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/crosswords/quick/14947","fields":{"headline":"Quick crossword No 14,947","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"crosswords/quick/14950","type":"crossword","sectionId":"crosswords","sectionName":"Crosswords","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-06T23:00:44Z","webTitle":"Quick crossword No 14,950","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/quick/14950","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/crosswords/quick/14950","fields":{"headline":"Quick crossword No 14,950","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"crosswords/quick/14949","type":"crossword","sectionId":"crosswords","sectionName":"Crosswords","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-05T23:00:15Z","webTitle":"Quick crossword No 14,949","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/quick/14949","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/crosswords/quick/14949","fields":{"headline":"Quick crossword No 14,949","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"crosswords/quick/14948","type":"crossword","sectionId":"crosswords","sectionName":"Crosswords","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-04T23:00:32Z","webTitle":"Quick crossword No 14,948","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/quick/14948","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/crosswords/quick/14948","fields":{"headline":"Quick crossword No 14,948","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"business/2018/mar/22/ted-baker-shares-tumble-after-trading-conditions-warning","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-22T18:05:14Z","webTitle":"Ted Baker shares tumble after trading conditions warning","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/mar/22/ted-baker-shares-tumble-after-trading-conditions-warning","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/mar/22/ted-baker-shares-tumble-after-trading-conditions-warning","fields":{"headline":"Ted Baker shares tumble after trading conditions warning","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"More than £140m has been wiped off the value of the fashion retailer Ted Baker after it warned that challenging trading conditions had been compounded by the recent heavy snows. The shares tumbled 13% on Thursday after its chief executive, Ray Kelvin, said that wintry weather had deterred shoppers from updating their wardrobes both here and in the US. “The recent unseasonal weather across Europe and the east coast of America has had an impact on the early part of trading for spring/summer,” said Kelvin. “We anticipate that external trading conditions will remain challenging across many of our global markets.” His gloomy prognosis came despite a successful year when both sales and profits grew strongly. Pre-tax profits rose 12% to £69m, while sales were up more than 11% at £592m. Kelvin’s cautious outlook added to the gloom in the retail sector after a series of updates from major retailers on Wednesday had pointed to a level of distress and weak consumer confidence not seen since the financial crisis a decade ago. Moss Bros issued a stark profit warning while the landlords of the fashion chain New Look approved a plan that will see it axe 980 jobs and close 60 stores via a so-called company voluntary arrangement (CVA). It also emerged that Carpetright is also seeking a CVA as it looks to shed up to a quarter of its 409 UK stores. Mothercare, the struggling parent and baby retailer that is in talks with its banks, said it had been given more time to secure extra funding. The failure of Maplin and Toys R Us last month had already dealt a severe blow to high street confidence as together the chains ran more than 300 stores and employed 5,500 staff. On Thursday PwC, which is overseeing the Maplin administration, made a further 66 redundancies at its head offices in London and Rotherham, bringing the total number of job losses at the chain to 129. “While the latest news of struggles at Moss Bros, New Look, Mothercare and Carpetright has further ignited concerns over the state of retail in the UK, Ted Baker’s latest results provide a glimmer of hope as the premium lifestyle brand continues to build on its successes,” said Charlotte Pearce, an analyst at GlobalData. She added: “By generating a decent proportion of sales from international markets, Ted Baker will be more protected considering the tough UK retail climate.”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2018/apr/02/searching-stars-island-maine-alan-lightman-review","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-02T05:59:02Z","webTitle":"Searching for Stars on an Island in Maine by Alan Lightman review – at one with the universe","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/apr/02/searching-stars-island-maine-alan-lightman-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/apr/02/searching-stars-island-maine-alan-lightman-review","fields":{"headline":"Searching for Stars on an Island in Maine by Alan Lightman review – at one with the universe","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Alan Lightman has made a unique career finding imaginative ways to bridge the “two cultures” of science and humanities. A novelist and physicist, he was the first person to be awarded a joint professorship in literature and astrophysics at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). His work in the latter discipline has resulted in notable contributions to the theory of astrophysical processes under extreme temperatures; he has helped to map the behaviour of such out-of-this-world concepts as “accretion discs” and “relativistic plasmas”. He made his name as a writer of fiction, meanwhile, with Einstein’s Dreams in 1993 – a lyrical series of short sketches, each one an attempt at a different understanding of time, and all rooted in the freewheeling mind of Einstein as he grappled with relativity in Berne, Switzerland in 1905. That book drew comparisons with the playful philosophical fiction of Italo Calvino and Jorge Luis Borges, and became an international bestseller. Since then, Lightman has published 17 books, each of which dwell in different ways on life, the universe and everything. In a TED talk, Lightman drew the distinction between his two habits of mind in this way: “The scientist tries to name things; the artist tries to avoid naming things.” As he approaches his three score and 10, the gap between those two positions apparently becomes ever more urgent to him. This latest curious book of essays is another stab at resolving that universal either/or. The starting point for its reflections is a kind of epiphany Lightman experienced 12 months or so ago. For many years, he has spent his summers and, occasionally, parts of his winters, on a tiny island off the coast of Maine. The island is a mile long and three quarters of a mile wide. Six families have houses on it, each with their own jetty. By necessity all the families have become at home in boats. One clear night, Lightman was chugging out to the island alone when he decided to turn off his engine and his lights and just drift. He lay on his back and gazed at the “sky vibrating with stars”, and not for the first time in his life experienced a kind of intense weightlessness, a powerful sense of eternity, a loss of self; he suggests when he returned from that Wordsworthian mental journey he had no idea how long he had been travelling. This experience inevitably got him thinking, somewhat in the manner of the star-gazing ancients or visionary Romantics (he nicknames his singular offshore vantage point “Lute Island” and watches and waits for inspiration). The book, a series of fragments of philosophy of mind, and insights into the creative lives of the great scientists, and attention to the materiality of the universe in both its largest and smallest components, is the result of those wandering meditations. Thoreau on Walden Pond is one acknowledged antecedent; the book also puts you in mind from time to time of Calvino’s last (and to my mind, greatest) work, the collected observations of Mr Palomar. Lightman does not possess Calvino’s structural rigour, his brilliant hold on irony as the defining principle of the human condition, but his discursive method is full of insight into some of the mysteries of the physical world, as well as the physics of mystery. He uses his own biography – the little science lab he created in his bedroom closet in Memphis, Tennessee, aged 12 – to demonstrate an intact sense of wonder at what we know and what we don’t. At the heart of his mediation is this neat formulation of the boundaries of scientific understanding: “The infinite is not merely a lot more of the finite.” Lightman has a sympathetic gift for recreating the leaps of faith in scientific advance. Of Galileo grinding his lenses and bringing far-off galaxies a thousand times closer. Of the way, in the 20th century one set of “absolutes” was quickly supplanted by the next – of how JJ Thomson’s discovery of electrons (his “plum pudding” notion of the atom) gave way to Ernest Rutherford’s idea of the “peach” structure of matter (a whole lot of space with a hard nut of protons at the centre). And how that certainty was divided again by the quark. At the same time, he feels himself in a wonderland of shifting scales. He maps out the heavens, concentrates on the veins of a leaf, tries to fathom the evolution of the humming bird, the veracity of Van Gogh’s Starry Night, and returns often to the thrilling chutzpah of Einstein rethinking time and space. Does he end up much the wiser after this latest record of attention to his pattern-making mind? Of course not. Does that make the effort of tracking his progress worthwhile? Of course. • Searching for Stars on an Island in Maine by Alan Lightman is published by Corsair (£12.99). To order a copy for £11.04 go to guardianbookshop.com or call 0330 333 6846.

To produce one’s own short story collection, after a decade spent in critical engagement with writers such as Vladimir Nabokov, Angela Carter, John Cheever and Elizabeth Taylor is a brave and potentially exposing move. Having examined in forensic detail the strengths and weaknesses, the foibles and failures and moments of genius of so many practitioners of the short form, what happens when you turn your hand to it yourself? The 10 stories that make up Mothers resist superficial analysis in a way that is interesting in itself. Power is an extraordinarily unshowy craftsman, so that discussing the writing itself feels like trying to focus on the glass of a window, rather than the view beyond. This is partly a function of the transparency of the prose, which so lacks ornament as to almost feel bald in places, and partly to do with the disposition of his narrators, all of whom share a kind of emotional reserve that is close to affectlessness. The risk in this kind of writing is that it leaves the reader unmoved; the reward is that it can more closely mirror daily life, which plays out without a string section or a set of filters to indicate or intensify the mood. The title of the collection comes from the three stories that open, close and form the heart of the book: “Summer 1976”, “Innsbruck” and “Eva”. All concern the same woman, Eva, glimpsed at different stages of a life deeply marked by her relationship with her own mother. When, in the final story, she becomes a mother herself, we are left to speculate about the subsequent effects on her own daughter, and the manner in which loss and damage are often handed down the generations. This is by no means new material for writers of fiction, but what Power does with it is subtly different, for so much is left unsaid that the result is a deliberately frustrating gap in interpretation. Deliberate because again, this is like life, in which our knowledge of other people – even our mothers – is only ever partial. Power’s insistence that the reader occupies a position of discomfiting uncertainty about cause and effect in Eva’s life is risky, but is absolutely true to the lived experience he is trying to recreate. Mothers is internationalist in outlook, with stories set in Sweden, Greece, France, the US, Mexico and Spain and a cast of characters who for the most part move with interest and openness through the world in search of work, or love, or something they can’t define. This gives the collection a flavour that might have been less noticeable five years ago, but in today’s political climate feels eloquent. The stories’ philosophical tenor frequently recalls Sartre’s Nausea and Camus’s The Outsider: alienation, absurdity, freedom and the search for meaning run through many of the narratives here. Another theme is the way in which people often fail to connect, hampered by the gulf between the inner worlds they inhabit. In “The Crossing” a new couple, Ann and Jim, go walking on Exmoor, where enforced closeness combined with revealing moments of physical vulnerability cause the early impressions they have formed of one another to disintegrate. The way Ann tries to stifle her irritation and her complex ambivalence about sleeping with Jim is beautifully captured. In both “Above the Wedding” and “Innsbruck” a sexual encounter is embarked on but then halted by one partner, the physical reality of bodies meeting utterly out of step with the kind of connection they had had in mind. In “Run” it is Englishman David’s obsession with the second world war that ruins a holiday in Sweden, his girlfriend Gunilla, as enigmatic a character as Eva, not just withdrawing from the reality he wants her to share in, but staging an escape. In an essay for the Guardian on James Salter, Power wrote that the short story “prioritises the extraordinary moment above the changes over time found in novels”. Each story in Mothers does that brilliantly; but across the Eva triptych Power is undeniably concerned with the passage of time. Mothers is a uniquely unsettling and subtle debut collection; one wonders if a longer work might also be on the cards. • Melissa Harrison’s third novel, All Among the Barley, will be published by Bloomsbury in August.

Juniper has formidable powers, including super-strength, flight and modesty (her great deeds are “no big deal”). But who could possibly be strong, courageous and funny enough to be her perfect sidekick? Crammed with the warm, enticing detail of the everyday, this vivid book is absorbing. Meanwhile, Sarah McIntyre’s The New Neighbours (David Fickling) features a tower block full of animal tenants. When a pigeon brings news to the top-floor bunnies that rats are moving into the building, they are thrilled; but as the news makes its way downwards, attitudes harden, and pigs, polar bears and yaks in turn declare rats to be smelly, thieving undesirables. What will happen when the residents finally meet the newcomers? McIntyre finds energy and humour without being preachy in this comic, layered warning against misinformation and prejudice. For the very smallest, Jörg Mühle’s beloved bunny returns in another perfectly judged interactive board book, Poor Little Rabbit! (Gecko). When Little Rabbit hurts his arm – and there’s blood! – it falls to the reader to console him with bandages, rhymes and ear-strokes, allowing toddlers to revel in their own kindness and maturity. Readers from five to eight should be inspired by Jamia Wilson’s Young, Gifted and Black: Meet 52 Black Heroes from Past and Present (Wide Eyed), with celebratory illustrations by Andrea Pippins. Although there is a strong slant towards the US – Wilson is based in New York – the breadth of talent and ambition showcased offers something for everyone, ranging from heads of state to singers, sporting heroes to award-winning authors. Myth Match: A Fantastical Flipbook of Imaginary Beasts by creative partnership Good Wives and Warriors (Laurence King) elegantly combines two winning ideas: the flipbook and the mythological bestiary. Richly illustrated in brilliant, fiery colours, it allows the reader first to learn about legendary creatures from the griffin to Goorialla, and then to create still more extraordinary hybrids. There are more domesticated magical creatures in Teacup House – Meet the Twitches (Usborne), the first in a new series by Hayley Scott, with bewitching pictures from Pippa Curnick. Stevie doesn’t want to leave her old home – but when her grandmother gives her the tiny Twitch rabbit family, in their teacup house, she is fascinated by the way they seem to move by themselves … Completely charming and immersive, it’s the sort of book that turns a child’s first independent reading into a lifelong addiction to books. For eight to 12, Irish author Dave Rudden concludes his Knights of the Borrowed Dark trilogy in high style with The Endless King (Puffin), crammed with the morally complex, evocative writing that marked out the first two books. Denizen Hardwick and his fellow young knights have travelled to Daybreak, the remote ancestral home of their order, to continue their training. But when the Endless King falls, they find themselves, instead, facing a full-scale Tenebrous invasion – and if their stronghold falls, so does the world. The swift-paced, emotion-laden, apocalyptic action won’t disappoint fans who have been eagerly awaiting the last instalment. There are more dark forces at play in Tin (Chicken House), a superlative debut from another Irish writer, Pádraig Kenny. Christopher is “proper” – a real boy, with a soul – but his best friends are the mechanical children who share the junkyard where he lives. When their owner/employer, the unscrupulous Mr Absalom, falls foul of two sinister visitors, Christopher and his friends are forced to undertake a dangerous journey, and meet some shattering truths head-on. Full of empathy, anger, sorrow and love, this is a robot story squarely focused on what it means to be human. Across the pond, the Pulitzer-winning Jane Smiley combines laconic charm, a gutsy heroine pitched somewhere between Ramona Quimby and Harriet the Spy, and a loving sense of human-equine communication in Riding Lessons (Scholastic), a quiet little book in which both nothing and everything seem to happen. Ellen is bright, impatient of restraint, and desperate to ride; her parents are adopting a new baby. Can she be good at riding? Is the new horse at the stables really speaking to her? Will she ever have a horse of her own? For young adult readers, performance poet Laura Dockrill’s fierce appetite for life has never blazed brighter than in the glorious Big Bones (Hot Key). Sixteen-year-old Bluebelle – BB – is very overweight, but chooses to love her body as much as she loves food and cooking. When her mum agrees to BB’s leaving school before A-levels, it’s on condition that she gets fitter, while the nurse insists she keep a food diary. This novel is, ostensibly, the result: a paean to feasting, family and good care of the self, and a penetrating insight into how teenage girls are taught to fear either food or fitness. Irresistibly hilarious and original, it shows Dockrill’s enormous rhapsodic charm. There is more funny, thought-provoking feminism in Laura Stevens’s debut The Exact Opposite of Okay (Egmont), which skewers double standards and entitled “Nice Guys” with surreal, sparkling humour. When would-be screenwriter and comic Izzy O’Neill is snapped in flagrante delicto at a party with a senator’s son, she doesn’t expect a website to spring up condemning her as a “world-class whore”. As her body, morality and personality become the targets of vicious online debate, Izzy attempts to navigate budding romance and friendship troubles while tracking down the website’s originator. Finally, another spectacular debut, Matt Killeen’s Orphan Monster Spy (Usborne), is a pulse-pounding, pitch-black Nazi espionage thriller told from the perspective of a teenage Jewish girl. Traumatised by her mother’s murder, saved by a British spy, the magnificently adaptive Sarah is sent undercover into an elite German boarding school for the future mothers of the Reich. While giving trauma and sorrow their full, deserved weight, Killeen sets a cracking pace – and pulls off the risks he takes with breathtaking panache."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"education/2018/mar/27/new-university-rankings-nursing-social-work-degrees-graduate-earnings","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-27T06:57:20Z","webTitle":"New university rankings ‘put nursing and social work degrees at risk’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2018/mar/27/new-university-rankings-nursing-social-work-degrees-graduate-earnings","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/education/2018/mar/27/new-university-rankings-nursing-social-work-degrees-graduate-earnings","fields":{"headline":"New university rankings ‘put nursing and social work degrees at risk’","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Universities have hit out at government plans to rank their academic teaching according to how much their graduates earn. Vice-chancellors warn they may be forced to cut vital degrees including nursing, social work and policing, because of these courses’ lower earnings potential. Nursing academics say they are still “reeling” from the significant drop in applications since the government replaced nursing bursaries with loans. They are urging ministers to think hard about the impact of their education policies on the future workforce in NHS hospitals. The government’s controversial teaching excellence framework (Tef), launched last summer, already gives universities a gold, silver or bronze ranking. Ministers now plan to assess teaching quality at subject level, placing a new emphasis on graduate salaries. It says this will reward excellence and expose universities and courses where teaching isn’t up to scratch. Prof Nick Petford, vice-chancellor of Northampton University, which won a gold for its teaching in the last Tef, is angry that his university could lose a medal that helps to attract good students, simply because it trains many midwives, nurses and police officers – whose earnings after graduation are much less impressive than lawyers’ or accountants’. “It would be beyond ridiculous to link teaching excellence with salaries for institutions graduating workers into a public sector, where pay is capped by the government,” he says. “We have no control over what a nurse gets paid. But we are rightly proud to help provide the great nurses the country needs.” The new policy has been enabled by the launch of the government’s experimental Longitudinal Education Outcomes [PDF] dataset, which is the first of its kind to track graduates into the workplace, using information from different government departments. Petford says: “No matter how well intentioned, if used crudely as a comparator, the data could destabilise the system and put some courses at risk.” He adds: “If you seriously believe university X is better than university Y based on graduate salaries you will by default be favouring those who educate vets and bankers over those who train dementia nurses and primary school teachers.” The head of another university, who asked to remain anonymous, puts it starkly: “The practical thing for me to do if I want a Tef gold is to close nursing and social care and recruit a load of lawyers. I think it will be incredibly socially regressive.” Similarly, feelings are running high at the University of the West of England in Bristol, which trains large numbers of students for careers in nursing, social work, paramedicine and the police force. Steve West, the vice-chancellor, says: “Many will start their careers in public services where salaries have been suppressed for years and career progression has been squeezed. Many will be keeping our hospitals, schools and social services open. “The rather simple notion that value equates to earning power is naive and insulting. Young people are driven by many things, and for most that is not how much they earn when they graduate.” Ian Dunn, deputy vice-chancellor for student experience at Coventry University, points out that some of its students of economics – one of the courses with the highest earning potential nationally – choose to go into the civil service or into teaching. “Under this new measure I should be advising them to go on to the trading floor instead. At a time when we need great teachers, that would be morally reprehensible.” Ben Craig, 24, who is training to be a paediatric nurse at Northampton University, says that although he wants to know he will earn a “steady wage”, he chose his course because he wanted to work in a caring profession and feel fulfilled. “Working on the ward can be emotionally taxing. But there would be nothing worse than getting up in the morning and doing a job I dreaded.” Alongside his studies he has periods of working full-time on a children’s ward in Kettering general hospital, often on 13- or 14-hour shifts. But he says he doesn’t resent the hard work. “As a nurse you’re a friend to the child you are assigned. It can be a daunting environment for children, and you have to be this positive spirit for them. Plus you give the doctors an insight into that child, which is so vital.” Craig, who is in the third year of his nursing degree, says he is one of the “lucky ones” because he started studying before nursing bursaries were abolished. He is the first person in his family to go to university and says he would have thought much harder about taking a nursing degree if he had had to pay fees of £9,250 a year. Applications to nursing degrees in England were down by 13% in January this year, according to the latest data from Ucas, with older learners less likely to apply than 18-year-olds. Kevin Crimmons, associate professor in adult nursing at Birmingham City University, says: “We are still reeling from the removal of the nursing bursary. For our undergraduate degree in nursing we have significantly more mature students than school leavers. Their needs are completely different and so is their reaction to debt.” He worries that the changes to the teaching rankings will be another poorly thought through “soundbite policy” that could have grave knock-on effects for nursing. “The government has been irresponsible in abolishing bursaries, which was a profound change, without thinking what the impact would be, and without a national media campaign to explain the new finances to potential students.” He adds that nursing students are motivated by compassion rather than salary. “They tell us that they want to do nursing because they want to make a difference in people’s lives.” A survey on how students perceive value for money published by the new Office for Students this month, found that students were “overwhelmingly” more concerned with the quality of teaching, fair assessment and helpful feedback from tutors than with how much they would earn at the end. Dunn says: “Students are getting the message that they are going to be working for 50 years, so it is quite understandable that they shouldn’t just be focused on salary. They have a broader idea of being happy in their careers and their lives.” The Department for Education said wages in nursing were above the average for 25- to 29-year-olds, according to data from the Office for National Statistics and that the new rankings would take a range of measures into account, not only graduate salaries. “The Tef will help applicants make better choices. Students will have more information than ever before, allowing them to compare universities by subject and hold universities to account for the education they provide.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"higher-education-network/2018/mar/28/universities-government-targets-female-representation-boards","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-28T06:30:14Z","webTitle":"Universities have too few women at the top.

How can they redress the balance?","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"It’s well known that female representation on boards in FTSE 100 companies is woefully low. The picture is sadly no different in universities, which have been set a target of 40% female representation on boards by 2020 in England. In Scotland last month, all public boards, including universities, were asked to comprise 50% women by 2020. Yet at present women make up just 36% of boards and chair just 19% of them across the UK. To have any chance of meeting these targets, universities will have to really step up progress over the next year. Diversifying boards matters because a range of perspectives, expertise and experiences strengthen their effectiveness, combating unconscious bias and “groupthink”. It also helps inspire a future generation from diverse backgrounds to get involved. As universities widen participation to students from different socioeconomic backgrounds, ethnicities and geographical regions, it’s important that governing bodies mirror their diversity. Despite goodwill in higher education, and a recognition of the need for change, recruitment practices mean that the usual suspects from a narrow demographic are too often appointed to boards. A recent internal survey conducted by the Leadership Foundation found that more than 50% of board vacancies are not publicly advertised, relying on the networks of board members to identify suitable candidates. Although this can be an effective way of securing strong candidates who would have otherwise not considered a university board appointment, this isn’t democratic. It narrows the pool of candidates to those in the board’s immediate network and risks marginalising those beyond. Potential candidates who have not built networks in higher education lack the necessary visibility and are less likely to be made aware of opportunities. Couple this with the tendency to hire people like themselves – only 19% of those chairing boards are female – and the result is a hiring norm which perpetuates rather than tackles inequality. Higher education needs to start making tangible changes to achieve board diversity. As board recruitment processes can last months, to meet the government target universities need to take action now, or female representation will fall short by 2020. What steps can they take? More accessible adverts The real problem lies in that figure of 50% of board appointments made without public advertisement. Although often candidates will emerge from informal conversations and networks, the value of a well-placed advert should not be underestimated. There also needs to be an increase in the transparency and accessibility of vacancies. Too often where vacancies are advertised they’re placed in newspapers that target a certain readership, or higher education recruitment pages lack the visibility to candidates outside the sector. Posting job adverts on a central hub will increase the transparency of board appointment processes and send a message of inclusivity and accessibility to candidates from diverse backgrounds. The Leadership Foundation and the Committee of University Chairs will shortly be holding trials on a board vacancies portal that will pull together all available vacancies. In the meantime, universities can make use of free of charge networks such as Women on Boards and KPMG Connect on Board, and organisations supporting specific professions and industries to advertise their appointments to a wider audience. They can also turn to their alumni network, business school industry partnerships and executive education graduates to access a larger pool of candidates with a personal connection to the university. Inclusive language These adverts should also use inclusive language to ensure a wide range of candidates can identify with the opportunity and institution. It is important to closely examine the level of specificity in the advert so that it reflects the essential knowledge, skills and experience required for the board – but does not over-specify and risk limiting the pool unnecessarily. Training for the job Our survey of women who had taken the Leadership Foundation’s Women onto Boards development programme showed that 75% of respondents are interested in additional support to develop the right profile and skills. This can be done through board readiness programmes, or perhaps even board apprenticeship schemes. Headhunting Some boards use headhunters to conduct a targeted search for qualified candidates. Although this is a more expensive route, search firms reach a much larger pool of potential candidates – and reach many who would not otherwise apply to an advert.

A technician advised that I would need my own cable fitted for a reliable connection. However, this is yet to happen.

After one technician “fixed” it, another discovered that a Virgin engineer, visiting one of my neighbours, had rerouted my cable to their flat. I’m now told that Virgin will be digging up the road to lay a new cable, but I don’t know when. I am at a loss to understand how it has taken nine years. Virgin has offered £100 compensation, as well as a loss-of-service credit. I have turned down this offer. I have also lost out on freelance commissions due to not having access to my emails.

If it’s so important to hang on to these things for another 21 months, one may well ask why it’s such a good idea to quit the EU at all. The prime minister realises that tearing us abruptly out of Europe would be madness, so she is trying to cushion the blow. That’s why she has bent over backwards to secure a transition period. May has relented on virtually every red line she previously drew – with the result that we are losing, not taking back control. The climbdown that has grabbed headlines is that we won’t have control over fish quotas during the transition. The attention given to this issue is bizarre, because fishing is responsible for only 0.05% of our economy. But equally, it is right to focus on how May has sold the fishing industry down the river. If she can’t protect a sector that is so symbolically important for Brexiters, what chance does she have to fight for economically more significant parts of the economy, such as finance? The fishing concession symbolises the tail-between-our-legs Brexit that the prime minister is negotiating. During the transition, we will follow all the EU’s rules without a vote on them. We will become, for that period, what Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg call a “vassal state”. How is that good for national pride? But the biggest climbdowns are yet to come. To get the transition deal, the prime minister has committed that either Northern Ireland or the whole of the UK could need to follow the rules of big chunks of the EU’s single market and customs union – not just during the transition but afterwards. May still pretends she can come up with some magical technology that will keep the Irish border open without the need for such “regulatory alignment”. But if she doesn’t come up with this technical fix soon, the EU is going to force her to choose between two lousy options: allowing Northern Ireland to become a quasi-province of the Republic of Ireland, or agreeing to regulatory alignment for the whole UK. Following the rules of the single market without a vote on them would turn us into rule-takers. That would be an astonishing blow for our proud nation. We, after all, virtually invented the single market and helped write most of its regulations. Meanwhile, by staying in the customs union, we would have to follow meekly any new trade deals the EU cuts with other countries – China and the US, for example – whether they are in our interests or not. Of course, May’s current plan to leave the single market and customs union is economically foolish. It would be bad for jobs and bad for public services, such as the NHS, because we would have less tax revenue to pay for them. But surrendering our role as a powerful European nation is against the national interest too. The final deal May is likely to cut is going to hurt us on both fronts, because she won’t keep us in the whole of the single market even if parliament forces her to stay in some form of customs union. As a result, our services industries will get clobbered. But to hang on to even bits of the single market, we’ll lose control. To avoid getting stuck with such a miserable deal, pro-Europeans need to attack it on both fronts – and explain why the only good option is to cancel Brexit. Concentrating just on the economic damage won’t be enough. It could sound too much like a rerun of David Cameron’s “project fear” campaign two years ago. We also need to go in hard on how Brexit will mean a loss of power and a loss of pride. This language may not come naturally to some pro-Europeans, as such talk feels like it’s associated with Rees-Mogg and his ilk. But, with the exception of their fishy stunts, the hardline Brexiters are now zipping their lips. They have concluded that any deal, however bad, is worth while so long as we quit the EU. We must not let the Brexiters have a monopoly over sovereignty, power and patriotism. It’s time for us to take off the gloves and call them out for selling our whole country, not just fishing, down the river. • Hugo Dixon is chairman and editor-in-chief of infacts.org, a journalistic enterprise making the fact-based case for Britain to stay in the EU"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/apr/06/experience-i-was-shot-five-times","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-06T09:00:28Z","webTitle":"Experience: I was shot five times","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/apr/06/experience-i-was-shot-five-times","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/apr/06/experience-i-was-shot-five-times","fields":{"headline":"Experience: I was shot five times","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Everything was grey. I could hear my friend Priscilla screaming and voices all around me, but I couldn’t see anything. The paramedics lifted the gurney – “One, two, three” – and that’s when I came to. I wasn’t supposed to be there. I live in Fayetteville in Georgia, and I was going to Barnesville, 15 miles away, for my first client meeting for my new business. The night before, I decided to make a quick detour, to help prep my friend Priscilla for a job interview. It was a warm day in early October 2015 and I followed Google Maps to Priscilla’s apartment. I couldn’t see a sign for her complex, just a nondescript building, so I pulled into a parking space and called her. A white Chevy pickup truck came screeching in, blocking me in. In my sideview mirror I saw the driver jump out of the truck. He was agitated and hiding something. “What are you doing here?” he yelled through my window. I was confused: did I do something wrong? Am I being robbed? He stepped back and I came face to face with a .380-calibre Magnum pistol. “Whoa,” I screamed. He fired. My window exploded and I felt the weight of 10 sledgehammers coming down on my leg and a hot pain. I grabbed my knee, trying to hold it together. Click, click, click. He tried to shoot me again, but the gun jammed. It was fight or flight time. I launched my upper body over the centre console, dragging my legs behind me. With every ounce of strength I had, I reached for the passenger door handle, pushed my way out and fell to the ground. I heard him walk around the front of the car. With my left arm I grabbed his shirt and pleaded with him, “I don’t know what I’ve done wrong. You don’t need to do this.” The sun was shining so brightly, I couldn’t see. Then he stepped over me and I saw his face. There was nothing in his eyes, just a blank stare. When a gun chamber is cleared, it’s a very distinctive sound. I heard it and could see the muscles in the man’s forearm as he held the gun to my temple. At the last second I turned my head away. He shot me in the back of my head and I blacked out. Five witnesses pieced the rest together. They said he shot me three more times: in the stomach, throat and ribs and that between shots he beat me with the gun and kicked me. An older lady screamed out of her window, “Stop shooting that boy, you’re going to kill him.” He bent down, looked at me, and fled. Priscilla was still on the phone. She later told me that when she heard me screaming and a loud bang she ran out to find me. When she arrived she said she could see smoke coming out of my head. My vision came back in the ambulance, like a fade in from black. On the monitor I watched my blood pressure dropping; I looked down and saw blood pouring from my midsection. I closed my eyes to pray and the paramedic yelled, “Stay with me!” so I prayed with my eyes open. We burst through the doors of the hospital. I counted 14 people and I thought, how many people got shot? I looked around. I was the only one in the room, and I realised – they’re all here for me. The shot to my leg shattered my femur, the shot in my throat blew out the side of my face, my jaw was shot open and the shot to my head penetrated my skull. The bullet is still in my head; doctors said that trying to retrieve it would be detrimental. I also have a second bullet in my leg and a 30cm scar on my abdomen. It took me three months to learn to write again. I’ve had severe migraines; I can’t run without a limp, or even climb a ladder, and everything hurts. My attacker wasn’t a gang member or drug dealer. He just an ordinary guy with a lot of issues. I found out later he had mistaken me for a man who was sleeping with his girlfriend. He died that day, after police forced his car off the road. He shot himself. I forgave him, but I’ve come to learn that forgiveness is a journey, not a destination. I’ve had to forgive him about 300 times. And every time I can’t do something I used to be able to, I have to forgive him again. • As told to Emma Rosser. Do you have an experience to share?

Louis Armstrong, Cab Calloway, Nat King Cole, Sarah Vaughan, Sam Cooke, Aretha Franklin and Otis Redding walked its corridors, slept in its rooms or lay by its pool. Wilson Pickett’s The Midnight Hour and Eddie Floyd’s Knock on Wood were composed here. This, after all, is Memphis, home of Elvis Presley and a strain of soul music known as the Memphis Sound. But the motel also represents a psychic scar for the city, the south and America. It was here that, amid seething racial tensions half a century ago, Martin Luther King was gunned down by a white drifter. It is a scar that modern Memphis – a majority black city with places of pilgrimage for music lovers such as Graceland, Beale Street, Sun Studio and the Stax Museum – is still struggling to heal. “When we think about the sound that came out of the city during that time, you can’t help but feel that grief in the sound,” says Zandria Robinson, assistant professor of sociology at Rhodes College in Memphis. “Even if it’s joyous, even if it’s nothing to do with race at all, there’s a bit of grief there in the sound because you associate with that time, with that moment and with those issues.” The sound will turn to momentary silence at 6.01pm on 4 April to mark exactly 50 years since King’s sonorous voice was stilled by the assassin’s bullet. A wreath-laying ceremony, to which past presidents are invited but Donald Trump is not, will be held on the motel balcony where King died during three days of commemorations under the rubric “Where do we go from here?”, after the title of his final book. It is a pointed question in this majority black city in the “Bible belt” state of Tennessee. While the days when the zoo was open to whites six days a week and African Americans one (cage cleaning day) are long gone, the insidious apartheid of economic, educational and geographical segregation persists. A growing black middle class was knocked back by the financial crisis and gentrification has been slow to reach historic black neighbourhoods. Two Confederate statues, a few minutes’ drive from the Lorraine, were torn down only three months ago after fierce opposition from white supremacists. Robinson adds: “People in Memphis tend to wear their race on their sleeve. It’s a very powerful, bold feeling: you’re very aware of what your race is because of this legacy of King’s assassination and the shadow in which we all live. I do find myself sometimes in a restaurant with my kid or partner, being the only black people in there, and I just wonder, how the hell did this happen? How did this happen in our city with 600,000 people, about 400,000 of them African American?” Part of the answer lies in the political convulsions of 1968, when the mood in Memphis was febrile as garbage workers went on strike over pay and safety conditions. On 28 March, King – subject to FBI surveillance, waning popularity and death threats – led a march of more than 6,000 people, including workers who carried signs that declared “I am a man”, defying white people’s habit of calling African American workers “boys”. But violence flared on Beale Street, the neon-lit heart of Memphis music, and police fired teargas. Cleo Smith, now 75 and wearing an “I am a man” badge ahead of the anniversary, recalls: “We were sprayed with water hose, Mace, hit with bully sticks. There was this one policeman that had this police dog he released in front of me and I hit the dog in the nose with my fist ’cause I thought he was fixing to bite. The policeman snapped his holster and said, ‘Hit him again.’ Naturally I wasn’t going to hit him the second time because I knew he was getting ready to shoot me. “So I broke away from the crowd and went home to my mother’s house, and when I walked in the door my mother, seeing the expression on my face, the fear, she says to me: ‘Son, you look like you just seen a ghost.’ And I wanted to tell my mom I almost became a ghost, but I didn’t tell her because she had asked me to stay away from the marches but I couldn’t stay away because I was a city employee.” King was dismayed and vowed to return. On 3 April, at Mason Temple in Memphis, the civil rights leader delivered what would be his last speech, including the words “I’ve been to the mountaintop” and a prophetic reflection on his own mortality. But when he retired to the modest Lorraine his mood turned jovial. On 4 April there were laughs with his brother, AD King, and a pillow fight with activist Andrew Young. At about 6pm, King stepped out on to the balcony and leaned over the railing. He asked saxophonist Ben Branch to play his favourite hymn, Precious Lord, at a mass meeting that evening. “Play it real pretty,” King said. Then, a bullet streaked across Mulberry Street and struck King in the neck. He collapsed in an instant, a leader of peaceful resistance dispatched by savage violence. The Rev Billy Kyles, a Memphis minister who died in 2016, later recalled: “He had fallen on his back when I got to him. He had a crushed cigarette in his hand. The knot in his tie was blown off, and I looked at this tremendous wound. He looked like he was trying to say something. His eyes moved.” The city was shaken to its core. Smith was at home in bed, exhausted after another march. “My wife came in and woke me and said that Dr King just got shot and I jumped up out of the bed, stood up, and the first thing that popped into my mind was: all hope is gone.” Smith, who earned $1.15 an hour back then and could not read or write until his mid to late 20s, is still working as a crew chief and fighting for workers’ rights. “Dr King taught me how to behave myself wisely because, before he came to Memphis, I was a street thug. I would fight at the drop of a hat. But he taught me how to behave like a man, act like a man and stick my shoulder up and be a man.” Another veteran of the march is the Rev James Netters, who was beaten by police and temporarily blinded by teargas. On the day King died, he was at a city council meeting negotiating on behalf of the garbage workers. Now 90, he recalls: “One of the council person’s wives called after we had finished putting the resolution together and said, ‘Turn the TV on, Martin has just been shot.’ My first remark is, ‘They killed my man.’ “They got me calmed down for a minute and said, ‘Wait till he gets to the hospital. He may be all right.’ I said, ‘That man is dead. They killed him. They killed my man.’ Martin was my idol, my mentor. I was at the march on Washington in 1963 and that speech [I Have a Dream] was so powerful and so enthralling that it just changed my whole life. So that’s how serious it was for me to have the man who had meant so much to me to be killed in that very moment.” Riots broke out in more than a hundred cities and many black neighbourhoods burned. The gunman, James Earl Ray, an escaped convict who had spoken of his loathing of African Americans, was arrested two months later at London’s Heathrow airport. He confessed and was sentenced to life in prison; he later recanted and claimed he had been set up. Ray died behind bars in 1998. Today the exterior of the Lorraine motel – listed in the Negro Motorist Green Book, or “Green Guide”, of establishments safe for African American travellers during the Jim Crow era of racial segregation – is preserved as it was: the rows of numbered doors, a sign with turquoise frame, yellow oval and white circles, even vintage cars in the car park. Room 306 recreates the quotidian details of King’s last hours: undrunk coffee, cigarettes in an ashtray, bed clothes turned back, a newspaper of the day. But the rest of the building now houses the National Civil Rights Museum, including a bus like the one on which Rosa Parks refused to give up her seat and a reconstruction of King’s jail cell in Birmingham. It is a museum, monument and, in some ways, millstone around the city’s neck. Robinson says: “As wonderful as the National Civil Rights Museum has been, it is a thing that is constantly revisited upon children. The first thing you learn when you go to this museum is that it is on the site of the murder of this person you are taught to idolise, but you are also implicitly being taught: don’t do that because that’s what happens to you. So there’s some shame there in this as well around both not speaking out but also the idea that, if you do speak out, you may be in danger.” The museum’s president, Terri Freeman, had a “visceral” reaction on her first visit. She recalls: “When I arrived here it was noticeable that the city was very scarred by what happened in ’68 and in many ways I felt that people were still living up on the balcony. It was a heavy burden: the city carried around this assassination. As opposed to bringing people together, it kind of solidified some divisions because you had a lot of white flight. “Downtown pretty much closed up, but a lot of development has occurred in the three years that I have been here,” she continued. “I think this 50th anniversary is helping actually for people to say, ‘OK, maybe we can let this go and really move forward.’ But you can’t just say we’re going to move forward without doing the work that it’s going to take.” After the initial gains of the civil rights movement in voting rights, school integration and employment in America, progress has stalled and in some cases gone into reverse for complex, interlocking reasons. Barack Obama, the first black president, was succeeded by Trump, who was endorsed by the Ku Klux Klan. Freeman admits: “All of us are culpable in this. Some of us got complacent over the years and kind of took for granted those gains that had occurred and then we looked up and said, ‘Oh-oh!’” A report produced by the museum and University of Memphis illustrates local frustrations. Among its findings is that the childhood poverty rate for African American children in Shelby county, which contains Memphis, is more than four times greater than that for whites. Median income for African Americans has remained at roughly half that of whites for the past half century. The incarceration rate for African Americans has increased 50% since 1980, while the rate for whites has fallen slightly. Tami Sawyer, director of diversity with Teach For America Memphis, says: “Memphis today is pretty much the same as when Martin Luther King died here. Of course there’s some integration and opportunity, but 50% of black kids live in poverty and schools are being resegregated. If King woke up here today, he’d probably say: ‘Is this the city I left?’ There hasn’t been a lot of change 50 years later.” The assassination “absolutely still casts a shadow”, she adds. “It’s a large part of our identity. We are constantly referred to as the city where Dr King died. Memphis died with Dr King, in a way.” Sawyer, 35, led a campaign to remove statues of Jefferson Davis, the president of the Confederacy during the civil war, and Nathan Bedford Forrest, a Confederate general and early member of the Klan, which was born in Tennessee. She witnessed them fall last December. “It was bittersweet,” she recalls. “I was overwhelmed, I was excited, I was in disbelief until they brought the statues off the base. I was elated. I thought heavily about the ancestors I’ll never know because they died in slavery.” But Sawyer received so much abuse that Facebook assigned her a specialist programmer to help deal with it. “Being black and being a woman made me more of a target,” she says. “It tells me we are still in a state in our country where racism lives. For a while it hid under the radar and now it’s back in the news and in our faces every day. We never solved racism. We never got equity. We have a lot more work to do. We are a racist country.” The election of Trump, and its emboldening of white supremacists, has sharpened questions around resistance and the need for a new generation of leaders. Had King lived, he would now be 89. What would he make of America today? Memphis native Hampton Sides, author of Hellhound On His Trail, about the assassination, says: “I’m not one of those people who believes King accomplished more in martyrdom than he would have accomplished had he lived on. No doubt the current state of America would cause him grave concern, but we could desperately use him right now. Think what a contribution he would make to the debates that are raging for the soul of our country – guns, immigration, police brutality, the war on truth. We sorely need his civility, his moderation, his message of non-violence and loving one’s enemies. He would have a lot to say.” Movements such as Black Lives Matter eschew hierarchy; online movements thrive without figureheads. Freeman is fine with that. “I think we run a risk of setting ourselves up for failure if we think that there’s going to be another King,” she says. “There will never be another Martin Luther King. “I honestly believe that, if King were alive today, he would be incredibly supportive of all the young people who are making their voices heard and using the tool of civil disobedience to begin to enact and create a movement for change because that’s what he did when he was alive. Yes, he was the figurehead, but there were thousands of people behind King that were moving and doing the work. We’re learning from our ancestors and our elders that we have to be persistent. We have to be in this for the long haul. We have to be tenacious. We have to be courageous. And so I think in that way that would make King very happy.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/lostinshowbiz/2018/mar/22/leather-jock-strap-one-used-chariot-bid-for-russell-crowe-divorce-detritus-auction","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-22T17:17:07Z","webTitle":"A leather jock strap, one used chariot … what are we bid for Russell Crowe’s divorce detritus?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/lostinshowbiz/2018/mar/22/leather-jock-strap-one-used-chariot-bid-for-russell-crowe-divorce-detritus-auction","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/lostinshowbiz/2018/mar/22/leather-jock-strap-one-used-chariot-bid-for-russell-crowe-divorce-detritus-auction","fields":{"headline":"A leather jock strap, one used chariot … what are we bid for Russell Crowe’s divorce detritus?","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Divorce is hard. It is especially hard, it seems, on celebrities. There’s John Cleese, who was so outraged at having to pay alimony to his wife of 16 years that he went on the not at all bitter sounding “Alimony Tour” in order to cope with the fact he now had a mere £10m in the bank. Heather Mills dumped a jug of water over Paul McCartney’s lawyer’s head. Then there was Brad Pitt who, after his split from Angelina Jolie, posed for GQ while saying things such as: “Right now I think manual labour is good for me. I’ve got to sweep the floor, I’ve got to wrap up my shit at night, you know?” And now we come to Russell Crowe, who is marking the end of his long-term marriage to Danielle Spencer with an auction at Sotheby’s in Australia entitled Russell Crowe: The Art of Divorce. Love: it just keeps on taking, but that doesn’t mean you can’t make some money while it takes, right? Obviously, we need to spend some serious time on what Russell is actually selling – the art, if you will – but first I really need some time with the cover of the catalogue of this auction. It features a photo of Russell himself, of course, sitting in what looks like a Travelodge lobby bar while wearing a tux and toasting the viewer with a tumbler of some amber-coloured liquid. Because there’s no better way to toast the end of a 30-year relationship than a photo that screams: “For relaxing times, make it Suntory time.” To the swag! Amid all the usual crap to be found in Hollywood actors’ wardrobes (endless disgusting expensive watches, random sporting paraphernalia, naff electric guitars), what Russell is really offloading is his film memorabilia. And what memorabilia! Are you the kind of person who has always longed for Russell’s leather jock strap from the movie Cinderella Man ($500-$600)? The cloth angel used to decorate a Christmas tree in the movie The Sum of Us ($400-$600)? If so, then, my friend, your time has come. Most notably lacking, however, are any souvenirs from Russell’s brief and apparently uncherished time on Ramsey Street. Where is Kenny Larkin’s leather jacket? And sure, Russell, you have (for some inexplicable reason) Denzel Washington’s seat back from the film American Gangster ($400-$600), but where is Bouncer’s lead? A napkin from Lassiter’s? A business card from Helen Daniels’ taxi service, Home James? It’s really like Russell doesn’t appreciate cultural history. Look, there’s some decent stuff here – a fully functioning chariot from Gladiator ($5,000-$10,000) would look rather smart in the garden, and the two full-size prop horses ($2,000-$4,000 each) are definitely what one could call “conversation pieces”. Captain Jack’s maritime uniform from Master and Commander ($25,000-$35,000) would certainly be a solution on days when one has absolutely nothing to wear. But they do rather make LiS wonder, not so much why would anyone want this, but why did Russell? I admire the sheer Australian-ness of all his Australian sporting mementos, but did he wear his Javert costume for Les Mis cosplay? Did he wear that leather jock strap for fun? I mean, we all take home a little from the office, but two horses, Russell? Two? Anyway, what the art of the divorce turns out to be is a handful of good stuff and a lot of inexplicable random craziness and the leathery smell of Russell Crowe’s crotch. This auction might be held to mark Russell’s divorce, but I think I just got a good insight into what marriage to him was like. Is Stormy Daniels a 21st-century Andrea Dworkin? And so to Lost in Showbiz’s feminist icon of 2018, a scrappy young fighter called Stormy Daniels. I like to think that Andrea Dworkin, who spent her adult life fighting against the hypersexualisation of the US, would get a kick out of the idea of a porn actor potentially bringing down a self-described sexual harasser and assaulter who somehow became the president of the United States. It’s not like you didn’t tell these knuckleheads where this would all lead, Andrea. Anyway, back to Stormy, who absolutely definitely did not have an affair with Donald Trump. OK, sure, Trump’s lawyer, Michael “Lionel Hutz” Cohen, just happened to pay her $130,000 in October 2016, but that was because he’s a nice guy and she needed some money for a coffee, and you know how expensive Starbucks is these days, right? Oh for God’s sake. We all know Trump banged her, and the fact that his supporters and vice-president Mike Pence don’t seem to give a damn has been a useful insight into how heartfelt their oft-professed conservative views about the sanctity of marriage really are. That Trump is currently launching – I kid you not – abstinence-only education in schools, while a porn star is currently and very credibly saying he cheated on his third wife takes this story to new heights. Let’s call it “Newt Gingrich pursuing Bill Clinton about Monica Lewinsky while he himself was cheating on his second wife” heights. But what to do with a woman who refuses to be slut-shamed into silence? No one seems to know. Stormy has been attacked viciously from the right and pretty much everyone else who has been in this position in the past – from Marilyn Monroe to Lewinsky – has found it pretty hard going. Not, apparently, Stormy. Her Twitter feed, which is both NSFW and wildly inspirational, is a masterclass in how a woman can refuse to live by the narratives others impose on her. “Why don’t you just disappear. No one cares you were a slut and slept with POTUS 12yrs ago,” one typical tweet at her went this week. “Technically I didn’t sleep with the POTUS 12 years ago. There was no sleeping (hehe) and he was just a goofy reality TV star. But I digress … People DO care that he lied about it, had me bullied, broke laws to cover it up, etc. And PS … I am NOT going anywhere xoxoxo,” she replied. “Slut and whore are words used by people who feel threatened. I find power in them,” she later added. Is Stormy the Andrea Dworkin the 21st century deserved? Probably. She certainly seems to be one we need. Cynthia Nixon: Sex and the State Governor Meanwhile uptown (part two), Miranda was launching her bid to be New York governor with her best friends. “Miranda, I can’t even govern my shoe closet – and you want to govern the whole state?!” Carrie gasped, working a Jackie O look (Givenchy skirt suit, Hermès bag, Louboutin shoes, Chanel boater hat) that she had worn for the occasion and had definitely bought on her freelance journalist’s salary. Samantha was talking to the press: “I don’t believe in the Republican party or the Democrat party, I just believe in parties,” she said, smiling into the camera and ignoring her friends, whom she was no longer speaking to. “Samantha, didn’t you use that line in the episode in which Carrie is dating a politician who keeps wanting to pee on her?” Charlotte piped up. “I don’t know – AND I’M STILL NOT SPEAKING TO YOU!” Samantha shouted before storming off to post something on Instagram. “Miranda’s a celebrity with no political experience. Carrie, don’t you think this is all a bit … Trumpian?” Charlotte asked. But Carrie wasn’t listening because she was too busy trying to think of a pun on “gubernatorial”. “I need to get new friends,” thought Miranda, slipping into her Uber and heading to City Hall.

I clicked through to a piece on NPR (National Public Radio) about the “foster mother” of the Florida school shooter; I navigated to, and then away from, a photo story about bound feet in the Economist that exceeded my number of free articles for the month. I read several pieces about people who wanted to leave Facebook, and one comment thread under a post by a friend who said goodbye, he was actually leaving (“don’t go!” said 37 other people), and then gazed for several moments at a photo of a gorge, taken by someone I’d never met on her holiday. It was pretty and, wondering where it was, I clicked through to the comments but they only said things like “how lovely”. By the time I was done with all this it was after 9pm.

Half the appeal, I became aware, was the muscle memory of scrolling and tapping – even, I suspect, of the eye movement – a series of small, fluid gestures that joined together felt soothing, in a way that might be recognised by a long-term chain smoker. I was conscious as I scrolled that emotion was being generated, frequently strong disdain – in this case, for someone who keeps putting up motivational messages and seems to be having a breakdown – and that this was, for a short while, gratifying. I was also aware of how fast that feeling drained. The night before, I had read 20 pages of Elizabeth Bowen’s novel The Last September, while piously ignoring the phone by my side, and it had felt simultaneously nourishing and also almost unbearably slow. I tell myself I need Facebook to stay informed, and there is some truth to this. I like the way, unlike on Twitter, old stories circulate again and again until finally I get around – or so it feels – to reading everything. And I like the passive connectivity; browsing the wedding photos of my third cousin once removed is a peculiar pastime, and yet it feels meaningful, keeping afloat an idea of the family in a way that makes the world feel marginally warmer. It is also, of course, a massive waste of time. My interests on Facebook skew tabloid, in line with the platform’s promotional biases and I’m forever clicking through to Washington Post stories about freak accidents or hideous child murders in the DC metropolitan area. There are the hours lost to pointless genealogy searches and the occasional bout of hate-browsing. Am I better informed and better connected for all this? Sort of. But it is an incredibly inefficient way to get information and, as became clearer last night, inculcates a weird mindset. As I logged off, I was aware that my sense of having caught up with the news rested on a dangerous assumption, a split-second’s thought, but still there: if there is something else worth reading, they’ll let me know. • Emma Brockes is a Guardian columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/2018/mar/23/its-more-than-just-turning-off-the-lights-what-else-to-do-for-earth-hour","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-23T15:44:15Z","webTitle":"'It's more than just turning off the lights': what else to do for Earth Hour","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/23/its-more-than-just-turning-off-the-lights-what-else-to-do-for-earth-hour","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/mar/23/its-more-than-just-turning-off-the-lights-what-else-to-do-for-earth-hour","fields":{"headline":"'It's more than just turning off the lights': what else to do for Earth Hour","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"For one hour every March since 2007, darkness has swept the globe as grassroots environmentalists, schools, offices and those responsible for some of the world’s most iconic landmarks switch off lights in a symbolic call for more action on climate change. This year, the WWF, which manages the initiative, hopes to build on its growing success and says millions of actions will be taken in at least 180 countries and territories. A record 187 countries took part in the event’s record breaking 10th year. An hour is not going to save the world – but a key message in publicising the event is that every action counts and that energised individuals can make genuine change to the way we think about human impact on the planet. The WWF says highlights of its pushes for new legislation include the banning of all plastics in the Galapagos in 2014, planting 17 million trees in Kazakhstan and pushing new laws for the protection of seas and forests in Russia. Here, readers tell us how they are going further than the hour (you should switch off the lights from 8:30-9:30pm local time) with gestures such as refusing plastic, leaving the car at home and hosting events to inspire others in 2018. ‘It is wrong to think we as individuals can’t achieve something meaningful’ – Jen Gale, 40, Wiltshire I’m making my own promise for the planet and refusing plastic cutlery when eating out, and I’m asking all the members of my 15k-strong Facebook community to join in, make their own pledges on 24 March and spread the word. When faced with huge issues like plastic pollution and climate change, it can feel overwhelming, as if we as individuals could never hope to achieve anything meaningful, but this is so wrong! Earth Hour is a brilliant event to raise awareness of the plight of the planet and allows people to show that they care. If everybody who makes a promise carries through with it, and the changes continue beyond Earth Hour, it really will make a difference in reducing the amount of plastic and carbon overloading the planet. ‘We will need to look at every part our lifestyles’ – Tim Eggins, 50, Chard, Somerset I am part of a local community group called Sustainable Chard. We have organised a day of events called Earth Hour Chard, including events aimed at the younger members of our town where they can learn about upcycling, renewable energy, planting and growing. During the afternoon there will be eco talks and workshops where people can learn how to reduce their impact on the planet with topics on travel, food, the home and carbon footprints and in the evening we have assembled live bands, musicians, poets, green traders and therapists for an Earth Hour extravaganza. We aim to engage as many people as possible, showing that the event is more than just switching off the lights: if we are to make any impact on climate change we will need to look at every part our lifestyles. ‘I’ll try to persuade my parents not to use the car’ – Tehya, 18, Zurich I am not just going to turn the lights off for an hour, I want to try to live in as environmentally friendly way as possible for the day. I will tell as many people as possible at school and locally to convince them to contribute to the effort. At home, I’ll unplug all electrical devices and lights during Earth Hour. I’ll try to persuade my parents not to use the car and to use public transport instead. I will not buy any plastic (food in plastic wrappings, bottles etc) or meat (which I don’t do anyway, as I am a vegetarian). In the evening when it’s dark I will try to not turn on any lights and use candles for light instead. ‘We hope to make people mindful of the need for conservation’ – Eric Engle, 32, West Virginia Our voluntary organisation Mid-Ohio Valley Climate Action has convinced Parkersburg city government, the county government and the federal buildings to turn off all the lights that they can. We’ll have a candlelit event with acoustic music at a park in the midst of dimmed downtown on the night. We hope to make people mindful of the need for conservation and energy efficiency and to educate on anthropogenic global climate change while encouraging environmental and climate activism and continued coalition-building. ‘Governments and big companies have the power to do more, but this does not absolve us of responsibility’ – Jo Harper, Leamington Spa At the school where I teach, we all wrote promises for the planet and hung them on our “promise tree”. I made 120 vegan flapjacks so that we could have a plastic-free breaktime and the children brought wild cuddly toys to school to raise money to sponsor four endangered animals. At home I am holding a candlelit Earth Hour dinner for 12 people, for which none of the ingredients can have been packed in plastic or use unsustainable palm oil. It’s quite a challenge! Earth Hour is largely symbolic, but it gets people thinking about the environment and what they can do personally. My message is that if we all do something, together we can make a big difference. By making promises about what we can do ourselves, it forces us to consider our own impact on the environment and our own responsibility. Governments and big companies have the power to do more, but this does not absolve us of responsibility. By holding the dinner party and asking some of my guests to make a plastic-free pudding, we have all become more aware of how plastic surrounds almost everything we buy. I now look at my shopping in a different way and I hope that other people will do so too. ‘Our Guides are spending a whole evening without electricity – Amy Billington, 23, Bangor I run a Guide unit in Groomsport, County Down, and we are participating in this year’s Earth Hour by running the entire evening in the dark, with no electricity. We are doing an environmental scavenger hunt around the local area as we meet beside the sea, gathering items such as plastics and litter to clean up our village a little bit, toasting marshmallows under tealights and trying to draw pictures in the dark. We hope to raise awareness of both Earth Hour itself and the WWF aims and values locally within our community. We want to do our bit in helping save the planet and show the Guides that you do not need to use so much electricity. We hope this event will inspire other local Guide, Brownie and Rainbow units to do the same and make this an annual event. ‘We’re hosting a community evening, cooking rescued surplus food from local farms’ – Charmaine Jacobs, Kent I run a social enterprise called the Gastro Hub in Folkestone aiming to connect people through sustainable food, cooking, conversation and communal dining experiences. Our overall mission is to reduce avoidable food waste and carbon emissions by preventing surplus food from going to landfill, through a community-led infrastructure to divert and transform this food into delicious and nutritious meals. For Earth Hour we are hosting a community candlelit supper serving warming soup made with surplus vegetables rescued from farms by the Gleaning Network in Kent. We are hoping to spread awareness of the individual and collective power we have to affect change on our environment. By bringing local people together in a way that demonstrates simple actions we can all take to reduce our carbon footprint, we hope that it will inspire a positive behaviour shift-change in others."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/mar/23/israel-bound-flight-crosses-saudi-arabia-airspace-first-time","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-23T09:27:49Z","webTitle":"Israel-bound plane flies over Saudi Arabia for first time","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/23/israel-bound-flight-crosses-saudi-arabia-airspace-first-time","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/mar/23/israel-bound-flight-crosses-saudi-arabia-airspace-first-time","fields":{"headline":"Israel-bound plane flies over Saudi Arabia for first time","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Saudi Arabia has opened its airspace for the first time to an Israel-bound passenger plane, breaking a 70-year-ban on commercial jets flying over the Arab kingdom to reach the Jewish state. While Riyadh does not formally recognise Israel, Thursday night’s touchdown by the Air India flight in Tel Aviv signalled a thawing of relations between the two countries which share a common enemy in Iran. “This is a historic evening. The Israeli skies are connecting with the Saudi Arabian skies in one direct flight,” the Israeli transport minister, Yisrael Katz, said when the jet landed at Ben Gurion airport. “We are celebrating the strengthening relations with India and the first civilian connection with Saudi Arabia and the Gulf states.” There was no confirmation that other airlines, including the Israeli flagship carrier El Al, whose planes have to fly under the Gulf and up the Red Sea, will be granted airspace access. Avoiding Saudi Arabia typically adds hours to Israel-bound flights. Riyadh has not yet formally acknowledged granting overflight rights, but aircraft trackers show the jet crossed its territory. Air India 139 took off from Delhi, and the Boeing Dreamliner flew over the kingdom for three hours, passing just west of the Saudi capital, according to the Flightradar24 monitoring app. Tracking showed the airliner had earlier flown over Oman, which also does not have official diplomatic relations with Israel. In his first foreign presidential trip, Donald Trump flew from Riyadh to Tel Aviv on Air Force One. His son-in-law, Jared Kushner, has a rapport with the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, and they have discussed a possible peace plan for Israel and Palestine. However, after the White House recognised Jerusalem as Israel’s capital, the Palestinian leadership rejected the US as a broker and has also become distrustful of Saudi Arabia."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"}]}}
