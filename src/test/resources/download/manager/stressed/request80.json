Adrian and Christine Whitehurst, nicknamed the “vampires of debt”, set up First Step in 2007, promising to help hard-pressed families bring their debts under control with easy monthly payments. But by the time the firm was placed in administration in 2014, £7m was missing from client funds, according to the Financial Conduct Authority – and the 4,000 people who paid in have little chance of seeing any of their money returned as it is not covered by a financial services industry compensation scheme. The couple, from Stockport, spent more than £500,000 on holidays, including luxury hotels in Marbella, Venice, Vienna and Greece. Another £200,000 went on a string of top-of-the range vehicles, including a Bentley, Range Rover and a Ducati motorbike, while £50,000 was lavished on Hermès and Louis Vuitton clothes and bags. In total, Adrian Whitehurst received more than £1.1m in cash, with the FCA declaring that £2.75m was “misappropriated”. Adrian, 55, and his wife, Christine, 54, shared images on social media of game drives in Kenya watching lions and giraffes, while their clients were struggling to pay off overdrafts and credit cards. Cash and loans taken from client accounts by the Whitehursts to buy shares in a speculative overseas development were sold back to the company to cover much of the shortfall in clients’ accounts. But administrators said the share valuations were questionable and have not been able to realise their value. Problems at First Step first emerged in November 2009, just two years after it was granted a consumer credit licence by the Office of Fair Trading. The OFT visited the firm following customer complaints, and in 2010 told First Step it was minded to revoke its licence. But the firm’s licence was not fully revoked until October 2013. During the period between the OFT’s first warning and the company being forced to close, the shortfall in client accounts ballooned by several million pounds. The FCA said the shortfall was £466,134 in November 2009, £3,869,472 by 2011 and £6,119,716 by October 2013. When the firm was formally placed into administration in 2014 the shortfall exceeded £7m. “From 1 December 2009 to 18 October 2013, Mr Whitehurst, together with Mrs Whitehurst, misappropriated more than £2.75m of client money. Mrs Whitehurst made or authorised drawings through her director’s loan account to facilitate this misappropriation and they used the client money to fund a luxury lifestyle,” said the FCA. The regulator described the Whitehursts as “reckless and dishonest”, as they knew that the money should have been used to repay their customers’ creditors. The Whitehursts told desperately indebted customers that they were building up a ringfenced pot of money for each customer, and that they would challenge the enforceability of debts against the customers while starting mis-selling claims to recover cash. But First Step made no – or token – payments to creditors. The FCA said: “The firm’s customers are unable to recover their money as these losses are not covered by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme, and as such were left with continuing debts.” The regulatory oversight of First Step was the responsibility of the OFT, although powers have since been transferred to the FCA. Mark Steward, FCA executive director of enforcement and market oversight, said: “The Whitehursts were trusted by their customers, who were extremely vulnerable, to help them with their debt problems. They abused this trust, living a luxury lifestyle at the expense of people who could not afford to lose their money. “They showed complete disregard for the consequences of their actions and we have taken the strongest action possible in preventing them from operating in financial services again.” The FCA said it had passed its findings to the City of London police."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2017/oct/29/on-my-radar-rupert-grint-cultural-highlights-ferryman-shrigley-palahniuk","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-29T10:00:24Z","webTitle":"On my radar: Rupert Grint’s cultural highlights","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/oct/29/on-my-radar-rupert-grint-cultural-highlights-ferryman-shrigley-palahniuk","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2017/oct/29/on-my-radar-rupert-grint-cultural-highlights-ferryman-shrigley-palahniuk","fields":{"headline":"On my radar: Rupert Grint’s cultural highlights","bodyText":"Born in Harlow in 1988 and raised in Hertfordshire, Rupert Grint rose to fame after being cast as Ron Weasley in the Harry Potter film series – the world’s second-highest grossing movie franchise – at the age of 11, alongside Daniel Radcliffe and Emma Watson. Outside the Potter world, his film roles include Driving Lessons (2006), Wild Target (2010), and Postman Pat (2014). He made his stage debut in Mojo at the Harold Pinter theatre, London, in 2013. He has recently starred in Snatch (2017), a TV adaptation of Guy Ritchie’s film of the same name, and will star alongside Nick Frost in new TV comedy Sick Note, launching on Sky 1 and streaming service Now TV on 7 November. 1 | Play The Ferryman I’m a huge Jez Butterworth fan – the first play I ever did was one of his. I really enjoyed this one: it’s ambitious, the cast is huge and it’s got so many animals and children in it. Visually, there’s just so much to look at. It’s set in Northern Ireland in the 1980s, with Thatcher in power, and centred on a farming family who were at one point heavily involved with the IRA. It’s a great bit of storytelling and the staging is amazing – it’s all set in one part of the house so you really get a snapshot of the family dynamic. As with a lot of Jez’s stuff, it’s got some very dark twists. 2 | Art David Shrigley David Shrigley is an artist I’ve always been a follower of. I love his humour; it really connects with me. He does these weird, unsettling cartoons paired with sometimes quite upsetting text. I’ve got two prints of his at home, and a lot of his books. I do a bit of similar art, and I’m quite into crazy cartoons, so he’s a bit of an inspiration. He’s recently done the fourth plinth in Trafalgar Square, with this big thumbs-up. I’ve never met him, but I quite like the mystery – I don’t really want to know too much about him. 3 | Book Rant: An Oral Biography of Buster Casey by Chuck Palahniuk I loved this book. It’s a fictional biography written through the words of people who knew this central character, Buster Casey. At one point he visits this dystopian world where people are split into Daytimers and Nighttimers, so it’s got science-fiction elements to it. I’ve read quite a lot of his stuff, and what I love is that he always manages to find something disturbing in his characters, something you’ve never encountered before. And the way it’s written has a kind of documentary feel about it, so it’s quite cinematic. A lot of his books have that quality – like Fight Club. I’d love to see this one as a film. 4 | Music Hamilton soundtrack I’m not very good at keeping up with the charts – I’ve always felt like a bit of an outsider when it comes to that. Recently I’ve been listening to the [hip-hop Broadway musical] Hamilton soundtrack: the music is so clever; lyrically it’s just genius. There’s not a bad song on there – it just flows so well. I saw it earlier this year in New York. I’d been listening to the soundtrack for about a year before that, so I knew what was going to happen, but then seeing it on stage was brilliant. It’ll be interesting to see if it’s as well loved when it comes to the UK [in December], but the music is so good, and [Hamilton composer and actor] Lin-Manuel Miranda is a genius. It was one of the best things I’ve watched. 5 | TV RuPaul’s Drag Race I watch this religiously. I came to it quite late, but I watched every single series in a very short period of time and was completely taken by it. I didn’t know what the drag world was all about so it was really educational. It’s an art form I think a lot of people should know about and appreciate, because it’s really impressive. I like it when they have to make their own outfits, and I love [drag queen] Sharon Needles, she’s my favourite. It’s really good TV, and I’m constantly trying to get people to watch it. I’ve actually managed to get my dad to watch it. 6 | Website threadless.com This is a graphic design competition website. You design T-shirts to a theme, like the 1990s, or puns, and people vote on them. There’s this whole community of designers, and if their design wins it gets made into real products which people can buy on the site. The winners are usually professional graphic designers, but it’s open to everyone. I’ve been designing on there anonymously for a couple of years, under a pseudonym. One of my designs got printed a few months ago – that was big, man. It’s a cool site and a clever concept, a fun way to chat with like-minded artists. 7 | Game Time Run, London E8 I did this escape room a couple of months ago, and it’s really, really fun. You split into teams and go into different rooms and you have to try to get out. When you go with a group of mates it’s a really good night out, and the set’s incredible. It has a time-travel theme to it: one room is a futuristic spaceship world, one’s an Egyptian land, then there’s Hitler’s office. There are a lot of elements from The Crystal Maze: we were in groups of five, and you have to work together. We didn’t actually escape – we got locked in Hitler’s office right at the end, which was quite distressing. But it was so much fun."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/oct/23/the-21st-century-hollywood-how-silicon-valley-became-the-worlds-trend-capital","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-23T14:24:06Z","webTitle":"The 21st-century Hollywood: how Silicon Valley became the world’s trend capital","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/oct/23/the-21st-century-hollywood-how-silicon-valley-became-the-worlds-trend-capital","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/oct/23/the-21st-century-hollywood-how-silicon-valley-became-the-worlds-trend-capital","fields":{"headline":"The 21st-century Hollywood: how Silicon Valley became the world’s trend capital","bodyText":"The strangest thing about Bulletproof Coffee isn’t stirring a pellet of grass-fed butter and a dollop of coconut oil into your morning cup and calling it breakfast, weird though that is to swallow. No, what makes Bulletproof really unusual is the trajectory the trend has followed. The craze started with the Silicon Valley entrepreneur Dave Asprey, who turned the alleged weight-shedding, brainpower-enhancing benefits of caffeine turbocharged with fat into a mini-empire. He took the idea to Santa Monica, where he opened a cafe. David Beckham started dropping in. From there, it spread to fashion. Vogue has called it “the new green juice”; at the recent fashion shows, it was on the way to replacing espresso and egg-white omelette as the standard front-row breakfast. Dan Brown, whose novels surely give him zeitgeist bragging rights, has been telling interviewers how 4am writing sessions for his latest book, Origin, were fuelled by Bulletproof. Asprey’s ready-made, cold-pressed Bulletproof products are about to go on sale in Whole Foods Market stores, at which point the journey from Silicon Valley quirk to bona fide hipster lifestyle trend will be complete. The direction of travel of trends outwards from Silicon Valley was visible when Duncan Selbie, the chief executive of Public Health England, warned of the “perils of sitting at your desk” all day and called for employers to introduce “walking meetings” to reduce stress and back pain among the workforce. The pioneer of the walking meeting was Steve Jobs and the habit is so deeply ingrained in Silicon Valley culture that the Frank Gehry-designed Facebook headquarters features four hectares of wifi-enabled wildflower meadows, with milkshake stands dotted along paths. On Prince Street in New York’s Soho, the newest boutique to open alongside Marc Jacobs and Ralph Lauren is evidence of the first true fashion trend to originate in Silicon Valley. Allbirds, the woollen sneakers that are already de rigueur at Googleplex, are spreading to “a creative class of people … architects, interior designers, entertainers in music and acting”, as the San Francisco-based cofounder Joey Zwillinger told the New York Observer. “Free sushi, massage chairs, toilet seats that heat up – employees at top companies here live like celebrities,” says Ravi Belani, director of the Alchemist, a startup accelerator and lecturer in entrepreneurship at Stanford University. Two hundred miles from the Sierra Nevada, where gold-rush fortunes were made overnight in the 19th century, and 500 miles from the Los Angeles hills where stars were born in the 20th century, Silicon Valley has become the 21st-century Hollywood. If you want to get rich and famous fast, this is where you need to be. “It’s not like this place is full of beautiful people,” says Bebe Chueh, the cofounder of the law firm Atrium, which specialises in helping startups, “but you can accelerate your career here. You don’t need to wade for years through a company structure. You can make it all happen when you are 22.” Anjula Acharia, who, as a celebrity manager and a partner in Trinity Ventures, bestrides the worlds of Hollywood and tech, says that, in the tech sphere, “people are still wearing anoraks. They do still look sort of geeky. This is definitely not New York or London in terms of style. But they have become the global elite. People see that, and they want to be part of that world.” “Twenty years ago, when we started lastminute.com, tech was totally weird and geeky,” remembers the cross-bench peer and Twitter board member Martha Lane Fox. “At that point, people were still wondering if the internet was really going to be a thing. As a relatively young woman wanting to be involved in it, I struck people as bizarre. And, although there are still not nearly enough women, that perception has changed. There has been a huge cultural shift.” “Revenge of the nerds” is how Troy Carter – the former manager of Lady Gaga and now a Silicon Valley venture capitalist – describes this change. Last year, Carter told Time magazine about leaving a barbecue in Silicon Valley with a feeling that “the power was shifting”. The new stardust glinting from the glass offices of Silicon Valley has not gone unnoticed by the fashion world. Virgil Abloh, the founder of Off-White, a Kanye West collaborator and probably the hottest name in the fashion industry right now, attended September’s iPhone X launch in the company of his friend Jony Ive, the chief design officer of Apple, and Angela Ahrendts, senior vice-president of retail at Apple, who was wearing a pink lace Burberry trench (Ahrendts was CEO of Burberry until 2014). In the same month, the San Francisco-born, New York-based fashion designer Alexander Wang – who, until recently, liked to hold up Ralph Lauren’s empire as his aspiration – began to talk about wanting to be more like Amazon. “Obviously, the big opportunity is digital. I feel that today there is still not a single lifestyle brand that operates like a tech company,” he said. “Imagine a creative director today for a brand like Amazon. What would that look like?” Karl Lagerfeld has built Chanel into a pop-cultural powerhouse on the back of his instinct for the modern and has made gorgeous, aspirational set design a fashion-week calling card – a Paris street by night, the gardens of Versailles. Last October, he built a datacentre for his show, with the colours of tweed suits picked out in tangles of Ethernet cables. Silicon Valley’s ascent to glamour can be crudely measured in the intermarriage with models (Snapchat’s Evan Spiegel to Victoria’s Secret’s Miranda Kerr, in May), ostentatious parties (Sean Parker’s fantasy-themed redwood forest wedding, reported to have cost $10m) and glossy magazine covers (Spiegel was called “the first Silicon Valley sex symbol” by GQ after landing the cover of Italian Vogue Uomo two years ago). Not to mention the films (The Social Network, 2010), the booming roll-call of bold-faced name investors (Jay-Z in Uber, Ashton Kutcher in Airbnb) and, er, interplanetary ambitions (Elon Musk is only dropping by on his way to Mars). At the core of all this, says Lane Fox, is the new reality that “tech is at the centre of who we are – and that is true for celebrities as well. Managing social media is a huge part of being a model or a pop star now, so, in a way, they are stars of tech.” The financial crisis played its part in Silicon Valley’s Hollywood makeover. “After 2008, a lot of the Ivy League grads who would have gone to Wall Street to make money started to come to Silicon Valley instead. There was a new sexiness about being an entrepreneur,” says Belani. “There have been negative imports that have come with that: a kind of bro culture, or fraternity culture, that arrived with that intake,” he adds. Chueh has seen a physical and cultural migration since she moved to San Francisco in 2011. “Gradually, the ecosystem has moved from Cupertino, where the culture was kind of hardcore geeky, to San Francisco, where it is more about web applications and tech-enabled ideas than it is about hardware and semiconductors.” Chichi members’ clubs have sprung up in the city: the Battery in 2015, the Modernist this year. The size of Silicon Valley egos have been mapped, through the last decade, in the pages of the architecture journals that have tracked an arms race of starchitect-designed offices. The Airbnb headquarters features a replica of the war room from Dr Strangelove. The new Apple Park spaceship has grandeur on a scale to rival the pharaohs’ pyramids. Silicon Valley has shaped a new culture in which work looks like play (ping-pong tables in reception, bean bags in W1A), but in which being off duty is frowned upon, even at weekends. “This is rooted in the brutal reality that, when you run a website, it’s always on,” says Lane Fox. “It’s not like a shop. You don’t get to close it.” Combined with the sense of mission that is the Silicon Valley creation myth, this has bred a workaholic culture, which has become a badge of honour. “The idea here is that work and play are one,” says Chueh. “Work isn’t something you go to from nine to five to get a paycheck. It’s an extension of your passion.” The working hours take their toll, and while early startup culture was fuelled by pizzas laid on for team all-nighters, Silicon Valley has gradually absorbed the wellness fixation of its native California. Bowls of free M&amp;Ms have been replaced by meditation pods. At Apple Park, fruit from the 9,000 drought-resistant trees will be harvested for use in the canteen, which will serve 14,000 lunches a day. In parallel with the keto-diet and Bulletproof enthusiasts, Silicon Valley is a driving force behind a boom in veganism, powered by enthusiasm for the new frontier of healthy, sustainable faux-meat products. “It’s cool now to be vegan,” says Belani. In contrast to the enthusiasm for radical diets and alternative work spaces, fashion in Silicon Valley is noticeably low key. Time spent on sartorial decisions is time that could be better spent working. Form follows function. “You have to look at the weather to understand the dress code here,” says Chueh. “It can be cold in the early morning and hot in the afternoon, so it’s all about layers: a T-shirt and a hoodie. On the other hand, there are no real seasons. So, unlike in, say, Boston, your wardrobe is pretty much the same all year round.” “I dress totally differently when I am in Silicon Valley as opposed to Hollywood,” says Acharia-Bath. “For instance, no one wears heels here, so, if you do, it becomes, like, a thing.” The flat-shoe, jeans and backpack uniform, technically unisex, but with a masculine, grey-marl slant, holds up a mirror to a very male world. “This is still an industry so dominated by men, especially at the top level,” says Lane Fox. Which should be enough to give us pause as this culture grows in influence, setting the agenda in ever more arenas. And just as the maverick, anarchic mindset that can be exciting and progressive in startup culture becomes something more dangerous as the big beasts of tech control and shape every aspect of our lives, from the news we read on Facebook to the private thoughts that are open secrets thanks to Google’s search history, Silicon Valley’s radical attitude to nutrition has the potential to act as a gateway drug to more extreme versions of biohacking. Ambrosia is a San Francisco startup that offers transfusions of young people’s blood, for £6,200 a session, to a client list with a median age of 60. Better sleep and an improvement in some early indicators for cancer and Alzheimer’s are among the benefits Ambrosia claims from early research (although the scientific community has been cautious about the results to date). Yes, this sounds ridiculous. But then, there was a time – not so long ago – when you might have been sceptical about the prediction that, by 2015, the average British child would spend less time outdoors than a high-security prisoner (less than an hour on average, whereas a lifer should get 60 minutes, under UN guidelines). Or that one in three British preschool children would own their own iPad. But what came out of Cupertino changed all that. Silicon Valley is the new Hollywood in many ways, but with one crucial difference: this time, it’s not just make-believe."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/oct/23/hotel-guests-who-complain-about-rough-sleepers-spoiling-their-view-can-sod-off","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-23T12:09:02Z","webTitle":"Hotel guests who complain about rough sleepers spoiling their view can sod off","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/oct/23/hotel-guests-who-complain-about-rough-sleepers-spoiling-their-view-can-sod-off","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/oct/23/hotel-guests-who-complain-about-rough-sleepers-spoiling-their-view-can-sod-off","fields":{"headline":"Hotel guests who complain about rough sleepers spoiling their view can sod off","bodyText":"I came out of a meeting one evening last week with some chums, and there was a fellow lying on the pavement in the doorway under his duvet with a couple of bags of possessions. He needed milk for his cereal. So we got him some, plus a bowl, spoon, sugar and a nice hot cup of tea, because it was chilly and starting to drizzle. And we didn’t think he was there as a fun lifestyle choice. Winter is arriving, and here we go again. In the cold, homeless rough sleepers are more troubling to see. So troubling that they quite ruin the view from some London hotels. Guests have been moaning away about the unsightly clusters of homeless humans visible from their windows, so the hotels have been moaning at Camden council, who must now do their best to make the pavements less comfy, and discourage us from giving money, snacks or tents to anyone sodden and freezing on the ground. It only encourages the destitute. To carry on being destitute. It’s tricky for the councils. If they’re only a bit mean, it won’t work when people are desperate, but if they’re very mean, it upsets most of us. Remember Tesco’s anti-homeless spikes in 2014? They claimed they were to prevent antisocial behaviour, but removed the spikes after protests. Or security guards hosing the sleepers away? Or South Tyneside’s December 2016 effort to fine beggars £100 for accepting drinks and snacks? Although they only meant to target “professional beggars”, they said. But how do you tell the difference? And if the councils are too brutish, there’s a risk that the public may feel rebellious and defiant. I do. Why should we not give someone money/food/drinks if we’ve just come out of Sainsbury’s, or wherever, laden with food, and they look pale, weak, sick, half-starved and heading for an early death? “Sod off, government/councils/hotel guests,” I tend to think. “I’ll do what I bloody like” – until there are some policy changes, such as stopping “defensive architecture” and universal credit roll-out, controlling rents and greedy landlords, and building enough hostels, homes, shelters (dog-friendly) and refuges, increasing wages and mental health provision. And telling hotel visitors to draw their curtains and shut up."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"world/2017/oct/23/public-indecency-case-against-briton-dropped-by-dubai-government-jamie-harron","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-23T11:58:15Z","webTitle":"Public indecency case against Briton dropped by Dubai government","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/23/public-indecency-case-against-briton-dropped-by-dubai-government-jamie-harron","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/oct/23/public-indecency-case-against-briton-dropped-by-dubai-government-jamie-harron","fields":{"headline":"Public indecency case against Briton dropped by Dubai government","bodyText":"A Scottish man who was prosecuted in Dubai for touching a man’s hip has been freed a day after being sentenced to three months in jail, his supporters have said. Jamie Harron, 27, was told on Monday morning that the case against him had been dropped by special order of the United Arab Emirates prime minister and ruler of Dubai, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al Maktoum, according to the campaign group Detained in Dubai. Harron was initially arrested for public indecency for touching a man’s hip as he carried a drink through a crowded bar in Dubai on 15 July. The electrician, from Stirling, claimed he was simply trying to avoid spilling his drink when he brushed past the man at the Rock Bottom bar. The Detained in Dubai advocacy group, which has been supporting Harron, said on Monday he had been handed back his passport at a police station and told he was free to leave. The government of Dubai has not responded to the Guardian’s request for confirmation. On Sunday Harron was sentenced to three months in prison for the public indecency charge and told he faced further court proceedings for drinking alcohol and allegedly swearing at the businessman he touched. Radha Stirling, the chief executive of Detained in Dubai, said Harron was “understandably nervous” when he was called in by the police on Monday morning. When he arrived at the police station, she said, his passport was returned and he was told he was free to go. “The charges were dropped, the sentence annulled, and he faces no order for deportation. This came by direct order from Sheikh Mohammed.” Stirling added: “We wish to express our deepest gratitude to Sheikh Mohammed for his personal intervention in this case, and for exonerating Jamie at long last. It has now been established that the allegations against Jamie were entirely unwarranted, defamatory and meritless, to such an extent that the ruler of the country found it necessary to step in and correct the wrongful action of the public prosecutor and to quash the judgment of the court. “This was a courageous and honourable decision on the part of Sheikh Mohammed, and while it highlights the urgent need for judicial reform in the country, it is also a hopeful sign that the UAE’s leadership possesses the will and vision to pursue such reforms in the future.” Stirling said on Sunday that Harron had “suffered tremendously” as a result of the allegations, had lost his job, faced losing his home and was struggling to pay his legal bills. He was detained in prison for five days after his arrest, she said, and his family has been unable to visit him without facing imprisonment themselves. Groups that campaign for reforms in the Emirate state welcomed the move but called for Sheikh Mohammed to overhaul the country’s judicial system. About 1.5 million Britons visit the UAE every year, according to the British government, with Dubai an increasingly popular destination for holidaymakers. But the government warns travellers from that UAE laws and customs are very different to those in the UK and that there may be serious penalties for doing something that might not be illegal in the UK. All sex outside marriage is illegal, for example, and public displays of affection are frowned upon and can result in arrests. Alcohol is served in licensed hotels and clubs but it is a punishable offence to drink, or be under the influence of alcohol, in public. The International Campaign for Freedom in the UAE said: “Since the Arab spring of 2011, repression has been rapidly stepped up by the UAE authorities, which has seen both Emiratis and non-Emiratis arbitrarily detained, forcefully disappeared, and in many cases tortured on the most frivolous of charges. “It is imperative that Jamie’s case be understood within this wider climate of repression inside the UAE and that the British government do more to inform its citizens about the real risks and dangers of travelling to the country.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2017/oct/24/tuesdays-best-tv-calais-the-end-of-the-jungle-our-girl-18-30-stone-holiday","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-24T05:00:37Z","webTitle":"Tuesday’s best TV: Calais, the End of the Jungle; Our Girl; 18-30 Stone Holiday","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/oct/24/tuesdays-best-tv-calais-the-end-of-the-jungle-our-girl-18-30-stone-holiday","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2017/oct/24/tuesdays-best-tv-calais-the-end-of-the-jungle-our-girl-18-30-stone-holiday","fields":{"headline":"Tuesday’s best TV: Calais, the End of the Jungle; Our Girl; 18-30 Stone Holiday","bodyText":"The 18-30 Stone Holiday 9pm, ITV Eight Brits, some tipping the scales at more than 190kg (30st), head for the Bahamas and the plus-size-friendly environs of The Resort, a hotel with reinforced toilets and beds.

Amid the ambient sounds and visuals, facts occasionally swim into view: “Monks wear their hoods up to cut out external distractions and focus on prayer.” We should all be hoodies. Ali Catterall The End of the F***ing World 10.20pm, Channel 4 Based on the comic by Chuck Forsman, this show, stripped across the week, finds Alex Lawther and Jessica Barden as misfit teens James and Alyssa. Alyssa is looking for someone with an edge amid stultifying suburbia and she finds it in James. Sadly, he’s a budding psychopath who is looking for someone to murder. Which creates a queasy dynamic for a black comedy – there really had better be a good reason for it down the line. Ben Arnold 1917: One Year, Two Revolutions 9pm, National Geographic The might of imperial Russia once seemed likely to last for ever. But the first world war enfeebled the once imperious state, leading to calls for revolution against Nicholas II. This, in turn, led to nine tumultuous months that irrevocably altered global politics. Told through the writing of a journalist stationed in Petrograd throughout the uprising and accompanied by captivating archive footage of the era, it’s a compelling chronicle. Mark Gibbings-Jones The Race Underground 7.50pm, PBS America Fascinating look at the beginnings of underground railways in the US.

Despite precedents elsewhere – London and Glasgow had started work on subway systems – public opinion and political deadlock proved large obstacles.

Southwark and Croydon councils in south London warned that without rapid changes the new system could have a devastating effect across the country as it is rolled out over the next few months, warning that arrears could reach “many hundreds of millions of pounds” and that tenants could face severe hardship. One food bank reported an increase in referrals of 97%. The findings emerge amid reports that the government is considering changes to cut the minimum six-week waiting period universal credit claimants must wait before they receive a first payment. Ministers have been warned that the widespread evidence of hardship caused to many tenants by the 42-day wait risks turning the flagship welfare policy into a “new poll tax”. The report examined rent accounts for 775 social housing tenants in the two boroughs who had moved on to universal credit between August and October 2016, comparing them with 249 rent accounts held by tenants who moved on to the older housing benefit system during the same period. The study found that 36% of those moving on to universal credit failed to pay rent at all in the first week, and on average accrued arrears for each of the next 11 weeks. At this point arrears stabilised but were not fully paid off. At the end of the study period 406 of the 775 households on universal credit were in a worse financial position that at the start. On average, each universal credit tenant ran up arrears at a rate of 60p a day. Total arrears for this group rose by £89,000 over the period. Southwark said that although just 12% of its social housing tenants were on universal credit, they have collectively built up £5.8m in rent arrears. The average universal credit household was £1,178 in arrears, compared with £8 in credit for the average council rent account across the borough. The study found that by week 20 tenants in receipt of universal credit were on average £156 in arrears, while those on housing benefit were in credit. Universe credit tenants were far more likely than housing benefit claimants to fail to pay the full rent owed – more than a third underpaid rent by 75%. The study found that long delays for universal credit payments was a key cause of stress, anxiety and depression for claimants. There was a common perception among claimants that the system was inflexible and challenging to navigate. Those tenants used to being paid weekly or fortnightly found it particularly difficult to move to a system of monthly payments. “Participants in this research almost universally have experienced financial hardship as a result of transitioning onto universal credit, notably as a result of the significant delays to payment,” the study says. Universal credit problems have also stretched local hardship services. As well as the local Pecan food bank reporting a 97% increase in referrals in the first three months of the year, Southwark council’s emergency support scheme handed out 34% more food parcels over the same period. Fiona Colley, Southwark’s cabinet member for finance, modernisation and performance, said: “This report’s stark evidence is why we need to lead this debate; I implore the government to listen to how this is affecting the poorest and most vulnerable people in our borough, and the potential effects reverberating nationally. “Universal credit, in its current form, has the potential to be catastrophic, not just for residents at an individual level, but for councils’ ... [budgets for housing]. “The arbitrary delay in receipt of money – particularly for those already in difficult situations such as temporary accommodation, could mean a spiral of debt, poverty and people not being able to afford to eat. I cannot think of a more compelling reason to push for change on this.” Alison Butler, Croydon council’s deputy leader and cabinet member for homes, regeneration and planning, said: “This report underlines the major flaws in universal credit, which is placing more and more Croydon and Southwark families in rent arrears and at risk of losing their home. The government needs to fix this policy now or risk devastating thousands more people not only in Croydon but nationwide.” The councils said more flexibility for tenants to arrange to have the housing benefit element of universal credit paid direct to the landlord would ease the transition period, along with shorter waiting times for a first payment to claimants. Universal credit was designed to simplify the benefits system by bundling six existing entitlements, including unemployment benefit, housing benefit and working tax credit, into one. However, the long-delayed programme – it is currently five years behind schedule – has run into huge criticism as a result of huge cuts and administrative errors and complexity. Labour, which supports the general principle of universal credit, is seeking a pause to the rollout so problems can be fixed. After the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, raised the issue of claimants being charged 55p a minute when calling a helpline on a mobile phone, the work and pensions secretary, David Gauke, announced last week that this line would be made free. Later that day the party inflicted a symbolic Commons defeat on the government with the passing of an opposition day motion calling for a pause in the rollout. It was passed by 299 votes to zero after government whips ordered Tory MPs to abstain. A Department for Work and Pensions spokesman said: “This research into a small group of claimants was carried out over a year ago, now the vast majority of claimants receive their first universal credit on time and in full. “The best way to help people pay their rent and to improve their lives is to support them into work, and under universal credit people are moving into work faster and staying in work longer than the old system. We also know that over time people adjust to managing monthly payments, and reduce their arrears. “The majority of people are comfortable managing their money upfront but budgeting advice, upfront benefit advances and direct rent payments to landlords can be provided for those who need it.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/oct/23/a-modern-mosque-without-minarets-stirs-controversy-in-tehran","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-23T18:55:47Z","webTitle":"A modern mosque without minarets stirs controversy in Tehran","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/23/a-modern-mosque-without-minarets-stirs-controversy-in-tehran","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/oct/23/a-modern-mosque-without-minarets-stirs-controversy-in-tehran","fields":{"headline":"A modern mosque without minarets stirs controversy in Tehran","bodyText":"When the Tehran authorities commissioned the construction of a mosque near the City theatre – one of Iranian capital’s most distinctive buildings – it was always going to be a tricky balancing act for the architects to design something unique that did not eclipse the adjacent structure. The theatre, which was built before the 1979 revolution, has a spectacular tiled circular structure with external pillars and is the largest exclusive space in Iran for performing arts. The new mosque next door is a modern building that sits in harmony with it, sweeping from the ground towards the Qibla (the direction of Mecca), allowing sunlight through windows embedded in a wave-like structure. But the Vali-e-Asr mosque, designed by the Iranian architects Reza Daneshmir and Catherine Spiridonoff, is stirring controversy in a country that hosts some of the world’s most glittering places of worship. Iranian hardliners are refusing to recognise it as a mosque, complaining that it does not have a minaret or proper dome, and that it is dwarfed by the theatre. The conservative Mashregh News said: “A mosque sacrificed for the City theatre,” adding that it had been “decapitated in the honour of the theatre”. It was “an insulting, postmodern design” that is “empty of any meaning”, it said. The mosque was due to be officially inaugurated this summer, nearly 10 years after the couple’s Tehran-based architecture firm, Fluid Motion, was commissioned to design it. The building is almost finished, but controversy has led to its funding being cut, meaning that the interior design has not been completed. Its fate remains in doubt. Some media reports suggest that the authorities intend to turn it into an Islamic cultural centre, with possible physical alterations. The mosque is located in “one of the most culturally sensitive places in Tehran”, according to its architects. It is at a point where the Enghelab (Revolution) Street crosses the tree-lined Vali-e-Asr, the most important junction in the city, not far from Tehran University and its surrounding bookshops. “We tried to create an interaction between the mosque, which has a cultural essence, and the City theatre. We wanted to make it a cultural project that would be in harmony with its surroundings – the mosque should respond to the needs of its own time,” the architects said. Built over an area of 3,855 sq metres (4,600 sq yards), the seven-floor mosque is 32 metres high, only 20 metres of which is above ground. It has big prayer halls, cultural centres, an imam’s residence and parking spaces. The mosque was proposed 14 years ago when Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was mayor of Tehran. Theatre directors strongly opposed an initial design by a different architect because the building was 52 metres high and threatened the theatre’s fragile foundation. When Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf became mayor, the design was given to Fluid Motion. The couple are experts in designing contemporary buildings. Daneshmir’s 2008 Pardis Mellat cinema is in many ways responsible for starting a new wave of modern structures in Tehran. A new generation of Iranian architects are following in the footsteps of a pre-revolutionary avant gardewho pushed the boundaries of traditional Persian architecture by using traditional elements in modern designs. “Our biggest source for this project was the Qur’an itself,” the architects said. “We tried to design this mosque with modesty, simplicity and good faith, and not a mosque which would get its pride from its structural height. The Vali-e-Asr mosque is located near the students’ park and the City theatre. We wanted it to connect better with the younger generations.” The couple said they were inspired by the Quba mosque, the oldest in the world dating back to the lifetime of the prophet Muhammad. “Simplicity was a main feature of the first mosques,” they said. They thought about the one-room concept and designed it so that “the general outline of the mosque is a gentle dome”. Mehran Gharleghi, the director of Studio Integrate in London, said: “The building has been designed carefully to respect the City theatre and coexist with it. Its height is lower than the City theatre; its platforms dissolve into the surrounding plaza as it gets closer to the City theatre. Its main public platform is also facing the City theatre to allow the visitors to enjoy views towards the theatre.” An alternative design in the traditional mosque typology with towers and large domes would have dominated the City theatre and could jeopardise its existence, he said. Creating novel religious spaces is not an unusual practice in the world of architecture, Gharleghi said, and unusual mosques even exist in Tehran, such as al-Ghadir mosque in Mirdamad Avenue, which won the Agha Khan award for architecture. “Whilst there are examples of humble religious spaces … religious buildings are often created from grand atriums, domes and towers which stand high to dominate the visitors,” Gharleghi said. “These typologies metaphorically refer to the grand nature of God. Breaking this tradition is in contrast with the religious beliefs of many. The geometry of Vali-e-Asr mosque doesn’t follow this logic. It dissolves into its surrounding context. Its ascending planing even suggests that people can climb over it and reach the top. This makes the mosque an accessible and a humble religious space … most important purposes of the mosque which praying and gathering people in a public space have been fulfilled.” Daneshmir and Spiridonoff said: “The Vali-e-Asr mosque doesn’t have a minaret, nor a dome; neither did the first mosque. A mosque is a place for worship, and the Qur’an doesn’t dictate a special structure for it. It’s what it contains that is important.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/oct/23/greedy-bosses-broken-capitalism-who-fix","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-23T10:41:51Z","webTitle":"If greedy bosses have broken capitalism, who will fix it? | Hugh Muir","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/oct/23/greedy-bosses-broken-capitalism-who-fix","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/oct/23/greedy-bosses-broken-capitalism-who-fix","fields":{"headline":"If greedy bosses have broken capitalism, who will fix it?","bodyText":"Thought for the day comes from the book of Luke: “There will be more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents than over 99 righteous ones who do not need to repent.” Might we place in the repenting category the UK boss of bankers Santander, the former chairs of Marks &amp; Spencer and HSBC, and the heads of the Confederation of British Industry, Barclays and Lloyds? All have now, in one way or another, questioned the viability of capitalism as we currently practise it, blaming management greed, tax evasion and other corporate sins. The Financial Times reports today that Shriti Vadera – once Gordon Brown’s eyes and ears at the Treasury, now head of Santander – told a conference that “the underlying promise of western capitalist economies – that a rising tide lifts all boats – has been broken”; a “better model” is needed. Robert Swannell, once of M&amp;S, said capitalism has “lost its way”, with companies and investors preoccupied by short-termism. Carolyn Fairbairn, of the CBI, spoke of capitalism’s wrong turnings. “The financial crash, a fixation on shareholder value at the expense of purpose, and the toxic issues of … payment of tax and executive pay stand in the way of redemption,” she said. These sentiments aren’t new. Reflecting on the financial crash, Brexit and the rise of Donald Trump on the back of America’s left-behinds, many have said much the same. But still it is a moment to hear the stewards of the capitalist system admit that the game, as it has been ruinously played, is up. But don’t be fooled. Don’t assume that – having at last identified for themselves the problem – they can be relied on to fix it. One should not be cynical. They may really want to, motivated by public-spiritedness or a sense of self-preservation. But the currents of capitalism make it virtually impossible for those who practise it to swim against the tide. Capitalism cannot self-regulate. It needs checks and balances. Those with an interest in checking its excesses need the muscle that would allow them to do so. It’s heartening to witness mea culpa. But the only thing that can truly shape a better capitalism is better representation of people in politics and the workplace: a recognition that the private sector isn’t inherently superior, a new mindset that says there are holy grails other than growth to be pursued. And above all, as a counterpoint to the devil-may-care capitalism the titans themselves now worry about, we truly need strong, responsible and confident unions as players again. That balance exists in many countries. Some of them form part of the Europe from which we are now cutting ourselves adrift.

Firstly, never postpone your Sunday long run until after a birthday party: it won’t happen. Secondly, when instead running this long run on a Monday morning, remember to get on the tube going the right way. Thirdly, if you do get the one the wrong way, try to notice before you’ve rattled past five stops. Yup, Monday is going well so far. Is it bedtime yet? So, it was a bit of a hectic weekend, but with rather little actual running for me. On Saturday I took part in the Surrey Masters cross-country championships (don’t click on that link if you prefer your websites to have been designed in the last twenty years, by the way) in Richmond Park. Despite a fairly low turnout from our team, we managed to finish second overall in our age group (‘ancient but not as ancient as some’, as I believe it’s official known) and win silver medals. My lack of enthusiasm for cross country has been noted on this blog before, but at least the Richmond Park course involved very little mud, albeit quite a lot of hill and wind. Sunday’s running was limited to a post-party exhausted trudge, and a Scootathlon (5k jog with my eight year old on her scooter, followed by another 1km with her jogging too). And now I am in need of another weekend to get over that one. So over to you, folks. Do we have any runners who marathoned at Abingdon yesterday? Come and share your medals, tales of triumph and woes as always. Just always remember to get the Victoria line the right way."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"football/2017/oct/10/the-fiver-iceland-world-cup-break-out-thunderclaps-sigur-ros-bjork","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-10T15:47:01Z","webTitle":"The Fiver | Pat-on-the-head patronisation and lazy cultural stereotyping","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/oct/10/the-fiver-iceland-world-cup-break-out-thunderclaps-sigur-ros-bjork","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/oct/10/the-fiver-iceland-world-cup-break-out-thunderclaps-sigur-ros-bjork","fields":{"headline":"Pat-on-the-head patronisation and lazy cultural stereotyping","bodyText":"THE ICEMEN COMETH-AGAIN Break out the thunderclaps, crank up the Sigur Rós and/or Bjork, prepare yourself for the never tiresome challenge of finding new and interesting ways to describe how small the place is, and get ready for that dreamy blend of pat-on-the-head patronisation and lazy cultural stereotyping that may or may not involve Sigur Rós and/or Bjork: Iceland – a country so small that it’s not even the first result on a Google search despite being an actual country – are going to the World Cup!

Happily for those of us who enjoy seeing the egalitarian triumph over the egotistical, this football Valhalla, with its indoor pitch on every corner and Uefa-badged coaches sprouting from every rockface, will be gracing another international tournament following Monday night’s 2-0 win over Kosovo that means they top Group I. Gylfi Sigurdsson (whose first coaches in English football, it’s always worth remembering, tried to turn him into a centre-half because English football) settled nerves with the opener before Johann Berg Gudmundsson made the points safe, sparking scenes of Icelandic joy not witnessed since Gudmundur Benediktsson went viral 15 months ago. Manager Heimur Hallgrimsson was almost lost for words and seemed to fill the awkward silence with one of those “find your adult film star name” formulas in which you list your first pet, a sportsperson who tested positive for cocaine and the full name of your favourite Cardiff City player: “This is really odd, I don’t know what to say,” said Hallgrimsson. “I mean … Pelé, Maradona, Aron Einar Gunnarsson.” So, basically, everyone is delighted, The Fiver (Nibbles Bosnich Kenneth Zohore, since you ask) included.

I was shocked by the fact that she used my case in order to illustrate her dedication to the idea of freedom of speech. In September 2014 – just before my arrest – Ms Bokova received a letter from a number of NGOs regarding the ongoing crackdown on independent media in Azerbaijan. The letter was quite detailed, naming nine journalists and two bloggers held in the prison at that time. Four of them remain in jail. The problem hasn’t stopped and the government continues to shut down media and arrest journalists on false pretences. The NGOs say they have had no response. I am not aware of Ms Bokova ever having spoken about the letter publicly. She certainly didn’t on the occasions when she spoke out to praise our president, Ilham Aliyev. There is certainly nothing about it on Unesco’s website.

After a record 208 days, agreement was struck between four parties on Tuesday to form a centre-right government led by the liberal prime minister, Mark Rutte. The blueprint – agreed by Rutte’s People’s Party for Freedom and Democracy, the Christian Democrats, the centrist and pro-European Union D66 party and the faith-based Christian Union – spells out plans for tax cuts, lessons in national identity and an experiment with state-sanctioned cannabis plantations over the next four years. It also pledges to fight for the Dutch fishing industry in the Brexit negotiations, maintain solidarity with the EU in the talks with the UK, and legislate to allow its citizens living in Britain the chance to have dual citizenship. The document says: “The cabinet will prepare proposals for the modernisation of nationality law. It concerns an extension of the possibility of possession of multiple nationalities for prospective first generation emigrants and immigrants.” Until now, Dutch nationals who take British citizenship to avoid having to leave the UK after Brexit would have been stripped of their Netherlands passports due to limits on dual nationality. Even as late as July, Rutte defended the policy, telling reporters that “countering dual nationality remains one of this cabinet’s policies”, in response to a petition with 22,000 signatures calling for a government rethink. About 100,000 Dutch nationals living in Britain face an uncertain future after March 2019. The UK and EU are yet to reconcile their differences on the citizens’ rights issue. Sophie in ‘t Veld, a Dutch MEP, said her party, the liberal D66, had pushed for the change to help Dutch citizens in the UK. She said: “It is a major step forward, but it doesn’t apply immediately. We will have to legislate. But when we do, people who emigrate will have the right to dual nationality, although their children will have to choose their single nationality at some point.“The document also pledges to maintain EU solidarity in the talks, which may disappoint some in Britain but that is the way it is.” Confirming the forming of the new government, Rutte said on Tuesday that while the Netherlands was thriving, “too many people are not yet feeling it”. He added: “All parties came with some last-minute wishes. But the government pact is now definitely ready.” Among the other pledges in the blueprint was a vow to close the country’s coal-fired power stations by 2030. The plan had been controversial as the plants went online in 2015, but closing them is seen as necessary to meet the state’s obligations under the Paris climate agreement. The prime minister hailed the new agreed agenda, entitled Trust in the Future, as an ambitious and balanced programme. The coalition will have a total of only 76 MPs in the 150-seat lower house of parliament, giving it a one-seat majority."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"science/2017/oct/27/lab-notes-strange-news-from-another-star-as-physics-melts-the-internet","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-27T15:05:45Z","webTitle":"Lab notes: strange news from another star as physics melts the internet","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/oct/27/lab-notes-strange-news-from-another-star-as-physics-melts-the-internet","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2017/oct/27/lab-notes-strange-news-from-another-star-as-physics-melts-the-internet","fields":{"headline":"Lab notes: strange news from another star as physics melts the internet","bodyText":"This week’s biggest stories First up, this just in: astronomers have detected a mysterious space rock hurtling past the sun, and believe it could be the first object that can be traced back to another solar system.

A human skull found in a Suffolk garden has yields new evidence of link between human and animal leprosy – with red squirrel fur traded with Viking Scandinavia thought to be a factor. But that’s as nothing compared to the strange discovery that shrews shrink their skulls and brains to survive winter – and then regrow them in the spring. Ponder that, if you will.

The whole animal is so well preserved it was possible for researchers to get very accurate measurements of the feathers and to calculate the shape of the wings and the likely weight of the animal when alive. These features very strongly constrain how birds fly – the shape of the wing (basically its length vs average width) and weight control how well birds can turn, how quickly they can take off, and if they can exploit winds to soar, or hover and so on. The great differences between the wings of vultures, albatross and wrens or crows underpin the ecology and behaviour of these animals.

Three hours had passed since full-time and the music had never really stopped; now Iceland’s players and staff were dancing on stage with the local rapper Emmsje Gauti and if a football match is exertion enough then this, feeding from the energy of the thousands who had greeted them on Ingolfstorg Square, was an exercise fuelled purely by adrenaline. Sigurdsson paused, puffed out his cheeks slightly and had a word in the ear of his team‑mate and captain, Aron Gunnarsson. Both men glanced at the blue-clad throng in front of them, and back at each other. The grins that spread across their faces rendered further conversation unnecessary. “I thought that, after the Euros, the toughest thing to do would be to restart,” the Iceland manager, Heimir Hallgrimsson, had said back at the Laugardalsvollur stadium, which emptied swiftly after the 2-0 victory against Kosovo in order that the celebrations might continue in Reykjavik city centre. “The first beer the day after a party is not good-tasting; I think tomorrow it won’t taste as good as now.” There will be a few in the Iceland capital who are willing to put that to the test but Hallgrimsson’s metaphor was designed to illustrate the scale of what his team had achieved. It is one thing being the underdog who provides a summer of diversion before normality intervenes; it is quite another raising yourself to do it all again, but Iceland’s World Cup debut will owe everything to unflinching self-belief in their approach and an ability to take strength in the face of change. When Iceland faced down a qualifying group whose obstacles included Croatia, Ukraine and Turkey, the most obvious difference was that the Swedish coach Lars Lagerback – with whom Hallgrimsson had co-managed for three years – was no longer on the scene. “There were many who told me not to take the team after all this success and the huge party in France,” Hallgrimsson said. “There were people close to me who urged me to quit but I had a bullying belief that we could take this further.” Winning Group I outright, after a rapid acceleration in fortune spurred by the 3-0 win in Turkey on Friday, proved him resoundingly correct. Hallgrimsson is a remarkable figure who has compromised on nothing. Two hours before the Kosovo game, an occasion of unsurpassed gravity in Iceland’s sporting history, he could be found half a mile away from Laugardalsvollur in Olver, a sports bar where the more vocal supporters gather on a matchday. “If I see any phones out they’ll be flushed down the toilet,” the MC warned a crowd of several hundred before Hallgrimsson took to the stage. There was no need; the omerta has gone, quite literally, without saying since Hallgrimsson began this tradition and a pin could be heard to drop when, after fiddling with his laptop, he began a 25-minute presentation about the match and Iceland’s approach to it. The contents need go no further; what matters the most is that, in a world that gets ever smaller the more successful you become, Iceland have remained themselves. That had to be the case on what, even in the absence of significant goal threat from Kosovo, developed into a nervy evening. Iceland, who would be guaranteed first place only with a win, do not quite wear the mantle of favourites comfortably yet and laboured in the first half until Sigurdsson’s opening goal. The same was true during the second period before – moments after the crowd had sought to get things going with the now-familiar, yet still spine-tingling, “thunderclap” routine – Sigurdsson superbly set up Johann Berg Gudmundsson for the goal that eliminated any doubts. It is not always about how you make the final step; half an hour later the stadium was bathed in fireworks, team and supporters swaying as one to the impossibly heart-tugging local anthem Eg er kominn heim (I’m back home). Next summer there will be plenty from this country of 334,000 going in the other direction. How Iceland are handled by their opponents in Russia will be a point of considerable interest; surely England and any other more established forces will be averse to making the same mistakes twice. It will no longer be mistakenly perceived indulgent, fanciful or patronising to treat Iceland as equals. “We have earned the right to be there, just like anyone else,” Hallgrimsson said. “We are not only representing Iceland in Russia, we are representing Europe. We’ve beaten big nations to be there so why can’t we achieve something like anyone else? We just have to be there like everyone, and why shouldn’t we have a chance to win?” Hallgrimsson’s work has not gone unnoticed elsewhere and even if you think a bolt-on such as the pre-match address would not be transferable in a higher-profile job, at some stage the offers will come in for a razor-sharp 50-year-old who – although less often these days – is a practising dentist and still lives on the tiny southern island of Heimaey. But why go anywhere else when the ceiling keeps on moving higher? “I have ambition,” he said. “But I’m the coach of Iceland, going to the World Cup finals, and I don’t think there is a better job in football than that.” As Hallgrimsson and his players soaked up that raucous, joyously communal reception, it was impossible to disagree. Reykjavik danced to a night of a thousand melodies and thrilled at the thought that is it unlikely to have been the last time."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"books/2017/oct/12/chris-ware-does-the-world-really-need-another-tome-about-an-artist","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-12T09:44:46Z","webTitle":"Chris Ware: 'Does the world really need another tome about an artist?'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/oct/12/chris-ware-does-the-world-really-need-another-tome-about-an-artist","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2017/oct/12/chris-ware-does-the-world-really-need-another-tome-about-an-artist","fields":{"headline":"Chris Ware: 'Does the world really need another tome about an artist?'","bodyText":"Chris Ware is a novelist’s graphic novelist. Beloved by the likes of Zadie Smith (“There’s no writer alive whose work I love more than Chris Ware’s”), he is compared more often to Joyce than cartoonists before him. His books are Ulyssean in size and complexity, pages filled with tiny, intricate drawings, which is probably how he manages to fit so much of life into them. His latest book is his biggest, in dimensions and concept. Monograph is a solid, 18-inch tall memoir, but also an exploration of a life spent in pursuit of art, and a frank breakdown of the nature and function of comics. “Does the world really need another printed tome about an artist, let alone one about an admittedly marginal and rather questionable graphic novelist/artist/writer who has already littered the recycling centres and used bookstores of his home country with dog-eared examples of his own self-regard?” Ware writes. Yes is the answer, for all the fans he has gathered over a 30-year career, which includes 18 years as a regular at the New Yorker. But Ware isn’t even the most significant presence in his own memoir. Instead, it is his first inspiration, and “the person who made me feel most like myself” – Clara Louise Ware, his grandmother. “The strongest relationships in life create almost a third person: a particular, ineffable sense of something that only exists when two people are around each other … After she died, I suddenly had to learn how to be myself, but on my own,” he says, via email (he dislikes phone interviews). “I think the very best novels and art do the same thing: they make us feel more like ourselves, creating a unique relationship that ceases to exist when one half disappears.” Like him, Clara was a storyteller, one so “unaffected and natural” that when she told him stories about her own life, “she’d make me feel almost as if I was time travelling”, Ware says. “I would really lose all sense of the kitchen table we were sitting at and I’d feel as if I was back in 1920 or 1910, re-experiencing her life right alongside her. It’s taken me years and years to try and get that same sense of concrete reality into my own stuff.” Ware’s “own stuff” may appear intricately plotted, but he says his creative process is essentially just sifting through a mess of plans and ideas, some recorded “while I was driving or brushing my teeth or whatever”. “But once I sit down to draw and am looking at the images as they start to coalesce on the page, all sorts of new ideas start to occur to me,” he says. “And these are almost always much more alive, real and tied unconsciously into whatever the story is actually about than whatever I’ve thought might be interesting, compelling, witty, whatever.” Ware is a passionate partisan of his vocation; he loves Charles Schulz’s Peanuts (“Peanuts’ was the lifelong psychological novel of Charles Schulz, spanning a half century of his and America’s life”) and has worked hard to preserve historical comics by campaigning for reprints of titles such as Krazy Kat and Gasoline Alley (both now back in print because of him). Making comics, he says, gives him “the strange advantage of actually seeing the inside of one’s brain as one works, rather than simply imagining it”. And with all their intricate nooks and crannies, Ware’s books feel like models of his brain. Building Stories, from 2012, came in a box filled with treasures: comic strips, a board-game panel, a ribbon. The dust jacket of his first and most famous book, 2000’s Jimmy Corrigan: The Smartest Kid on Earth, unfolded to become the lead character’s family tree. Monograph comes with perfect, miniature reproductions of various of his unpublished comics, glued into pages. All of Ware’s books, as Maus creator and close friend Art Spiegelman writes in Monograph’s introduction, are “beautiful reliquaries or memory palaces that bring the past back to life”. Memory, both collective and individual, is hugely important to Ware and at times, Monograph feels like a rebuke to how his grandmother lost hers, before she died in 1990. “Witnessing the slow erosion of my grandmother’s memory, and for her to tell me of her dreams bleeding into reality, terrified me, because for her whole life she’d relied on her wits and sharp grasp of the world to get through any situation,” he writes. It is a remarkably personal book, and Ware finds himself torn between the desire to see his thoughts realised in art and a deep need for privacy. At one point, he realises that, having published his sketchbooks, nothing has been left private – so he includes pages from his genuine diary – but reprinted at a tiny, unreadable size (the diary, he says, will see legible print only after he is dead). But there are other personal details: a ramshackle two-storey house that he built for his daughter’s Playmobil figures, presents he made for his wife, and a diorama that he made for his grandmother when, in the throes of her final illness, she confessed to him she’d never had a dolls’ house. Inside the latter – a model of the run-down apartment where Ware worked in the late 1980s – is a birthday card, left unfinished on the drafting table. That too is for Clara, to go with the gift it is built into. Monograph is not Ware’s only life-spanning work: his long-awaited graphic novel Rusty Brown is a sprawling, deeply felt story of a nerdy kid growing up in Nebraska, the place of Ware’s own childhood. After being serialised in tantalising fits and starts, the first part will finally be published in 2018, after 17 years of work – and it is still not finished. “Hopefully, working on a visual novel that will take much of my time on Earth to complete is maybe an interesting idea, leaving behind a strange, comprehensive and slightly unquantifiable work,” Ware says. His only promise? “At least it will be strange.” Monograph is published by Rizzoli, priced £45. It is available from the Guardian Bookshop for £38.25, including free UK p&amp;p."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/oct/14/good-riddance-to-bad-blood-how-i-learned-to-love-my-chaotic-family","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-14T05:30:00Z","webTitle":"Good riddance to bad blood: how I learned to love my chaotic family","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/oct/14/good-riddance-to-bad-blood-how-i-learned-to-love-my-chaotic-family","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/oct/14/good-riddance-to-bad-blood-how-i-learned-to-love-my-chaotic-family","fields":{"headline":"Good riddance to bad blood: how I learned to love my chaotic family","bodyText":"Great-grandpa Neves – no one can remember his first name – is directing traffic on the Golden Gate Bridge, naked. By 1930, he has been in California, from his native Portugal, long enough – more than 15 years – to perform the hand signals on instinct: palm out front for “stop”; a backward wave for “move along”. To his schizophrenic eyes, the cars are an eyesore: they make the magnificent bridge look as if it crawling with ants. He has come to get them off. This story is the centrepiece of Jason Tougaw’s chaotic, colourful family lore. Neves is the first of many complex characters that populate his family tree, and his saga on the bridge is the first of many dramatic tales. “Bad blood”, so it goes, flows through the family’s veins: it has made and squandered fortunes, led to drugs, alcoholism, fallen celebrity, mental illnesses, depression, abuse, prison sentences, divorces, and near‑fatal accidents. “My family feels comfortable living on the edge,” says Tougaw. “If things run too smoothly, they tend to sabotage them.” It would make for a fascinating episode of Who Do You Think You Are?, but what if your life doesn’t resemble that of your family? What if you don’t identify with the folklore? And how, in this case, do you escape it? A professor of literature at City University of New York, the author of two non-fiction books, in a loving, long-term relationship and with no police record, Tougaw might appear to have dodged his family’s recklessness. “When I was a kid, I thought I was from a different gene pool – the straight one among their chaos; I rebelled against everything my family embraced,” he says. When he moved to New York in 1993, he found himself telling people about his hippie childhood in California. “Distance loosened my lips,” he says. “I talked about my mother’s near abortion with me in Mexico, living on a converted school bus, growing up poor in the shadow of luxury. People kept asking: ‘Why aren’t you more fucked up? Why are you so different from the people who raised you?’ So, I wanted to get to the bottom of it, work out how I avoided the worst of their fates and crack our family history open. And, at the same time, try to answer the deeper, more universal question – how did I become me?” Neves may have been the start of the family’s folklore, but it was Ralph who took it and ran. Ralph was his son, Tougaw’s grandfather, a charismatic, foul-mouthed jockey who found fame and fortune then squandered it. The press labelled him the Portuguese Pepperpot. His glamorous wife, Midge – Tougaw’s grandmother – was best friends with Betty Grable. She drove a pink T-Bird, a new one every year during the 50s and early 60s. In photographs, they are impossibly glamorous: boarding jets, posing at the races, her swathed in furs and pearls, him dapper in his racing silks, their three polished children in suits, ties and pretty dresses. In 1936, during a race, Ralph was thrown from his horse and trampled. He was taken to hospital, declared dead and his body wheeled to the morgue. A friend, a doctor on duty that day, paid his private respects and, for reasons known only to him, administered a shot of adrenaline into Ralph’s heart. Ralph jumped up, delirious with shock, raced from the hospital and hailed a taxi to the racecourse. This was the first of many narrow scrapes. “What’s my names spelled backward?” he would later say to his grandchildren. “Seven. Lucky Seven.” He lived his life at full speed. He had six wives; Midge was the second. “His recklessness wouldn’t have been half so alluring without his talent,” says Tougaw. By the time Ralph and Midge’s children, Gary, Craig and Cathy – Tougaw’s mother – were in their late teens, they had rebelled against their formal, middle-American upbringing and embraced 60s California counter-culture with gusto – LSD, surfing and the rejection of wealth. Cathy got pregnant in 1968, aged 18, with her teenage boyfriend, the first of many abusive men who would enter and exit her and Tougaw’s life. Charlie, his father, was a junkie, and gone, by the time Tougaw could crawl. Growing up, Tougaw wanted stability – and nothing to do with his heroin-addicted father, by now in prison. The very idea of Charlie terrified him. He begged his mother to send him to school. He dreamed of a “normal” life. He and his mother moved around southern California as homes, boyfriends and husbands – one of whom abused Tougaw – came and went. As a teenager, he witnessed his mother and her friends weighing out bags of cocaine on the dining table and was sworn to secrecy. But his grandmother, Midge (by now divorced from Ralph), was his rock. “Nanny was steadier and more stable than my mother,” says Tougaw. “I would look at her and think: ‘I want to be like that.’” As a way of coping, he retreated into his mind. He suffered from panic attacks, nightmares, bed-wetting and hypochondria. He was bullied at school. He navigated his childhood with the help of friends, cousins, adolescent sexual experiments and the New Romantic scene he adored. But he was angry. “I spent 10 years, from childhood into early adulthood, unable to speak the words ‘mom’ or ‘love’,” says Tougaw. At family get-togethers, accidents, bad luck, ill health and unfortunate choices in partners were all explained away: “It’s our Port-a-ghee blood,” they would say, referring to the colloquial immigrant word for Portuguese. The schizophrenia of his great-grandfather and his cousin Bryan was part of, but not all, the story. “We’ve constructed a robust, sensational family mythology – it excuses failings, even encourages bad behaviour,” says Tougaw. Why was Tougaw one of the more fortunate ones? How did he rise above the pernicious family lore? Did he get lucky, genetically, by dodging the illness that plagued his great-grandfather and his cousin or is there another reason? “A few years ago, I read about psychological studies of resilience,” he says. “They focused on how a minority of maltreated children exceed expectations. They identified a variation in a gene, 5-HTT. I became convinced I possessed it. As a kid, I had a tendency to bob and float, dodging the worst predators.” For the rest of his family, he says, “our collective memory tells a story of resilience barely achieved. Great-grandpa Neves didn’t make it, but Ralph did. So did his children. We find ourselves in deep shit and we dig our way out. That’s the spine of our story.” Today, Tougaw has a good relationship with his mother. “She keeps saying my memoir is ‘going to land her in the big house’ – an outdated term for prison.” His father died in 2011. Writing his family’s story, says Tougaw, has had unexpected consequences. “I’m more reconciled with our differences. I’d even go so far as to say I am grateful for my genes. I’ve discovered our reckless strain in me more than I realised: we have a certain daring about us, a desire to be different, a creativity and an inherent distrust of rules and formal behaviour.” Coming out as gay, as Tougaw did in the 80s, would have been a lot harder in a family more wedded to conventional behaviour. “It was no big deal,” he says. Were there any huge revelations? “I realised that your family history is part of you and you have to accept, rather than fight, that,” he says. “I thought I would suddenly figure everything out, but I didn’t. In fact, that’s the point: I’ve realised that you have to live with what you can’t figure out. I also realised I’m proud of our family lore – and I think I have been all along.” • The One You Get by Jason Tougaw is published by Dzanc Books"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"uk-news/2017/oct/10/foreign-office-did-not-help-us-says-father-of-man-murdered-in-berlin","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-10T15:48:20Z","webTitle":"Foreign Office did not help us, says father of man murdered in Berlin","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/oct/10/foreign-office-did-not-help-us-says-father-of-man-murdered-in-berlin","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2017/oct/10/foreign-office-did-not-help-us-says-father-of-man-murdered-in-berlin","fields":{"headline":"Foreign Office did not help us, says father of man murdered in Berlin","bodyText":"The father of a tech entrepreneur who was murdered by a neo-Nazi in Berlin has criticised the Foreign Office for failing to support him and his wife after the death of their son. Luke Holland, 31, from Stockport, Greater Manchester, was shot in the chest and abdomen with a sawn-off shotgun outside a bar in the German capital in September 2015. In July 2016, Rolf Zielezinski, 63, an unemployed construction worker, was sentenced to 11 years and seven months in jail for the murder. Holland’s parents argue that their son was killed because he was a foreigner. During Zielezinski’s trial, Holland’s mother, Rita, confronted him with a photo of her son. He shrugged at her, smiled, and said: “English”. However, the murder was not treated as a hate crime by German authorities, despite the fact that Zielezinski’s flat was found to contain Nazi memorabilia, including a bust of Hitler. “On the night the police came around to tell us that our son was dead, we were given a number to call the Foreign Office,” Philip Holland told the Guardian. “So we called that number and they said they didn’t know anything about [the murder] and that they would call us back. “They didn’t call us back the next day, so we called them and they said they’d get someone to call us back. So it was two days before they called us back.” The Hollands, both 63, were told they could not see their son’s body until they had arranged for a funeral director to transport it back to the UK. They were provided with links to web pages with lists of funeral directors who would only transport bodies to London, so they were forced to do their own research to find a firm that would repatriate to Manchester. “They just sent us reams of web pages to read through – which were totally irrelevant and about what the Foreign Office does when people lose their passports and that sort of thing. At that moment in time we weren’t in the frame of mind to read through pages and pages to find out what the Foreign Office does.” He added: “Then you’ve got the trauma of transferring money over to Germany before anything can be done about repatriating the body … It’s just a nightmare.” Zielezinski was initially going to be charged with manslaughter, on the grounds that he may have been drunk when he killed Holland. The couple, however, found their own lawyer and mounted a campaign to raise the charge to murder. During the four-month trial, the couple flew to Berlin on Mondays and returned on Thursdays, staying in hotels. They reported being harassed by neo-Nazi protesters on their way in and out of the courthouse. A Foreign Office official was present for two days of the court case. “Every time we see these news stories and it says ‘the Foreign Office are helping the family’, we just laugh,” said Philip Holland. “It’s not as if they’re overburdened with British people getting murdered in Berlin.” The case of Holland’s murder attracted significant media attention in Germany once it was found that Zielezinski had been linked to the murder of 22-year-old Burak Bektaş, a German of Turkish descent. The Hollands have previously said that, had German police investigated Bektaş’s death properly, their son might still be alive. Luke Holland, a trained lawyer, held an MBA from Oxford University and spoke fluent Japanese. He had moved to Berlin to help set up a business that was developing a vibrating music bracelet. Recording a verdict of unlawful killing at an inquest into Holland’s death on Monday, the coroner, Alison Mutch, talked of his “drive and enthusiasm for learning”. “I am sorry that I never got to meet him,” she said. “He sounded like a very special young man. He will leave a huge gap in your lives and many other people’s lives.” She paid tribute to his parents, who she said had shown “dogged determination in ensuring that justice was served in the sentencing of the attacker”. Speaking to journalists after the inquest, Philip Holland said his son had been brought up to believe “that with happiness, kindness and endeavour, a happy and fruitful life could be achieved”. “Luke not only believed this, he lived his life to the full like this,” he said. “Luke was my favourite person, not only my son. It is so hard to understand why. An accident, yes, an illness, yes, but a senseless murder, no.” A spokesperson for the Foreign Office said: “Embassy staff have been in touch with Luke Holland’s family to provide support since his tragic death in 2015. We will continue to assist in any way we can.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/live/2017/oct/10/ecuador-v-argentina-world-cup-2018-qualifier-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-11T01:29:22Z","webTitle":"Ecuador 1-3 Argentina: World Cup 2018 qualifier – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2017/oct/10/ecuador-v-argentina-world-cup-2018-qualifier-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/live/2017/oct/10/ecuador-v-argentina-world-cup-2018-qualifier-live","fields":{"headline":"Ecuador 1-3 Argentina: World Cup 2018 qualifier – as it happened","bodyText":"That was quite a night of hot Conmebol action. Brazil, Uruguay, Argentina and Colombia have qualified for the World Cup, while Peru will meet New Zealand in a two-legged play-off. If they win they will reach the World Cup for the first time since 1982. Oh, and Lionel Messi is a genius, but you knew that already. Thanks for your company, night. The final scores Brazil 3-0 Chile Ecuador 1-3 Argentina Paraguay 0-1 Venezuela Peru 1-1 Colombia Uruguay 4-2 Bolivia It’s all over in Quito. Lionel Messi scored a superb hat-trick to ensure he will get one last crack at winning the World Cup next summer. There isn’t much scope for late drama now. Peru are going into a play-off against New Zealand, and Argentina and Colombia will qualify automatically. Paraguay must be desperately disappointed - a win at home to Venezuela would have put them into the play-off. Brazil 3-0 Chile Gabriel Jesus gets his second, with Claudio Bravo out of his goal after going up for a corner, and Chile’s last hope has gone. There are two minutes of normal time remaining in Sao Paulo, and Chile are on the brink of elimination. Roberto Firmino should have finished them off just then, but his shot was superbly saved by Claudio Bravo. The latest scores Brazil 2-0 Chile Ecuador 1-3 Argentina Paraguay 0-1 Venezuela Peru 1-1 Colombia Uruguay 4-2 Bolivia Venezuela have taken a surprise lead in Paraguay, which surely ends Paraguay’s chances of qualifying. So now it’s between Peru and Chile for the play-off place. Chile need one goal, for them or Colombia. 81 min Argentina are cruising now. Bolivia have pulled one back in Bolivia. Chile are 2-0 down in Brazil but I think - I think, I haven’t a clue - a 2-1 defeat would put them into the play-offs as things stand. Peru have scored! It’s Peru 1-1 Colombia. That means Chile will miss out if it stays like this. 79 min The substitute Estrada misses a decent chance for Ecuador, heading Ramirez’s cross over the bar. 78 min A goal for either Paraguay or Peru would lift them above Chile into the play-off place. Like the very best spandex, it’s exquisitely tight. Make that Uruguay 4-1 Bolivia. The latest scores Brazil 2-0 Chile Ecuador 1-3 Argentina Paraguay 0-0 Venezuela Peru 0-1 Colombia Uruguay 3-1 Bolivia 76 min Mauro Icardi comes to replace Benedetto. 74 min The tireless left-back Ramirez wins a corner for Ecuador and decides to take it himself. It’s headed away at the near post and Di Maria, who has been outstanding, leads another Argentina break. 73 min Ecuador’s race is run. They know it, and Argentina know it. 71 min Paraguay are still drawing 0-0 at home to Venezuela. If they win that game they will almost certainly leapfrog Peru and Chile into fifth place. 68 min That third Messi goal was entirely ridiculous. He was on the edge of area, off balance because a defender was trying to sit on him, and he still managed to chip a keeper who was only a few yards off his line. It was genius. 66 min It looks like Argentina will qualify automatically, unless Ecuador score twice or Chile score thrice in Brazil. The latest scores Brazil 2-0 Chile Ecuador 1-3 Argentina Paraguay 0-0 Venezuela Peru 0-1 Colombia Uruguay 3-1 Bolivia There goes the fear, let it go. Argentina are going to the World Cup thanks to Lionel Messi, who has completed a famous hat-trick with a glorious chip! A loose ball came to him 35 yards out and he made straight for goal. Benedetto made a fine off-the-ball run, and Messi used him by not using him before darting to the left and flipping the ball majestically over Banguera. Uruguay lead Bolivia 3-1. They are going to finish second in the group. 61 min Biglia is booked for a cynical foul on the marauding Renato Ibarra. 60 min Ecuador have done most of the attacking in this half. Argentina are playing a dangerous game, though at the moment they have a bit of breathing space because of the other scores. The latest scores Brazil 2-0 Chile Ecuador 1-2 Argentina Paraguay 0-0 Venezuela Peru 0-1 Colombia Uruguay 2-1 Bolivia Colombia have taken the lead in Peru, which pushes Chile back up to fifth, Colombia to third and Argentina to fourth. I think. 58 min Since you asked nicely, Paulinho and Gabriel Jesus scored for Brazil. Brazil now lead 2-0, which pushes Chile down to sixth place. My head hurts and there’s still half an hour to go. The upshot is that, at the moment, a draw is enough for Argentina to stay alive. As things stand Peru and Chile are level on points, goal difference and goals scored. But Chile have the better head-to-head record so they would, I think, take fifth place. Brazil have taken the lead against Chile, which means... I’ll let you know what that means. 53 min Ecuador are putting Argentina under a lot of pressure at the moment. It does feel like Argentina need a third goal if they are to win this game, maybe even a fourth. 51 min At the moment Argentina are third in the group, but an Ecuador equaliser would push them down to sixth. Acuna is booked for a foul on Intriago. 50 min Mercado is lucky not to be booked for flattening Romario Ibarra. 48 min The excellent Di Maria wins an early corner for Argentina. It comes to nothing. 46 min Peep peep! After taking an age to emerge from the dressing-room, Argentina begin the second half. The half-time scores Brazil 0-0 Chile Ecuador 1-2 Argentina Paraguay 0-0 Venezuela Peru 0-0 Colombia Uruguay 2-1 Bolivia As it stands, Brazil, Uruguay, Argentina and Chile will qualify, with Colombia going into a play-off against New Zealand. Martin Caceres and Edinson Cavani have scored to put Uruguay 2-1 up at home to Bolivia. They will be going to Russia next year. That was pretty lively. Romario Ibarra gave Ecuador the lead after 40 seconds; then Lionel Messi gave Argentina the lead with two fine goals. See you in 10 minutes for the second half. 43 min I know it’s human nature to ease off when you take the lead, but Argentina were rampant when Messi put them 2-1 up. It could be 4-1 by now. Instead they sat back and that has allowed Ecuador back into the match. At the moment they look likelier to score the next goal. 41 min An early substitution for Ecuador: Enner Valencia replaces Cevallos, which suggests a switch to dear old 4-4-2. 39 min This game has been on the manic side of frenetic. Ecuador’s intent has been admirable given they have nothing to play for, even if some of their play has been a little rough around the edges. 38 min “Could Ronaldo score two goals, right on cue, for Argentina?” asks Gary Naylor. “Of course he couldn’t. He’s Portuguese.” HONK! 36 min As things stand, Brazil, Uruguay, Argentina and Chile will qualify automatically, with Colombia going into a play-off against New Zealand. 35 min Romario Ibarra wins another corner for Ecuador in this crazily open game. Romero ends up palming the ball behind for another corner, which is eventually cleared. Both sides are fifty shades of shambles in defence. 32 min Messi plays a delicious return pass through to Di Maria, whose close-range shot is excellently blocked by Banguera. Messi and Di Maria have been almost telepathic tonight. 30 min Argentina have been far too defensive since going ahead, which has allowed Ecuador back into the match. If they concentrate on attacking they could have the game wrapped up by half-time. 29 min This match is getting very niggly. Enzo Perez seems to over the ball on Intriago, though the referee gives just a free-kick. Bolivia have taken the lead in Uruguay. That’s unlikely to have any impact on the group, however, as Uruguay already have nine toes in Russia. 27 min Cevallos’s free-kick is headed behind for an Ecuador corner. Nothing comes of it, except a blast of heat towards the referee from Aimar when he is penalised for a challenge on Benedetto. The latest scores · Brazil 0-0 Chile · Ecuador 1-2 Argentina · Paraguay 0-0 Venezuela · Peru 0-0 Colombia · Uruguay 0-0 Bolivia 23 min Messi and Di Maria have been so good in the first quarter of the match. In a way it highlights the absurdity of Argentina being in such a precarious position, but they won’t care about that so long as they get through. At the moment that looks likely as they are in complete control. Lionel Messi gets his second! He slithered through a woolly challenge just outside the area and then, as defenders converged, smashed a rising drive past Banguera at the near post. 19 min Argentina’s greater class - and greater need - are starting to tell. 17 min As things stand Argentina are out, but I suspect things won’t be standing like this for long. 16 min Messi is crackling with menace every time he gets the ball. He moves away from a couple of defenders on the left of the box before hitting a fierce shot that is beaten away by Banguera. 14 min Cevallos is booked for a late tackle on Enzo Perez. That’s a fine equaliser from Argentina. Messi played the ball out to Di Maria on the left and hared towards the area. Di Maria eased a superb return pass into his path and Messi stabbed the ball past the outrushing Banguera. 11 min This is a very open game. Ramirez leathers one from 35 yards and Romero holds on at the near post. 10 min Di Maria flashes another superb cross into the six-yard area that beats everyone and drifts past the far post. He and Messi look sharp. 9 min Argentina are a mess at the back. Ramirez beats his man far too easily down the left before his cross is headed away. At the other end, Di Maria’s long-range shot deflects onto the roof of the net. Banguera didn’t seem particularly perturbed. The latest scores · Brazil 0-0 Chile · Ecuador 1-0 Argentina · Paraguay 0-0 Venezuela · Peru 0-0 Colombia · Uruguay 0-0 Bolivia 7 min That was better from Argentina. Messi played a pass wide to Di Maria, who sidefooted a superb first-time ball that flashed across the face of goal and wide. 5 min As it stands, Argentina are in the malodorous stuff. They need to score at least one and probably two if they are to avoid humiliation. Ecuador are looking dangerous on the break, with Renato Ibarra’s cross almost falling for Ordonez at the far post. 3 min “Riquelme and Veron on the bench?” asks Jamie O’Sullivan. “It seems to have gone under the radar that Argentina will be able to call upon not one but two midfield maestros from yesteryear tonight, and therefore stands to reason that this should be an easy win for the Albiceleste.” Seba has unfinished business at the World Cup. You know it and I know it. Oh my giddy God. Ecuador took the lead almost straight from the kick-off. Romario Ibarra played a neat headed one-two with Ordonez on the edge of the box before thumping the ball past Romero with his left foot. Ecuador have scored after 40 seconds! 1 min Peep peep! he game is under way. Ecuador are in yellow, Argentina are in blue and white. The feed’s working! It’s really small! Five minutes to kick-off and my (legal) feed of the game isn’t working. This could be a triumph. I’d like to apologise in advance for tonight’s coverage. Specifically: all of it I probably won’t have chance to check my emails that often, as I’m too old for this multi-game/permutations lark. It’s not you, it’s bloody well me! “The Universal is a great song,” says Simon McMahon. “Although when it comes to Scotland, it really really really couldn’t happen.” “Howdy from Austin, Texas,” says Michael Sciortino. “Think all these permutations are getting sports statisticians a little hot and bothered? They must love this.” This? This is a tingle compared to the life-changing orgasm that was the last day of the 1983-84 season in Romania’s Divizia C, Seria VIII. The magic of the World Cup, with Matt Dony “After Wales reverted to type and tamely threw away a play-off place to Ireland/Wimbledon c1988, I’ve lost investment in the World Cup. It’s hilarious that the Netherlands have blown it yet again, I kind of hope Argentina fail in some amusing way (a red card for Messi would be magnificent), and I hope some stodgy, boring team Greece their way to the trophy, boring hundreds of millions of people around the world. Bah, humbug.” You want Ireland to win the World Cup? You’ve changed your tune since the start of that email. “Hey Rob, I live in Ecuador and follow the selección closely,” says Matthew Carpenter-Arevalo. “My take on this game: the Ecuador team is broken after not qualifying. The dressing room disintegrated and a number of key players either quit or were told not to come back. The team you’ll see tonight is full of young people getting their international debut. A lot of fans are staying away from the stadium, even though Messi himself is a huge draw and the game still means something for Argentina. Lastly, the altitude hasn’t been much of a benefit for Ecuador: they lost to both Peru and Paraguay at home. A motivated Argentina have a decent chance.” “I’d avoid calling Messi the world’s second best player,” says George Ritchie. “You might alienate core parts of your audience tonight.” I was just going on last year’s Ballon d’Or. I should have learned my lesson in 1990, when I was widely ridiculed at school for regularly describing Robby Langers as the joint 26th best player in Europe. “Hey Rob,” says Paul Cockburn. “This last round of games in S America has garnered a fair bit of interest in NZ, especially here in Wellington where the first leg will he held. Opinion is mixed. Last time we had one of these play-offs, we got spanked by Mexico. It’s hard to see any of the S American teams being too scared of the All Whites, but, hey, against Paraguay, maybe…? Realistically, then, what we want is for Argentina to finish fifth, so Messi can come to Aotearoa and sign for Wellington Phoenix while he’s here…” I can’t see them beating a South American team over two legs but stranger things have happened – see 2010 World Cup, only unbeaten team. An email! “Hi Rob,” says Simon Frank. “Greetings from the very much at sea level Bahamas. A propos of not very much, I spent six months in Quito back in 1993 where I took in a load of Nacional games at the Estadio Atahualpa. Great stadium. They used to have an enormous bottle of Guitig (local mineral water) at the entrance. Is it still there?” While I find your faith in the Guardian budget quite touching, I’m not actually in Quito. But we do have a watercooler in the MBM dungeon, if that helps? A number of scripts have been written for this game, and the most obvious involves Lionel Messi taking Argentina to the World Cup single-footedly. It’s hard to imagine a World Cup without the world’s second-best player, especially as it would almost certainly be his last chance to emulate Diego Maradona and win the thing. Ecuador (4-5-1): Banguera; Velasco, Aimar, Arboleda, Ramirez; Intriago, Orejuela, Romario Ibarra, Cevallos, Renato Ibarra; Ordonez. Substitutes: Ortiz, Piedra, Johnson, Israel Murillo, Plata, Uchuari, E Valencia, Garces, Lopez, Arreaga. Argentina (3-4-2-1) Romero; Mercado, Mascherano, Otamendi; Salvio, Enzo Perez, Biglia, Acuna; Messi, Di Maria; Benedetto. Substitutes: Guzman, Marchesin, Fazio, Pezzella, P Perez, Icardi, Casco, Rigoni, Riquelme, Veron, Banega, Paredes, Dybala, Gomez. A World Cup without Argentina? Yes it really, really, really could happen. If they fail to win in Ecuador tonight, they may well miss out for the first time since 1970. This is the table going into the last round of fixtures. It’s all desperately complicated, with something riding on all of these games: Brazil v Chile Ecuador v Argentina Paraguay v Venezuela Peru v Colombia Uruguay v Bolivia Brazil have qualified, and only the mathematicians think Uruguay might not go to Russia next summer. Four teams qualify automatically, while the fifth-placed side will fancy their chances in a play-off against New Zealand. Those two/three remaining places are between Chile, Colombia, Peru, Argentina and Paraguay. The permutations are infinite, but Argentina know that if they win they will not finish lower than fifth. If they draw, they are at the mercy of results elsewhere and might even need a favour from Brazil. The match will be played in Quito, where Argentina haven’t won since 2001. It’s almost 10,000 feet above sea level, and apparently the pitch is flooded. Godspeed, lads. The action starts at 00.30 GMT. We’ll be focussing on Argentina but will keep you updated on the other games, at least until 1.47am, when following five matches becomes too much, and I start weeping gently."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"film/2017/oct/14/tom-hanks-movies-didnt-make-sense-or-money-interview-short-stories","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-14T09:00:03Z","webTitle":"Tom Hanks: ‘I’ve made a lot of movies that didn’t make sense – or money’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/oct/14/tom-hanks-movies-didnt-make-sense-or-money-interview-short-stories","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2017/oct/14/tom-hanks-movies-didnt-make-sense-or-money-interview-short-stories","fields":{"headline":"Tom Hanks: ‘I’ve made a lot of movies that didn’t make sense – or money’","bodyText":"“This is odd,” Tom Hanks says with a shake of his shoulders, the international sign of limbering up. We are in a photographer’s studio in LA, a setting that is as familiar to Hanks as the reason for our meeting is strange. He has written a collection of short stories called Uncommon Type and, balanced on the edge of the sofa, is exploring the novelty of giving an interview without “talking points from the studio”. Hanks-the-actor is cushioned; Hanks-the-author is not, and after humbly asking what other writers I’ve interviewed recently (Salman Rushdie, Martin Amis) barks with incredulous laughter. “Oh, shit,” he says. For those of us who came of age in the late 1980s, Hanks has been around as long as we’ve been going to movies, and at 61 he is bizarrely unchanged: hair marginally greyer, face slightly fuller, but otherwise still Hanks, the boyish energy and cheerful cadences recognisable from three decades on screen. He often starts sentences with “Look, I get it”, or rather, “I-I-I get it”, the mild stutter synonymous with his brand of almost cartoonish affability. “Look, I get it,” he says, pushing his black spectacles up the bridge of his nose, hippy beads slack at his wrist. “I’m a famous guy and I wrote a book and all that, but the reality is, how much does a collection of short stories really warrant attention?” This is classic Hanks, appearing to break the fourth wall of his celebrity to let us all in; and if he has survived these years in the spotlight relatively intact, it is through a combination of good luck and this kind of strategy. Hanks gives every impression of being sincere, but I get the feeling he is also rather wily about his famous good humour. As he must know by now, it can make it hard to see anything else. All of which makes Uncommon Type, a set of 17 stories written over many years in the downtime between movies, a more interesting production than it might otherwise have been. There are some good lines and some ambitious themes, but it is mainly of interest as an extension of Hanks the actor; a way of decoding the appeal that has made him worth an estimated $350m. His success as an actor relies less on any of the showier A-list attributes than on what one thinks of as a peculiarly American decency: the urbanity of his Walt Disney in Saving Mr Banks, the quiet heroism of Captain Phillips, the integrity of all those romantic leads – most notably as Sam, the widower in Sleepless In Seattle – in the 1990s, in which he appeared not only as the good guy, but as the good guy with solid self-awareness. He might exude large measures of “aw, shucks” bashfulness, but Hanks has just the right amount of ironic reserve – the suggestion of some darker humour in check – to make the shine on his performance that much brighter. And, of course, the warmth. On the page, as on screen, Hanks is, simply, a lovely person to be around. His characters in Uncommon Type are families disintegrating or coming together, mismatched couples, immigrants looking for a first foothold in New York, people at the point of crisis who tack more towards humour than gloom. In the story Go See Costas, which he based on the real-life tale of his father-in-law Al Wilson’s arrival in the US from Greece, a penniless immigrant tries to score work at a diner. In the opening story, Three Exhausting Weeks, a dating couple size each other up via a lot of perky dialogue. In Who’s Who, an aspiring actor who once gazed dumbfounded at the crowds in New York and asked herself “Where is everyone going?” comes to the realisation that “Everyone was going everywhere”, one of the best open-ended lines of the book. “I just kept asking questions,” Hanks says. “Like, ‘Well, how long should they be?’ My editor would say, ‘Well, however long they are.’ ‘OK, how many do you want?’ ‘Well, you know, 15 would be good.’” It turns out Hanks has almost no vanity as a writer. “Look,” he says, “in my day job I provide the raw material and someone else makes all the decisions; the order, the editing, the lighting. So I don’t have any problems with someone coming in saying, ‘I think it should be like this.’ About six stories in, my editor said, ‘You’re always writing about people who are stumbling upon somebody, that becomes part of their world.’ I thought, I guess I am. Son of a gun.” The best story by a mile is A Special Weekend, which chronicles 48 hours in the life of a boy called Kenny, shuttling between divorced parents. Hanks’ own parents split up when he was very young and he was raised mainly by his father, a jobbing cook, and a series of stepmothers. In the story, Hanks captures the child’s-eye view of the world with pitch-perfect accuracy, integrating the slow external movement of time with the vast internal journeys children make at that age, and as a writing project it nails perhaps the hardest thing of all: a story in which nothing and everything happens. “I think it ends up being the need for connectedness,” he says of his thematic interests. “Not just humankind, but also the human condition. Again and again, we’re searching for that person who’s a magic key for us, makes us feel connected, secure, part of something bigger than ourselves. Without it, the world ain’t any fun.” For Hanks, that person has, for the past 30 years, been the actor Rita Wilson, his wife and the mother of his two youngest children, Chet and Truman, now in their 20s. (Colin and Elizabeth, Hanks’ children by his first wife, Samantha Lewes, are in their 30s.) Hanks is famously uxorious, and his reliability as an actor is something that, from his first marriage at the age of 21, he has pegged to the stability of his home life. He likes to be regular in his habits, moderate in his passions and, it turns out, modest in his assessment of what it is he does. “As an actor, I think your job is to show up on time. Crazy important to show up on time.” That’s really right up there? “Huge. It’s the first lesson I learned as a professional actor. You must. Show up. On time.” He beats his hand in time on the sofa. (In fact, today Hanks startled everyone by arriving at the studio 30 minutes early. “A fluke of traffic,” he says, but it’s an indication, perhaps, of a certain uptight underlay to the “hey, man” buoyancy of his style.) “Because, if you don’t, you don’t have the time. It’s as simple as that. Before the sun goes down, or just to get it right; to get everybody on the same page, momentum-wise. If you’re late, momentum can be lost.” He can’t bear to look back on his work. I mention that Saving Private Ryan, the 1998 movie directed by Steven Spielberg in which Hanks plays a noble squad leader on a mission to save a mother’s last surviving son, was on TV the night before. “OK, well, I can walk you through that [scene by scene]: horrible, terrible, should’ve done something else. That worked out. I don’t even remember doing that, so that’s a good sign. But they [his films] all end up just being these lingering examples of individual failures, somehow. Here’s what I’ve learned: the only thing you can do is to make it different. OK, you’re going to shoot something and it’s going to take 47 takes? In the course of those 47 takes, you’ll be able to do it different, and somewhere in the course of those 47 takes is the way it needs to be.” *** Goofballs don’t age the way other leading men do. Bruce Willis looks craggy and ancient these days. John Travolta is stretched tight as a drum. Hanks, on the other hand, an actor for whom funny was always more important than buff, is still recognisable as the guy we love – although, of course, ageing is less of an issue for all of these men than it is for their female counterparts. What’s the male equivalent of the Hollywood actress considered too old for a lead? “Unfairly, I don’t think there is one.” You don’t age out of some genres? “No. But here’s what you can do: you can fat yourself out. If you’re fat, you can’t play an astronaut. Take a look at the guys who are still working; they’re in really good shape. Otherwise, they become character guys. So that’s possible. But it’s not the same as with women. With women, the biggest problem is that there’s usually a fraction of women in a movie compared with the number of men. There’s only ever one girl in an action movie, and it’s like, ‘Hi, I’m mysterious, but hot.’ That is literally the template for an awful lot of women in film. Television is not the same – it’s quite diverse – but in the commerce of motion pictures, it’s just not fair.” We are speaking a few weeks before the Harvey Weinstein allegations emerge. Hanks has never worked with Weinstein, but this week told the New York Times: “It all just sort of fits, doesn’t it?... You can’t buy, ‘Oh, well, I grew up in the 60s and 70s and so therefore...’ I did, too.” Hanks cites Nora Ephron as an exception in the film business: “She refused to buy into that shit.” The late writer and director worked with Hanks on Sleepless In Seattle and You’ve Got Mail, and was rehearsing her Broadway play Lucky Guy when she died in 2012. They were great pals, and Hanks dedicates Uncommon Type to her. “Nora was not a soft woman,” he says, smiling. “You did not want to cross her. Nora said, ‘Never turn down a front row seat for human folly.’ And I have turned down a lot of those front row seats, but human behaviour is constantly entertaining. Watching humans behave in one way results in a comedy, and in another way a tragedy, but it ends up being a constant fascination. Why in the world do we do what we do, and how does someone get to that place where they think that’s important? The people that are dicks in showbiz, I always say to them: ‘Why are you in this?’ I’m in it because there’s nothing more fun than doing this. This is like going to high school and finding out you can take a drama class instead of calculus. Sign me up!” Well, they’re in it for the money, no? “The money can be good. But after that, man, you just want more money. There’s always another level of mammon that you require in order to keep yourself happy. Are you in it for power? To do what? To have a parking place right next to your trailer? If those are the talismans, after a while none of it’s going to be enough.” The business of handling obnoxious people on set is one about which, along with everything else, Hanks appears to be sanguine. “I learned a long time ago that you don’t have to like the people you work with,” he says. “But you have to respect their process. If someone wants to be a dick, it’s OK. Unless that dickishness is power play, because it’s fun to beat up on underlings. Then you got to take them off to the side and have a conversation.” The idea of being set straight by Hanks is vaguely terrifying, like being told off by a judge. “If it’s a dickishness that means everybody else doesn’t get to work at their best level – if you being a dick means you’re going to encroach upon my process, there’ll be a slug fest in the parking lot. There will be words exchanged. And I’ve worked with men and women where I’m like, ‘Are we going to have to go through this again?’ And, well, yes, because that’s what’s called for. On rare occasions, people are insane – but those are really rare.” His own sanity is something he puts down to good decision-making and good luck. Certainly he didn’t come by it during childhood. Hanks talks about his early years with a kind of bleak whimsy, the constant moving around from town to town in California, the disruption of his parents’ new partners. When I ask if his baseline cheerfulness is something he might have learned from either of his parents, he bursts into laughter. “No. Dear lord. My parents were so busy with all their own problems, I don’t think they were even aware of the fact that sometimes we were in the house.” His father was a cook who hated cooking. His mother was someone who for many years he saw somewhat infrequently. In Pollyanna-ish style, Hanks has tried to salvage good things from this experience, for example, “the few times I’ve been afraid of a new environment, I got over it. And once you learn that it might be bad for a while, then you’re OK.” You’re an optimist, I suggest, and while Hanks allows this to be the case, he looks vaguely as if I have accused him of something. “I think the kneejerk reaction is that because you’re optimistic, you’re naive. Or that, because you’re essentially cheerful, you’re ignoring the pain of the real things that are going on. And that’s just not the case. I weigh everything. But I can’t help it that I wake up in the morning and think: what good thing is going to come around?” I wondered whether part of the reason Hanks wrote Uncommon Type was that, after 30 solid years of success at the box office – the combined receipts of his movies is around $8bn, and he has won two Oscars (for Forrest Gump and Philadelphia), multiple Golden Globes and a Tony nomination for Lucky Guy – he needed a new challenge. “Not at all,” he says. “If you’re looking back, yeah, shoot. I got it. That’s all fine. But that’s not the reason I did this.” It’s not a question of getting sucked into the competitive horse race, either. If he hadn’t married and had kids early, Hanks says, he might have had a tougher time handling his fame. These days, 21 seems very young to have a family, and I ask him if, when he looks at his own 21-year-old son and imagines him becoming a father, his mind boggles. “Yeah,” he says. “I had to stop telling them, ‘You know what I had when I was your age? I had your older brother!’ It was young. Other than moments of total terror, what it provided me with was a nut that I had to provide: there’s three of us, now, and I need x numbers of dollars in order for us, literally, to survive.” It was a limitation he found freeing. “I need to make enough to be able to go to the dentist and fix my car, and as soon as I can get on a decent dental plan, then the rest is the high country. And that’s what life was like. I avoided all the parties, the pitfalls. I mean, I did the same degree of social influencing drugs that anybody else did, but it didn’t become a habit, and it didn’t become a reason to live.” He wasn’t resentful about having to stay in and provide? “No. I always had more fun just sitting around talking to people than going out. Look, I was ridiculously fortunate, but there was never a plethora of riches and luxury. What I was was a working guy. I made my nut. Then you rethink what that nut is. Slowly, you move along. I was the most naive and inexperienced and stupid 35-year-old that ever was, but at the time, the kids’ mom and I had restrictions upon us that meant we could not spin out of control.” He thinks for a moment. “If we did, shame on us.” The year that Hanks and Lewes divorced, 1987, was also the beginning of his great run of success. A year later, he made Big, still the movie for which many of us love him best, and after that the hits came so thick and fast that, after marrying Wilson in 1988, his second family had a very different experience from his first. “I talk about this with my [older] kids all the time,” he says. “They remember when life was normal. When we lived in standard houses and I sometimes had work or not. And there was not the ballyhoo that goes along with everything. My younger kids have always had this other guy who was their dad.” The other guy is Hanks from his mid-30s onwards, and he tries hard to own his privilege. “Look, I’m rich.” He laughs. “I’m rich.” He is also careful with money. “I read a long time ago that you can’t have debt. If you’re in debt, you can’t say no. You have to have what David Niven called fuck-you money. So, the nut is what do you need in order to live right now, and that’s finite. My money’s in the bank, man. My money’s safe. I have all the groovy accoutrements that go along with being a celebrity, and it’s really great, but the nut stays where it is. Our nut is: if it stops tomorrow, we’ll be fine.” He and Wilson tried to raise their kids in as normal an environment as possible. “I would say we lived in a relatively modest home until all the kids were grown up. I say relatively; if you saw the house, you would – relatively modest for somebody who does what I do for a living, and that still takes in the same security concerns. We didn’t move until they were older, and that was a conscious decision. You don’t want to fuck up the kids because, hey, guess what, we have a new boat in the driveway. The money was great, but both Rita and I have communicated to our kids that we really love what we do. We’re doing it for the sheer-ass pleasure.” What about the movies that failed? “Oh, I’d go through horrible doldrums. I’ve made an awful lot of movies that didn’t make any sense, and didn’t make any money, but that doesn’t alter the work that goes into it, or even what your opinion of it is.” Such as? “Like, I made a movie that altered my entire consciousness – Cloud Atlas – I thought, jeez, this thing is so fab; it’s the only movie I’ve been in that I’ve seen more than twice. And it didn’t do any business. And there’s nothing you can do about it. And you must allow yourself a week of thinking, jeez, I’m so bummed out. But that’s not the only reason to do it. It’s lovely when it all works and you get ballyhooed. But if it’s 50/50, you’re way ahead of the game. In reality, I think it’s more like 80/20; 80% of what you do doesn’t work.” Hanks has no qualms about being on the other side of 60. “I actually like getting older. I always felt like I had a big ass and a squeaky voice when I was growing up.” There were other hard things. “I will tell you, type 2 diabetes was a thing. I just wasn’t eating right, I wasn’t putting good stuff into the machine. And my doctor said, congratulations, you idiot, you now have type 2 diabetes. It’s not like you automatically change your behaviours, but that was a major signpost that said ‘This is optional, man. These are choices. And if you want to, go ahead. But: consequences. Dig it?’” He and Wilson have always been relatively abstemious. “In the former firmament of Hollywood, everyone got shitfaced at 5pm. Everybody drank. We just didn’t do that.” And he doesn’t consider the longevity of their marriage strange. Everyone they know is married, Hanks says; that’s just how they hang out, with other married couples who’ve been together as long as they have. The biggest risk to their equilibrium right now isn’t marital strife, but Trump. “Every dinner party you have falls into this black hole of conversation. How long can we hold off? It’s such a huge, magnificent mess right now. Had Hillary Clinton been elected, and I voted for her, I think we’d be in some other form of hideous mess. The nature of discourse has been ‘us’ versus ‘them’ for some time and I think there was a massive amount of fatigue from the Bush-Clinton continuum.” Was his faith in the American people damaged by the election of Trump? “Faith in the American people?” He gives me a very Hanksian look, amused in a wry, senatorial way. “We still have this thing called the constitution. Even though it seems as though there are people hellbent on altering it, or bending it, or not living up to the oaths of protecting and defending the constitution, there are an equal number who are strapping on their brass knuckles.” In different circumstances, I suggest, he might have been a Trump voter; what if he’d been a 61-year-old unemployed actor who’d never had a good part in his life? “Yeah, and if I’d been earlier, I could’ve died in Vietnam. I grew up thinking, hey, it’ll work out; hey, who cares? Don’t plan too much, just go ahead and do it. But look, I’m white. So, right then and there, I can drive across the country by myself in 1977 without any difficulties. I can walk into any store. The ongoing test is one of empathy. You always have to take into account how shitty a deal a person has had, along with how many opportunities they have squandered.” Hanks is so measured, so committed to the process of rationalisation that it is impossible to imagine him losing his temper. How does he fight? “Well,” he says, and thinks for a moment. “When I get pissed off, it’s emotional. I can get pretty complainy. And then syntax is of major importance. If you write this story and I call you on the phone and the first thing I say is, ‘Let me get this straight.’” He raises his eyebrows. “That’s bad news,” he says, and dispenses the broadest of smiles. • Tom Hanks’ Uncommon Type is published next week by William Heinemann at £16.99.

He also called for protectionist measures, directly clashing with recommendations contained in a key International Monetary Fund (IMF) report released the same day. Saying his administration was working on a “fantastic” economic bill “which nobody knows about”, Trump offered no details but said the bill contained “economic-development incentives” for companies to stay in the US. Companies sending jobs overseas, he said, would “get penalised severely”. “It’s both a carrot and a stick,” he said. “It is an incentive to stay. But it is perhaps even more so – if you leave, it’s going to be very tough for you to think that you’re going to be able to sell your product back into our country.” The IMF report on the global economy contained a rebuke to protectionist policies. “Although the chances of advanced economy policies turning inward have diminished in the near term, pressures for increased protectionism have not disappeared and ought to be resisted,” it read. According to the report, increased growth is forecast in the US, the eurozone, Japan and China this year, with world trade expected to grow 4.2% – its fastest rate in six years. The last time the global economy grew so fast was in 2010, in a short-lived recovery from the 2008 financial crisis. This year’s performance is significantly stronger, the IMF chief economist, Maurice Obstfeld, told the Financial Times. “This is not bounce-back from a sharp deceleration; this is an acceleration from the fairly tepid growth rates of recent years, so that’s really good news,” he said. Trump nonetheless feels the US economy is in need of protection. Asked by Forbes if he was comfortable with measures that the private sector would largely oppose, he said: “Very comfortable. What I want to do is reciprocal. “See, I think the concept of reciprocal is a very nice concept. If somebody is charging us 50%, we should charge them 50%. Right now they charge us 50%, and we charge them nothing. That doesn’t work with me.” Trump’s words echoed those in the pages of The Art of the Deal, his bestselling 1980s advertisement for his own his business acumen. He has often described how he uses inflated numbers as a negotiating tactic, often then employing the same numbers to declare victory after the fact. Forbes quoted Trump’s words from 1984, when he bought a now long-defunct franchise, the New Jersey Generals, in a now long-defunct competition, the United States Football League. “When I build something for somebody, I always add $50m or $60m on to the price,” the magazine quoted him as saying. “My guys come in, they say it’s going to cost $75m. I say it’s going to cost $125m and I build it for $100m. Basically, I did a lousy job. But they think I did a great job.” Trump told Forbes about his current proposal to cut the corporate tax rate to 20% – after months of saying he wanted to go even lower, to 15%. “I was actually saying 15 for the purpose of getting to 20,” he said. “As you know, this will be a negotiation for the next 30 days. But I wanted the 15 in order to get to 20.” Using impressive numbers, Forbes pointed out, is essential to Trump’s reflexive habit of establishing hierarchy. “So GDP last quarter was 3.1%,” he said. “Most of the folks that are in your business, and elsewhere, were saying that would not be hit for a long time. You know, Obama never hit the number.” Asked to comment on soaring US stock indexes, which are up as much as 20% since the start of his term, Trump said the real number was 25%. “Since election day it’s 25%,” he said. “It has gone up since election day $5.2tn – $5.2tn. If Hillary Clinton would have won, the markets would have gone down substantially.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"voluntary-sector-network/2017/oct/13/lobbying-act-law-not-silencing-charities","type":"article","sectionId":"voluntary-sector-network","sectionName":"Voluntary Sector Network","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-13T06:33:25Z","webTitle":"It's not the law that's silencing charities: it's their own lack of imagination | Katherine Rake","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/voluntary-sector-network/2017/oct/13/lobbying-act-law-not-silencing-charities","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/voluntary-sector-network/2017/oct/13/lobbying-act-law-not-silencing-charities","fields":{"headline":"It's not the law that's silencing charities: it's their own lack of imagination","bodyText":"When things fall silent, it takes a while to notice. Like the freezer that no longer hums after being accidentally unplugged, the silence creates a niggle that we often ignore, until there’s a mush of once-frozen peas and melted ice cream. I had just such a niggle when I realised I hadn’t seen any inspiring charity campaigns for a while. When I Whatsapped some veteran charity campaigners to ask what they thought, one said maybe campaigning had shifted to politics, in the form of Labour’s Momentum movement, or the Vote Leave campaign, leaving no space for charities. Another thought digital natives had taken over, building their own networks and connections, leaving little room from charity campaigns. I railed against these answers. In a time of turbulent and volatile politics, the need for charities to build powerful alliances for change and reflect views not often heard in mainstream politics is bigger than ever. Charities have a special role to play bridging the gap between Westminster and everyday lives and injecting a healthy dose of reality into policy making. Not content with the Whatsapp response, I continued my entirely unscientific research on Twitter. where the response was quick fire and enthusiastic and produced a list chosen by people whose business it is to campaign: the campaigners’ campaigns if you like. There is a lot to be inspired by here, from campaigning for simple things that make a big difference to people’s lives, such as badges to wear on public transport if you have cancer, through to the audacious US campaign to save a local library that invited residents to book burning parties and saved the library with the power of reverse psychology. There are campaigns that raise issues rarely on the mainstream agenda, like Let us Learn, which highlights barriers facing young migrants who want to go to university. Or the brilliantly-named Pregnant then screwed campaign that allows mothers to share stories about pregnancy and discrimination, as well as providing support and advice. Most of these are not charity campaigns. The campaigns the campaigners love are often run by small groups, are full of energy and humour, create online and real-world connections around a common experience and enableeveryone to pitch in and make change happen. It is understandable that charities have raised concerns about the clunky and frustrating Lobbying Act and its chilling effect on charity campaigns. But to put the blame on the Act alone is to miss a bigger point: charities have been left standing by a new generation of campaigners. To help break the silence, charities need to think deeply about how they campaign. This is not about taking old ideas and getting clever with digital: if the only thing you ask supporters is to write to their MP, it is going to be as tired online as it is on paper. New campaigns are about building a platform for others to come together, share experiences, and challenge stereotypes. The engagement needs to be deep and different, helping people change their own lives as well enlisting them to support new policy. It needs to be relevant, breaking long-term goals into steps that feel achievable. Most fundamental of all, it requires charities to cede power, enabling people to set their own goals, create campaigns that are right for them and help themselves as well as others along the way. Ultimately this is about democratising campaigns, and shifts a charity’s focus from giving voice to others’ concerns to building and handing over a megaphone so that those affected can voice their concerns directly.

A new Magic Pass gives access to lifts in 25 little resorts in five cantons, including powder wonderland Grimentz-Zinal, Crans-Montana, Villars-Gryon and pretty St Luc, and represents a fantastic bargain. Although it’s CHF459 (£356) for adults or CHF299 (£232) for kids upfront, that covers the whole season, from 1 November until 30 April 2018, ideal for those planning multiple trips, or perhaps a ski-safari road trip, taking in several resorts. The four largest Bernese Oberland resorts – Gstaad, Jungfrau Region, Adelboden-Lenk and Meiringen-Hasliberg – have a combined TOP4 season pass for CHF666 (£516), covering 666km of slopes, valid from 1 December until 30 April. But don’t wait too long – if you buy the pass from 16 December onward it will cost CHF950 (£733). In the French Pyrenees, the new Pyrenees 2 Vallees pass covers four ski areas – Saint-Lary, Peyragudes, Piau and Val Louron. It’s €20 for eight days, then you can buy each area’s day pass as you require, at a 10-15% discount. Flights and trains New daily sleeper trains with Austrian rail operator OBB make it possible to reach the Tirol overnight, albeit with a bit of luggage hefting. After a Eurostar to Brussels, and a connection to Cologne, skiers pick up the NightJet sleeper, which can be disembarked in various locations, including a final stop at Innsbruck. It’s possible to depart London St Pancras at 15.04 and arrive in Innsbruck by 9.14am the next day, returning from Innsbruck at 20.44 and arriving St Pancras at 14.05. From £215pp return, snowcarbon.co.uk. A new airline, Powdair, is to run flights to the Swiss airport of Sion from Bristol, Luton, London City, Manchester, Southampton and Southend from December, for around £100-150 each way, between Thursday-Monday. Sion is a gateway to the 36 Valais resorts, including Nendaz, 25 minutes’ drive away, which is lift-linked to Verbier. Free ski and snowboard carriage and 23kg hold allowance are included, and season tickets are available. Jet2 has expanded its ski flights, with departures for the first time from Stansted to Geneva, Salzburg, Grenoble and Lyon, and from Birmingham to Grenoble, Geneva, Salzburg and Turin. Flights from Belfast to Salzburg and Verona have also resumed. Accommodation and trips One of the most exciting new hotel projects in years sees the reinvention of the old Montenvers refuge, above the Mer de Glace glacier in Chamonix. Built in 1880 to house the first mountaineers in the area, it’s been transformed into the coolly elegant Terminal Neige (doubles from €150, €80 for a bed in a dorm) from Sibuet’s Terminal Neige brand, following its streetwise Totem hotel in Flaine. Original wood-panelling in the lounge is offset by kitsch chairs made from twee embroidered samplers of mountain scenes, and industrial lighting. It is only accessible on the little red Montenvers mountain train from Chamonix town, and from the hotel guests can ski-tour, visit the illuminated ice caves within the glacier, head up to the Aiguille du Midi cable car to ski the Vallée Blanche, and dine in the nearby Le Panoramique restaurant, which has a terrace affording incredible views of the glacier. Elsewhere, ho36 (singles from €35) is a smart “new generation” hostel with private rooms – all dark grey walls, cow hides and bare pine – set to open in December in Les Ménuires, France. And Lenzerheide, the fab large Swiss resort recently linked to Arosa, will be home to the youthful new Revier Mountain Lodge (doubles from CHF94/£73). Though the building may resemble a 1970s college, the 96 bedrooms are cool, pine-clad cubes with beds set into picture windows; the bar is dark grey and industrial, and there’s a club night every Friday. Other interesting openings include Una Lodge (doubles around £125 B&amp;B including sauna and Jacuzzi), a smart retreat in Switzerland with just four doubles and a suite, right by the lifts in Le Chable, linked to Verbier; and the ski-in, ski-out Franz Ferdinand (doubles from €130) by the lift-station in Nassfeld, the Austrian resort with a quirkier than usual range of snow sports and activities – the hotel itself will boast a big après-ski terrace and club. Further afield the Hotel Becket (doubles from $66 a night), is a bargain new option in California’s epic Lake Tahoe. Ski Safari’s new Arctic Circle Ski Safari includes Sweden’s Riksgränsen (the world’s most northerly ski resort) and Björkliden, with great off-piste and runs that descend into Norway, plus add-ons to see Santa in Lapland, the Aurora Sky Station, and non-ski activities such as dog-sledding. Seven nights from £1,195pp, including B&amp;B, flights and transfers. New lifts and resort links Andermatt, the Swiss resort famed for its powder and wilderness descents around the Gemsstock mountain, will be connected for the first time to Sedrun. A new chairlift is the first step towards merging the two resorts – 14 lifts are planned. A huge amount of expert terrain has been added in the Canadian resort of Panorama, in British Columbia’s Taynton Bowl, including a steep, 6½km “double black diamond” run (the toughest piste category in North America) called the Monster. It’s part of a 500-acre expansion in the next few years. The resort also boasts Canada’s largest slope-side hot pool. Although skiers will have to wait until 2021 for the opening of a game-changing new lift linking the mega resorts of Alpe d’Huez and Les Deux Alpes, the former is already making improvements, with a new gondola from Vaujany to L’Enversin d’Oz. Activities A specially converted and graffitied carriage on the Andermatt-to-Disentis train, which takes 70 minutes and calls at resorts including Sedrun, has become the Après Ski Train, with a bar and lounge. Rides are free to those with a lift pass. A heated, horse-drawn carriage with space to seat 20 people will become a travelling restaurant in Gstaad, hosting cheese fondues while trotting around the village. Book through the Michel Stallbeizli restaurant once in resort (around £58pp). Giant inflatable airbags that allow freestylers to practise tricks but land safely is an innovation adopted by resorts worldwide. This season Mammoth, in California, has upped the ante and invested in a Progression Airbag, one of only three in the world, which improves on the concept by more closely resembling a real snow jump. It is 200ft long and sloped, features a landing, deck and walls, and sits next to a real snow equivalent that riders can move on to when they’ve mastered a trick. Though Olympians and athletes have been commandeering it over the summer, visitors can book sessions and camps to try it – though details will only be released in the new year. Last season, Mammoth boasted its second longest ski season ever, with lifts open for skiers on 270 days of the year. It plans to open even earlier this season, on 9 November. Closer to home, freestylers heading to Val Thorens in the French Alps can try the new Délir ’Park, an indoor space full of foam pits and trampolines, ideal for practising those spins and flips."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"media/2017/oct/15/armando-iannucci-the-death-of-stalin-hear-me-out-interview","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-15T08:30:25Z","webTitle":"Armando Iannucci: ‘I was saved from being a reject by comedy’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/oct/15/armando-iannucci-the-death-of-stalin-hear-me-out-interview","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2017/oct/15/armando-iannucci-the-death-of-stalin-hear-me-out-interview","fields":{"headline":"Armando Iannucci: ‘I was saved from being a reject by comedy’","bodyText":"Armando Iannucci arrives for our 3pm meeting with a small amount of his lunch still clinging to his shirt. We discuss retouching the mark for the Observer’s pictures but, admirably, he doesn’t seem to care either way. It is tempting to describe the 53-year-old Iannucci as the most feared political satirist of our age. Certainly, his output in the past decade – the BBC sitcom The Thick of It, the companion film In the Loop, and latterly Veep – has been untouchable in skewering the vanity, incompetence and plain childishness of people in power. But, in person, nothing about Iannucci is remotely scary: he is self-effacing, smiley, quick to laugh. At the end of the day, he’s just a guy with a tomato stain on his shirt. Iannucci’s latest target is Stalin and his cronies. His new film, The Death of Stalin, is set in 1953 and depicts – with unexpected historical accuracy – the undignified scrabble for dominance that followed the demise of the Soviet despot. It is silly, moving and revelatory, all at once, with deft, pitch-perfect turns from Simon Russell Beale as Beria and Steve Buscemi as Khrushchev. Iannucci, who never likes to have fewer than seven plates spinning at any moment, has also just published a book on classical music, Hear Me Out, about a lifetime of listening to Mahler and Britten in open defiance of “the keepers of the cool”. Was it easier than you expected to make a comedy about Stalin and his inner circle that was also factually accurate? Yeah. When we were researching it, we found out things like Vasily, Stalin’s son, really did lose the ice-hockey team in a plane crash. And because the comedy is the comedy of hysteria, you want to be true to what happened and how people responded. So anything that was so-bizarre-and-yet-true was a candidate for going in. I thought about having “This is a true story…”, but then I thought, no, just watch it for what it is, and it would be great if you subsequently found out that the bulk of it was true. These men are vicious, but your film also gives them a human side. They have families they fear for; they play practical jokes. Did your feelings towards them change? Um, no. But I did think, what must they have done to have survived and ended up so close to Stalin, and what has it done to them? The fact, for example, that he would almost taunt them and mock them and play them off against each other… With all these things it’s about posing the question, “What would you have done in those circumstances?” Power corrupts? Yeah, it was almost like Animal Farm by the end, and yet they all lived near each other and popped in and out of each other’s houses. He might have had your brother shot and all that, but they had to sublimate that as just part of the process of moving forward. But, you know, you read that Boris Johnson and Michael Gove were the biggest enemies and are now reconciled. I’m not saying they are like Stalin, but in that febrile environment where you see each other every day, in order to survive, just psychologically, you must have to close off a bit of your emotion. So there are lessons about today’s political landscape? Trump gets all his closest associates in over the past three or four months, and has to say, “By the way, you’re fired because I need to survive now. So could you go away?” And eventually he’ll be saying that to his daughter and his son-in-law: “You’ve now become an albatross, I can’t be seen with you anymore.” Or after the general election, Theresa May turns to her two very close advisers and says, “It’s you or me.” And they all kind of understand that. It’s like that thing in The Godfather: “It’s not personal, it’s strictly business.” Is it true there have been calls in Russia for the film to be banned? You say Russia – it’s a person in a country of 200 million people. Just somebody somewhere said something. Were you expecting a reaction? I was wondering what it would be. I was surprised to hear we sold it to a Russian distributor. Stalin’s been making a comeback. There have been busts of Lenin, Stalin and other key figures going up in Moscow for the 100th anniversary of the Russian Revolution. It’s that sense of, don’t be frightened of strong men. That’s the message in Moscow at the moment. There’s a line in your book Hear Me Out where you describe film directing as “an astonishing ego trip”, and that you “wouldn’t recommend it to anyone who has the slightest psychotic tendencies”. Is it a job you feel comfortable doing? Ha! It is, but you do spend all day ordering people around, and everyone will do what you say. My wife teases me when I finish a shoot that it takes about a week and a half before I stop going, “Right, shall we have a cup of tea? You, get a cup of tea…” I can see how, especially if you do shoots that go on for months, you become like a medieval lord with all these serfs, just ordering them around and torturing them and asking them to tell jokes and fetch food. As the creator and showrunner on HBO’s Veep for the first four seasons was it a difficult decision to give it up in 2015? No. It might have been the British thing that we don’t do that many episodes of TV shows in the UK. Plus, it was three months of the year going out to Baltimore, backwards and forwards, and it was an all-year-round thing of the writing, the shooting, the edit, the publicising and then the writing… And I knew the show could carry on, but fundamentally I’d taken it to where I wanted to take it. The show will end next year with a final, seventh series. Do you know what’s going to happen? No, no, no. They asked if I wanted to stay on, but I knew I was going to do Stalin and I just thought, I can’t be on set and get a call saying, “Can you look at this script?” But it’s great, because I watch it as a viewer and you realise – though I always knew this – what an amazing cast it is and how funny they all are. And also, I genuinely don’t know what they are going to say next, which is really great. It was recently announced that you’re making a new show with HBO called Avenue 5. What’s the idea behind that? I’ve always wanted to do sci-fi, so this will be set mostly in space, in about 40 years’ time. It’s not going to be Blade Runner, but there will be an element of realism to it. I’ve been out to the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena and Virgin Galactic, looking at where it might be in about 40 years’ time. I’ve mapped out the season and we’re writing the pilot episode and we’ll shoot that sometime next year. And because it’s in space, it’s not location specific, so we can shoot it in a studio or a hanger in London. We’ll just build a spaceship here. What impact do you think streaming services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime are having on terrestrial TV? Well, the good thing is that content producers – writers and producers – have more places to go. And also, what’s great, and HBO paved the way with this: quality stuff is profitable. That’s their business model: you’ll only subscribe to HBO if you think you’re going to get good stuff that’s different from what’s on the networks. So they need it to be better and well thought out and high production values and all that. But is the quality always better? I do worry that simply because there’s so much money available from the big streaming companies, they’ll say, “Oh we’ll make your movie. We know no one else wanted to, and we realise why, because it was slightly indulgent or whatever, but we’ll make it.” And you watch it and you think, it was fine but… For all the criticism of the studio process, if you’re making something that costs someone else money and which is going to be available commercially, you want people to go and see it. So it does force you to think: have you made it as well as you can? Or have you really thought this through? In Hear Me Out you write about the tyranny of the keepers of cool. Was liking classical music a reaction against them? Well, I was never really into fashion or clothes. I just wasn’t that bothered. I wanted to read a good book. I was saved from being written off as a complete reject by the fact I could do comedy. You started to learn piano in your 40s. Was that difficult? I found it hard. It was learning a language: Oh, I can speak music! And suddenly these dots and whatever started to make sense. But it was hard work. Some people can do it instinctively and I couldn’t. My son would lean over me, he’d be practising the violin, and go, “No, no, no, it’s like this.” And he hasn’t had a piano lesson. Do you listen to any non-classical music? I kind of like Radiohead, the Beatles, Bowie, it’s not extensive, but I’m always trying. What’s interesting now is, because everything is available, kids can listen to Sinatra when they’re 12 and there’s no real sense of: “You’ve got to listen to this because it’s out now. But you can’t listen to that because that’s from 20 years ago.” They are a lot more experimental in what they are listening to and that then feeds into the music that’s being produced. It’s influenced not just by music from two years ago, but music from 20 or 30 years ago. How can classical music stay relevant? It’s up to the classical music establishment, for want of a better word, to open it up. Concerts needn’t be off-putting and expensive and you don’t have to dress up and you don’t have to understand the technical complexities. Just talk to the audience. One of the weird things about a concert is that nobody says anything to you, so you’ve got to just accept what’s in front of you and work it out. Somebody should sit down and explain: “This piece, when it was first composed, caused a riot. Now it might sound a bit more conventional because it’s been used in a Walt Disney movie.” I don’t know, I think it’s just useful. Stalin had a great passion for classical music. So listening to it doesn’t make you a better human being then? George Steiner writes about how Goebbels was into Mozart and played the piano beautifully. Wagner was an antisemitic bastard, so actually, no. That’s the sad thing: it doesn’t make any difference. It really doesn’t. Can you put that aside when you listen to the music? I don’t know. I always got taken by the grandiosity of Wagner, but the more I listen to it now the more I think, it does sound fascist, doesn’t it? But it’s interesting, that thing of, “Can you excuse?” Like Polanski. That whole, “Great film-maker, but should you be watching his movies?” I don’t know what the answer is.

A study by an American psychologist suggests that people are better able to pick up on the emotions of others when simply focusing on their voice, compared with both watching and listening to them, or just watching them. “Humans are actually remarkably good at using many of their senses for conveying emotions, but emotion research historically is focused almost exclusively on the facial expressions,” said Michael Kraus, a social psychologist at Yale University and author of the study. While combining information from a person’s voice with their facial expressions and other cues might at first seem like a way to boost understanding of their thoughts and feelings, Kraus says pooling the senses divides attention. What’s more, he notes, facial expressions can mask a person’s true feelings – something that he says is harder to do with the voice – while language plays a key role in how people understand and label their emotions. The upshot, he says, is that what people say, and the way they say it, offers the clearest insights into the emotions of others. “Listening matters,” said Kraus. “Actually considering what people are saying and the ways in which they say it can, I believe, lead to improved understanding of others at work or in your personal relationships.” The study, published in the journal American Psychologist, describes a series of five experiments involving more than 1,770 individuals, in which participants were asked to rate how another person felt using a series of scales reflecting different emotions. Among the experiments, 266 strangers were paired up and asked to discuss film and TV then food and drink in both a lighted room and a room with the lights off. In each case, participants then rated their own emotions and those of their partner on a series of scales. The results revealed that participants were better able to accurately estimate their partner’s feelings when the lights were off. In another, almost 600 participants recruited online were each shown a video of three women taking part in the experiment above in one of three scenarios: the lighted-room conversation, a night-vision video of the dark-room conversation and a sound-only recording of the dark-room conversation. The results showed that viewers were best able to assess women’s emotions in the sound-only recording. Professor Sophie Scott, head of the speech communication group at University College London, agreed that people are often better able to control their facial expression than their voice when emotional – and that, in some cases, voices and visuals can tell a different story. But while she said the results from the latest study were very interesting, they were far from dramatic. “The effect sizes are tiny,” said Scott. “It could be that these [other cues] are making a difference – but it is perhaps not an enormous difference.” But, she noted, it might be that the studies did not provoke much emotional variation among those taking part. Scott added that the importance of the voice may not apply to everyone, noting that other research has shown that when understanding of speech is impaired, people develop an enhanced ability to pick up on the facial cues of others. Kraus agreed. “I actually think that people with hearing problems must be particularly adept at parsing the facial and nonverbal expressions of emotion,” he said. Ray Wilkinson, professor of human communication at the University of Sheffield, said that the study was interesting, but noted that the findings were based on experimental situations that might not reflect “real life” interactions and added that, while the content of a person’s speech is, unsurprisingly, important, other research has found that gestures can help to get a point across. “The findings are little bit surprising in that what we know generally about human communication is that it is multi-modal – it is not just verbal,” he said. “Gesture and facial expression are also important for communication and add a lot to the overall meaning.” While Wilkinson notes the situation might be different for emotions, he adds that the idea of the “true” message is problematic. While verbal and facial cues might offer a different message, “that can be part of what we are wanting to convey,” he said. “It depends what we mean by the ‘real message’ or what what the ‘real’ emotion is – that in itself can be a rather slippery concept.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"money/2017/oct/11/aldi-to-accept-old-1-pound-coin-for-two-weeks-after-deadline","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-11T19:55:28Z","webTitle":"Aldi to accept old £1 coin for two weeks after deadline","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2017/oct/11/aldi-to-accept-old-1-pound-coin-for-two-weeks-after-deadline","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2017/oct/11/aldi-to-accept-old-1-pound-coin-for-two-weeks-after-deadline","fields":{"headline":"Aldi to accept old £1 coin for two weeks after deadline","bodyText":"The discount supermarket chain Aldi is to accept the old £1 coins in its UK stores for two weeks after they cease to be legal tender. The UK’s largest retailer, Tesco, said earlier this week that it would allow its shoppers to pay with the round pound coins at tills and self-service machines for an extra week in apparent defiance of the 15 October deadline the Royal Mint has imposed. It follows a similar announcement by the discount retailer Poundland, which will accept round pounds until 31 October. About 500m are believed to remain in circulation. Aldi said: “We’ve been ready to accept the new £1 coins since they first came into circulation in March. To make the transition as easy as possible for our customers, we will continue to accept the old £1 coins as payment across our stores until 31 October.” The old coin remains legal tender until midnight on Sunday. After that time, businesses can stop accepting it and will not automatically be giving it as change for notes. The Royal Mint and the Treasury were keen for retailers to stick to the deadline for a clean break from the round pound to avoid potential chaos being created by some shops continuing to accept them. The new 12-sided £1 coin, which resembles the old threepenny bit, entered circulation in March and has new high-tech security features to thwart counterfeiters. The production of the new coins followed concerns about round pounds being vulnerable to sophisticated counterfeiters. About one in 30 old-style pound coins in people’s change has been fake in recent years."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"uk-news/2017/oct/11/ipcc-investigates-officer-over-alleged-assault-of-photographer-at-corbyn-rally","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-11T11:35:12Z","webTitle":"IPCC investigates officer over alleged assault of photographer at Corbyn rally","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/oct/11/ipcc-investigates-officer-over-alleged-assault-of-photographer-at-corbyn-rally","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2017/oct/11/ipcc-investigates-officer-over-alleged-assault-of-photographer-at-corbyn-rally","fields":{"headline":"IPCC investigates officer over alleged assault of photographer at Corbyn rally","bodyText":"A criminal investigation is under way after a police protection officer at a Jeremy Corbyn rally is alleged to have assaulted a photographer on the final day of the general election campaign. The Independent Police Complaints Commission said it was investigating a Metropolitan police officer from the royalty and specialist protection command during the rally in Colwyn Bay, north Wales, on 7 June. A photographer was involved in an incident at the event where he was restrained on the ground by a police officer, the IPCC said. The man suffered physical injuries as well as damage to his photography equipment. The photographer, who has not been identified, complained to the Met police, which referred the officer to the IPCC, which said it was now conducting an independent investigation. The IPCC said the officer had been informed that his actions were subject to criminal investigation for potential common assault and criminal damage. The watchdog’s commissioner, Cindy Butts, said: “This was an incident that occurred in public view at a large event and to maintain public confidence this matter is now being investigated by the IPCC. We are examining the force used and its appropriateness in the circumstances.” The Labour leader held six rallies across the country on the final day of campaigning in June, attended by thousands of people. As well as the rally in Colwyn Bay, Corbyn travelled more than 500 miles for appearances in Glasgow, Watford, Harrow and Islington, his constituency in north London. The north Wales rally was a show of support from the Labour leader for the Clwyd West Labour candidate Gareth Thomas and Aberconwy candidate Emily Owen, both contesting Conservative-held seats. However, neither candidate managed to win the seats, though both substantially reduced the Conservative majorities."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2017/oct/12/prokofiev-peter-and-the-wolf-etc-cd-review-vasily-petrenko-alexander-armstrong","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-12T14:45:06Z","webTitle":"Prokofiev: Peter and the Wolf, etc CD review – affable but unmemorable","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/oct/12/prokofiev-peter-and-the-wolf-etc-cd-review-vasily-petrenko-alexander-armstrong","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2017/oct/12/prokofiev-peter-and-the-wolf-etc-cd-review-vasily-petrenko-alexander-armstrong","fields":{"headline":"Prokofiev: Peter and the Wolf, etc CD review – affable but unmemorable","bodyText":"Peter and the Wolf is a gift for storytellers.

His latest Debussy album is a perfect example. The goldfish of Poisson d’Or move in jerks and sudden flashes. The water droplets in Reflets dans l’Eau are super crisp, like pointillism writ large. At the end of Doctor Gradus ad Parnassum the tune rings out like a defiant shout. It’s not pretty but it is exhilarating. There is gentleness too – try The Snow Is Dancing, whispered and supple. But what makes Osborne’s interpretations so revelatory is his willingness to state in plain terms what many pianists make blurry.

In the wake of last week’s Kate Winslet and Idris Elba vehicle The Mountain Between Us comes this based-on-a-true-story drama about what happened to former pro hockey player Eric LeMarque (Josh Harnett) when he went snowboarding with a plastic bag full of crystal meth, a two-way radio low on charge, and a foolhardy belief in his own inviolability. Bleached-out flashbacks to LeMarque’s unhappy childhood punctuate the film’s present-tense trudges through the snow, failures to light a fire, and inevitable encounters with wolves. Stylistically, it’s strictly made-for-TV trauma-drama stuff, but it’s hard not to admire Hartnett’s tenacity in what was surely a physically challenging role and wonder why he hasn’t had a better career arc. Poor Mira Sorvino, who has had even worse fortunes despite an early Oscar, and who is only 11 years older than Hartnett in real life, is cast as LeMarque’s long-suffering, devoted mother. Still, perhaps the best thing about this movie is that the relationship between a parent and her adult child, instead of a romantic liaison, represents the true emotional spine of the story."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"business/2017/oct/12/cut-duty-scotch-whisky-raise-industry-spirits-association","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-12T08:31:30Z","webTitle":"Cut duty on Scotch whisky to raise industry spirits, say distillers","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/oct/12/cut-duty-scotch-whisky-raise-industry-spirits-association","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2017/oct/12/cut-duty-scotch-whisky-raise-industry-spirits-association","fields":{"headline":"Cut duty on Scotch whisky to raise industry spirits, say distillers","bodyText":"The Scotch Whisky Association has called for a cut in duty on the strong stuff after warning that sales fell by 1m bottles over the first six months of the year.. The association said the slump could be attributed to a near 4% increase in duty on spirits, one of several tax-raising measures imposed by the chancellor, Philip Hammond, in his March budget. Industry figures show that an average bottle sold at £12.77 will generate more than £10 for the Treasury, meaning that tax makes up around 80% of the retail price of a bottle of whisky. Official HMRC figures show 36.7m bottles were released for sale in the first six months of 2017 – down from 37.7m in the same period last year. However, the industry trade body said the tax hike didn’t appear to be working, as it cited a decline in tax revenues from spirits of more than 7% to £697m from £751m in the first three months of the financial year. Karen Betts, chief executive of the association, said the quarterly HMRC figures showed that the Treasury had made an error. “Philip Hammond’s damaging 3.9% spirits duty hike has hit UK demand for Scotch and seen less money going to the Treasury,” she said. “The chancellor should use his November budget to drop the dram duty and boost a great British success story.” She said the whisky industry supported 40,000 jobs and played a key role in Scotland’s economy, accounting for more than £4bn in exports. Scotch is Britain’s biggest food-and-drink export by far, with chocolate sales of £660m a distant second. However, the damage caused to domestic sales by the increase in spirit tax is a double whammy for an industry that has suffered several years of falling export sales. Intense competition from distillers in east Asia and the US has eaten into export markets and reduced sales abroad. The industry is also battling proposals in Holyrood to implement a 50p minimum price for alcohol in Scotland. Betts said the Treasury should look at the example set by a cut in duty two years ago. She said a 2% reduction in duty in 2015 saw spirits revenue rise by 4%, giving a £124m boost to the Treasury. And a freeze in 2016 led to a revenue increase of more than 7%, pouring an additional £229m into the chancellor’s coffers."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"global-development/2017/oct/13/tunisia-battle-to-keep-desert-at-bay-acacias-for-all","type":"article","sectionId":"global-development","sectionName":"Global development","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-13T11:11:52Z","webTitle":"'If the land isn't worked, it decays': Tunisia's battle to keep the desert at bay","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2017/oct/13/tunisia-battle-to-keep-desert-at-bay-acacias-for-all","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2017/oct/13/tunisia-battle-to-keep-desert-at-bay-acacias-for-all","fields":{"headline":"'If the land isn't worked, it decays': Tunisia's battle to keep the desert at bay","bodyText":"The dusty Peugeot rumbles along the road, parallel to the ancient aqueduct that once delivered water from the springs of Zaghouan in Tunisia’s Dorsal mountains to ancient Carthage, about 57km north. However, the waters around Zaghouan have long run dry and, if action is not taken soon, so might much of the land around it. It is not just Zaghouan. “Ninety-five per cent of the [arable] land is in the process of desertification,” explains Sarah Toumi, president and founder of Acacias for All, a social enterprise aimed at checking the descent of Tunisia’s countryside into arid desert. “There is less than 1% of fertile organic material left in the soil, meaning it’s really poor and can easily become desert. By 2030, it will all become a desert if we do nothing.” Desertification is not exclusive to Tunisia. According to the International Fund for Agriculture Development, no continent, excluding Antarctica, is immune from the combined effects of intensive modern farming, dwindling fresh water supplies and rising temperatures, all of which can reduce fertile soil to desert. However, Africa, containing 37% of the world’s arid zones, and Asia, with 33%, are at acute risk. For post-revolutionary Tunisia, racked by social tension, high unemployment and an underperforming economy, the agricultural sector is vital, accounting for 14% of the country’s GDP and employing 20% of its workforce. Within Tunisia, desertification assumes different forms, ranging from the gradual encroachment of the Sahara from the country’s south, to the depletion of the land’s natural resources through over-farming in its north. On each front, Acacias for All is part of the pushback, helping local women form agricultural collectives that will allow them to plant new crops, such as the pea-like acacias that give the social enterprise its name. For Toumi, who shares French and Tunisian nationality, the personal preceded the national. Six years ago, when she saw her grandparents’ date farm near the coastal city of Sfax succumbing to the effects of desertification, she fell back on the experience gained from her networking with environmental students in Paris. “In the beginning no one believed in me, except a few of the women. So, I started a crowdfunding campaign that raised €3,000 (£2,670). I used this to create a nursery to grow the acacia trees, which the women then agreed to plant.” Now, in addition to growing acacias, Toumi’s team is involved in promoting a return to Tunisia’s environmentally neutral indigenous rose crop, as well as orchestrating the production of other crops including moringa, olives, almonds. None of the new crops need artificial fertilisers and all, when fermented and mulched after harvesting, will help renew the soil that bore them. Acacias for All now has about 300 farmers across Tunisia participating in schemes that will help reverse the degradation of the soil that once provided imperial Rome with much of its bread basket. For the women participating in Acacias for All’s work, the proposition is simple. In return for planting the new crops, the social enterprise will provide the trees, the training to grow and harvest them, and guarantee that whatever is produced will be sold in the shops with which Toumi and her five-strong team have negotiated contracts. Once established, the cooperative structure allows the women to buy further crops, the equipment to farm them and, critically, gain the financial independence that comes from participating in a successful business. In Zaghouan, Nejia Ben Zeid, a retired vet, is president of Acacias for All’s local cooperative and the owner of about 1,300 olive trees near El Fahs, a few miles outside Zaghouan. Acacias for All’s presence in the area is largely down to Ben Zeid, who, after hearing Toumi speak at an agricultural conference, pursued her till she agreed to visit the region. “I liked the innovative approach of Acacias for All and the idea of introducing new crops that don’t need a lot of water,” Ben Zeid explained through an interpreter. “The idea of a contract was also appealing. I liked the idea that I would get a fixed price for whatever I grew. This is true for everyone in the cooperative.” In the olive groves of El Fahs, Ben Zeid, Toumi and her team are joined by another farmer, Naima Jabali. As the storm clouds gather ominously, they inspect the small, weed-like patches of emerging moringa that had been planted in August as a test. In time, they hope the moringa will thrive in the long gaps between the olive trees, its roots anchoring the topsoil against the winds that blow through the area. Jabali’s farm is a few miles off. She is also taking part in the pilot programme. In the past, she explains, she handed over whatever she grew to her husband, so that he could sell it. Now it goes back into the cooperative. “I knew about desertification,” says Jabili. “If the land isn’t worked properly, it decays. We’re all farmers. We know this.” Named by Forbes as one of its “30 under 30” entrepreneurs in 2016, and recently appointed to the Presidential Council for Africa initiative by French president Emmanuel Macron, Toumi’s ambitions remain undimmed. “I want to plant a million trees by 2018. The environment brings everything together – the economy, agriculture and women’s rights. It’s all there.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2017/oct/11/australia-retain-constellation-cup-with-victory-over-new-zealand","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-11T10:35:41Z","webTitle":"Australia retain Constellation Cup with victory over New Zealand","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/oct/11/australia-retain-constellation-cup-with-victory-over-new-zealand","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/oct/11/australia-retain-constellation-cup-with-victory-over-new-zealand","fields":{"headline":"Australia retain Constellation Cup with victory over New Zealand","bodyText":"Order has been restored. After an embarrassing 10-goal loss to arch-rivals New Zealand in the Quad Series last month that sparked a rare period of turmoil in Australian netball, the Diamonds on Wednesday retained the Constellation Cup with a 55-43 win over the Silver Ferns in the third Test in Adelaide. The netball world is back on its axis. Having already won the first two legs of the four-match series in New Zealand, the Diamonds’ hard-fought 12-goal win at Adelaide Arena in front of 5,000 fans secured the trans-Tasman trophy for the fifth straight year for the Australians. It also made the Diamonds favourites for Commonwealth gold early next year. A strong performance from towering captain Caitlin Bassett for three quarters, coupled with the Diamonds’ uncompromising defence, set up the win. Diamonds coach Lisa Alexander stuck with the same attacking combination as the first two Tests, pairing 193cm West Australian Bassett at shooter with comeback queen Susan Pettitt – who had a standout year for the Giants in Super Netball to be recalled to national duties after a while in the wilderness. Twenty-three-old Liz Watson, in just her 11th game for her country, again got the nod at wing attack. The Vixens’ powerful performance and growing connection with Bassett will make Madi Robinson, dropped after the Quad Series for poor form, nervous ahead of the Commonwealth Games. Robinson’s Collingwood team-mate, Kim Ravaillion continued her strong form, playing centre until three-quarter time and Gabi Simpson – who was vocal about the squad’s performance in the Invercargill loss – was strong and vocal at wing defence. Pie April Brandley and her former West Coast Fever team-mate, Courtney Bruce – with just 21 Tests between – partnered in defence and were able to shut down shooters Maria Tutaia and Bailey Mes, forcing changes in the Kiwi circle. While the Kiwis started with purpose, it was a scrappy first quarter, with turnovers galore, ill-timed passes and dropped balls, including two by Brandley, coming out of defence. Bassett carried the shooting load, putting in 10 from 12 attempts, getting great service from Watson. Kiwi goal shooter Mes was 5/5 and Tutaia missed three to finish with 5/8. The low-scoring quarter finished 12-10 the Diamonds’ way. With Pettitt well and truly shut down by Ferns’ captain Katrina Grant in the first, she was replaced at goal attack in the second by Steph Wood. Three quick goals from Bassett signalled the dominance that was to come in the second quarter from the Diamonds. As the Ferns’ intensity dropped, the Australian goals kept coming, with Bassett hitting 13/13. Wood chipped in 5/9 and did a power of work outside the circle too. Ferns’ coach Janine Southby knew she had to swing the changes and did, switching Mes for Te Paea Selby-Rickit at shooter, Temalisi Fakahokotau for Kelly Jury at the other end and re-shuffling her midcourt, bringing Kayla Cullen to wing defence, who had an immediate impact with a few turnovers. Bassett had it all her own way in the second, to bring her tally to 23/25 for the half. Australia’s lead got out to as many 14 goals with just over two minutes to go, but the half finished 30/19. Southby’s changes had the desired effect in the third, with things clicking into gear, surprisingly, with their star shooter Tutaia off the court. Mes and Selby-Rickit started creating space for each other. Mes shot 8/9, Selby-Rickit 7/8. Bassett was quiet, but accurate with 6/6. Jo Weston replaced Brandley at goal defence with a few minutes to go and had a deflection to her name in seconds. With little runs of goals, the Ferns pulled the margin back to just four at three-quarter time, 38-34. They had the momentum heading into the break. Two Victorians took the court for the Diamonds in the last, with Kate Moloney making her international debut at centre and Pie spearhead Caitlin Thwaites replacing Bassett at shooter. They both made their presence felt, Moloney through her tenacity for the ball and Thwaites via accurate shooting from the get-go. With a run of six straight Thwaites goals, the Diamonds wrested back control and the Ferns looked done. The Ferns again shuffled the deck, bringing Tutaia back on, to shooter this time, putting Cullen into centre, Jury back to keeper and Grant to wing defence. But it was all for nothing, as the Diamonds pulled away, winning 55-43. Thwaites finished with 10/13 and Wood had a clean sheet in the last, 7/7 to finish with 14/18 for the match. The last match of the series, now a dead rubber, will be played in Sydney on Saturday night."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"film/2017/oct/11/actor-terry-crews-sexually-assaulted-by-hollywood-executive","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-11T13:46:25Z","webTitle":"Actor Terry Crews: I was sexually assaulted by Hollywood executive","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/oct/11/actor-terry-crews-sexually-assaulted-by-hollywood-executive","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2017/oct/11/actor-terry-crews-sexually-assaulted-by-hollywood-executive","fields":{"headline":"Actor Terry Crews: I was sexually assaulted by Hollywood executive","bodyText":"Actor and former NFL star Terry Crews has claimed he was the victim of a sexual assault by a “high-level Hollywood executive”, but did not retaliate or speak out over the incident for fear of being ostracised or sent to jail. Crews, who played for teams including the Los Angeles Rams, the San Diego Chargers and the Washington Redskins and appears in the sitcom Brooklyn Nine-Nine, recounted the incident via a series of tweets. The 49-year-old said he was prompted to share his story in the wake of the ongoing Harvey Weinstein scandal. “This whole thing with Harvey Weinstein is giving me PTSD. Why? Because this kind of thing happened to ME,” he wrote. Film producer Weinstein has been accused of sexual assault or harassment by multiple women, including Asia Argento, Gwyneth Paltrow and Angelina Jolie. Weinstein denies some of the allegations and says all his relationships were “consensual”. Crews described how, at an industry function in 2016, an unnamed male executive groped his genitals in front of his wife and “grinned like a jerk” at the pair’s shocked response. He said that he was tempted to retaliate, but was worried how the incident would be reported and feared he would go to jail. “‘240 lbs. Black Man stomps out Hollywood Honcho’ would be the headline the next day,” he wrote. Crews said the executive later called to apologise, but did not give a reason for his actions. Crews chose not to publicise the incident for fear of being ostracised. “Par [for] the course when the predator has power [and] influence”, he wrote. The actor said his experience had helped him “understand and empathize with those who have remained silent”. “But Harvey Weinstein is not the only perpetrator,” he added. Crews also expressed hope that, by making his experience public, he would “deter a predator and encourage someone who feels hopeless”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"environment/2017/oct/11/fukushima-evacuee-un-japan-human-rights","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-11T10:27:04Z","webTitle":"Fukushima evacuee to tell UN that Japan violated human rights","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/oct/11/fukushima-evacuee-un-japan-human-rights","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/oct/11/fukushima-evacuee-un-japan-human-rights","fields":{"headline":"Fukushima evacuee to tell UN that Japan violated human rights","bodyText":"A nuclear evacuee from Fukushima will claim Japan’s government has violated the human rights of people who fled their homes after the 2011 nuclear disaster, in testimony before the UN in Geneva this week. Mitsuko Sonoda, who voluntarily left her village with her husband and their 10-year-old son days after three reactors at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant went into meltdown, will tell the UN human rights council that evacuees face financial hardship and are being forced to return to neighbourhoods they believe are still unsafe almost seven years after the disaster. “We feel abandoned by the Japanese government and society,” Sonoda, who will speak at the council’s pre-session review of Japan on Thursday, told the Guardian. An estimated 27,000 evacuees who, like Sonoda, were living outside the mandatory evacuation zone when the meltdown occurred, had their housing assistance withdrawn this March, forcing some to consider returning to their former homes despite concerns over radiation levels. In addition, as the government attempts to rebuild the Fukushima region by reopening decontaminated neighbourhoods that were once no-go areas, tens of thousands of evacuees who were ordered to leave will lose compensation payments and housing assistance in March next year. The denial of financial aid has left many evacuees facing a near-impossible choice: move back to homes they fear are unsafe, or face more financial hardship as they struggle to build lives elsewhere without state help. “People should be allowed to choose whether or not to go back to their old homes, and be given the financial means to make that choice,” said Kendra Ulrich, senior global energy campaigner for Greenpeace Japan. “If they are being put under economic pressure to return, then they are not in a position to make an informed decision. This UN session is about pressuring the Japanese government to do the right thing.” Evacuees are being encouraged to return to villages and towns near the Fukushima plant despite evidence that some still contain radiation “hot spots”. In Iitate village, where the evacuation order was lifted this March, much of the surrounding forests remain highly radioactive, although homes, schools and other public buildings have been declared safe as part of an unprecedented decontamination effort. “You could call places like Iitate an open-air prison,” said Ulrich. “The impact on people’s quality of life will be severe if they move back. Their lives are embedded in forests, yet the environment means they will not be allowed to enter them. Forests are impossible to decontaminate.” After months of moving around, Sonoda and her family settled in Kyoto for two years, where local authorities provided them with a rent-free apartment. They have been living in her husband’s native England for the past four years. “We’ve effectively had to evacuate twice,” said Sonoda, who works as a freelance translator and Japanese calligraphy tutor. “My son and I really struggled at first … we didn’t want to leave Japan.” Concern over food safety and internal radiation exposure convinced her that she could never return to Fukushima, aside from making short visits to see relatives. “It’s really sad, because my village is such a beautiful place,” she said. “We had a house and had planned to retire there.” The evacuations have forced families to live apart, while parents struggle to earn enough money to fund their new accommodation and keep up mortgage payments on their abandoned homes. “Stopping housing support earlier this year was an act of cruelty,” Sonoda said. “Some of my friends had to go back to Fukushima even though they didn’t want to.” Greenpeace Japan, which is assisting Sonoda, hopes her testimony will be the first step in building international pressure on Japan’s government to continue offering financial help to evacuees and to reconsider its resettlement plan. It has called on the government to declare Fukushima neighbourhoods unsafe until atmospheric radiation is brought to below one millisievert (mSv) a year, the maximum public exposure limit recommended by the International Commission on Radiological Protection. While 1 mSv a year remains the government’s long-term target, it is encouraging people to return to areas where radiation levels are below 20 mSv a year, an annual exposure limit that, internationally, applies to nuclear power plant workers. “Why should people, especially women and children, have to live in places where the radiation level is 20 times the international limit?” Sonoda said. “The government hasn’t given us an answer.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2017/oct/11/lady-antebellum-review-o2-arena-london","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-11T11:52:01Z","webTitle":"Lady Antebellum review – country superstars are cosy but cloying","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/oct/11/lady-antebellum-review-o2-arena-london","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2017/oct/11/lady-antebellum-review-o2-arena-london","fields":{"headline":"Lady Antebellum review – country superstars are cosy but cloying","bodyText":"‘I’m the happiest person in the world right now,” says Dave Haywood, one-third of country superstars Lady Antebellum. “It’s the last night of the tour and we’re in London playing the O2!” Haywood is right to marvel. Despite having sold more than 18m records back home in the US and garnering seven Grammy awards, here in Britain “Lady A” have yet to score a No 1 album and their highest placed single, 2010’s Need You Now, reached only No 15. But as the ever-expending Country to Country festival – held annually at this venue – has proved, the once-maligned genre is growing in popularity on this side of the Atlantic, and Lady Antebellum are a big reason why. Their unashamedly MOR blend of country, pop and rock has seduced a young audience lured by Taylor Swift’s crossover success, and the Nashville trio are welcomed like conquering heroes. Easing into the jaunty Downtown, vocalists Hillary Scott and Charles Kelley are resplendent in blood red – leopard print and lumberjack-plaid respectively – and look as thrilled as Haywood to be here. “It’s gonna be tough getting me off the stage tonight,” Kelley admits, his rough-hewn, everyman voice playing against Scott’s plaintive but powerful innocence as they glide through Our Kind of Love and emote over Dancin’ Away With My Heart. Their slick, sentimental brand of country has taken a soulful turn with latest album Heart Break and the horn stamps of You Look Good add a sultry punch to the cloying niceness. But Lady Antebellum’s overzealous band – featuring two guitarists and a keyboardist – too often ride roughshod over the three-piece harmonies at the heart of their success, and it’s a relief when only Scott, Kelley, and Haywood on piano team up for the stripped-down Hurt. Support acts Kelsea Ballerini and Brett Young guest on a cover of Shania Twain’s You’re Still the One. It’s all very cosy as Kelley repeatedly coos over pregnant Scott and she watches like an indulgent mother while he strides into the crowd during Love Don’t Live Here. But the scant recognition of the recent Las Vegas massacre is offhand and, in the light of that tragedy, the decision to play Good Time to Be Alive seems questionable. Paying tribute to Tom Petty with Learning to Fly, Kelley acknowledges Petty’s initial success came in the UK. “You made Tom Petty cool,” he says. The same can’t be said for Lady Antebellum, but they deserve the affection they’ve palpably won."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"stage/2017/oct/11/young-frankenstein-review-mel-brooks-horror-spoof-musical","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-11T09:53:16Z","webTitle":"Young Frankenstein review – glorious gags as Mel Brooks bolts together a monster hit","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/oct/11/young-frankenstein-review-mel-brooks-horror-spoof-musical","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2017/oct/11/young-frankenstein-review-mel-brooks-horror-spoof-musical","fields":{"headline":"Young Frankenstein review – glorious gags as Mel Brooks bolts together a monster hit","bodyText":"Mel Brooks recently predicted how London critics would react to this musical version of his 1974 horror-movie spoof: “They’ll say it’s good but it’s not as great as The Producers.” Well for this critic it’s every bit as good as, if not better than, its predecessor in that it piles on the gags even more relentlessly and wittily parodies musicals past and present. It offers an evening of gloriously impure fun. The book, by Brooks himself and the late Thomas Meehan, sticks closely to the format of the movie. Frederick Frankenstein is an American professor of neurology lured back to Transylvania to sell off his grandfather’s rambling Gothic pile. Once he arrives, several things tempt him to stay. One is the brio of his yodelling assistant, Inga, who in the course of a wagon-ride to the castle reveals a remarkable capacity to fork hay (“I’m a very hard forker,” she announces). Even more tempting is the prospect of repeating his grandfather’s experiment of reanimating dead tissue and implanting a new brain in the body of a giant corpse. Thus is the Monster reborn. The musical is, in part, a send-up of the original 1931 James Whale Frankenstein movie. It is even more, however, a love letter to the rackety world of American vaudeville. Frederick and his dorsally-challenged sidekick, Igor, launch into a front-cloth dance-routine at first sight. This is also a world where there are no pathetic phalluses – recalling the athletic prowess of Frederick’s grandfather, his ex-lover claims: “He won the three-legged race all by himself.” Best of all is a sequence where the Monster seeks refuge with a blind hermit who serves him warm soup, hot noodles and wine with staggeringly ill-directed aim: it is a variation on the trembling-waiter gag last seen in One Man, Two Guvnors and just as funny. Like The Producers, the show puts a bonfire under the accepted canons of good taste. But, as both composer and lyricist, Brooks offers a sophisticated pastiche of stock musical forms. Lesley Joseph, as the superannuated lover of the original doctor, launches into a song, He Vas My Boyfriend, that instantly evokes Cabaret, even down to the way she nonchalantly drags a chair behind her. When Frederick’s discarded fiancee sings Deep Love we hear the plangent refrains of a Lloyd Webber number being mocked. In a sequence that is almost as outrageous as Springtime for Hitler, the transmogrified Monster leads a tap-dancing chorus in Puttin’ on the Ritz. Susan Stroman, as director and choreographer, orchestrates the extravaganza perfectly and Beowulf Boritt’s designs have just the right antiquarian oddity. The cast is also good enough to banish memories of the movie prototypes. Hadley Fraser as Frederick avoids crazed-scientist shtick to give us a credible portrait of a prof driven by the lust for experiments and experiments with lust. Ross Noble is both funny and touching as the faithful Igor, Summer Strallen lights up the stage as the incandescent Inga, Dianne Pilkington is suitably arch as Frederick’s untouchable fiancee and Shuler Hensley, the sole survivor of the original 2007 Broadway production, as the Monster inescapably gains our sympathy. This may not be a show for sensitive souls whose idea of a jolly evening is sitting at home reading Walter Pater. For the rest of us, who cherish popular theatre’s roots in laughter and song, it offers two-and-a-half hours of time-suspending pleasure and shows that the 91-year-old Brooks, present on the first night, remains a bawdily parodic Peter Pan.

Here’s Ed Miliband responding satirically to a tweet about the story. Grenfell Tower fire survivors whose immigration status was uncertain are to be given the chance to become permanent residents of Britain, the government has announced. As the Press Association reports, a one-year immigration amnesty was initially granted for foreign national survivors of the June 14 inferno and they have now been given a route to permanent residence. Immigration minister Brandon Lewis said in a written ministerial statement that the 12 months’ limited leave, granted to eligible individuals who come forward by November 30, will now be extendable and lead to a permanent right to remain in the UK after five years, subject to meeting security, criminality and fraud checks. Two leading Conservative ex-ministers from the remain and leave sides of the EU debate, Nicky Morgan and Tim Loughton, will push the government to commit to allowing refugee children to reunite with their families under post-Brexit immigration law. That’s all from me for today. Thanks for the comments. According to the BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg, Philip Hammond’s Times’s article about not spending money now preparing for a “no deal” Brexit, and Theresa May’s apparent rebuke to him at PMQs (see 2.22pm), originated with a row at cabinet yesterday. In an interesting blog she says: Two different cabinet sources say [Hammond’s] comments today come on top of a row at cabinet yesterday over precisely this issue, an exchange described as “robust”. Number 10 acknowledges that there was a brief discussion of the preparation for the “no deal” scenario, although they deny (as they would) that there was anything like a ding-dong. But one of the cabinet sources suggests Mr Hammond’s behaviour is either “deliberate and divisive or politically stupid”. But it led today to what Brexiteers are claiming was a “deliberate slapdown” of the chancellor by Theresa May at Prime Minister’s Questions, when she made plain that money would be forthcoming for “no deal” planning as and when it was necessary, striking a rather different tone to the chancellor’s “very last moment”, comments. In an interview with Emma Barnett on Radio 5 Live Nick Clegg, the former Lib Dem leader and former deputy prime minister, said he was surprised by Theresa May’s refusal on LBC last night to answer the question about how she would vote in an EU referendum now. Clegg said: I was a bit surprised. I thought she was going to say, ‘Yes, I voted remain then, but now I’m wholeheartedly for - ’, so on and so forth … That’s what I would have expected her to do ... If you’re negotiating with someone, it’s very important that you negotiate with people who you think in their heart of hearts really believe what they’re doing. It’s not a very good way of negotiating for a team, if the captain of the team doesn’t seem to be particularly persuaded that they want to stick the ball in the other net. In the comments BTL BareNakedSciolist points out that the @CLPNominations Twitter account has some interesting figures on nominations for the Scottish Labour leadership contest. A hard border could be created around Northern Ireland after Brexit even if the UK initially agrees a soft border with the EU, MPs have been told. As the Press Association reports, Paul Mac Flynn, a senior economist for the Nevin Economic Research Institute, gave the assessment during a hearing of expert witnesses by a committee in Westminster about the impact of Brexit on the Irish border. Mac Flynn raised concerns about proposals previously outlined by the UK that only large businesses rather than small or medium ones could be required to register their imports and exports along a post-Brexit border, saying people could find ways to get around such rules. He told MPs: I think the danger is, we could start out with a soft border and end up with a hard border. Like the exemption for small and medium sized enterprises. The idea was first that they were going to say that for 6% to 8% of heavy goods vehicles. If you’re somebody who is going to want to get around a tariff border, all that says to you is – right, don’t use trucks, use vans. Then we start checking vans, so we say we’ll start using estate cars. Before you know it, we’re checking everyone. I think it has to come down to this - if you’re leaving the customs union, that has an implication for what the border in Northern Ireland is going to look like. Say that one is being sacrificed to the other, but at least be honest about it. This is from the BBC’s Adam Fleming. The Scottish government has today published a 32-page report (pdf) setting out what business thinks about Brexit. It seems a relatively thin document, but in its press release the Scottish government says it shows that “business leaders across Scotland believe Brexit may hinder recruitment, hit the bottom line, and curtail future growth prospects”. Jeremy Corbyn has called on Theresa May to rethink the troubled new universal credit system and abolish charges for its helpline, which costs frustrated claimants up to 55p a minute to call from a mobile phone. May has dismissed suggestions that the government is not willing to spend money preparing for the possibility of a “no deal” Brexit, which seemed like a mild rebuke to Philip Hammond, the chancellor. In a Times article Hammond, the chancellor and the leading figure in the cabinet seeking to soften Brexit, said the Treasury would only spend money preparing for this “when it’s responsible to do so”. His intervention was intended as a slapdown to Tories saying the government should start spending money preparing for a hard Brexit now (see 9.12am), but in evidence to the Treasury committee this morning he claimed that his words had been over-interpreted by journalists. (See 9.56am.) At PMQs Iain Duncan Smith, a leading Tory Brexiter, asked May to confirm that money would be allocated “as and when required” to prepare for a “no deal” Brexit. In response May said: I’m very happy to give my right honourable friend that confirmation. We are preparing for every eventuality. We are committing money to prepare for Brexit, including a no-deal scenario. May also said the Treasury had already committed to giving more than £250m of new money to government departments in this financial year to help them prepare for Brexit. This was welcomed by Suella Fernandes, chair of the European Research Group, the Tory faction pushing for a hard Brexit (or “clean” Brexit, as they prefer to call it.) May has ruled out trying to extend the Brexit talks. In response to a question from the Conservative MP Peter Bone, she confirmed that the article 50 rules did allow the two-year Brexit timetable to be extended. But she went on: I’ve been very clear. We want those negotiations to end - not just the negotiations to end, we want to have an agreement on the future relationship, and our withdrawal – by March 2019, and we will leave the EU on March 2019. May has hinted that the UK could continue to participate in the common fisheries policy during the Brexit transition. In response to a question at PMQs from the Lib Dem MP Alistair Carmichael about whether the UK would remain in the CFP during the transition, she said: When we have left the European Union, we will be leaving the common fisheries policy. As part of the agreement that we need to enter into for the implementation period, obviously this and other issues will be part of that agreement. But when we leave the European Union, we will leave the common fisheries policy. This is similar to the language May uses about the single market; she says that although the UK will technically leave in March 2019, she envisages a transition period during which the UK will continue to participate in the single market on much the same terms as now. Liz Truss, the chief secretary to the Treasury, has claimed that she has changed her mind about Brexit and would now vote to leave the EU. Theresa May yesterday refused to say how she would vote in a new referendum. But when Truss was asked the same question on the Daily Politics, she replied: All of us had to make a judgment on what we thought the future would look like. I made a judgment thinking it would be bad for the economy. Since we have left, it has been more positive, so the facts have changed and I have changed my mind. Jeremy Hunt, the health secretary, also recently said he had changed from backing remain to backing leave because the gloomy economic predictions about Brexit had failed to materialise. Philip Hammond has called for a rapid response from the EU27 to the prime minister’s offer of a transition deal, and even warned that there could be no air traffic between the UK and the EU if no exit deal of any kind could be agreed. Hammond has said the government will not “automatically step in” to help out councils, which say they are struggling to fund fire safety measures on tower blocks. Addressing the Treasury committee, he said protected funding in local authority budgets could be freed up to allow the work to be paid for instead. As the Press Association reports, only in the “last resort” would Whitehall hand over cash to pay for the work, Hammond said. He told MPs: Any safety-critical work that is required needs to be carried out. We will not allow a situation to arise where a housing authority or a social landlord, due to lack of financial resource, cannot carry out safety-critical work. That does not mean the government will automatically step in and provide funding for that safety-critical work. The number of Romanians and Bulgarians living in Britain has risen by nearly 80% from 230,000 in 2014 to 413,000 last year, according to the Office for National Statistics. This is what political journalists and commentators are saying about PMQs on Twitter. Generally Corbyn is seen as the winner, although that’s not the universal view. From the Daily Mirror’s Jason Beattie From ITV’s Paul Brand From Politico’s Tom McTague From the BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg From the New Statesman’s George Eaton From Sky’s Beth Rigby From HuffPost’s Owen Bennett From the Independent’s John Rentoul From Sky’s Faisal Islam From the Sun’s Tom Newton Dunn From the Evening Standard’s Kate Proctor From the Mail on Sunday’s Dan Hodges Jeremy Corbyn’s spokesman won’t answer the question about how he would vote in an EU referendum now, the FT’s Jim Pickard reports. Jeremy Corbyn’s best question at PMQs was about the 55p-a-minute call for the universal credit helpline – although, having asked once and not got a reply, he did not pursue it, which limited the effectiveness of the question. On the Daily Politics Andrew Neil has just shown what could have been achieved by pursuing this. He asked Liz Truss, the chief secretary to the Treasury, a series of questions about this, and left her squirming. The 55p-a-minute charge applies to mobile calls. Truss said she would advise people to go to a jobcentre if they had a query about universal credit. But when Neil put it to her that many people had to ring because they did not have time for a personal visit, and that increasingly people have to use mobiles because they don’t have landlines, Truss had no answer. As usual, I missed the questions from the SNP leader at Westminster, Ian Blackford, because I was writing up the snap verdict. So here they are. Blackford started by asking May why she could not say whether she would vote leave or remain in an EU referendum now in her LBC phone-in yesterday. He asked: Why hasn’t the prime minister been straightforward about how she would vote? May said there was no second referendum. There is no second referendum. The people of the UK voted and we will be leaving the EU in March 2019. Blackford asked again about Brexit. She’s hamstrung by the parliamentary majority and a divided party of rightwing Brexiteers ... This morning Philip Hammond admitted a ‘cloud of uncertainty’ is hanging over the British economy ... Will the prime minister come off the fence and recognise if we’re to save this economy we need to stay in the single market and the customs union. May said the SNP should recognise that to save jobs in Scotland, it should stay in the UK. I’ve taken the quotes from PoliticsHome. Hywel Williams, the Plaid Cymru MP, asks about the NHS in Wales. He quotes someone moving to England to get the care he needed. May says people are moving to England because care is better there than in Labour-run Wales. And that’s it. May say free schools have contributed a great deal to education generally. But they have done more than that. In her constituency there is a free school for children with autism. That was not available before, she says. Labour’s Vicky Foxcroft says a woman came to her office fleeing domestic violence. She could not find a place in a refuge because of cuts. What advice would May offer? May says she does not want to see any woman not being able to get support. More money has been put into the refuge system. Antoinette Sandbach, a Conservative, asks about support for parents who have lost a baby. May says there was a debate on this in the Commons. She pays tribute to those who spoke movingly on this. Labour’s Jim McMahon asks about a six-year-old from his constituency who died from meningitis. Will May meet with campaigners to discuss extending the vaccination programme? May says the government does need to raise awareness of this. This is not just an issue for parents; it is for healthcare professions too. She will ask the health secretary to meet the campaigners. Peter Bone, a Conservative, says article 50 allows the Brexit talks to be extended. Will the government rule this out? May says Bone is right about article 50 allowing the talks to be extended. But the government wants a deal by March 2019. The UK will leave then, she says. May rules out extending the Brexit deadline. The Lib Dem Alistair Carmichael asks if the UK will stay in the common fisheries policy during the Brexit transition. May says the UK will leave the CFP when it leaves the EU. But what happens to fishing during the transition needs to be negotiated. Wendy Morton, a Conservative, says she was shocked to hear the shadow chancellor predicting a run on the pound. Wouldn’t letting him into the Treasury be the biggest risk for this country? May agrees. A run on the pound would make Britain poorer. Corbyn asked what planet she was on. We all know what planet his is on, May says: planet Venezuela. Labour’s Kerry McCarthy asks about the deaths of students from meningitis. Will the government do more to extend awareness about this and to encourage more vaccination of teenagers. May says McCarthy has raised an important point. Gary Streeter, a Conservative, says the Royal Marines have served the country with distinction for many years. Plans to downsize it are concerning, he says. May says the government is looking at how threats are changing. She says the claims Streeter is referring to are “pure speculation”. Labour’s Heidi Alexander says May has been ramping up the no- deal rhetoric on Brexit. That is because she is afraid of the most rightwing, rabid elements in her party. When businesses are considering moving jobs, don’t the British people deserve better “than a prime minister running scared”. May shakes her head during this. Then she says Alexander “could not be more wrong”. She says the government is planning for a deal. She set out her ideas in the Florence speech. After Brexit, the UK will no longer be members of the single market and the customs union, she says. Iain Duncan Smith, the Conservative former cabinet minister, asks for an assurance that all money necessary will be committed to planning for the possibility of a “no deal” Brexit. May says, where money has to be spent, it will be spent. She says £250m has already been given to departments to help them prepare for Brexit. May says she wants EU citizens to stay in the UK. If there is no deal with the EU, the government will have to make arrangements with other countries, not just about their citizens here, but about Britons in their countries. She says the UK and the EU are “very close” to a deal on this point. PMQs - Snap verdict: More often than not these days PMQs feels like a draw, and today was no exception. Corbyn chose a topic on which the government is exceptionally vulnerable, and his questions were good and emotive, but he never asked anything specific enough to unsettle May, and she did a reasonably competent job of brushing it all aside with a broad-brush defence of welfare reform. (Although this did prompt one of the best retorts from Corbyn; not for the first time, he was effective defending the record of the last Labour government.) Both leaders saved their TV soundbites until the end, and at this point Corbyn threw in a rather casual call for May to stand down. (If the leader of the opposition is saying the PM should resign, you would normally expect them to make a bigger deal of this.). May responded with a pre-cooked but better-than-usual generalised broadside about the Labour conference. Corbyn says the last Labour government lifted 1 million children out of poverty. Absurdly the UC helpline cost claimants 55p a minute. Will May at least make the helpline free? May says she will continue to look at this. She wants people to be able to find jobs. That is why the government is helping firms create jobs. Corbyn says UC is only one of a string of failures of this government. “Everywhere you look, it is a government in chaos.” He mentions Brexit, Bombardier, young people and social care. The government is more interested in fighting among itself than in solving these problems. If a prime minister can’t lead, shouldn’t she leave? May says the deficit is down by two-thirds, 3 million more people are in jobs, more people are getting education, record levels of funding are going into schools and health. What did we see from Labour at their conference? Shelter said Labour’s housing policy would end up harming people on low incomes. Labour’s Haringey council rejected another Labour policy. The Equalities and Human Rights Commission said Labour had to prove its commitment to equality. And the Labour leader of Brighton council said the party might not be welcome back unless it showed its commitment to tackling antisemitism. Corbyn quotes the experience of one housing association. John Major said the way it operated was unfair and unforgiving. If Major can understand that, why can’t May? May says some research shows that, after four months, the number of people in rent arrears on UC has fallen by a third. More people on UC are getting jobs than under jobseeker’s allowance. According to Corbyn, the IPPR and the Child Poverty Action Group say it will put more children into poverty. Tory MPs have called for the roll-out to be delayed. He quotes from “Georgina”, who was left all summer with no money. She relied on her family. He tells May to pause UC, because it drives up debt, poverty and homelessness. May offers to look at this case. It is possible for those in need to get advance payments. The number of people getting them has gone up from 30% to 50%. Under Labour 1.4 million people spent most of the last decade trapped on out-of-work benefits. The number of households where no one had worked more than doubled. The welfare bill went up by 60% in real terms. That was a failing system. Jeremy Corbyn starts by paying tribute to Rodney Bickerstaffe, the former Nupe leader, who died last week. He did more than anything to introduce the minimum wage. He asks about universal credit. May says it is worth remembering why it was introduced. We want a welfare system that provides a safety net and helps people into work. Labour’s system did not do that. It was too complicated. Some people were better off on benefits. UC is simpler, and makes sure work always pays. Corbyn says he wonders what planet May is on. Citizens Advice describes UC as “a disaster waiting to happen”. Housing associations says evictions from non-payment of rent are up 50% as a result of UC. May says the government has been listening to concerns that have been raised. Changes have been made. Now more than 80% of people are getting their first payments on time. The department continues to monitor this. But we need a system that ensures work pays. Bob Neill, a Conservative, says financial services firms warmly support May’s pragmatic approach to Brexit. Will May consider publishing a white paper on this? May says that is what she set out in her Florence speech. More papers may be published, she says. Labour’s Ian Mearns says yesterday was world mental health day. But only £1 of every £8 spent by clinical commissioning groups goes on mental health. Theresa May says the government has given mental health parity of esteem. More money is being spent on this. But more must be done. For example, the government is ensuring there is more training on this in schools. PMQs is about to start. Philip Hammond has finished. After that hearing, you can see why the government were so keen to delay the establishment of select committees. Here are the main points from his evidence. Hammond said the UK had to prepare for the possibility of a “bad-tempered breakdown” in relations with the EU. A “no deal” Brexit could be relatively friendly, he said, or it could involve acting in a very damaging way. He told MP: If it is a WTO regime with no deal, there are then two further potential levels that you have to consider. One is no deal, WTO, but a friendly agreement that we are not going to reach a deal but we will work together to cooperate to make things run as smoothly as possible. But, bluntly, we also have to consider the possibility of a bad-tempered breakdown in negotiations where we have non-cooperation, and, worst-case scenario, even a situation where people are not necessarily acting in their own economic self-interest. So we need to prepare for a wide range of scenarios. Hammond said that the very worst case scenario could involve the EU not even being able to share customs data with the UK. (See 11.05am.) He said the government was preparing for all eventualities. But he stressed that, if in the worst case scenario, the procedures in place at the border would not be ideal. Referring to this possibility he said: The commitment that we have made is that we will be ready with necessary minimum structures to operate the system on day one. Will everything we ever need be in place on day one? Definitely it won’t. He said there was a theoretical possibility that a “no deal” Brexit could lead to planes not being able to fly from the UK to the EU. But nobody seriously expected that to happen, he said. (See 9.59am.) He claimed that his Times article today (see 9.12am) had been misunderstood. He was not ruling out spending money on preparing for a “no deal” Brexit; he was just saying he did not think it was necessary to spend money now. We do have planning for all scenarios, including a ‘no deal’ scenario. I’m clear that we have to be prepared for a ‘no deal’ scenario unless and until we have clear evidence that that is not where we will end up. At the moment, although of course we hope for a different outcome, we cannot be certain of that different outcome. What I am not proposing to do is allocate funds to departments in advance of the need to spend ... Every pound we spend on contingent preparations for a hard customs border is a pound we can’t spend on the NHS, social care, education or deficit reduction. He said there was no need to spend money now preparing for a “no deal” Brexit just to show the EU that the UK is serious about this being an option because EU leaders already knew “we mean business”. (See 10.32am.) He said any money that did have to be spent on planning for a “no deal” Brexit would come from the reserves, not from departmental budgets. He said the government had no plans to publish Treasury assessments of the costs and benefits of various Brexit outcomes. He criticised the EU for not being willing to start negotiating the Brexit transition with the UK. We have set out I think a fair and generous proposal to the European Union. What we want to do now, we don’t want them to immediately jump up and say ‘We agree with everything you are proposing’. We simply want them to say, ‘Yes, let’s sit around the table and let’s look at the issues that we will need to debate in order to get into a future partnership agreement via a transitional or interim period.’ And in many areas, like future financial services frameworks, the only work that has been done so far has come from the UK. And We need our European partners to engage with us, look at our proposals, By all means challenge them and kick the tyres, but this is a shared problem and if we don’t talk about it, we are not going to get to a solution in a timescale that allows the future partnership that I do believe the vast majority of our European partners want to achieve. He claimed Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, and his team now accepted that the current framework for the talks - which prevents the transition and the future trade relationship being discussed until there has been progress on Ireland, EU citizens’ rights and money - was flawed. He said: We believe, and I think it is the case, that the EU 27 negotiating team also now believes, that the only way we will settle the so-called phase one issues is to set them in a broader context of the UK’s future relationship with the European Union. He said there should be “at least exploratory discussions” on transition arrangements and the future relationship now. He said delaying an agreement on a transition would be harmful. A transition was “a wasting asset”, he said. It has a value today, it will still have a very high value at Christmas and early in the New Year, but as we move through 2018 its value to everybody will diminish significantly. I think our European partners need to think very carefully about the need for speed in order to protect the potential value to all of us of having an interim period that protects our businesses and citizens and allows investment and normal business activity - contracting and so on - to carry on. He said uncertainty generated by Brexit was damaging the economy. I think it reflects the sense that, while the UK’s economy is fundamentally strong and in good shape, we are being affected by uncertainty around the negotiation process that we are engaged in. There is plenty of anecdotal evidence that businesses and consumers are waiting to see what the outcome is, or what the direction of travel is, before firming up investment decisions and consumption decisions. My general view is that our economy is fundamentally robust, we have some very positive things going for us, so a strong outlook for the future. But the cloud of uncertainty is acting as a temporary damper and we need to remove it as soon as possible by making progress with the negotiation process. Turning away from the Hammond hearing for a moment, John Bruton, the former Irish prime minister, has said a “no-deal” Brexit would be “devastating” for the peace process in Northern Ireland. He told Sky’s All Out Politcs: The effects in Ireland [of a “no deal” Brexit] would be devastating for the peace process. I spent a lot of my life building a reconciliation that enabled a peace process in Northern Ireland to be put in place. That’s going to be utterly disrupted by the barriers that will have to be imposed along the border if Britain leaves the European Union without a satisfactory deal. Hammond says the best-case assumption for what customs arrangements will be like after Brexit is what the government described as a “highly streamlined” customs arrangement in its position paper on this. This would give business much of the benefit of being in the customs union, he says. These are from the Times’ Sam Coates. Q: Could the UK not just carry on as now? Hammond says one option that the UK must prepare for is the possibility of the UK not being able to share data with the EU after Brexit. Hammond says one possibility is that a “no deal” Brexit could leave the EU and the UK unable to share data. Hammond says the UK cannot just allow truck to role through Dover containing dangerous goods or illegal immigrants. Hammond says the UK also has to consider the possibility of a bad-tempered breakdown, where the EU does not cooperate with the UK. It is possible that the people could act against their own interests. That is why the UK has to prepare for all eventualities. He says, if that were to happen, not everything would be ready on day one. He says the government can only know what it needs to put in place when it has a good idea of what the outcome will be. Hammond says government must consider possibility of a “bad-tempered breakdown” of relations with the EU. Hammond corrects what he says about 29 March 2019 being the first day of the transition. He meant 30 March 2019, he says. Perhaps someone pointed out this tweet from the Sun’s Tom Newton Dunn in response to what he said earlier. (See 10.32am.) Alison McGovern comes in on Ireland. Q: The government wants no physical structures at the border. But it also wants migration checks. Won’t they have to be at the border? Hammond says those controls won’t necessarily have to be at the border. Q: Won’t customs checks have to be at the border? Not necessarily, says Hammond. He says Ireland and the UK have different excise rules for items like tobacco. But they are no physical controls at the border. Q: So why have we not been able to resolve this issue? Hammond says we cannot get to a conclusion until we know what the context will be. If goods can move freely, through a streamlined customs process, that will give us our answer. According to the BBC’s Norman Smith, David Jones, the former Brexit minister, has said Philip Hammond should set aside billions in the budget for “no deal” Brexit contingency planning. Alister Jack, a Conservative, goes next. He asks about Ireland. Hammond says using numberplate recognition as part of the new customs regime would involve cameras. They would not necessarily have to be at the border. But people opposed to a border would object to them. (He is alluding to the prospect of Republican terrorists pulling them down, or blowing them up.) UPDATE: This is from Sky’s Beth Rigby. Labour’s Alison McGovern goes next. Q: Can you explain how financial services will be better off after Brexit? Hammond says you cannot say at this point without knowing what Brexit will look like. Q: Has the Treasury conducted an analysis of the costs and benefits of Brexit? Hammond says the Treasury had conducted many analyses. It depends what you mean by Brexit. Q: Do you disagree with the current structure of the Brexit talks. Hammond says this was imposed by the EU. The UK never thought it was ideal. He says the negotiators (he implies the EU negotiators) now recognise that we cannot reach an agreement on Ireland and the financial settlement until we know what the final deal will be like. Here is the start of the Press Association’s story about the opening of Philip Hammond’s evidence session. A “cloud of uncertainty” caused by Brexit is acting as a damper on the UK economy, the chancellor has said. Philip Hammond told the House of Commons Treasury committee that businesses and consumers were holding back on spending decisions until they see the outcome of Brexit talks in Brussels. Progress in negotiations needs to come “as soon as possible” to remove the drag on growth, he said. The chancellor’s comments came after the UK was the only major economy not to see its growth forecast upgraded in an International Monetary Fund (IMF) report, which predicted it would slow from 1.8% in 2016 to 1.7% this year and 1.5% in 2018. Giving evidence to the committee, Hammond confirmed that he was not ready to spend billions of pounds of taxpayers’ money now on preparing for a “no deal” departure from the EU. He said the IMF forecasts for the UK were unchanged since its last report in July, while many other economies saw their prospects improve. “I think it reflects the sense that, while the UK’s economy is fundamentally strong and in good shape, we are being affected by uncertainty around the negotiation process that we are engaged in,” said Hammond. “There is plenty of anecdotal evidence that businesses and consumers are waiting to see what the outcome is, or what the direction of travel is, before firming up investment decisions and consumption decisions. “My general view is that our economy is fundamentally robust, we have some very positive things going for us, so a strong outlook for the future. “But the cloud of uncertainty is acting as a temporary damper and we need to remove it as soon as possible by making progress with the negotiation process.” The Conservative Stephen Hammond goes next. Q: Would we do better to align ourselves with America or the EU on financial regulation? Hammond says there is a debate going on in the US at the moment about financial deregulation. If the US gets out of alignment with the EU, that will make things more difficult. He says the UK taxpayer learnt a hard lesson in 2008-09. The government is not going to expose the taxpayer to those risks again. The Conservative MP Charlie Elphicke goes next. Q: When will the transition start and end? Hammond says it will start on 29 March 2019. The prime minister said it would last around two years. But this will be a subject for negotiation. And the UK will need to carry out further analysis, he says. Q: And what will the end state look like? Hammond says that is for the negotiations, “which we have not yet been able to begin”. He says “astonishingly” the EU has not opened talks on this aspect yet. We have made the running on this. We really need our European partners to engage ... We are simply asking them to start talking to us, because we are friends and we hope to remain friends. He says people in the UK are finding it “increasingly hard to understand” why the EU will not open trade talks. Q: And what did you mean by the Times article? Hammond says some people want the government to start spending money now on preparing for a “no deal” Brexit “simply to show that we mean business”. This is unnecessary, he says. He says in the EU “they know we mean business”. Hammond says EU leaders already know UK is serious about willing to leave EU without a deal. Q: Why don’t we just invest in improving customs anyway? Hammond says this is not investment we need anyway. “It is not generic, it is specific to the outcome.” Q: How will the UK be better off after Brexit? Hammond says the UK will not have to comply with EU law. “We will be free to make our own decisions.” But no country, other than North Korea, is immune from what happens around it. The UK will be free to act. But decisions have consequences. He hopes the UK will exercise that freedom in a way that protects jobs and prosperity. UPDATE: This is from my Observer colleague Michael Savage. Hammond says he expects EU partners would be “flexible around pragmatic issues” during a transition. For example, he thinks they should allow the UK to negotiate new trade deals with other countries during the transition. The British Airline Passengers Association (BALPA) agrees with what Philip Hammond said about the theoretical possibility of a “no deal” Brexit stopping flights to the continent. This is what its general secretary Brian Strutton said in a statement yesterday. The entire UK aviation sector which employs nearly a million people and carries more than 250 million passengers per annum would be devastated by a Brexit ‘no deal’. Unlike most other sectors there are no World Trade Organisation or any other rules to fall back on for aviation if there is no deal. UK airlines could find they have to stop flying – it’s that serious. And this would impact passengers long before March 2019 because airlines couldn’t sell advance tickets and, frankly, would passengers risk buying them? It is utter madness for anyone to think that a Brexit ‘no deal’ would be anything but a total disaster for our world leading UK aviation sector and beyond. After all, without air cargo we will not be able to export or import freely. The entire industry has said that we have to see evidence of the post-Brexit plan for aviation now if we are to avert a catastrophic crisis of confidence. Labour’s Wes Streeting goes next. Q: Business leaders want certainty over Brexit, and certainty during the transition. When will we know what the transition will involve. Hammond says he agrees with Streeting. Business want certainty. That is probably more important than getting the perfect outcome. Exporting companies have one set of concerns. Firms in the service sector have another set of concerns. But they all want certainty. He says in many sectors supply chain contracts operate on a three-year basis. As contracts come up for renewal, firms need to know what is happening. He says this is well understood in government. The government wants to avoid firms having to make “worst case assumptions”. He says an interim deal is in everyone’s interests. What chances does he think there will be a deal on an interim agreement, he asks himself. He says he talks with EU counterparts have shown there is a “high degree of consensus” about the need for a transition deal. He says Theresa May set out a fair offer. In many areas the only work that has been done so far has come from the UK. We need our European partners to engage with us ... This is a shared problem and if we don’t talk about it we are not going to get a solution [on an appropriate timescale] Hammond says EU needs to engage more with UK on planning for transition deal. He says the EU should “break out” from the current talks structure and start exploratory talks on a transition, and on a future trade relationship. He says a transition deal is a “wasting asset”. As we move through 2018, its value will diminish, he says. Here is the Ukip MP Patrick O’Flynn what Philip Hammond said earlier about Brexit generating uncertainty. Here’s the Sun’s Steve Hawkes with the reaction of one Tory MP to Philip Hammond’s Times article. The SNP’s Stewart Hosie is now asking the questions. He asks about the Bank of England’s financial policy committee. Hammond says the FPC is an important part of the financial architecture in place. But it is the case that people end up putting structures in place to deal with the last crisis, not the next one, he says. Q: Why has an external seat on the FPC been vacant for almost a year? Hammond says the original appointment process did not throw up a good enough candidate. Candidates must have no outside interests. That limits the field, he says. It also pays a public sector wage. And it is looking for someone of international standing. But he is optimistic that they will be able to find someone. Hosie says the salary is £93,000 for 23 days’ work. That is equivalent to an annual salary of around £400,000. Hammond says that they cannot appoint someone with outside interests that would allow them to earn that much. Nicky Morgan, the chairman, is now asking about economic crime. Hammond says he is attending a meeting on this subject this afternoon. Hammond says any money that has to be spent on a “no deal” scenario will come from the reserve. Q: How much will the government have to spend? Hammond says it is difficult to say. It is “theoretically possible” that a “no deal” scenario could lead to there being no air traffic between the UK and the EU on the day after Brexit. But no one expects that, he says. He makes the point that there is a wide range of contingencies to plan for. Hammond says “no deal” Brexit could theoretically lead to suspension of air travel between EU and UK. UPDATE: Here is the quote in full. Q: How is the Treasury preparing for a “no deal” Brexit. Hammond says he wrote his article to make the point that the Treasury is willing to spend on preparing for a “no deal” Brexit if necessary. He says he was “rather surprised” to see it written up as if he was saying the opposite. (See 9.12pm.) Hammond claims his Times article about “no deal” Brexit planning has been misunderstood. But he says he will not allocate funds to departments in advance of the need to spend. We will be ready, he says. But we won’t spend it earlier than necessary “just to make some demonstration point”. Hammond says there is an underlying problem with productivity in the UK. Our public sector infrastructure is not as good as it could be, he says. He says there is a skills gap in the UK. The government is tackling that, he says. And regional disaparity is an issue, he says. He says the “staggering disparity” between regional productivity is a drag on the UK as a whole. And this is a social issue too, he says. He says no other advanced country has such a big gap between its best-performing city and the others. Hammond says the UK’s “staggering disparity” in regional productivity is a drag on the economy. Philip Hammond is giving evidence to the Treasury committee now. You can watch the hearing here. Asked about the latest IMF growth figures, he says the UK is “affected by the uncertainty” around Brexit. There is anecdotal evidence that business is putting off investment decisions. The cloud of uncertainty is acting as a temporary dampener. Hammond says uncertainty generated by Brexit is damaging the economy. David Owen, the former Labour foreign secretary and SDP founder, gave Jeremy Corbhn an endorsement of sorts on the Today programme this morning. In a wide-ranging interview, asked if he could see Corbyn becoming prime minister, Owen said: I think it’s certainly a possibility. I believe he is different person from the old Trotskyist that people thought he was. Thirteenth law of British politics, you can’t be a Trot and an allotment holder. They share things; they share their seeds and their spades and they have this narrow strip of land. And I think he has shown a likeability. The real problem with him is, does he understand the economy. If he doesn’t, he will not carry conviction unless he has on that platform some experienced people in the market economy. Owen also said that Corbyn was better at accommodating dissent in the Labour party than Michael Foot was. In many ways Corbyn has been a more rational person in dealing with dissent in his own party than ever Michael Foot. He met his dissenters over the nuclear deterrent, and dropped his own commitment. He also agreed to campaign for Europe in the referendum even though most people knew he was against staying inside the European Union. So it is a hard thing for many people to realise, but Corbyn has been more understanding of dissent in his own party than Michael Foot was in 1981 when he flatly refused to make any compromises whatever with Shirley Williams, myself and Bill Rodgers. Here is the BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg on Philip Hammond’s Times article. And here is the Spectator’s James Forsyth (a commentator who has repeatedly argued for the need for Britain to be serious about being willing to leave the EU with no deal if it wants to get proper concessions from Brussels) is saying about the article. Since the general election the House of Commons news factory has not been producing at quite the volume it normally does because select committees were not sitting. The government seemed to drag its feet in setting them up. But now they are all fully functional, and today we have a plethora of hearings, with three featuring cabinet ministers. The most interesting will probably be the Treasury committee session with the chancellor, Philip Hammond. Yesterday the Sun reported that two pro-leave cabinet ministers want Hammond to spend billions on preparing for a “no deal” Brexit, so that Brussels knows the UK is serious about being willing to leave the EU if necessary without a deal. It said: Two of the PM’s most senior ministers spoke to The Sun to vent their growing anger with the government’s failure to be ready to call the EU’s bluff if exit deal talks fail. Levelling much of the blame on Philip Hammond and Treasury mandarins, the powerful pair insisted the chancellor publicly sets aside jumbo sums in his annual financial blueprint next month ... One of the two Leave-backing cabinet ministers, who is closely connected to the Brexit process, still put odds of there being no deal at “50%”. One of the powerful duo: “Since the election, the system has fallen into inertia. “No proper leadership means departments have stopped preparing for no deal, and they are using our lack of a majority as an excuse. “It is killing our negotiating hand, as the EU is watching us very carefully and they can see just how little we’re doing too.” The cabinet minister added: “It’s straightforward – Hammond simply has to show them the colour of our money in the Budget so they know we’re for real”. In an otherwise unremarkable article (paywall) about Brexit in the Times, Hammond has hit back, saying he won’t authorising contingency spending on this scale. He writes: I also need to ensure that we are prepared for all outcomes, including a no-deal scenario. The government and the Treasury are prepared. We are planning for every outcome and we will find any necessary funding and we will only spend it when it’s responsible to do so. The Times has splashed on the story (paywall). I will be covering the Hammond hearing in full. Here is the agenda for the day. 9.45am: Philip Hammond, the chancellor, gives evidence to the Treasury committee. 10am: Matthew Taylor gives evidence to a joint meeting of the Commons business committee and the Commons work and pensions committee about his review of employment legislation. 10.30am: Nick Gibb, the schools minister, and Anne Milton, the minister for women, give evidence to the Commons women and equalities commtitee on sexual violence and sexual harassment in schools. 12pm: Theresa May faces Jeremy Corbyn at PMQs. 2pm: May meets Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England. 2.30pm: Karen Bradley, the culture secretary, gives evidence to the Commons culture committee. 4pm: Sajid Javid, the communities secretary, gives evidence to the Commons communities committee. As usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web. I plan to post a summary after PMQs and another in the afternoon. You can read all today’s Guardian politics stories here.

Tottenham have been here before. Real Madrid have decided they want to sign Harry Kane next summer and Tottenham will know from past experiences that the Spaniards like to get their man. Today’s story has the European champions preparing to do a swap deal for Kane in an attempt to make Mauricio Pochettino consider the merits of selling the best striker in England. Admittedly it’s not Antonio Núñez they’re preparing to chuck Tottenham’s way. Nor is it a signed photo of Julien Faubert. In fact, at first glance it looks like they’re being mightily generous, with plans afoot for Real to throw Gareth Bale, Karim Benzema and Luka Modric into the bargain – until you consider that Benzema turns 30 in December, Modric is 32 and Bale was watching from the stands as Wales lost their decisive World Cup qualifier to Martin O’Neill’s galácticos after his latest injury setback. Hmm. Tottenham may want to think carefully before agreeing to that one. Anyway there’s no point them even contemplating an emotional reunion with Bale. Not if Manchester United have anything to do about it. They’ve been after the Welshman for ages – it might seem that José Mourinho doesn’t need any more forwards but his team could do with an upgrade at left-back – and reckon that £89m will convince Real to sell a player whose star has slightly dimmed at the Bernabéu in recent months. Unlike Bale and Kane, no one wants poor Mesut Özil, whose hopes of becoming rich Mesut Özil are looking increasingly forlorn. It turns out there’s exceedingly little appetite across Europe to hand the German the £330,000 a week he wants when his Arsenal contract runs out at the end of the season. Internazionale and Besiktas thought about it before deciding he was too expensive, and that could leave Özil having to come crawling back to Arsenal with a view to reviving negotiations about getting £250,000 a week. Arsène Wenger is feeling smug. Although whether he’ll still have space for Özil in his team remains to be seen. Wenger’s already eyeing up a move for the PSV Eindhoven winger Hirving Lozano, who could be theirs for £20m. Paris Saint-Germain want to sign Chelsea’s N’Golo Kanté for £90m and watch him argue with Neymar over penalties. In big striker news, Olivier Giroud is a target for Inter and Juventus, while Brighton, Crystal Palace and West Bromwich Albion want Sheffield Wednesday’s Gary Hooper, who would cost £6m.

Shane O’Brien left the UK on a privately chartered flight after the fatal stabbing of 21-year-old Josh Hanson at the RE bar in Eastcote in the early hours of 11 October 2015 in what police say was an unprovoked attack. Announcing an increased reward of £50,000 for information leading to O’Brien’s arrest on the second anniversary of Hanson’s death, Metropolitan police detectives revealed that the suspect, who is on the National Crime Agency’s most wanted list, had been detained in the Czech Republic in February. O’Brien was arrested on suspicion of criminal damage and assault and gave his name as Enzo Mellonceli, supported by false documentation, before being released on bail. Mugshots show he had grown his hair to shoulder length and had a full beard and a distinctive new tattoo of an owl holding a skull, which covered up his previous “Shannon 15-04-06” tattoo. Hanson’s mother, Tracey, said: “While we grieve, Shane O’Brien, the man the police would like to speak to in connection with my son’s murder, has yet to be caught and we still wait for justice. Justice for the most heinous crime that my son had to endure and justice to ensure that innocent people are safe. “I hope and pray that you only ever have to imagine what I have just shared with you and it never becomes your reality, because it rips at your soul and your very being. “Please can you help us. Josh leaves behind a sister and a family who miss and love him very much. Take a moment to look around you and if you think you may have seen O’Brien please call the police. Someone has seen him and all it takes is that one phone call to help us get justice so we can grieve in peace.” In an interview with the Guardian in 2016, Tracey Hanson and her daughter Brooke described the hunt for O’Brien as a near full-time job. Josh Hanson was found with a serious wound to the neck after the attack in the early hours of the morning. He was pronounced dead at the scene. A postmortem gave the cause of death as haemorrhage, inhalation of blood and an incised wound to the neck. O’Brien left the UK in a privately chartered flight from Biggin Hill airport. In March 2015 he was added to the most wanted list by the NCA and Crimestoppers. At that time it was believed he could be hiding in the Netherlands. The police later received information that he had travelled to Dubai, and his arrest in Prague was his last known sighting. He had been using the Italian aliases of Enzo Mellonceli and Enzo Machado. Police said O’Brien had boxing gloves with him when he was arrested in Prague, and they urged gym or boxing ring users to study his image. O’Brien, originally from Ladbroke Grove, is described as white and 1.8 metres (6ft) tall with grey eyes and dark brown hair. Police hunting O’Brien arrested two men in October 2015 on suspicion of perverting the course of justice and assisting an offender. They were bailed pending further inquiries. DCI Noel McHugh said: “It is clear he is being helped by others to evade police and has the ability to move around without using his own identity. That is why we decided to offer such a large reward. “£50,000 is a substantial amount of money and I hope it will encourage someone who moves in O’Brien’s circles to come forward. If you have been debating whether to make that call, just listen to the pain in the voices of Josh’s mum, Tracey, and his sister, Brooke. Your silence is denying justice to Josh’s family.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2017/oct/11/2017-deadliest-on-record-for-land-defenders-mining-logging","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-11T10:35:06Z","webTitle":"2017 on course to be deadliest on record for land defenders","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/oct/11/2017-deadliest-on-record-for-land-defenders-mining-logging","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/oct/11/2017-deadliest-on-record-for-land-defenders-mining-logging","fields":{"headline":"2017 on course to be deadliest on record for land defenders","bodyText":"The number of people killed this year while defending their community’s land, natural resources or wildlife has passed 150 – meaning 2017 is on course to be the deadliest year on record. Environmental activists, wildlife rangers and indigenous leaders are locked in fierce conflicts with mining, logging and agricultural companies in hundreds of places around the world. The Guardian is working with watchdog Global Witness to record all the deaths in 2017, and this week that figure reached 153 with a spate of killings across three continents. These included Ruben Arzaga, a village leader and environmental officer shot while arresting suspected illegal loggers in the Philippines; Elías Gamonal Mozombite, one of six farmers shot dead in a land rights battle reportedly linked to palm oil trade in Peru, and Wayne Lotter, a leading elephant conservationist and head of an anti-poaching NGO shot dead in Tanzania. Billy Kyte of Global Witness said the latest deaths underlined the scale of the crisis facing those seeking to protect their land and environment from global corporations and governments. “These stark statistics show 2017 looks like being the deadliest yet for those on the frontline to protect our environment and their land rights.” Kyte said Brazil, Colombia and the Philippines were set to be the most dangerous places – as they were in 2016. “The heads of these governments must recognise this crisis and prioritise the protection of these defenders. Without guaranteeing communities a say in how their land and natural resources are used, the roots of this violence will continue to grow.” The findings show that mining and extractive industries continue to be the industry linked to the most killings – 33 so far this year. There has also been a surge in deaths associated with agribusiness – 28 deaths so far this year, compared with 23 for the whole of 2016. And more park rangers have been killed already in 2017 than during the whole of last year. Kyte said some progress appeared to have been made in Honduras, historically the world’s most dangerous place per capita, where deaths dropped from 14 in 2016 to only one this year so far. However, he added: “Whilst this is welcome, news there continues to contain regular reports of threats, harassment and criminalisation of activists and human rights defenders in the country.” Last year 200 environmental activists, wildlife rangers and indigenous leaders were killed. And with that figure set to be exceeded, Kyte warned that investors as well as governments and global corporations had a key role to play. “Investors too have blood on their hands. They should not invest in projects linked to abuses and must speak out when defenders are threatened.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"stage/2017/oct/11/theatre-to-stage-musical-based-on-imaginary-death-of-katie-hopkins","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-11T17:00:17Z","webTitle":"Theatre to stage musical based on imaginary death of Katie Hopkins","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/oct/11/theatre-to-stage-musical-based-on-imaginary-death-of-katie-hopkins","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2017/oct/11/theatre-to-stage-musical-based-on-imaginary-death-of-katie-hopkins","fields":{"headline":"Theatre to stage musical based on imaginary death of Katie Hopkins","bodyText":"Memorable British musicals in recent years have tackled difficult, challenging and dark subjects including serial murder and trial by TV. Next up: what if Katie Hopkins was murdered? The Assassination of Katie Hopkins is a provocatively titled musical scheduled to open in spring next year which uses her fictional death as a way to explore wider issues of “truth, celebrity and public outrage”. The rightwing Mail Online columnist divides opinion like few others. She is detested or loved. The show’s co-writer, Chris Bush, said she hoped the production would challenge audiences’ preconceptions about Hopkins. “She is someone who generates very, very strong opinions, positively or negatively, and what interests me as a writer is challenging assumptions.” Hopkins will not be a visible character on stage but her death is the trigger for the narrative and her presence looms large over events. “We have been going back and forth on whether we mind if she hates it,” said Bush. “But is it worse if she loves it?” Bush has written the words while Matt Winkworth has composed the music. It will receive its world premiere at Theatr Clwyd in north Wales next April, directed by James Grieve, artistic director of touring theatre company Paines Plough. While fictional, the work will be presented as if it is a piece of verbatim theatre. Bush said it would examine social media, the mob mentality it encourages and the limits of free speech. “Does having the right to a voice give you a right to a platform?” It will also explore reaction to reports of a high-profile death. Was it right that some people organised street parties after the death of Thatcher, Bush asked? Bush admitted she was “slightly terrified” by elements of social media. “I think it is very easy to think there isn’t any real world impact to writing something online or sharing something.” The show would, Bush hoped, raise difficult questions rather than laying out a manifesto or having an argument she wanted to win. Hopkins first came to the public’s attention in 2007 when, as a “global brand consultant”, she was a rancorous, bitchy, highly entertaining candidate on The Apprentice. That was followed later the same year by I’m a Celebrity … Get Me Out of Here! when she was a late replacement for Malcolm McLaren, and an appearance on Celebrity Big Brother. By then she was known as a rightwing controversialist with columns for first the Sun and then Mail Online. Barely a week went by – still goes by – without Hopkins saying something disgraceful or outrageous. In columns, tweets and interviews Hopkins has admired the “efficiency” of Ebola, said she does not like fat people, berated the “mammary militia breastfeeding en masse in Costa”, suggested that Justin Bieber could be the next Amy Winehouse and complained that dementia sufferers are bed blockers. Her tweets get her into particular trouble. She had to leave her weekly Sunday show at radio station LBC after calling for a “final solution” following the Manchester arena terrorist attack. Earlier this year she lost a court libel case brought by the writer and food blogger Jack Monroe in a row over tweets suggesting Monroe had approved of the defacing of a war memorial during an anti-austerity demonstration in Whitehall. Bush said Hopkins’ views were not ones she had much time for. “I disagree with the vast majority of what Katie Hopkins has to say … politically I couldn’t be much further from where she is on a spectrum. “Whether she is useful or has any right to say what she says is a much more complicated question.” The production continues a trend of musicals burrowing into less traditional subjects, from Jerry Springer the Opera to London Road, which was a verbatim account of how lives were affected by a series of murders in Ipswich."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2017/oct/11/spanish-government-to-hold-crisis-talks-on-catalan-independence","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-11T16:43:13Z","webTitle":"Spanish PM asks Catalonia: have you declared independence or not?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/11/spanish-government-to-hold-crisis-talks-on-catalan-independence","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/oct/11/spanish-government-to-hold-crisis-talks-on-catalan-independence","fields":{"headline":"Spanish PM asks Catalonia: have you declared independence or not?","bodyText":"The Spanish prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, has asked the Catalan government to clarify whether or not it has declared independence, as he considers the unprecedented step of suspending the region’s autonomy and imposing direct rule from Madrid. On Tuesday evening, the Catalan president, Carles Puigdemont, said while the referendum this month had given his government a mandate to create a sovereign republic, he would not immediately push ahead with independence from Spain. Although he signed a declaration of independence, he proposed that its effects be suspended for a few weeks to allow for dialogue. Rajoy, who has refused to rule out invoking article 155 of the Spanish constitution to take control of Catalonia, was quick to seize on the ambiguity of Puigdemont’s position, accusing him of deliberately sowing confusion. The prime minister also rejected calls for external mediation between the two governments, insisting the Catalan question remained a domestic matter. “The cabinet has agreed this morning to formally require the Catalan government to confirm whether it has declared independence after the deliberate confusion created over whether it has come into effect,” he said in a television address on Wednesday. “This request, which comes before any of the measures that the government could adopt under article 155 of our constitution, is meant to offer our citizens the clarity and security that such an important issue requires.” Rajoy said Puigdemont had until Monday 16 October to confirm whether or not independence had been declared and then a further three days to rectify the situation and restore “constitutional order”. If he failed to do so, Rajoy said the government would activate article 155. “The Catalan president’s answer to these questions will inform what happens over the next few days,” he said. “If Mr Puigdemont demonstrates a willingness to respect the law and re-establish institutional normality, we could bring a close to a period of instability, tension and the breakdown of co-existence. “That is what everyone wants and expects; it’s what they’ve been demanding. We must put an urgent end to the situation in Catalonia. There must be a return to normality and calm as swiftly as possible.” Speaking later on Wednesday, Pedro Sánchez, the leader of Spain’s Socialist party (PSOE), urged Puigdemont to “be black and white” about whether independence had been declared but offered a possible way out of the crisis. If independence had been declared, said Sánchez, then the PSOE would back the actions of the Spanish government. But he also said that he and Rajoy had agreed that there should be a commission to examine the possibility of changing the way the country’s autonomous regions are governed through constitutional reform. The idea, Sánchez added, was to find a formula to “allow for Catalonia to remain a part of Spain”. While talks on the matter will not begin for six months – meaning there is still ample scope to apply article 155 – the move could go some way to showing that negotiations are possible if Puigdemont backs away from independence. It also shows that Rajoy and Sánchez are increasingly united in the face of the secessionist threat. In an address to parliament on Wednesday afternoon, Rajoy described the referendum as an “illegal and fraudulent” act, dismissed Puigdemont’s independence plans as a “fairytale” and said Spain would resolve the standoff on its own. He was adamant that there could be no discussion of Spain’s national unity as laid out in the constitution. “That’s something that the many mediators who have offered themselves over recent days should bear in mind,” he said. “Most of them have offered to help in good faith to find a way out of this situation. I can only thank them for their concern and their interest. But there is no possible mediation between democratic law and disobedience or illegality.” He has repeatedly pointed out that the referendum and the laws underpinning it are a violation of the Spanish constitution, which is based “on the indissoluble unity of the Spanish nation, the common and indivisible homeland of all Spaniards”. Barring a sudden climbdown from Puigdemont, Rajoy looks likely to become the first Spanish prime minister to take the drastic step of invoking article 155. It allows the central government to take control of an autonomous region if it “does not fulfil the obligations imposed upon it by the constitution or other laws, or acts in a way that is seriously prejudicial to the general interest of Spain”. However, its invocation could provoke civil unrest in Catalonia, where tensions remain high after the Spanish police’s crackdown on the referendum and where thousands of national police and Guardia Civil officers are still deployed. Puigdemont’s proposal to suspend a declaration of independence to allow for negotiations pulled the region back from the brink of a showdown with Madrid, but it also drew criticism from the leader of the opposition in the Catalan parliament and his pro-independence junior coalition partners. The Catalan president had originally promised to make a unilateral declaration of independence within 48 hours of a victory for the yes campaign, but has instead chosen to seek international help for mediated negotiations. He renewed his calls for dialogue on Wednesday, saying it was time to sit down and talk. “Maybe, it could help [us] to talk if two people representing the Spanish government and two people representing the Catalan government just simply agree on one thing, for instance, naming a mediator,” he told CNN. “Yesterday I tried to send a message of calmness and to remind people that we are facing a political problem that we need to solve with politics and not with police.” Puigdemont also claimed that most Catalans were in favour of independence, saying: “The relationship between Catalonia and Spain does not work and the majority of Catalan people want Catalonia as an independent state.” While 90% of participants in the poll voted in favour of splitting from Spain, only 2.3 million of Catalonia’s 5.3 million registered voters – 43% – took part. However, according to the Catalan government, 770,000 votes were lost after Spanish police stepped in to try to halt the vote."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/oct/16/muslim-inmates-allege-humiliation-and-abuse-by-brisbane-prison-staff","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-15T17:00:36Z","webTitle":"Muslim inmates allege humiliation and abuse by Brisbane prison staff","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/oct/16/muslim-inmates-allege-humiliation-and-abuse-by-brisbane-prison-staff","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/oct/16/muslim-inmates-allege-humiliation-and-abuse-by-brisbane-prison-staff","fields":{"headline":"Muslim inmates allege humiliation and abuse by Brisbane prison staff","bodyText":"Allegations of abuse, humiliation and deprivation by prison staff have been made by Muslim inmates at a correction centre in Brisbane. The Islamic Council of Queensland made a series of complaints about the behaviour of staff towards inmates at the Arthur Gorrie correctional centre (AGCC), the state’s largest prison. In a letter sent to Queensland Corrective Services (QCS) in June, the council said that “on at least five occasions non-Muslim prisoners have been instructed to physically assault Muslim prisoners”, including one time “without the guard realising he was instructing another Muslim to commit the assault.” It also alleged an inmate was made to stand facing a wall while a guard bashed his head into it repeatedly, “causing the prisoner to lose consciousness”. The letter alleged an AGCC manager entered a cell with eight Muslims praying together and claimed “they are engaging in terrorist activity and it should not be tolerated”. The letter claimed “the prisoners were threatened with gas if they continued to pray together”. The council’s appeal for action was unsuccessful, according to a QCS spokesperson, on the grounds that, “after referral to the ESU [ethical standards unit] and CSIU [corrective services investigation unit], no further evidence was provided to substantiate the claims”. The spokesperson said: “QCS takes any allegation of prisoner mistreatment seriously … If an allegation of assault is made, it is referred, in every instance, to the Queensland police service, corrective services investigation unit.” Jesse Price, a 21-year-old ex-inmate from Upper Coomera, converted to Islam last October while detained at the AGCC, the state’s biggest remand centre. Now removed from detention, he is one of few individuals willing to publicly voice complaints. “I’m in the process of doing a discrimination claim … The way I was treated: I was bashed, left in segregation, not given halal food. They would call me a terrorist and were saying I should be associated with terrorists,” Price said. Price said on one occasion he was “knocked out” following altercations with other inmates. “The guards bashed me and put me on the ground, said I’m a piece of shit, I’m a Muslim.” He claimed he protested multiple times before finally being transferred from the AGCC. “It was only until I told them that I felt that I had been sexually abused,” he said. “I was taken down to the detention units, so [that meant] segregation. And they ripped all my clothes off me and stuff. They kicked me in the private parts. It came to the point where I was getting taunted by them, it was ongoing, every day … The staff needs to know the things that they were doing and how it was wrong and how it affects people. And know the effects of the ongoing scarring it’s had.” Price said he was detained in the Brisbane correctional centre and Wolston correctional centre before arriving at the AGCC last year, with charges including alleged assaults on a police officer, vehicle theft and property-related offences. He said he was in contact with Muslim inmates at the prison, who were “still experiencing the same stuff from the guards”. Following his release from the AGCC, members of the Islamic Council of Queensland provided Price support as a newly converted Muslim. The council, founded in 1969, is a peak umbrella body which uses community channels to represent the interests of Muslims in Queensland. The council’s members heard accusations against prison staff during regular visits with Muslim inmates at the AGCC. These were eventually raised in a formal address to QCS’s general manager, Peter Shaddock. Ali Kadri, spokesperson of the ICQ, has had a long-standing involvement in efforts to legitimise and address the inmates’ claims, which he said pointed to an “ongoing structural problem”. Kadri said it sometimes took up to 12 weeks for converts to access halal food and in some instances they never did. Inmates who convert are required to send a dietary request form to the general manager’s office, and “in many cases, the guards have just crumpled these papers up in front of the inmates and thrown them in the bin”. The AGCC is privately owned by the company GEO Group, which when asked about inmates’ access to halal food responded: “GEO is required to adhere to QCS procedure for the provision of special diets to prisoners in accordance with religious or medical requirement.” The GEO spokesperson also said: “The management of the AGCC has not received complaints in the last 12 months of prisoners being mocked or intimidated because of religion or race … GEO is aware QCS has received complaints directly from the ICQ which were investigated by QCS.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/oct/11/trump-walk-away-us-iran-nuclear-deal","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-11T06:01:34Z","webTitle":"'We are on a tightrope': Trump poised to walk away from Iran nuclear deal","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/11/trump-walk-away-us-iran-nuclear-deal","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/oct/11/trump-walk-away-us-iran-nuclear-deal","fields":{"headline":"'We are on a tightrope': Trump poised to walk away from Iran nuclear deal","bodyText":"If Donald Trump decides this week to withdraw his endorsement of the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, its fate and the potential for a major conflict will be determined by a complex battle in Congress. No one is able to predict whether that struggle will lead to a reimposition of US sanctions, the collapse of the agreement and the rapid scaling-up of Iran’s nuclear programme. It could result in a compromise that leaves the deal alive but opens the way for a more combative policy towards Tehran on other fronts. “We are on a tightrope. We don’t know what will happen,” a western diplomat said. The congressional contest will pit most Republicans against almost all Democrats, hawks against doves, and will be played out under rules drawn up for a completely different set of circumstances. The Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act (INARA) of 2015 was designed for a situation in which Iran was breaking the international agreement signed in July of that year, and a US administration was trying to cover up Tehran violations as a means of preserving the accord. The actual situation is one in which Iran is agreed by all signatories, including the US, to be abiding by its obligations, but the US president appears determined to kill off the deal regardless. To add another level of complication, neither the Republican majority nor the president wants to be seen as the assassin that inflicts the death blow. Trump says he has made his decision and an announcement is expected on Thursday or Friday. Most signs are that he will not certify the deal, the Joint Comprehensive Programme of Action (JCPOA). The president has changed his mind at the eleventh hour before and the UK has not given up. In a telephone call with Trump on Tuesday, British prime minister Theresa May “reaffirmed the UK’s strong commitment to the deal alongside our European partners, saying it was vitally important for regional security”, Downing Street said. The British foreign secretary Boris Johnson insisted the UK regarded the deal as an historic achievement that had made the world a safer place. He reiterated this in calls with the US secretary of state Rex Tillerson and the Iranian foreign minister Javad Zarif. If such last-ditch appeals fall flat and Trump washes his hands of an agreement he has called “the worst deal ever negotiated”, INARA gives Congress 60 days to decide whether to reimpose sanctions. The vote can be passed in the Senate by 51 votes. The Republicans have 52 seats. The Republicans have historically been hostile to Iran and multilateral agreements, but these are not normal circumstances. The party leadership in Congress does not want to be landed with a decision it thinks the president should make, taking up time it would prefer to go to tax cuts. The picture is made muddier still by a bizarre exchange of insults between Trump and the Republican chair of the Senate foreign relations committee, Bob Corker. Europe’s conundrum For European diplomats, a lot will depend on Trump’s words and tone. The worst-case scenario would be a vituperative denunciation or an ultimatum to Iran to renegotiate – an option that Tehran, Moscow and Beijing have rejected – coupled with a challenge to Congress to reimpose sanctions. “It’s hard to imagine a world where the administration signals that it’s going to decline to certify and it would like to see the reimposition of some or all sanctions – and Congress not acting,” said Richard Fontaine, the president of the Centre for a New American Security. “From a Republican point of view, would you want to take a position against the reimposition of Iran sanctions on the Hill, only to see the president do it anyway?” The renewal of sanctions would be a nightmare for the three European signatories – the UK, France and Germany – and for the EU, which acted as midwife for the agreement. All say they will stick by their obligations. “We signed that deal and the [UN] security council endorsed it. The world took Americans’ word for what it was,” Germany’s ambassador to Washington, Peter Wittig, told the Guardian. “To unravel that would jeopardise US credibility and also the credibility of the west in the world.” Wittig stressed that Berlin and other European capitals share US concerns about Iran’s missile programme, its role in Syria and Iraq and in sponsoring militants. “We agree on the need to confront Iran in the region, so let’s spit it out,” he said. “Let’s talk about a concerted strategy … on how to deal with Iran.” Other European diplomats have said there is no sign of such a policy from the administration, which they say seems determined to take out on the JCPOA frustrations over its inability to curb Iranian influence in the region. If the US walked out on the deal, it is unclear whether Europe could keep faith with it, even if it wanted to. Regulations dating back to 1996, aimed at preventing European companies from complying with US sanctions that run counter to EU foreign policy, have never been properly tested. Faced with a choice between doing business in Iran and in the US, the big European firms are unlikely to hesitate. It would be hard for the EU to punish them. “The worst scenario we’ll get into is one where there is not enough pressure to force Iran to make concessions, but enough pressure to make them say this agreement isn’t working for us and reconsider the nuclear restrictions that are in place,” said Richard Nephew, a former principal deputy sanctions coordinator at the state department. If Trump gives a thumbs-down, the best the deal’s supporters can hope for is that he does not call directly for new sanctions, while his secretaries of defence and state, who support the agreement, work with Congress to find a compromise. Part of such a fix would involve a modification of INARA so Trump is not asked to endure the humiliation of approving his predecessor’s agreement every 90 days. Opponents are unlikely to give up. Instead, they are expected to mount one assault after another in Congress, goading Tehran to walk away. The deal could outlive the immediate crisis, but it will not be secure as long as its greatest detractor remains in the White House."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2017/oct/12/all-blacks-dominance-threatens-the-health-of-international-test-rugby","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-11T17:00:17Z","webTitle":"All Blacks' dominance threatens the health of international Test rugby | Bret Harris","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/oct/12/all-blacks-dominance-threatens-the-health-of-international-test-rugby","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/oct/12/all-blacks-dominance-threatens-the-health-of-international-test-rugby","fields":{"headline":"All Blacks' dominance threatens the health of international rugby","bodyText":"Never in the history of sport has there been an international team as dominant as the All Blacks. The New Zealanders have lost only two games since winning the 2015 World Cup – an exhibition against Ireland in Chicago and the second Test against the combined might of the British and Irish Lions, which they played with 14 men for almost three quarters of the game after Sonny Bill Williams was red-carded. The All Blacks’ dominance might be wonderful for rugby in New Zealand, but questions remain as to whether it is positive for Test rugby and the health of the game in other countries. This is particularly true for Australia, as the Wallabies play the Kiwis more often than any other team. While New Zealand has been the top country in world rugby for more than 100 years, the All Blacks have not always been invincible, especially at the World Cup from 1991 to 2007 when they were regularly knocked out in the play-off stages. The All Blacks would dominate Test rugby in between World Cups only to choke at the showpiece event, giving the likes of Australia, England and South Africa an opportunity to claim the mantle as the world’s best team. But the All Blacks have now won the last two World Cups in 2011 and 2015 and it is not beyond the realms of possibility they will remain undefeated until they lift the Webb Ellis Cup again in Japan in 2019. This kind of dominance is abhorred in other sports. Most professional sporting competitions have introduced drafts and/or salary caps to maintain parity among teams, seeing it as detrimental for one side to win all the time, but these sort of equalising mechanisms are not applicable to Test rugby. If the All Blacks cannot be brought back to the field, it is up to other nations to lift their standards to try to match them. So who will challenge the All Blacks for world supremacy? It might seem like a fantastical exercise, but there are a few contenders. Under former Wallabies coach Eddie Jones, England are certainly mobilising their forces to make a genuine assault on the World Cup in Japan, instilling the same will to win that the men in white had in 2003. Rugby supporters around the globe are salivating at the prospect of England hosting the All Blacks at Twickenham in November next year, but that is a long time to wait to see the Kiwis knocked off their pedestal. In the meantime, the Wallabies and the Springboks look as if they have turned the corner, raising hope that a famous win against the All Blacks is not too far away. Both Australia and South Africa gave the All Blacks a run for their money in the Rugby Championship, narrowly losing epic contests in Dunedin and Cape Town respectively. It is a little bit sad when Australian and South African supporters get excited when the Wallabies and Springboks go close against the All Blacks. Is that as good as it gets? A gallant defeat? You cannot forget that the All Blacks also inflicted record defeats on the Wallabies and the Springboks in the same competition. That’s the thing about the Kiwis, when they are on they are unbeatable and when they are off they almost always win anyway. France, of course, are always a wildcard at the World Cup, having knocked the All Blacks out of the tournament in 1999 and 2007 and almost upsetting them in the final in Auckland in 2011. The All Blacks play France in Paris on their end of year tour. Les Bleus always step up when they play New Zealand and will be a formidable opponent. The Wallabies will get the next crack at the All Blacks in the third Bledisloe Test in Brisbane on 21 October . With the All Blacks having already won the Bledisloe Cup for a record 15th consecutive time, the game in Brisbane is a dead rubber, but that expression is not part of the Kiwi vocabulary. The All Blacks have an insatiable hunger to win every single game they play. Until the pretenders to the throne can match that desire, they will not beat them and that will not be good for rugby. The yawning gap between the All Blacks and the rest of the world may turn Test rugby into a great, big yawn."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/oct/12/our-sickly-sweet-obsession-with-comfort-will-end-up-killing-us","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-12T03:15:23Z","webTitle":"Our sickly-sweet obsession with comfort will end up killing us | Brigid Delaney's diary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/oct/12/our-sickly-sweet-obsession-with-comfort-will-end-up-killing-us","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/oct/12/our-sickly-sweet-obsession-with-comfort-will-end-up-killing-us","fields":{"headline":"Our sickly-sweet obsession with comfort will end up killing us","bodyText":"The leaves are turning red, and it is peak cruise ship season on the waterways of Canada. In Quebec City, the main attraction, the thing the disgorged passengers all lined up for, was not the museums or churches but a popcorn shop. You could smell it for miles away, sickly sweet and buttery. At the counter you ordered your popcorn with a topping: chocolate, salted caramel, vanilla syrup, pecan syrup. Giant tubs of chocolate or syrup covered popcorn is for kids, right? But the average age of the people in the queues was 60 plus. The elderly children ate their buckets of comfort food wearing comfort clothing – baggy shorts, bright-coloured polos and trainers for men, athleisure leggings for women and those functional vest parkas. There were thousands of Benjamin Buttons walking around town with their giant tubs of popcorn, subverting the usual, old ways of ageing – the scratchy tweed clothes and the palate for sharp things: whiskey, blue cheese, anchovies on toast. The cruise ships are all about comfort, too. Everything is done for you. You’re fed and watered and when on land, moved around the place in coaches with guides. You bypass the discomfort of the post-9/11 airports with their nasty queues and TSA full-body scans, removing your shoes and having your moisturiser confiscated. Last week, marvelling about the queues at the popcorn shop, I thought about another type of sailor, from Taiwan. In the late 1970s, Tehching Hsieh jumped ship in Philadelphia and made his way to New York to make his name as an artist. In the 1980s Hsieh made a series of performance art pieces that are now being celebrated in this year’s Venice Biennale. Last year I met the now 66-year-old in Taipei to discuss these works. The pieces all took a year to perform and the each of them involved significant discomfort to the artist. There was the year he lived outside, not entering a building for a year (except for a courthouse when he was arrested), in New York during the coldest winter on record. There was the year he tied himself to another artist, Linda Montano, by a length of rope, and they had to spend 12 months in close proximity. And the year he spent in a cage marking off the days. And the year he spent every hour clocking on to a time clock, breaking up his sleep and activities into hourly intervals. In the 30 years after making these works the intentional discomfort he endured seems perverse and shocking. In that time, the rich of the rich west have engineered our lives so that we rarely have to experience even a twinge of discomfort. It’s not just the cruise ships and popcorn. Comfort is the organising principle of modern life. So great is our need for comfort – to be comfortable – that the most popular products are based around things fulfilling this need and have internalised within their very engineering the fulfilment of our need for comfort. What is Netflix and on-demand TV, chocolate-covered popcorn, business class and premium economy, cruise ships, athleisure wear, our social media echo chambers, our online shopping and UberEats – other than things that sate our desire to be comfortable? The New York Times columnist David Brooks has written about the millennial generation weaned on praise and constant booster shots of self esteem – every participant gets a prize! But our desire for comfort to be physically and psychically comfortable – to live within an inarticulatable but deeply felt and precise bandwidth of ease that includes everything from how a food feels in your mouth, to how socks rub on your feet, to how a phone sits in your hand, to how a drink or a movie or a computer game calms you – can be traced back to baby boomers. The children of those who lived without comfort through rationing, wars and depression came of age in a time of unprecedented prosperity. Their birthright was the quarter-acre block, mass production of household appliances and time-saving devices, television, fast food, breakfast cereals and affordable airline travel. We are taught as consumers that if we are not comfortable, if the temperature is too hot or cold, or if the music is too loud or if the meal is not right, we can complain and things will be adjusted for us. We seek comforts in controlling our inside climate through aircon and heating – despite the fact that our short-term comfort comes at a long-term cost to the climate. Yesterday, ABC radio took calls about the federal government’s new scheme to get people to turn off appliances – including air conditioners during what’s termed peak times – ie during heatwaves – to prevent widespread power outages. One complaint from a woman who used her air conditioner was typical and went along the lines of: “I’m not switching my air conditioner off on a hot day, I don’t want to be uncomfortable.” Of course you don’t. But increasingly we are living in uncomfortable times. The sugary comfort food is killing us. The comfortable temperatures are killing the planet. Tehching Hsieh – an outsider, a sailor who jumped ship, with little English – sought discomfort and turned it into art. This discomfort now seems prescient. A warning of a time to come, where discomfort is no longer about choice, but about survival."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"culture/2017/oct/14/joseph-kosuth","type":"article","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-13T22:12:55Z","webTitle":"Joseph Kosuth: 'The artists at the top of the billionaires' lists are quite derivative'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2017/oct/14/joseph-kosuth","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/2017/oct/14/joseph-kosuth","fields":{"headline":"Joseph Kosuth: 'The artists at the top of the billionaires' lists are quite derivative'","bodyText":"Joseph Kosuth was 24 in 1969 when he wrote his seminal essay, Art After Philosophy. It’s a staple of art theory classes everywhere these days, but when I ask him about it, he immediately reminds me how young he was back then. “I threw a lot of things in and maybe not quite as thoughtfully as I could have,” he says. At 72, the American conceptual artist is just as forthright and opinionated as he was when he was writing “agitprop art theory” as a self-described wunderkind – though now he is bolstered by more than 50 years of a high-profile artistic career. Frequently self-referential, concerned with language, philosophy and the nature of art itself, Kosuth’s works pioneered the use of text – of words, language – as visual art. One of the key figures in the conceptual art movement of the 1960s, who rejected a conventional understanding of art in favour of focusing on the ideas behind the work, he has maintained a career as a curator and writer as his pieces have been exhibited across the world, featuring in the permanent collections of major museums with career retrospectives travelling across Europe. So Kosuth is reasonably surprised when, sitting on a metal stool at one end of a stark, whitewashed room covered in his works in Flinders Lane, Melbourne, I tell him that his art – which has not been seen much in Australia – is relatively new to me. “Darling, how did you manage to avoid me all these years?” he exclaims. Kosuth has a gruff manner – accentuated perhaps by the fact that he is slightly hard of hearing “this week” – but he is engaging and opinionated. He is known for having high-profile connections, and when conversation turns to politics, the anecdotes begin to flow. There was the time actor Vanessa Redgrave would “pound on my door and sit in my kitchen and go on and on, trying to convince me to join her revolutionary workers’ party – oh mon dieu!” he says, putting his head in his hands. Then there was his ancestor, Lajos Kossuth, who played a significant role in the Hungarian revolution of 1848, and who corresponded and ultimately fell out with Karl Marx. “And gave away some thousands of hectares! My inheritance! Gave away to the Hungarian people!” Kosuth laments. “Which is fine – I did fine without it, thank you very much.” When it comes to art, though, he is serious: “Artists make meaning; that’s what we do,” he says. Kosuth’s own brand of meaning-making is most often represented by his most well-known work, One and Three Chairs (1965), in which a chair, a photograph of that chair, and the dictionary definition of the word “chair” are installed side-by-side. A Short History of My Thought, currently on show for Melbourne festival at Anna Schwartz Gallery, is perhaps the ideal entry point for a Kosuth novice. Comprising mainly neon, language-focused pieces made between the mid-1960s and a couple of years ago, the exhibition is less a retrospective than a judicious sampling of a career built on questioning the very nature of art itself. Kosuth initially supported his art practice with teaching, until it began to make enough money to sustain itself. But younger artists, he says, seem to be particularly influenced by commercialisation, unconsciously conflating artistic worth with financial value. He is scathing of those who are “stupid enough” to think that the answer to “who is the most expensive?” can also answer the question “who is the best?” “Those artists at the top of the list of billionaires’ [collections] are rather quite derivative artists,” he says. Then: “They’re friends of mine, so I won’t say specific ones. But I watch this phenomenon and they cite me as their childhood hero sometimes and I don’t know what to do with that.” By way of explaining how stifling commercial considerations can be to art, he points across the room to where Double Reading #12 is hanging – a work comprised of a Blondie cartoon and a quote from the philosopher Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz about the nature of truth. “This was a show I did in LA at Margo Leavin [Gallery]. It was a really long time ago, and traffic was terrible that night in LA and I got to my opening like, in the middle of it, and as I walked in these Hollywood lawyers that were collectors of mine came running out, saying, ‘Joseph, did you get permission to use that [cartoon]?!’ I said, ‘No’.” He notes that he didn’t get permission from Leibniz either, but permission was not the point. “I pointed to the Blondie cartoon and said, ‘See that? That’s not my work.’” He points to the Leibniz quote: “Not my work either. My work is the gap between. It’s where the surplus meaning is created from those two. Those are just props to give me that.” This concern for spaces – for “the gap between” – is part of what drew him to use neon as a material in his art. “I needed something with qualities that I could unpack and separate,” he says. “People were used to seeing [neon], although for other purposes than art. They were used to seeing these things lit on the wall. So I transformed them,” he says. “Any neon used before me was basically decorative, formalistic stuff.” The concern for spaces also fuels his relationship with his audience. “I expect the audience to complete the work,” he says. “I am initiating a conversation. While I can explain my work and can talk about it, I am sometimes reticent to do it, because people want to look at the answers in the back of the book instead of working it out themselves.” There are facts, however, that underpin his art – facts that are sometimes useful to know in order for the piece to resonate. Kosuth points to a large, pink work at the end of the gallery. “That’s the very last word that [philosopher Ludwig] Wittgenstein wrote as he died,” he explains. “That was the word ‘language’, in German, crossed off. I mean, I was fascinated by that … it gives a human side that you don’t always get from dear Ludwig.” I tell Kosuth I once studied that great thinker’s philosophies on language, and he nods approvingly. Kosuth curated the centennial exhibition in Wittgenstein’s honour for the city of Vienna – “the philosophers were fighting over his body – it’s very contentious, the Wittgenstein industry,” he says. He was also invited to create a work for the side of the house Wittgenstein made for his sister, Margaret. Given his concerns about commercialisation, how should artists respond to the contemporary political moment? “There are things you can do – ‘dirty tricks’ they would call it during the Nixon era,” he says. Kosuth was himself active against the Vietnam War, engaging in guerrilla-type creative activity like dropping little cards from a plane over Boston that said: “if this was napalm, you’d be burning”. “But it’s one thing to do that; it’s another to make it part of your career portfolio.” Politics is always local, he says. “We have the worst president in memory and the thing about the American president is that he’s everybody’s president, he impacts everybody’s life, whether you have the opportunity to vote for the guy or not ... but there are always local issues that have to be dealt with.” Ultimately, though, it’s the role of artists to look beyond politics – beyond the temporary. “We’re in a world where the two most powerful groups – the two motors of society – are on one hand businessmen and women who want to see profit at the end of the day, and on the other politicians, who want to maintain their power. Those are short-term goals, and if there’s a commitment only to short-term goals, it’s not good for society. “That’s why the intellectuals, the artists, the writers – the intellectual workers, shall we call them – are so important. They provide the long threads in this textile of society.” • A Short History of My Thought by Joseph Kosuth is showing at Anna Schwartz Gallery, Melbourne, until 5 November"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2017/oct/17/accused-of-graft-popularity-near-zero-so-why-is-brazils-president-still-in-office","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-17T19:52:23Z","webTitle":"Accused of corruption, popularity near zero – why is Temer still Brazil's president?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/17/accused-of-graft-popularity-near-zero-so-why-is-brazils-president-still-in-office","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/oct/17/accused-of-graft-popularity-near-zero-so-why-is-brazils-president-still-in-office","fields":{"headline":"Accused of corruption, popularity near zero – why is Temer still Brazil's president?","bodyText":"If Brazil’s recent decline could be plotted in the falling popularity of its presidents, Michel Temer represents the bottom of the curve. In 2010, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva ended his second term with an 80% approval rating. In March 2016 – four months before she was impeached – his protege and successor Dilma Rousseff’s administration had a 10% rating. Last month, the government of Temer, Rousseff’s former vice-president, plunged to 3% in one poll. Among under 24-year-olds, Temer’s approval hit zero. Temer has been charged with corruption, racketeering and obstruction of justice. Yet there have been none of the huge, anti-corruption street protests that helped drive Rousseff’s impeachment on charges of breaking budget rules. And unlike Rousseff, Temer has retained the support of financial markets who like the austerity measures he has introduced, such as privatising government services, a 20-year cap on expenditure and a planned pensions overhaul. There are signs of economic recovery. But spending has been so pared to the bone that some basic functions of the state are now at risk. Critics say Temer’s austerity drive hurts the poor more than the rich. According to a survey by Oxfam Brasil, richer Brazilians pay proportionally less tax than the poor and middle classes and the richest 5% earn the same as the rest of the population put together. Yet the highest rate of income tax is just 27.5% . Markets don’t care much about inequality, but the damaging graft allegations against the president and his allies also threaten to inflict further damage on the country’s institutions. Temer seems likely to survive this latest crisis – he is expected to win a second vote in the lower house of congress this week on whether to suspend him for a trial – but trust in Brazil’s political leaders has been drastically undermined. That lack of trust is feeding support for an authoritarian solution to the crisis – which could have serious consequences in next year’s presidential elections. The lower house of congress first voted not to suspend the president for a trial after Temer was charged with corruption, shortly after his government agreed to spend $1.33bn on projects in the states of lawmakers who were due to vote, according to independent watchdog Open Accounts. Many of those lawmakers are allied with powerful agribusiness and evangelical Christian lobbies, and face their own graft investigations. Environmentalists say Temer’s administration is reducing Amazon protection in return for their support. “Our country has been kidnapped by a band of unscrupulous politicians,” former supreme court justice Joaquim Barbosa said afterwards. Temer has since been charged with obstruction of justice; along with six leading figures from his party, the Brazilian Democratic Movement Party, or PMDB, he was charged with racketeering. Janot has also filed charges against Lula, Rousseff and leading members of their Workers’ party – former allies of Temer’s PMDB – and said both parties were part of a criminal organisation that for 15 years had accepted bribes for decisions relating to ports, airports, droughts, oil rigs, tax breaks and hydroelectric plants in the Amazon. Former prosecutor general Rodrigo Janot – who unveiled the charges against the three former presidents – said Temer’s party abandoned Rousseff’s governing coalition because it had failed to stop the graft investigation, which in turn led to the lower house of congress approving impeachment proceedings. “All the members of his criminal organisation, independent of the nucleus they belonged to, had a common interest that united them,” Janot wrote. “The maximum, undue economic advantage for themselves and the others, independent of whether such business attended the public interest or not.” All of the accused have denied the accusations. Temer has said he is the victim of a conspiracy. As supreme court justice Luís Barroso told foreign journalists recently in Rio, formidable interests are protecting themselves. “These people are powerful, they have allies, partners and accomplices everywhere, at the highest echelons, in the powers of the Republic, in the press and where one would least imagine,” he said. But 78% of Brazilians support the graft investigation. And their disillusionment over the way it is playing out at the highest levels opens a dangerous gap for populists and extremists in next year’s presidential elections. Lula is seeking a return to the presidency in 2018 – and currently leads polling, but he has been handed nearly a sentence of nearly 10 years in prison for corruption and money laundering, and may well be ruled ineligible to stand. A likely rightwing candidate is João Doria, the flamboyant, multimillionaire mayor of São Paulo. Like Donald Trump, he is a former host of Brazil’s version of the TV show The Apprentice, only assumed power last January, and has no prior administrative experience. Running second in many polling scenarios is Jair Bolsonaro, a former army captain whose extreme rightwing, authoritarian message plays well with those angry over corruption as well as voters petrified by Brazil’s soaring levels of violent crime. And he enjoys the support of a growing number who argue that Brazil’s armed forces should intervene – as they did in 1964, when they installed a vicious dictatorship that lasted 21 years – an option supported by 43% , according to a September online poll. In September the high-ranking army general Antonio Mourão spooked many when he said that in his view if Brazil’s institutions could not remove those involved in illicit acts from public life, “we will have to impose this”. Bolsonaro defended him. “Democracy isn’t done by buying votes or accepting corruption for governability,” he tweeted to 602,000 followers. “Reacting to this is the obligation of any civilian or SOLDIER.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/oct/11/why-we-should-all-ask-ourselves-am-i-racist","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-11T17:19:11Z","webTitle":"Why we should all ask ourselves: am I racist? | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/11/why-we-should-all-ask-ourselves-am-i-racist","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/oct/11/why-we-should-all-ask-ourselves-am-i-racist","fields":{"headline":"Why we should all ask ourselves: am I racist?","bodyText":"The findings of the government racial equality audit relating to institutional racism (Racial equality audit reveals deep divide, 10 October) should make many of us ask the question: am I racist? All my antecedents, the aggressively territorial history of my people, my family and background and the nature of the society I live in persuade me that I must be. My working-class upbringing and education in the north-west of England provided an infrastructure which ensured that cultural differences between people were not discussed but rank and status were assumed as a matter of course. Prejudice was commonplace and life was pretty much black and white. I recall many years ago the furore around the use of a golliwog as a marketing symbol for a well-known product. What ridiculous nonsense, I thought – but of course it wasn’t. Why on earth should I think it right or acceptable to ridicule people of colour for my amusement? I really didn’t understand. On reflection it was one of those events which makes us question what we believed to be true. I can’t undo my life or deny my past intolerances, but I can learn from them.

Ian Mitchell Preston, Lancashire • The government’s new Ethnicity facts and figures website has to be welcomed, in that it shows the huge disparities that ethnic minorities face in outcomes, compared to their white British counterparts. However, in almost all media coverage, ethnicity has been reported and commented on as being defined by skin colour. As a teacher and educationist working with Gypsy, Roma and Traveller children and young people for over 18 years, it is disturbing to have heard little or nothing specifically about this minority group – especially given that, in every one of the 22 outcomes in the “Education, skills and training” section of the new website (from age five to apprenticeships, further and higher education and after education), Gypsy/Roma and Travellers of Irish heritage are very worryingly and very firmly at the bottom. Let’s hope that this data really does begins a process that drives forward real equality of opportunity for the groups that are most at risk in the education system. Peter Norton Bishop’s Stortford, Hertfordshire • So Theresa May wants the findings from the government audit on race equality to reveal “uncomfortable truths”. One such truth is that almost her first official statement made when she became home secretary in 2010 was that equality had become a “dirty word” (Theresa May scraps legal requirement to reduce inequality, theguardian.com, 17 November 2010). Another is that, consequently, through a succession of government policies (not least austerity) and statements since then, the government has effectively “invisibilised” the issue of “race” and racism which underlies the structural disadvantage which black and ethnic minorities continue to face in this country. Gary Craig Professor emeritus of social justice, University of Hull • The compilation and release of ethnicity data by the government is of course to be welcomed. The irony, of course, is that Tory policies have consistently compounded the social drivers for many of the alarming headline points from the data, and the double whammy is that the current administration are probably the least well equipped for a long time to act on any recommendations for explanation or change stemming from the data release due to its own weaknesses. The debate too in the media appears to be characterised by a narrow focus on personal and “petty” racism. These are institutional and structural issues and as such require a focused and structural response. This has to come from the top. Deryck Browne Chief executive, African Health Policy Network • The new audit on race equality rings alarm bells – and not only because of the shocking disparities on which it shines a light. We should also be extremely concerned about the government’s failure to invest in the UK’s equality bodies. The Equality and Human Rights Commission, for example, exists to tackle discrimination and promote equality. However, its budget has been cut by 75% over the past decade, with still more to come. How can we expect it to do its job effectively, while its funding is aggressively stripped away? The government should also be proactive in supporting the many brilliant grassroots organisations around the UK that work tirelessly to inform people of their rights, and help change attitudes. I support the prime minister’s decision to highlight the glaring inequalities in our communities. However, talk is cheap. If she wants to see change, she will need to make the most of the tools at her disposal – resourcing and empowering the groups that exist to help, but have been starved of the funding to do so. Jean Lambert MEP Green, London • The government’s audit on race reveals that white teenagers are four times more likely to be smokers than black teenagers. Obviously black teenagers and their families are doing something right. What could it be? Can we look forward to the Department of Health funding research to find out? I’m not holding my breath.

Collective X are a group of international musicians, curated by Tottenham-raised Iraqi composer Alya Al-Sultani in response to Brexit. Their music is a Funkadelic-ish political pamphlet with smooth jazz vocals dipping the whole thing in melted chocolate.

Michael Jackson Thriller (Steve Aoki Midnight Hour Remix) The world is divided into people who like Stranger Things and people who thought it was like being yelled at in the pub by an excited man with an I Love The 80s Twitter feed. “Remember ET?!” Me, whimpering: “Yes, of course, please stop spitting crisps at me.” This nostalgia-bothering Jive Bunny-ing of Michael Jackson’s Halloween anthem is like that, but on a massive dose of fashionable rave drugs.

It’s rare, however, to stumble across such a beguiling confluence of voice, delivery, song-writing and vibes as you find in Bedouine, a mesmerising 33-year-old folk singer, still a cult act but deserving of much wider acclaim. When she walks on stage in this pub back room, the LA-dweller actually resembles a character from central Hollywood casting. She wears an intricately embroidered woollen dress – the wrong choice, it turns out, for a sweltering box like this – and round Lennon specs; her wavy tresses have no discernible end. It’s as though the sleeve of a rare 60s album has come alive in front of you. Long, spidery fingers pluck the opening strings of her opening song, You Kill Me, with ease. It’s about wandering – a huge theme in Bedouine’s music. The room falls into a humid hush. Stripped of the sublime Spacebomb studios orchestrations that adorned her self-titled debut album, released in June, there is, equally, now nowhere for her to hide. As song after song unfurls, it becomes clear that Bedouine needs no shelter. Direct and unfussy, her voice can also be feather-light, but it is always imbued with the kind of authority that you wish more women with acoustic guitars aspired to: the feeling, as with Joni Mitchell, that they are sages imparting hard wisdom direct from the source. Tonight, Bedouine sounds nothing like Mitchell – her songs take place octaves lower and stray into mellifluous country (One of These Days) or even warm bossa nova – but there is a core of granite to them. When she sings sweetly about doubt (as on Mind’s Eye) or about tiptoeing around a lover (as on Nice and Quiet), there is no sense of submissiveness, just self-possession. Her songs often deal with love, but never in martyrdom; they are full of conclusions arrived at from observation and so-dry-you-miss-it humour. All these time-honoured concerns come out sounding like retro caresses, but Bedouine’s turns of phrase are often fresh; her eyebrow can arch. “California city parks,” she sings on Back to You, “they talk in exclamation marks/ I am still dying to know what’s exciting.” She plays an untitled new song and wipes sweat from her face with the flared sleeve she can’t roll up. “I feel like an athlete,” she deadpans, when someone hands her a towel. Bedouine named herself after the nomadic Arab people, in keeping with her own peripatetic life. Born in Aleppo of Armenian origin – she would be a shoo-in if you were casting the young, folkie Cher – Azniv Korkejian grew up in Saudi Arabia and attended international schools before a green card lottery landed her family in the US in her teens. When she is not Bedouine, Korkejian is a film and dialogue editor for film and TV; her latest CV point was The Big Sick, the autobiographical romcom starring Kumail Nanjiani. Keen to self-record to tape, Korkejian met analogue engineer Gus Seyffert (Norah Jones, Beck, Roger Waters) and, over a number of years of downtime, they demoed the songs that would become her debut. Lured in by the lovely, Spacebomb-produced Natalie Prass album of 2015, those songs eventually found a natural home at the Virginia studio-cum-label run by Matthew E White. You don’t want to assume too much about someone with family in Syria, but even as it draws from obviously Anglo-American traditions, Bedouine’s music seems informed by a greater-than-average understanding of change, sorrow and the relative importance of things. In interviews, she has revealed how she shares her small place in LA with a large alsatian called Hans and few possessions. She has also expressed a desire to play sousaphone for Solange. One of the night’s standouts, Solitary Daughter sounds like autobiography of the best kind: elliptical, but clear in its declaration of independence. “I don’t need your company to feel saved,” she sings. “I don’t need objects to keep or to pawn.” Shortly after, one fan has to be helped to a seat, literally swooning. It’s unclear whether it’s just the heat."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2017/oct/11/street-barriers-are-a-price-worth-paying-for-our-safety","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-11T17:18:25Z","webTitle":"Street barriers are a price worth paying for our safety | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/11/street-barriers-are-a-price-worth-paying-for-our-safety","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/oct/11/street-barriers-are-a-price-worth-paying-for-our-safety","fields":{"headline":"Street barriers are a price worth paying for our safety","bodyText":"Exhibition Road in South Kensington, London, the scene of a car accident last Saturday that resulted in 11 people being injured (Report, 9 October), was redeveloped several years ago at considerable expense to create a thoroughfare that could accommodate both motorists and pedestrians in some form of symbiotic relationship, where both could thrive in perfect harmony. As a result the streetscape was designed to avoid the erection of unsightly barriers and instead the proximity between motorist and pedestrian was intended to promote a sense of inclusiveness where the motorist in particular was encouraged to pay extra heed to the safety of the pedestrians.

Yet this is precisely what some British MPs have taken it upon themselves to do. Last month, two MPs of Sikh faith fired off a letter – signed by their 140 colleagues – to the head of the Office for National Statistics, asking him to introduce a separate tick-box for Sikh ethnicity on the 2021 census form. This is despite the fact that the Sikhs are not an ethnic group. How can they be when their “ethnicity” is shared by Muslims and Hindus too? Like their Hindu and Muslim counterparts, they are, and will continue to remain, Punjabis. Any attempt to describe them as anything other than Punjabi would be tantamount to redefining the term “ethnicity”. Moreover, the campaign to describe Sikhs as an ethnic group is spearheaded by Sikh separatists, who want to create a separate Sikh state carved out of India. The idea behind the campaign is that if Sikhs are recognised as a separate ethnic group by the Office for National Statistics, such acceptance would add an extra layer of legitimacy to their separatist cause. Randhir Singh Bains Gants Hill, Essex • A leader with some wise words about how a census might accommodate the self-identity of trans people concludes “sexual orientation counts, and a way must be found to count it”.

Add to that the unusual southerly winds and a once-in-200-years event. But though the weather conditions behind the great storm of 1987, the anniversary of which falls this weekend, may now be increasingly understood and analysed by the Met Office, the devastating event will still be remembered for the famous lunchtime forecast by Michael Fish in which he dismissed reports of a hurricane on the way. Thirty years on, the Met Office is confident that any such looming event would now be clearly forecast, probably days in advance, and certainly with at least 12 hours’ warning of its likely severity and impact. “A storm like this would not come out of the blue today,” said Ken Mylne, a Met Office scientist. “You would not be unwarned, but [the warning] would come with a level of risk.” He said storms of this nature were still hard to predict, but that warnings are now given with codes to say how likely they are, with a red warning for the most severe and most likely. The great storm helped spur changes in the way the Met Office does its forecasting, including how it communicates severe weather warnings. Supercomputing power has increased many times over – the average smartphone today has five times the computing power of the Met Office’s best computers in 1987 – which means forecasters can pull together “ensemble” models with data from a wide variety of sources. The data has also improved as today 215 billion readings from satellites are incorporated into Met Office forecasts daily. In 1987, only a few coarse-grained satellite images were available, and these were not used for the standard forecasts that tended to rely on ships, buoys and planes, of which few were operating in the Bay of Biscay where the great storm was brewing. Along with these advances, our understanding of some of the basic physical forces driving the weather has also been transformed. Take the sting jet. Unheard of in 1987, it is an important phenomenon produced by a strong jet of air in the tail of a cloud – hence the sting – wrapped round a low-pressure centre. Reaching 50km across, the jet starts at about 3km or 4km above the earth and descends over three or four hours, while snow and rain falling into it evaporate and cool as the system descends, which help it to accelerate to high speeds. Those speeds can reach more than 100mph, and it is now understood that such a system played a major part in the devastation caused by the great storm. That devastation included 22 deaths across Britain and France, with many more injured, hundreds of thousands of homes left without power, 15m trees torn down and roads and railways disrupted. The great storm was the most damaging to hit the UK since 1703 and at the time caused about £1bn of damage. Technically, Michael Fish was right: the great storm was not a hurricane, but an extratropical cyclone. Hurricanes are driven by warmer water in the sea below, while storms like this one are driven by conditions in the upper atmosphere. However, hurricane-strength winds were experienced, with a high speed of 115mph measured in Shoreham, West Sussex, and 94mph gusts in London between 3am and 4am. Warm winds coming from the south meeting colder air from the north intensified the storm. Although storms may become more frequent as a result of climate change, the conditions that created the 1987 storm are still only likely once in 200 years, according to the Met Office. The Met Office is planning to improve its storm forecasting and early warning systems even further, with severe weather warnings to be produced seven days in advance instead of the current five, along with new warnings of thunder and lightning. The visual design of how these warnings are communicated on the web site is also being improved, and the language used simplified. However, even with much more advanced forecasting systems, the Met Office is still unable to predict the localised effects a severe storm can have, such as damage to trees, which was one of the lasting legacies of the 1987 storm."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"global-development/2017/nov/28/were-neglected-as-if-were-nothing-sacked-workers-desperate-to-get-jobs-back-at-madagascars-port","type":"article","sectionId":"global-development","sectionName":"Global development","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-28T11:00:50Z","webTitle":"'We're neglected as if we're nothing': sacked workers desperate to get jobs back at Madagascar's port","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2017/nov/28/were-neglected-as-if-were-nothing-sacked-workers-desperate-to-get-jobs-back-at-madagascars-port","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2017/nov/28/were-neglected-as-if-were-nothing-sacked-workers-desperate-to-get-jobs-back-at-madagascars-port","fields":{"headline":"'We're neglected as if we're nothing': sacked workers desperate to get jobs back at Madagascar's port","bodyText":"François Bia, now a 50-year-old rickshaw driver, began working at the docks in Toamasina on Madagascar’s east coast in 1989. He carried sacks of rice on his back to and from the ships, or lashed containers to the decks using cables and metal turnbuckles. After 23 years, he was still a day labourer, working for no more than a few dollars a shift. In 2012, he joined a union, hoping to improve his pay and conditions, but managers at the port fired him, along with 42 other dockworkers who had joined the same union. Although union-busting violates national law and international labour standards, the state-owned SMMC, which oversees the handling of non-containerised cargo, has refused to rehire the workers, pay them compensation, or recognise the union. In the rush to attract foreign investment, workers’ rights in Madagascar and across much of Africa are routinely overlooked. In the mid-2000s the port at Toamasina was privatised. The container operations are owned, through a subsidiary, by International Container Terminal Services, Inc, a company that operates 28 terminals around the world, mostly in poorer countries. Enrique K Razon, the Filipino billionaire who runs ICTSI, told the Wall Street Journal that the company’s best returns were in Africa because it receives high fees, due to a lack of competition. Razon did not mention the other reason for the company’s high returns in Africa: very low wages. ICTSI uses the state-owned SMMC as a labour-hire firm. “ICTSI does not want a unionised workforce, and they have used SMMC … to avoid the direct responsibility of employing these workers and entering into a proper social and work contract with them,” said Paddy Crumlin, president of the International Transport Workers’ Federation (ITF). Hans-Ole Madsen, a senior vice-president at ICTSI, denied Crumlin’s allegations. He said ICTSI had a collective bargaining agreement with other workers at the port. However, unionists in Toamasina claim ICTSI only deals with “yellow unions” that rubber-stamp management’s demands. SMMC said there were no workers’ unions at SMMC and did not respond to other questions. Crumlin argues that there is often a double standard in supply-chain management. Many firms, like Levi Strauss &amp; Co, considered a leader in ethical sourcing, promote the rights of their factory workers, but fail to consider how their goods, or clothes, get to market in North America or Europe. Levi’s orders clothes from five factories in Madagascar, and the ITF directly targeted the company in a recent campaign for dockworkers’ rights, since those clothes go through the port in Toamasina. Once Levi’s learned about the situation, the company sent a letter of support for the dockworkers to Madagascar’s labour ministry. But despite mounting international pressure, the fired dockworkers remain stuck in legal limbo. The regional labour and social laws director determined that they had been fired “in an abusive manner” that was “without valid or legal reason”. Local courts have repeatedly ruled in the dockworkers’ favour, calling SMMC’s behaviour “a violation of international labour standards” and “above all an unconstitutional act”. Yet the courts have not compelled SMMC to compensate or re-employ the dockworkers, and lately the case has stalled, partly down to court clerks in Toamasina and partly because hearings have been postponed over concerns about the plague outbreak. “I admit that it’s a big sport, a big battle, a big battle to fight,” said Hermann Tandra, Madagascar’s general director of labour and social laws. Tandra’s ministry has relatively little power; it cannot unilaterally reinstate the 43 fired dockworkers. (The prime minister’s office, which could exert influence, did not respond to requests for comment for this story.) In April, a complaint was filed on behalf of the dockworkers to the International Labour Organisation. The ILO has not yet ruled on the matter. Meanwhile, hundreds of workers still at the port are engaged in their own struggle to be recognised as permanent employees with proper contracts and benefits. According to Madagascar’s labour code, they should be given this status after six months of work. SMMC says this rule doesn’t apply to their dockworkers, who are not continuously employed if ships are not at port. But a local court ruled in 2014 that “there is no doubt that the claimants have for a long time filled the requirements for a permanent contract”. Many have worked at the port for decades and remain day labourers, but, as in the case of the 43, the court has not yet ordered concrete action to be taken. ICTSI are not directly involved in this case, but Madsen said that on a given day, more than 90% of ICTSI’s workers at the Toamasina port are full-time employees. “Multinational corporations have more lawyers than many of the unions have members,” said Bastian Schulz, director of the Friedrich-Ebert-Stiftung Trade Union Competence Centre in Johannesburg. FES, a political foundation affiliated with the Social Democratic Party of Germany, is one of only a handful of international organisations working to support unions in Africa. Strengthening unions could alleviate many of the problems African societies face: inequality, low wages, and weak social safety nets. Research shows that unions help in all of these areas, for members and non-members alike. In countries like Madagascar, unions may also serve another important function: increasing civic participation. A new study suggests unions in Africa serve as “schools of democracy” where members learn to organise and engage with issues that go well beyond the immediate concerns of their union. An earlier study found that: “As workers gained increased control of their lives at the workplace, they also wanted decision-making powers in their lives after working hours.” That will be of little comfort to François Bia in the struggle to support his family. Within a year of being fired in 2012, two of his children, then aged 10 and 16, stopped going to school because he could no longer afford to pay the fees. He now earns about $2 a day on the rickshaw, but his small body has started to break down after his years working on the docks and the creaky streets. He is not allowed access to the hospital that the port’s permanent workers use, despite his years of service, and he cannot afford a doctor’s visit, so he rubs ravintsara (literally, “good leaf”) balm into his aching muscles when he gets home. Meanwhile, he says, the managers at the port grow ever more wealthy. “If there were true human rights, it would not be like this,” he told me. “We have families and we have rent to pay, and we need to send our children to school. But we are neglected as if we are nothing, as if we are not human beings at all.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/oct/11/stanislav-petrov-obituary","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-11T16:08:29Z","webTitle":"Stanislav Petrov obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/11/stanislav-petrov-obituary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/oct/11/stanislav-petrov-obituary","fields":{"headline":"Stanislav Petrov obituary","bodyText":"Stanislav Petrov, who has died aged 77, was a largely unsung hero of the cold war, whose calm common sense saved the world from nuclear war. In 1983, he was a lieutenant colonel in the Soviet air defence forces and duty officer at Serpukhov-15, a secret command centre outside Moscow that monitored Soviet early warning satellites orbiting over the US. Early in the morning of 26 September, alarms went off and computers sent signals that a US Minuteman intercontinental ballistic missile had been launched from an American base. A few seconds later they seemed to detect that four more missiles had been launched. “We were in a state of shock,” Petrov recalled. “We needed to understand, ‘What’s next?’” It was his job to tell his superiors, who would report to the general staff of the Soviet military. They would then consult the Soviet leader, Yuri Andropov, about launching a counterattack. Petrov’s computer systems said the reliability of the satellites’ information was at the “highest” level. Only 25 minutes would pass between the missiles’ launch and their detonation. “There was no rule about how long we were allowed to think before we reported a strike,” he told the BBC in 2013. “But we knew that every second of procrastination took away valuable time, that the Soviet Union’s military and political leadership needed to be informed without delay. All I had to do was to reach for the phone, to raise the direct line to our top commanders – but I couldn’t move. I felt as if I was sitting on a hot frying pan.” He decided to report the alert as a system malfunction. “I had a funny feeling in my gut,” he told the Washington Post in 1999. “I didn’t want to make a mistake. I made a decision, and that was it.” His misgivings proved well founded. Although they would not have registered activity until several minutes after any launch, Soviet ground-based radar installations that can track missiles rising above the horizon did not detect an attack. The false alarm was apparently caused by the satellite mistaking the sun’s reflection off the tops of high-altitude clouds for a missile launch. The incident happened at a particularly critical period during the cold war. The US president, Ronald Reagan, had denounced the Soviet Union as an “evil empire” and was rapidly enhancing the US nuclear arsenal. Pershing II medium-range missiles were about to be installed in western Europe, shortening the time between nuclear launch and Soviet territory. Since mid-February 1981 the US had been testing Soviet radar and satellite vulnerabilities with a series of near-penetrations of Soviet territory. Clandestine naval operations stealthily accessed waters near the Barents, Norwegian, Black and Baltic seas, demonstrating how close Nato ships could get to critical Soviet bases. US bombers flew directly towards Soviet airspace, peeling off only at the last moment, sometimes several times a week. The Soviet leadership feared Washington was preparing an all-out sneak attack. In early September 1983 a Soviet fighter plane shot down a Korean Air commercial flight after it crossed into Soviet airspace, believing it was a spy plane. All those on board were killed. In this heightened atmosphere, Petrov’s response to the computers’ warning of missile launches was remarkably cool-headed. At first he was praised for his action, but after an investigation was reprimanded for failing to record everything properly in the log book. Asked why he had failed in this respect, he replied: “Because I had a phone in one hand and the intercom in the other, and I don’t have a third hand.” Petrov was born near Vladivostok in the Soviet far east. His father had been a second world war fighter pilot. His mother was a nurse. After studying at the Kiev higher engineering radio-technical college of the Soviet air force, he joined the air defence forces. Gaining quick promotion, he was assigned to the early warning system when it began in the early 1970s. He retired from the military in 1984 and became a senior engineer at the research institute that had created the early warning system. His role in averting all-out nuclear war received prominence only in 1998, when Col Gen Yury Votintsev, the retired commander of Soviet missile defence, mentioned him in his memoirs. In 2006 Petrov went to New York to receive an award from the Association of World Citizens. In 2013 he won the Dresden peace prize and in 2014 Jakob Staberg, a film producer, made a documentary-drama, The Man Who Saved the World, about him. In spite of his decisive action at one of the tensest periods of Soviet-US confrontation, Petrov spent his retirement alone in virtual obscurity in Fryazino, a Moscow suburb, unrewarded by his country’s authorities. His death went unannounced for four months: after several failed attempts to telephone him over the summer, Karl Schumacher, a German researcher who had befriended him years earlier, made contact with Petrov’s son, Dmitri, who confirmed his father had died of pneumonia in May. Petrov’s wife, Raisa, died in 1997. He is survived by Dmitri, and a daughter, Yelena. • Stanislav Petrov, air defence officer, born 7 September 1939; died 19 May 2017"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"news/2017/oct/13/looking-back-cycling","type":"article","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-13T08:00:27Z","webTitle":"Looking back: cycling","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2017/oct/13/looking-back-cycling","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/2017/oct/13/looking-back-cycling","fields":{"headline":"Looking back: cycling","bodyText":"Despite his support for cycling, CP Scott, former Guardian editor, wrote in 1878 about reckless ‘bicyclists’ riding too fast and even endangering pedestrians.

The idea of ego in food has come up in conversation a lot recently. It’s often thought to be what distinguishes home cooking from restaurant cooking, though there are exceptions: you’ll certainly find ego-driven cooks in home kitchens and the most gentle, generous cooks in restaurants. It’s had me thinking about what home cooking really means. What would be the most ego-less dish? A boiled egg? A bowl of cereal? Beans on toast? They all stem from a need to get food on the table for hungry people quickly, be that yourself or those you love. It’s an act of giving. And that’s the definition of home cooking that I’ve settled on. These dinners both come together in a single pan, and are ready, from the moment you start chopping or grating, in under half an hour. They make use of easy-to-find ingredients and leave little washing up. Most of all, they both bring the kind of flavour hit that makes you think they took longer to make than they did. I’m not sure I’ve quite managed ego-less cooking with them yet though; I still want to hear the hungry clatter of forks and spoons, the oohs and ahhs, the compliments to the chef … It’s a work in progress.

Serves 4 2 tbsp extra virgin olive oil 2 x 400g tins butter beans, drained 400g vine or cherry tomatoes 200g kale, washed, stems removed, roughly torn 50g walnuts, lightly toasted 2 garlic cloves, finely sliced Nutmeg, freshly grated The zest and juice of a lemon Salt Parmesan (I use a vegetarian one), for grating on top, optional 1 Heat the olive oil in a large frying pan over a high heat. Add the beans in a single layer. Stir to coat the beans in the oil, then let them sit long enough to brown on one side – about 3-4 minutes – before turning to brown the other side for about the same length of time. The beans should be golden and a bit crunchy on the outside. 2 Add the tomatoes and allow them to cook for a few minutes, or until they begin to break down. 3 Add a little more oil to the pan and allow it to heat a little. Add the kale and a pinch of salt to the pan, then cook for a couple of minutes, turning all the time until it is tender and the edges have crisped. 4 Stir in the walnuts and garlic, then wait 10 seconds and stir in a good grating of nutmeg. Wait another 10 seconds and stir in the lemon juice and zest. Remove from the heat. Serve with grated parmesan and some bread for a hearty meal. One-pot orzo with beetroot, thyme and orange You can use any colour of beetroot you like here – I adore the deep magenta or the red ones, but yellow and pink work well too. Vegans can leave out the feta. Serves 4 4 large beetroots, peeled and grated (prepared weight around 500g) 300g orzo pasta A small bunch of thyme 1 tsp salt 2 tbsp olive oil, plus more for finishing Zest of 1 small orange or clementine 100g feta cheese 4 handfuls rocket or other peppery leaves 1 Put the grated beetroots, pasta and picked thyme into the pan with the salt, 2 tbsp oil and 850ml water. Put the pan on a high heat, cover with a lid and bring to the boil. Simmer for 10 minutes, or until the pasta has cooked and the water has been absorbed. Stir regularly to prevent the pasta from catching on the bottom of the pan. 2 Spoon on to warm plates and finish with some orange zest, peppery leaves, a crumbling of feta and a good drizzle of olive oil.

The bid to oust University College Dublin’s Katie Ascough over her strong anti-abortion views comes ahead of what is widely expected to be a rancorous wider campaign in the run-up to next year’s planned abortion reform referendum. A vote on whether to abolish the eighth amendment to the Irish constitution, which gives equal rights to life for a foetus and a pregnant woman, will take place next summer and the clash between some students and their president at UCD is being seen as the opening skirmish. Ascough faces impeachment over her “executive decision” to remove information from the UCD student handbook including pregnancy help websites, the prices of abortion in other countries, including Britain, and information on abortion pills. A vote on whether or not to remove her from office, triggered by 1,200 students signing a petition, will be held on 25-26 October. Ascough has claimed she made her decision after taking legal advice that suggested publishing the information would be illegal. Removing it cost the students’ union an estimated €8,000 (£7,185). Ivana Bacik, who as Trinity College student union president was threatened with prison in 1989 when she published abortion information in the freshers’ handbook, said there was no legal basis for Ascough withdrawing the information. Now an Irish Labour party senator and law lecturer, Bacik was successfully defended with three other student union officials by the future Irish president Mary Robinson. The case led to a referendum three years later that added a clause to the eighth amendment making freedom of information on abortion services lawfully available in another state. “I don’t see how the decision to withdraw the abortion information for students at UCD was based on any legal argument,” she said. “In reality, for decades now, students’ unions in Ireland have been publishing information in freshers’ handbooks on where to obtain abortions outside Ireland. That generally means that they have been printing the contact details of clinics like Marie Stopes and BPAS in England, alongside information on other options open to women facing a crisis pregnancy, such as contact details for single parent support networks and adoption agencies. “By providing abortion information in this way, they are not advocating or promoting abortion. No students’ union has been prosecuted for any breach of the 1995 act as a result,” Bacik said. Anti-abortion groups such as the Society for the Protection of Unborn Children and traditional Catholic campaigners in the Iona Institute have accused pro-choice activists of trying to censor their arguments. They have said the impeachment of the UCD student president is part of that censorship strategy. They point to the cutting down of posters advertising an anti-abortion meeting in Dublin last month by two men who said they belonged to the leftwing party People Before Profit. The anti-abortion organisations also allege that hotels that were due to host pro-life events were intimidated and threatened to cancel the meetings."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/oct/14/lemon-tart-recipe-jeremy-lee-king-of-puddings","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-14T09:00:03Z","webTitle":"Jeremy Lee’s recipe for lemon tart | King of puddings","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/oct/14/lemon-tart-recipe-jeremy-lee-king-of-puddings","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/oct/14/lemon-tart-recipe-jeremy-lee-king-of-puddings","fields":{"headline":"Jeremy Lee’s alluring recipe for lemon tart","bodyText":"A beautiful lemon – preferably with leaves attached and picked somewhere near Naples – has an almighty ability to cheer even the most frazzled of cooks. Depicted in every form imaginable, they are a fruit that inspires artists and, in more modern times, photographers, almost as much as they do chefs. Lemons have an allure unlike any other fruit. They have become vital to sparking up almost any dish with an elusive vigour that only they can provide. They feature in an abundance of dishes, savoury as well as sweet – from dressing a leafy salad to finishing the caper and black butter sauce one tips on a wing of charred skate for raie au beurre noir. And, when added to puddings, cakes, creams, custards and biscuits, a lemon is the perfect foil for any cloying sweetness. Like so many ingredients, it is hard to imagine a time when lemons were rare and precious fruits. That said, their cost is still almighty if it is the great, unwaxed lemons from the Amalfi you are buying. There are myriad others, but just as it is only the white truffles from Alba make the grade, so it is with these legendary lemons. It is not even the juice so much as the oils in the skin, when zested, that make the heart skip a beat. Worry not: I shall not ask you to spend the month’s rent on lemons, although sometimes it feels like that at Quo Vadis. Once we used to fill huge baskets with lemons in the reception. However, the heap seemed to diminish rather quickly – it appeared everyone thought the lemons so lovely they would take one or two home with them. This expense is not, thankfully, necessary with this lemon tart, a pudding that sparks the imagination and gathers attention like few others. Now, there are a great many recipes for lemon tart; indeed, there may be a real beauty when the lemons are in season in winter. But I like this recipe very much, for it retains the finely grated zest, which adds a curious curd-like quality – both homely and comforting. And, crucially, there is much lemony zip. Should you have a few pieces of candied lemon peel at hand, to add some joviality to the tart, by all means cut thin slices and strew them liberally around the edges. A bowl of whipped cream, as ever, seems somehow appropriate. Lemon tart The pastry is best made the day before. Have ready a deep-fluted tart case, about 22cm wide by 2cm deep, with a removable base. Serves 12 For the pastry 170g flour, plus more for rolling 100g cold unsalted butter, cubed A pinch of salt 1 tsp icing sugar 1 egg 1 tbsp cream For the lemon filling Zest and juice of 9 medium lemons 6 eggs 375g caster sugar 525g creme fraiche 6 tbsp rum 1 Set the oven to 170C/335F/gas 3½. Sift the flour into a bowl. Cut the butter into small pieces. Drop the butter into the flour with a pinch of salt. Lightly work these together with your fingertips until a fine crumb forms, then add the icing sugar. 2 Beat the egg. Add the cream and stir well. Pour this into the pastry and knead into a dough. Tip on to a clean surface and knead lightly and deftly until the pastry is smooth. Wrap in clingfilm and refrigerate for at least an hour – preferably overnight. 3 It is vital the tart case does not leak, so clear the surfaces of all clutter before proceeding. On a lightly floured surface, gently roll out the pastry in a disc and line the tart case. Put the tart case in the fridge to settle for at least 30 minutes. Meanwhile, make two discs of greaseproof paper. Have ready a big bag of dried beans and/or rice. 4 Remove the tart from the fridge. Carefully line the tart case with the greaseproof paper. Pour the beans and or rice on top of the paper to fill the case. Put the tart case in the oven and bake for 15 minutes, or until the edge of the pastry is golden. Turn down the heat to 140C/275F/gas 1 and cook for a further 10 minutes. 5 Remove the tart case from the oven. With care, slowly lift the paper from the case. Keep the rice or beans for future baking endeavours. Return the tart case to the oven for 5 minutes more. (There may be cracks. Should these appear, remove the tart from the oven. Place on a surface. Crack two egg whites into a bowl and keep the yolks as an excellent excuse for mayonnaise. Beat the whites with a fork until lightly frothed. Brush the inside of the tart case liberally with the beaten whites. Return the tart to the oven for 1 minute only. Remove and set to one side.) 6 Finely grate the zest from the lemons, then juice them. 7 Crack the eggs into a large bowl and beat them well. Add the sugar and beat well. Now add the creme fraiche, then the lemon juice, then the zest, and finally the rum, mixing all very well together. Let the lemon cream settle. 8 Spoon away any froth that settles upon the surface. Decant the lemon cream into a jug, put the tart case back in the oven, holding the shelf and tray out far enough to allow the cream to be poured from the jug into the tart. Turn down the oven temperature to oven to 130C/265F/gas ½ – you don’t want the filling to colour or bubble so keep an eye on it. 9 Carefully push the shelf and filled tart back into the oven. Close the door. Bake for 45 minutes, checking from time to time that the tart is not colouring. It should take an hour, but often takes 15 minutes or even half an hour longer. It is wise to be patient here. 10 When the tart is cooked and there be just the faintest wobble upon the surface when jiggled, remove from the oven and cool.

Personally, I don’t like talking about stigma – the more you talk about something, the more you entrench it. People often cite fear of stigma as the reason they don’t talk about their mental illness, but I think it runs deeper than that. Before I was anorexic I’d always assumed people with mental illness knew they weren’t well. But on reflection that’s ridiculous. My Dad has diabetes. He had it for years before anyone realised and no one expected him to innately know. Sometimes you’re too close to your own life to gain perspective; it’s like trying to make sense of a painting if you’re only inches from it. It’s really hard to find the words to describe my anorexia – it was more of a feeling, a lacking, an awareness I wasn’t really coping. I didn’t know I was doing this any more than you know you are breathing right now. It was just something I did, a process. I didn’t realise how different aspects of my thinking were entwined with my eating disorder – calorie counting, anxiety, mood swings, lack of attention span, lack of sex drive, constant coldness. That’s why it took me so long to ask for help. My anorexia didn’t really begin so much as develop. That might sound pedantic, but it’s important – it took time to grip me and even longer to realise. It’s hard to tell when a social drinker becomes an alcoholic; it’s the same with mental illness. It’s not like you can compare your experience against anyone else’s so it’s hard to tell when things go a bit wonky upstairs. Over the years anorexia became my normality, always playing in the background without me really realising. I think one of the first triggers was when I got a role in a school play. I had to appear topless, so I decided to lose some weight. As I lost weight people kept on telling me I looked good. That was the word they kept repeating over and over again: “good”. But anorexia wasn’t about vanity, it was about validation – for the first time in my life people kept telling me I was good at something, like they accepted me. Around that time I had all the pressures most teenagers have – exams, deadlines and university looming. Some deal with it better than others, but I didn’t deal with it well. Everything felt a bit too intense. Over time, restriction, weighing and calorie counting became a coping mechanism, a distraction from life. It was something else to focus on, something above real life and something I enjoyed. If I could just reduce my calorie intake, exercise more and weigh less I believed somehow everything would fall into place. I wanted to talk but I didn’t know what to say. I was waiting for something to happen so I could classify myself as ill. I was worried people wouldn’t take me seriously, that if I didn’t explain myself properly people would think I was attention-seeking or pathetic. So I understand why more people don’t just talk, because sometimes finding the words can seem impossible. Not all the silence on mental illness is to do with stigma. It’s also about finding the right words.

I didn’t even know you could until I watched my mum do it on a packed commuter train during the school holidays. She would be taking us to a daycare scheme subsided by the civil service – her employer – in London. Travelling from our tiny cottage in Woking, Surrey, we would catch an early train to Waterloo. She would let me have the last empty seat and would stand, holding on to a rail with one hand, her head heavy, chin pointing to the floor, deep, slow breaths. She was fast asleep. She would snatch sleep as quickly as time snatched it away again. In the summer months, she would nap in St James’s Park during her lunchbreak. In the evening, when she sat on the sofa, my brother or I would shout “Mum!” as her red wine spilt with the judder of her heavy, tired head. She was always tired. That is what I remember growing up, watching a 1980s superwoman trying to “have it all”. Aside from the fact that “having it all” was a nasty trick played by men to allow a new generation of women into the workplace as long as they continued to look after the kids and clean the house, her “having it all” plan had a few holes. My father left when my brother was four and I was three weeks old. I am pretty sure there is nothing harder than being a single parent to a toddler and a baby, but her office job wasn’t exactly easy, either. Her alarm would go off at 5.15am. She would sneak out in the dark to feed an extension lead through a downstairs window and into the car to power a small electric heater because she could not afford to have the broken one in the car fixed. She would then spend the day trying to explain why public officials had said or done what they had, to a legion of journalists who would call her from 6am to 1am. We had nannies and childminders in term time. One childminder had a chocolate labrador called Marmite. When my mum came to collect me, he would sit down on the sofa next to her and rest his paw on her shoulder. Everyone, it seemed, could see how tired she was. Her office, consistent with the attitudes of many in the 80s and 90s, was punishing for a working mother, especially a single, career-focused one. I remember the time she was called into central London on Mothering Sunday. I had cried because she had to leave our lunch. When she arrived at the office, she realised it was an exercise in power play, not an emergency. She made sacrifices. How many I will probably never know; she sacrificed her time – and, yes, her sense of self, surely. Most obviously, I remember that the house that we moved into when my father left only had two bedrooms. When my brother and I were too old to share a bunkbed, the cellar became her bedroom although it had no windows. A friend cut her single bed in half to fit it down there. I, however, looked on with pride. My mum’s job in London was far more exciting that any of my friends’ dads’ jobs. And although I knew my mum was different – she wasn’t at home like other mums, she couldn’t make it to school Christmas fetes like other mums – I never felt resentful, just proud; a beaming, chest-bursting pride. Her working life was the opposite of what many hysterical, shaming headlines (and a few interfering individuals) have suggested over the years: her career was the most profound and total commitment to her children – not just to be able to afford to send us on school trips, but to show us what women can do and, in turn, what we could do. Yet there was one feeling that was difficult to stomach, and that was guilt. The older I became – even as a stroppy, selfish, boy-chasing teen – I was increasingly aware of the hours, the sacrifice, the commute, the dog-tiredness. I was aware of the ceaseless uphill grind that she had endured for decades. Which was all for me and my brother. Then, a couple of years ago, she retired. Suddenly, her life changed completely. No more 5.15am alarms. Instead, every week it is Zumba and pilates and afternoons at the local cinema with her neighbour and a large glass of red. It is trips to the Tate, the British Film Institute and the Imperial War Museum. It is walks on the beach with new and old friends. It is attending local council meetings to single-handedly overthrow the Conservative party – but always home in time for a bath and Front Row on Radio 4. Just like that, the grind was over. And now my chest is bursting again, but this time with happiness and relief. Now she is not snatching sleep or time or moments with her children. Now, finally, she is living for her – not me. And selfishly, I feel atoned. Now time ebbs and flows with her command. That feeling of guilt in me has lifted. Her once-furrowed brow, anxiously staring into an arsenal of phone screens and pagers and notebooks, now light with smiles when I arrive at her house on a cold, dark evening, and I am the one who is tired, falling asleep on the sofa. Every time she texts me to tell me she is doing the things she didn’t do for 30 years – a Thursday morning yoga class or watching the 6pm news – I remember the tea bags kept in the fridge to cool her tired eyes. And I think: she is not tired any more. Her life in retirement makes me think about my own future. She owns a house, she has a pension – things I will probably never achieve. She is a baby boomer – isn’t that the demographic who actually “have it all”? The system worked for her, in some ways. She worked hard, and now she has security. Although I will never have those things, the payoff is that I will never work that hard in the way she did; both practically, as we shift ever closer to flexible working, but also culturally. I will never have to be all of those things to all of those people. I won’t have to work so hard to prove to men that I am capable or to prove to other mums that I am dedicated, or prove to teachers that being a working single mother is not a concern but in fact will fill a daughter’s chest with pride and her mind with ambition and independence. Now I understand that is precisely why she worked so hard, so that my life would be easier than hers; so that I am not tired with the same burdens she faced; so that I don’t have to fall asleep standing up."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"film/2017/oct/11/happy-death-day-review-jessica-rothe","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-11T16:10:16Z","webTitle":"Happy Death Day review – Groundhog Day meets Scream in gore-free horror","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/oct/11/happy-death-day-review-jessica-rothe","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2017/oct/11/happy-death-day-review-jessica-rothe","fields":{"headline":"Happy Death Day review – Groundhog Day meets Scream in gore-free horror","bodyText":"Given horror’s box-office dominance in 2017 (It, Get Out and Split remain three of the year’s biggest hits), it seems only right that the slasher movie receives the resurrection it deserves. But one of the many reasons it died again after Scream brought it back to life was a reluctance from audiences to feel terrified by the relative simplicity of a man bearing a knife. Why get scared over another rubber mask, when there are evil dolls, demons, clowns, poltergeists and zombies instead? In an attempt to elevate a familiar structure, eager new comedy horror Happy Death Day takes the classic slasher formula and adds a nifty twist. Theresa, known as Tree (Jessica Rothe), is waking up in a bad place: a dorm room, to be exact. She’s not quite sure how she got there, but a hangover and someone called Carter (Israel Broussard) are all the clues she needs. Even worse, it’s her birthday, an occasion she loathes, and the ensuing 24 hours provide her with social embarrassment, romantic entanglements, sorority sister drama and, well, her death. But then Tree wakes up, stuck in the same day, unable to break the cycle until she finds out who wants her dead. It’s Groundhog Day meets Scream, although lacking the first film’s novelty and the latter’s postmodern smarts. There’s a slick, brightly lit peppiness that makes it a mostly easy watch, and the heightened performances (sassy bitch, dumb jock, geeky nerd) clue us into the fact that this is targeted at a younger teen audience. It feels aimed at a sleepover crowd, the scares never truly landing and, despite the many, many deaths, the gore almost entirely absent. And here’s where a key problem lies. We’re made aware of the format early on, so Tree’s repetitious deaths have very little impact as we know that soon after she’ll be up again to endure the same. (A late-in-the-day attempt to suggest that each death had a physical toll is poorly explained). It drains much of the suspense from each differently staged murder, something Final Destination managed so well, and this would be at least partly recovered if we were made to feel that Tree’s endings were horribly painful, but in securing a lower rating, the film is almost entirely gore-free. It’s a strange, regressive decision, especially given that it’s the product of Blumhouse, the phenomenally successful production company that’s scored major R-rated successes with Get Out, the Purge franchise and the Paranormal Activity series. In the slasher movie canon, there’s something naive and likable about how it seems to exist in a pre-Scream universe, before we were all made aware of the cliches that dominate the subgenre. There’s plenty of walking down dark tunnels, asking “Who’s there?” and general behavior that would have most horror fans eye-rolling. For a while this proves entertaining in a silly 80s throwback way, but in the final stretch this simplicity becomes distracting, with a poorly constructed ending featuring one of the most staggeringly stupid motivations for a killer ever written. Rothe keeps it mostly watchable with a well-pitched comic performance, and until she’s slut-shamed near the end there’s something interesting about a female slasher movie lead who’s so sexually uninhibited. There are some fun, bitchy one-liners but the script feels underworked, with some especially heinous dialogue (“Will you please stop staring at me like I just took a dump on your mom’s head?”), some nonsensical plotting (Tree hates her birthday and wants no one to know yet has changed her ringtone to a birthday song) and a handful of emotional beats that have zero impact. The slasher movie remains dead and buried. For now.

Ashley Tabor, 40, had hoped to knock together two properties at the top of the luxury Knightsbridge Apartments complex to create a £200m penthouse flat with 10 bedrooms, a cinema, “butler’s pantry” and “service kitchen”. But Westminster’s director of planning on Wednesday recommended that Tabor’s plan should be rejected because of the council’s policy against merging homes. The council’s planning committee will vote on the project on 17 October. To create the huge apartment, which could have been one of London’s most expensive homes, Tabor bought the flat next door to his existing residence in the block for £90m earlier this year. He bought his first flat in the luxury block, which is a stone’s throw from Harrods and popular with wealthy Russian and Middle Eastern families, for £15m in 2006. In his application, submitted by luxury planning firm Gerald Eve, Tabor said he needed “a large, modern family home where the family could live separately from guest accommodation and other more public areas of the house”. The proposed flat would have occupied 1,418 sq m (15,260 sq ft) – making it more than 15 times the size of the average UK home. Luxury property experts said that if the plan does get the go-ahead, it could be worth £200m and would eclipse the current record-setting £135m triplex apartment in the One Hyde Park development down the street. Westminster’s planning director noted that Tabor has lived in the borough for a decade and employed about 500 people at Global, his entertainment company, which owns Capital FM, Heart and LBC radio stations. The official said that “in planning terms, they cannot be considered reasons that would overcome the strong presumption in policy to protect residential accommodation in Westminster and optimise the delivery of housing in London as a whole”. Tabor is the son of gambling tycoon Michael Tabor, whose wealth is estimated at £625m. He is credited with helping discover acts including The Wanted and Corinne Bailey Rae, and is known for throwing popular parties at his Barbados mansion, Sunset Reef. Henry Pryor, a luxury property buying agent, said it was very unlikely that Westminster councillors would overrule the planning director’s advice when they meet to vote on the plans next week. “The political environment has changed and everyone is against knocking two homes into one. Almost everyone thinks we should be increasing housing stock, not decreasing it.” he said. “It’s perhaps refreshing to find that money can’t buy you everything.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2017/oct/11/grenfell-fire-only-10-households-affected-have-permanent-homes","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-11T17:59:23Z","webTitle":"Grenfell fire: only 10 households affected have permanent homes","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/oct/11/grenfell-fire-only-10-households-affected-have-permanent-homes","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2017/oct/11/grenfell-fire-only-10-households-affected-have-permanent-homes","fields":{"headline":"Grenfell fire: only 10 households affected have permanent homes","bodyText":"Only 10 of the households made homeless by the Grenfell Tower fire have been permanently rehoused four months after the blaze, the communities minister has told MPs. Sajid Javid revealed that officials are trying to rehouse 203 households following the fire in June that claimed about 80 lives. That is more than the 151 homes that were lost in the tower and in neighbouring Grenfell Walk, because many households have chosen to split and be rehoused separately, he said. Just over half of the households – 111 – have accepted offers of either temporary or permanent accommodation. Of those, 44 have moved in to temporary homes and 10 into permanent homes. That leaves 92 households yet to accept accommodation of any kind. “Clearly, a large number still remain in hotels and emergency accommodation and on top of that there are also others in hotels following the tragedy who haven’t lost their homes but they may have been damaged or the families traumatised,” Javid said. He said the delay was partly down to families asking for redecoration or specific furniture in their new homes, as was their right, adding that the council was aiming to ensure no one is living in hotels at Christmas, unless they want to be. Javid said the priority in trying to get people rehoused as quickly as possible was to “listen very carefully to what each family wants, what they say their needs are and to move at their pace”. He said: “If they change their minds or are unclear ... we are giving them more time. No one is being pushed in any way into reaching a decision. There are still some families, particularly the bereaved families, who are not ready to make a decision and do not want to engage in the process.” Javid said there have been several occasions where families cannot decide whether they want to be near their old home or even outside the borough. Some individuals have said they prefer to stay in hotel rooms at the moment while other families have refused several properties. He reported that the London Borough of Kensington and Chelsea has bought 167 new permanent homes and has 130 temporary properties available. Bereaved families are being given first refusal, followed by disabled people, those with children and then the rest, in a system agreed in consultation with the survivors group Grenfell United. Meanwhile, survivors who feared deportation because of their uncertain immigration status are to be allowed permanent residency in the UK, the Home Office has announced. Some residents were unwilling to come forward to help investigations because under normal circumstances their immigration status could have led them to be removed from the country. In the wake of the fire, ministers said such residents could be granted 12 months’ limited leave to remain in the UK, but that has now been extended to permanent status following pressure from survivors’ campaign groups and the shadow home secretary, Diane Abbott. It is believed to affect no more than 20 people. “Since the Grenfell Tower immigration policy was announced, we have been planning for the future of those residents affected by these unprecedented events and listening to their feedback, as well as the views of Sir Martin Moore-Bick [chairman of the public inquiry],” said Brandon Lewis, immigration minister. “The government believes it is right to provide this specific group of survivors greater certainty over their long-term future in the UK, subject to their continued eligibility and the necessary security and criminality checks being met.” The policy will apply to residents of the tower at the time of the blaze and people living in adjacent buildings who lost their homes permanently. They must come forward before 30 November to have their limited leave extended and to qualify for permanent residence after a total period of five years. Earlier the chancellor, Philip Hammond, confirmed that councils that need to spend millions of pounds on making similar tower blocks safe from fire will not automatically receive government funding, and that it will only be handed out as a “last resort”. Last weekend the Guardian reported that several councils are in dispute with ministers over who would pay to retrofit sprinklers to dozens of tower blocks and to replace cladding similar to that which burned so ferociously on Grenfell Tower. Hammond told the Commons Treasury select committee: “Any safety-critical work that is required needs to be carried out. We will not allow a situation to arise where a housing authority or a social landlord, due to lack of financial resource, cannot carry out safety-critical work. That does not mean the government will automatically step in and provide funding for that safety-critical work.” He said the government would look at “moving ringfences” to allow councils to spend protected funding and claimed the government had asked councils that warned they did not have the money to set out the details. He said that as a “last resort”, when a council “genuinely does not have any available resource”, the government would make sure the money was provided. Moore-Bick’s public inquiry into the disaster appears unlikely to start taking evidence until the new year."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2017/oct/21/jacob-rees-mogg-given-screen-time","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-21T07:00:16Z","webTitle":"The next time Jacob Rees-Mogg is given screen time, I will break the television","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/oct/21/jacob-rees-mogg-given-screen-time","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2017/oct/21/jacob-rees-mogg-given-screen-time","fields":{"headline":"The next time Jacob Rees-Mogg is given screen time, I will break the television","bodyText":"My wife has taken to keeping Lucretius’s On The Nature Of Things by her bedside. I don’t know what this signifies, but I’ve responded with Seneca’s Moral And Political Essays. I’m only dipping in at the moment, but already I’ve found the following: “The best should be preferred by the majority and instead the populace chooses the worst.” Just another 1st-century metropolitan elitist, you might think, but mistrusting majority opinion doesn’t necessarily equate with looking down on people. In a letter to Lucilius, procurator of Sicily, Seneca warned against condescension. “You must inevitably either hate or imitate the world. But the right thing is to shun both courses: you should neither become like the bad because they are many, nor be an enemy of the many because they are unlike you.” So how does one put this sage advice into practice when it comes to the will of the British people, the concealed prevarications of the Labour party, the open warfare within the Tory party and all the other Referendum-related vexations – including and in particular Jacob Rees-Mogg – that try our patience in the day and trouble our sleep, if we’re getting any, at night? Answer: I have no idea, but I’m going on reading. What’s becoming plainer is that we can’t continue in our deliberations, both with each other and with other countries, until we accept the fallibility of the majority. The next time Rees-Mogg is given television time to tell us a) how cute he finds his own persona; and b) that we are bound by the “will of the British people”, I will break the television. Rees-Mogg is not only, by self-definition, a democrat, he is also a mind-reader. He knows precisely what the British people voted for: how long they expected negotiations to last, how big a divorce settlement they were prepared to pay, where they stood on transition, the Single Market, the Customs Union and countless other legal and financial particulars on which their views coincided exactly with his. Given that the British people only voted yes or no to the question “Should the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union?” this is a remarkable feat of clairvoyancy. I’m sorry Lucretius didn’t write On The Nature Of Brexit, since no two Brexiteers are able to agree as to what it is, what it’s for or where it’s going. And if we are in the dark now, how much darker was it when we cast lots? Whatever happens – and I favour another referendum to declare null and void all referendums past and to come – there is one lesson we can learn: beware those for whom “the will of the people” is a euphemism for “the will of me”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"money/2017/oct/16/faulty-sophie-hulme-designer-handbag-broken","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-16T06:00:51Z","webTitle":"I’ve been left £200 out of pocket after buying a faulty designer handbag","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2017/oct/16/faulty-sophie-hulme-designer-handbag-broken","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2017/oct/16/faulty-sophie-hulme-designer-handbag-broken","fields":{"headline":"I’ve been left £200 out of pocket after buying a faulty designer handbag","bodyText":"I recently went to a designer sample sale and brought a lovely Sophie Hulme handbag for £200.

She only popped up to the office roof for a ciggie and now she’s stuck trying to talk down a stranger who’s intent on ending it all. To be fair, life hasn’t been kind to Marcella either. She is, as she explains to Suicidal Woman, an actor who hasn’t had a part in four years and who, in between temping jobs, is reduced to playing fairy princesses at children’s parties on Saturday mornings with a banging hangover. Furthermore, Marcella is £28K in debt and still mourning the ex who dumped her after 12 years and promptly married a woman he’d known for six days. “And I’ve got fat hands,” she adds, triumphantly. “Christ, it sounds like you should jump, mate,” says Suicidal Woman, not unreasonably. Set in London, GameFace is the brainchild of writer and actor Roisin Conaty, last seen propping up Greg Davies in Man Down. With her tragicomic portrait of a woman whose life has unravelled, there are echoes of Phoebe Waller-Bridge’s brilliant Fleabag here, although GameFace is far from an imitation, not least because the pilot was screened two years before Fleabag aired. Still, there are similarities, particularly in Conaty’s protagonist who, rather than being winsome and lovable, is gratifyingly messed up. Marcella is in her 30s, which, in sitcom-world, usually signals a husband, a brace of kids and a neutral, “age-appropriate” wardrobe that will see her all the way to retirement. Not here. Not only is Marcella single, up for a night out and partial to a push-up bra, she is unreliable, eats crap food and looks as if she could do with a good bath. You can practically smell the booze on her as she is ejected from yet another kids’ party and totters home in a giant princess dress, teeth stained with red wine, her hair caked in something unmentionable. Whether drunk-texting her ex, getting lost while camping in a wood or trying to hide the full extent of her hopelessness from her life coach, Graham (the sessions were a birthday present from her mother), life conspires to deliver a fresh kick in the teeth every day. “How do you deal with stress?” asks Graham. “Carbs, fags, wine,” Marcella shrugs. Where Fleabag centres on a woman undone by self-loathing, underneath Marcella’s Barbie-meets-Bet-Lynch exterior is a woman fitfully trying to get it together. GameFace’s parade of brilliantly awkward set-pieces is underpinned by Marcella’s essential optimism that things will get better. It’s the kind of big-hearted comedy that somehow manages to make depression and catastrophic loneliness funny. Self-sabotage is a running theme as Marcella routinely forgets the driving lessons that will, she hopes, give her new independence. Elsewhere, she does battle with her conspiracy-theorist neighbour, listens patiently to the brocialist prattling of her flatmate’s boyfriend and dutifully turns up to auditions and gives them her all, even if it means rubbing onion in her eyes to make herself cry. GameFace isn’t just about one woman’s nightmare. It’s an affectionate paean to all the Marcellas out there gamely staggering through life, screwing up and getting screwed. Seriously, have a drink, babes. You look like you need it."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"music/2017/oct/12/readers-recommend-playlist-songs-featuring-echoes","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-12T11:00:39Z","webTitle":"Readers recommend playlist: songs featuring echoes","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/oct/12/readers-recommend-playlist-songs-featuring-echoes","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2017/oct/12/readers-recommend-playlist-songs-featuring-echoes","fields":{"headline":"Readers recommend playlist: songs featuring echoes","bodyText":"Here is this week’s playlist – songs picked by a reader from hundreds of suggestions on last week’s callout. Thanks for taking part. Read more about how our weekly series works at the end of the piece. The response to last week’s callout was more muted than usual and seemed to draw lots of suggestions from the same nominators, creating a bit of an echo below the line, if you will. That said, you still managed to nominate nearly 300 songs, comprising more than 20 hours of music. No wonder I don’t seem to have had time to do much else but listen (with one notable exception, which I will get to later). I will start the A-list with two songs that reference the myth of Echo and Narcissus, from which we get the word echo. First, Cocteau Twins’ Mud and Dark; second, Daniel Land &amp; the Modern Painters’ Echo &amp; Narcissus. Next, we get to tracks that make use of echo and reverb-like effects in the music. As contributor Pussel put it: “Can’t have this topic without dub”. So, we’ll have Gregory Isaacs’ Public Eyes, which makes plentiful use of such things, as does Neko Case’s Hold On, Hold On, albeit in a different genre. There is also the fabulous use of echo in the introduction to Madness’s One Step Beyond. Wrapping up this section is the incredible use of echo effects by Brian May on Queen’s Brighton Rock. The next sub-division is songs that made it on to the A-list because they include the word “echo” in the lyrics. Harry Nilsson can “only hear the echoes of my mind” even though Everybody’s Talkin’. David Coverdale, meanwhile, hears “the songs that I have sung echo in the distance” on Deep Purple’s Soldier of Fortune. Three versions of this track were nominated; I went for the original, since it features Coverdale’s soulful vocals and Ritchie Blackmore’s atmospheric guitar playing. Last here are Simon and Garfunkel’s words – “Like silent raindrops fell and echoed in the wells of silence” – in the wonderful The Sound of Silence. Now we get to songs with “echo” in the title. First up is a Scottish folk song, Echo Mocks the Corncrake, by Songs of Separation. The title refers to the way in which the corncrake cry is reflected back from the stone ends of crofts and how the poor bird tries to have a conversation with itself. Then we get to a couple of pieces of whimsy: the Ink Spots’ We Three (My Echo, My Shadow and Me) is a melancholy meditation on being single, while the Bonzo Dog Doo Dah Band tell us of Little Sir Echo. The title of Rush’s song, Test for Echo, refers to a standard location sound test, in this case in the context of increasing media involvement in criminal proceedings. Several people nominated the next song as a must for this week. I couldn’t agree more, so here is Echo by the late Tom Petty, with the Heartbreakers.Finally, we come to the pachyderm in the pantry. My final choice will be controversial, since it’s zedded. However, I found time to do one thing other than listen to your recommendations this week. That thing was to visit the superb Their Mortal Remains exhibition at the V&amp;A. When told this song was zedded, one nominator replied: I completely agree. So, featuring the topic in the title, the lyrics and the music, here, with 23 minutes of prog brilliance, we end on Pink Floyd’s Echoes. New theme: how to join in The new theme will be announced at 8pm (BST) on Thursday 12 October. You have until 11pm on Monday 16 October to submit nominations. Here is a reminder of some of the guidelines for readers recommend: If you have a good idea for a theme, or you would like to volunteer to compile a playlist from readers’ suggestions and write a blog about it, please email matthew.holmes@theguardian.com.

Under her watch, it has issued increasingly alarmed dispatches to ministers from the frontline, where her members preside over institutions awash with drugs and violence, denuded of staff and, as she puts it, “full to bursting”. Overcrowding in prisons is an affront to decency, an engine of disorder and a remarkably stupid way to prepare prisoners for a useful life after release. It’s also an incredibly stressful and downright dangerous environment for staff. This week Albutt essentially called for ministers to grow a pair: to ease the pressure through some form of executive early release of prisoners, regardless of the political consequences. Politics aside, there are two problems with this. First, executive release undermines the rule of law and victims’ confidence in the system. I do not believe that magistrates are sending people to prison unnecessarily. In my own experience I have seen sentencers make heroic efforts to spare offenders custody. Sometimes custodial sentences are the only option available to give communities a rest from prolific offenders who wreak havoc. We often lose sight of the fact that short-term custody, when the conditions are right, can provide a place of safety and structure for chaotic offenders to address their problems and access services. The second problem with executive release is the current state of the probation system, which would have to cope with a significant increase in workload at a time when it is already struggling to cope. The service has been hollowed out and broken up by a series of ill-conceived and unnecessary reforms. The impact of this managerial nonsense, known officially as Transforming Rehabilitation, is laid bare by successive damning reports by the chief inspector of probation, Dame Glenys Stacey. Performance has dipped sharply across the country and places such as London are, according to her, more at risk as a result of an inability to monitor minor offenders. The system is already failing to safeguard the community, and executive release would only magnify this problem. In the long term we need to wean ourselves off our addiction to locking people up cheaply. This, coupled with remote and incompetent corporate management of the prison system, has created the human disaster described so vividly in this week’s highly critical report by the chief inspector of prisons, Peter Clarke, on living conditions in Britain’s prisons. Locking two people up in a crumbling prison cell built for one for sometimes 22 hours a day, and forcing them to defecate inches from where they sleep and eat, is not only demeaning, it is actively driving prisoners to drugs (in one prison easier to get hold of than soap) as a means to escape boredom and squalor. We desperately need to create alternatives to this sort of custody which command public confidence and help rescue the potential of those who offend against us. But you just can’t do that with a Poundland criminal justice system. Albutt is right, however, that urgent and decisive action is required. We must create a surge of prison officers to take back large parts of our prison estate that have become effectively lawless. Nothing hopeful can be built in places where there is no safety and where the state is routinely humiliated. Nothing. The Ministry of Justice ought to exercise some humility and admit frontline staff cuts went far too far. It should issue a plea for a national reserve taskforce to be created from recently departed staff, augmented as a last resort by the military if this is necessary, and go in to regain control of our most disordered prisons. When you restore order, you restore predictability. Regimes can run again. Services to prisoners can be delivered, and personal security improved. Relationships between staff and prisoners also improve, and rehabilitation becomes a reality instead of the current darkly comic abstraction. Contrary to popular belief, most prisoners want the staff to be in charge and most prisoners, given the right support, can change their lives. Ungoverned spaces where the drugs subculture is now firmly entrenched must be reclaimed. Prisons can and should be places of hope and transformation. Even in these acutely difficult times, against the odds, some prisons are doing just that. But all too often our jails – and jailers – are broken. In the end we need significantly more staff, or significantly fewer prisoners. The status quo is untenable. Something has to give. • Ian Acheson, a former prison governor, led the 2016 independent review of Islamist extremism in prisons, probation and the youth justice system"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"travel/2017/oct/11/thailand-bans-smoking-on-20-popular-tourist-beaches","type":"article","sectionId":"travel","sectionName":"Travel","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-11T15:19:55Z","webTitle":"Thailand bans smoking on 20 popular tourist beaches","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2017/oct/11/thailand-bans-smoking-on-20-popular-tourist-beaches","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/travel/2017/oct/11/thailand-bans-smoking-on-20-popular-tourist-beaches","fields":{"headline":"Thailand bans smoking on 20 popular tourist beaches","bodyText":"Thailand is to ban smoking on some of the country’s most popular tourist beaches, with the prospect of up to a year in prison for those caught lighting up, according to reports by local media. The move follows a recent survey of litter on Patong beach, Phuket – visited by millions of foreign tourists each year – which found an average of 0.76 cigarette butts per square metre in a sample area, which would amount to 101,058 butts on the 2.5km-long stretch of sand. The survey was undertaken by the country’s department of marine and coastal resources, which described it as a “serious problem”. Discarded cigarette butts accounted for a third of rubbish collected by the department. “Cigarettes have a direct effect on the natural environment,” director general Jatuporn Buruspat told the Phuket Gazette. “The butts clog the drains contributing to floods. When the cigarettes stay under the beach sand for a long time, it also negatively affects the eco system. And then when the chemicals from the cigarette butts reach the water, it also releases cadmium, lead, arsenic and some acid from insecticide which are poison to the natural food chain.” The ban, which will come into play in November, will affect 20 beaches including Patong, Koh Khai Nok, Koh Khai Nai (Phuket); Hua Hin, Cha-Am, Khao Takiab (western province of Prachuap Khiri Khan); Pattaya, Jomtien, Bangsaen (eastern province of Chonburi) and Samila (Songkhla city). After a trial period, the ban is expected to be enforced on all Thai beaches, as well as on passenger and tourist boats, to tackle the problem of butts damaging the underwater environment. Anyone found to be breaking the law will face one year in jail or a maximum 100,000 baht (£2,285) fine, or both. The Bangkok Post also reported the news, adding that Thailand has the sixth most rubbish-strewn areas of sea in the world."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"football/2017/oct/11/sergio-aguero-manchester-city-car-crash-rib-injury-stoke","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-11T12:42:36Z","webTitle":"Sergio Agüero targets early Manchester City return after car crash","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/oct/11/sergio-aguero-manchester-city-car-crash-rib-injury-stoke","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/oct/11/sergio-aguero-manchester-city-car-crash-rib-injury-stoke","fields":{"headline":"Sergio Agüero targets early Manchester City return after car crash","bodyText":"Sergio Agüero is hopeful of being available for Manchester City’s home game with Stoke City on Saturday in what would be a surprise early return from the rib injury the striker suffered in a car crash less than two weeks ago. Agüero broke a rib in Amsterdam when the vehicle taking him to the airport after a pop concert crashed into a pole on 28 September, two days before City won 1-0 at Chelsea in their final match before the international break. The Argentinian was expected to be ruled out for around six weeks yet it is understood he will undergo a late fitness test before the Stoke game. While Agüero missed Argentina’s final World Cup qualifiers, he resumed light training at the club on Tuesday morning. The 29-year-old’s response to this first session back was encouraging and so Pep Guardiola wants to wait until the final moment before determining Agüero’s fitness to play. City, who announced on Wednesday that the former Blackburn Rovers winger Jason Wilcox has been appointed the club’s academy director, are unbeaten in all competitions and lead the Premier League on goal difference ahead of Manchester United. Before his injury Agüero had been instrumental in City’s fly start, scoring seven times in eight appearances. United go to Liverpool for Saturday’s early match with José Mourinho receiving a welcome boost regarding Phil Jones. The central defender was forced out of Gareth Southgate’s England squad because of a knee injury but is expected to be available for the trip to Anfield. Mourinho will be without Marouane Fellaini because of a serious knee problem. The midfielder had been impressive form, scoring four times in six appearances for United, but strained medial ligaments in Belgium’s 4-3 victory over Bosnia-Herzegovina on Saturday.

The dense, rigorous Propensity unfolds over a stealthily time-bending bassline and features Mahanthappa’s blistering avant-bop sax improv, while the title track lays a kind of Indo-Latin feel beneath Abassi’s lissom guitar lines. Thoughts mixes Pat Metheny’s trumpet-like synth-guitar sound and a sitar’s slurs, and classical cello sporadically softens the street-edgy mix. Balancing high-speed jazz with so many taxing rhythm-bends while maintaining cohesion is a tough call at times, but Abbasi is plainly an emerging force with his own voice."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"travel/2017/oct/12/europe-best-small-ski-resorts-readers-tips","type":"article","sectionId":"travel","sectionName":"Travel","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-12T05:00:32Z","webTitle":"Best little ski resorts in Europe: readers’ travel tips","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2017/oct/12/europe-best-small-ski-resorts-readers-tips","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/travel/2017/oct/12/europe-best-small-ski-resorts-readers-tips","fields":{"headline":"Best little ski resorts in Europe: readers’ travel tips","bodyText":"Winning tip: Secret skiing, Switzerland Villars is only two hours on the train from Geneva airport and it is possible to get a tram up into the village of Gryon, making the journey from airport to piste very easy for weekend skiers. Gryon and Villars have a wide range of blue and red pistes, which are excellent for families or skiers wanting to perfect their technique. However, the area’s best-kept secret is the glacier at Diablerets: incredible off-piste terrain with 2,000-metre verticals from top to bottom. The best thing is that it doesn’t attract the large numbers nearby Verbier does. tomglancey Little Tibet, Italy Known as Italy’s “Little Tibet”, Campo Imperatore is a relatively unknown 27km plateau in the Abruzzo region. It is serviced by four well-maintained ski-lifts. There is a fabulous mountain hotel (pictured) with an observatory, where Mussolini was held captive in the second world war, which oozes history in a basic yet charming manner. Accommodation costs about £55 a night for a double room with breakfast. Hotel Nido dell’ Aquila is less than three miles away and has helpful and friendly hosts. If you want a middle-of-nowhere, breathtaking resort that offers quiet skiing all through the season, this is the one for you. ID863949 Budget resort, Arlberg Mention the Arlberg and the names Lech and St Anton inevitably crop up. Far less well-known and much quieter (but still on the same ski pass) is Sonnenkopf – a deep powder bowl with easy on-piste and challenging off-piste runs. Skibase in Wald organises friendly ski-touring days. Stay at Hotel Sonnblick (above, half-board from €72pp) or the brand new, luxurious Arlberg Chalets, both only 10 minutes’ drive to Stuben and the gateway back to those busy, big-name resorts. Neil Winter Dead handy for families, France From Grenoble, it’s a 50-minute drive to a family-friendly resort that is very simple, quicker to get to and cheaper than the much more fashionable Alpe d’Huez or Les Deux Alpes. It is spookily called La Morte (the dead woman), and changed its name to L’Alpe du Grand Serre for obvious reasons. There aren’t very many shops there, but it has a few good restaurants. Trinart Great for beginners, Bulgaria We decided on Borovets as our first skiing adventure after a recommendation from a Bulgarian colleague. We stayed in Hotel Rila, which is right next to the ski runs. The slopes here are beautiful and well-maintained, with great tree runs for those after forest adventure, plus a good park for learning and progressing jumps, rails and tabletops. The whole trip, including flights, hotel (half-board), transfers, lift pass and equipment hire worked out around £450pp for a week. Mikej Dot Spring snow, Sweden Jump on a cheap flight to Stockholm Västerås, pick up a hire car and a 90-minute drive north-west lies Romme Alpin, a low-key, family-oriented resort. You can stay on site or in a local wood cabin. Food and après-ski are all available, albeit at a gentle pace. It can be too cold around Christmas, so for ideal skiing go in March or early April. Tony Nicolas Weekend jaunt, Norway For a superb long weekend skiing, try Trysil in Norway. Quiet slopes and excellent skiing, including at night, plus a great 45-degree black slope for the more adventurous. The ski pass costs £40 a day, and it’s easy to access by car from Oslo airport. There’s a ski-in/ski-out Radisson Blu hotel (doubles from £140 B&amp;B) with swimming pools, spa, gym, restaurants and bars and a bowling alley – plus free parking. august13 Genuine mountain village, Austria Mauterndorf, below the huge Obertauern skiing resort, is still a genuine mountain village. Close by, there are five excellent ski areas, all different – the aforementioned Obertauern, Mauterndorf itself with its long runs into the valleys; St Margarethen with its link up into the Katschberg Pass area; and the more family-friendly, charming Fanningberg, lower down, putting it below the clouds that can make Obertauern foggy at times. The village itself has good hotels, bars and restaurants which are cosy and traditional and not too expensive. David Wright Peak powder, Austria Even though the mountain’s peak is less than 2,000 metres, the local microclimate means Fieberbrunn gets the most yearly snowfall in the Alps. The resort has ample tree skiing, as well as big mountain runs, but for beginners, the Skiwies’n Lords area at the base of the chair lift provides excellent training, as well as several cafes to rest in. The après scene is small but as lively as any big resort and it’s only an hour from Munich airport. Adult passes cost €45 in low season, €53 at peak times. Paul Jones Friendly and relaxed, France Auron is a lovely spot near the Mercantour national park in the southern Alps, with Nice less than two hours away by car. Mostly used by locals, it’s a sunny resort at an altitude of 1,600 metres, with a friendly and relaxed feel. Lots of good equipment rental shops, plus a café and restaurants, a couple of boulangeries, a cinema and a gym for a quiet après-ski. Great for all abilities and there are fabulous views from many of the slopes.

The Man of Glass lasted the longest” – Arjen Robben probably summed it up best himself. After an international career with 37 goals in 96 matches for Holland the 33-year-old bade farewell to the Oranje on Tuesday night. Early on in his career, he had been mocked for being injured too often but in the end there was just a sense of loss. The Dutch had not only failed to qualify for the World Cup finals in Russia next summer, they also have to try to regroup now without the one outstanding player they have had at their disposal. Make no mistake, Robben is an extraordinary player and, as with so many others, perhaps he will only be fully appreciated now that he has left. It was an overwhelmingly emotional evening at the Amsterdam Arena, where the former Amsterdam mayor Eberhard van der Laan, who died last week, was mourned and the Dutch knew what was coming. Realistically, there was no way they were going to beat Sweden by the seven goals required to reach Russia. As the Wilhelmus anthem reverberated around the stadium, Robben visibly welled up, aware that this was likely to be the final game for his country. A graph of soaring highs and dispiriting lows, Robben’s Holland career had come full circle in that he made his debut in 2003 and was playing his final game in 2017 under the same coach, Dick Advocaat. Advocaat’s association with Robben is perhaps known most for what many in the Netherlands consider to be the single worst substitution ever. At Euro 2004 Robben, then still only 20 and soon to be heading to Chelsea, started against the Czech Republic and began exerting the influence he would continue to show with the national team for 13 years. The Dutch were leading 2-0 and he had dazzled, creating both goals, the first a free-kick deliciously served up with that left foot to the back-post for Wilfried Bouma, and then a cross whipped in from the left for Ruud van Nistelrooy to tap in. Strangely, Advocaat decided to withdraw him at 2-1 just before the hour, replacing him with Paul Bosvelt. The result? The Oranje capitulated in the most staggering of ways, going down to 10 men and losing 3-2. The assistant coach, Wim van Hanegem, asked what he would do if Advocaat made the same decision in the following game against Latvia, said: “I’ll take him down.” Perhaps the threat worked because Advocaat let Robben play the full 90 minutes – and Holland won. In the quarter-finals against Sweden – their qualifying opponents in Amsterdam – Robben scored the final penalty in the shootout and sent the Dutch to the semi-finals, where they promptly went out 2-1 to the host country, Portugal. But the tone was set for the young forward whose slalom runs on spindly legs sent shivers down defenders’ spines. Having played the role of protagonist and pantomime villain alike, and despite fitness doubts looming in essentially every summer before a major national tournament, Robben has been undeniably central in providing the most lasting football memories of the past decade for the Netherlands. In 2008, he began working with the osteopath Hub Westhovens. “He gives me confidence in my body,” Robben has said. That summer the flying forward produced one of the best individual performances seen by a Holland player in one half as Holland beat France 4-1 at Euro 2008. Introduced at half-time, Robben soon ran on to a Van Nistelrooy pass by the touchline. It was the kind of run that has come to typify Robben – where one could actually imagine the gears shifting, the motor roaring, and the engine firing his legs forward. The sheer acceleration he showed once he latched on to the pass was remarkable, and he sent in a cross in for Robin van Persie to tap in. Twelve minutes later, released on the left by Wesley Sneijder, Robben sped through, with the slightest drop of the shoulder confounding Lilian Thuram and allowing him to get ahead. Despite us being accustomed to the winger cutting inside to score in recent years, Robben - as in this case - could equally cut outside and score. From a tight angle, he struck the ball into the top of the net, and the France goalkeeper Grégory Coupet had no chance. Robben celebrated with a nonchalant shrug, as if his ability to influence proceedings was merely second nature. Two summers later, Holland were carried at the World Cup by two 26-year-old “veterans”: the man who had led Bayern to the Champions League final that year (Robben) and the man who actually won it with Internazionale (Sneijder). They led the team – chastised for straying away from “Dutch principles” – to within touching distance of eternal glory, of achieving what neither Johan Cruyff nor Marco van Basten nor Dennis Bergkamp could do. That touching distance eventually turned out to be Iker Casillas’s outstretched leg as Robben found himself one on one with the Spain goalkeeper in the World Cup final but could not quite place his shot well enough. “It is a moment that will always haunt me,” he says. Perhaps then, it is understandable to see that in his other World Cup meeting with Casillas, Robben - for the fifth goal in the 5-1 victory in 2014 - was not panicked into shooting. Having beaten Sergio Ramos to the ball despite starting at least 10 yards behind the centre-back, Robben propelled himself into another one on one against Casillas. This time as the Spanish No1 rushed out to close the angle, Robben turned, dribbled further into the centre as if to twist the knife further, while the Spanish keeper scrambled and flapped haplessly at his feet, and then unleashed a shot that seemed to channel all the frustration from that fateful night in Johannesburg. During their training camp in Portugal for the 2014 World Cup, Louis van Gaal opened up about some of the secrets behind Robben’s success. “I have said several times that there are few players in this world who handle their body as professionally as Robben does. If you see how Arjen does his warm-up exercises and compare it with the others, that is a different experience altogether. I find it very beautiful.” Detractors have accused him of being a one trick pony, but even if he only has one move up his sleeve, he at least does it better than anyone else. Defenders know which run he will make, where he will likely receive the ball, and what he will do once he gets it and are still helpless against him and his magical left foot - arguably second-best only to Lionel Messi in this era. After the 2013 Champions League final Cruyff praised him as having a “beautiful mix of intuition, technique and the desire he naturally has towards the goal”. For an incredibly brief moment in Tuesday’s game against Sweden, as his second goal soared into the net, with an unstoppable mix of power and precision, the Dutch may have been excused for starting to believe again – because this is what Robben has meant. He has been, for years, still able to inspire a group of supporters somewhat disillusioned with the state of football in the national team and the domestic league. As the clock ticked down and the flicker of hope was snuffed out again, the crowd at the Arena began serenading the captain, who applauded them back. “I wanted so badly to show them what I can do, just one more time.” It was like a testimonial, and the gravity of his retirement began to overshadow the disappointment of not making the World Cup, which had been something of a foregone conclusion anyway. “Normally you would say: ‘This is a very nice way to go out,’”, said Robben. “To win 2-0 and score twice. It was a bit like Dirk Kuyt’s farewell, with his hat-trick [for Feyenoord], apart from the fact that he won the league and we fail to reach the World Cup.” When the Big Four of Van Persie, Sneijder, Rafael van der Vaart and Robben broke through, they were rightfully seen as the faces of a bright future for the Dutch. Sneijder and Robben remained key players at major tournaments from 2006 to 2014, which is a remarkable duration in international football. Robben was not a natural leader, with his sulky demeanour, but he grew into an unmistakable one over the course of his career. “I have learned so much from him without him even knowing about it,” Virgil van Dijk said on Tuesday. Now, although he is officially the first to retire of the four, Robben’s decision seems to signify the end of that era. He spoke of “passing the baton” on Tuesday but the overwhelming sentiment is that there are not many – if any – candidates worthy of picking it up. Robben has his flaws: he can be an irritating player to watch with his tendency to tumble too easily. He does not always contribute much as far as defending is concerned and can come across as a very individual player, wanting the ball for himself all the time. But he possesses and often explicitly shows a desire to change a game that very few can match. At half-time on Tuesday, Robben told his team-mates: “Goddamit, this is the Dutch national team. That is what we have to show.” And yet they could not muster a goal in the second half. It is not inconceivable that there is a gulf in the notion of the playing “like a Dutch national team should” for Robben and the rest, and with him gone, the future seems bleak at the moment. “Never say never,” he said when asked if he would come out of retirement if the Dutch were in crisis – but then you could argue they are in the midst of a crisis right now. Robben remains the last truly world-class Dutch footballer (at least in men’s football) and retires from international duty as the best currently active. His farewell was precipitated by a wish to prolong his club career at Bayern Munich, where he is still influential, and he definitely has a better chance of adding to his trophy cabinet. For many born in the 1990s who may have seen only a few years of peak Bergkamp, Robben is arguably the best player they have seen in the distinctive orange shirt and, although this takes many different factors into account, he should be considered among the top 10 Dutch footballers of all time, and perhaps even the top five. And if it were not for Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo, Robben’s sheer consistency in achievement at the highest level of football and ability to constantly grab games by the scruff of their neck would perhaps be lauded a lot more. Memoria praeteritorum bonorum goes a Latin expression; the phenomenon of sometimes judging the past disproportionately more positively than the present. Maybe in the future, Robben will get more credit. Even as the glass man continues to defy decline, there is not much left of him in the present. For all his flaws, one should really savour every time he bounds in from the right and skips past defenders with that smirk on his face, before it is too late."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"science/2017/oct/12/coochy-coo-why-baby-talk-is-more-sophisticated-than-you-might-think","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-12T16:00:08Z","webTitle":"Coochy coo: why baby talk is more sophisticated than you might think","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/oct/12/coochy-coo-why-baby-talk-is-more-sophisticated-than-you-might-think","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2017/oct/12/coochy-coo-why-baby-talk-is-more-sophisticated-than-you-might-think","fields":{"headline":"Coochy coo: why baby talk is more sophisticated than you might think","bodyText":"Cooing to an infant might not seem like sophisticated speech, but it turns out that baby talk is more complex than previously thought. While it has long been known the pitch and rhythm of speech changes when mothers talk to their babies, researchers have now found the timbre of their voice changes too – a quality that reflects properties such as how velvety, raspy or nasal a sound seems. To delve into the nature of baby talk – a mode of speech thought to help language development in infants – the team recorded 24 mothers while they talked to their children, aged between seven months and one year. The mothers spoke to their children in 10 different native languages including English, Spanish, Mandarin and Hebrew. “We basically brought mothers into the lab and had them play with and read to their own babies, just like they would at home,” said Dr Elise Piazza, co-author of the research from the baby lab at Princeton University. The mothers were also recorded while being interviewed by the researchers about their child’s daily routine to capture their speech when talking to adults. Short snippets of the recordings were then analysed using a computer system to extract a measure of the timbre of the voice, independent of rhythm and variations in pitch. These “vocal fingerprints” were then fed into an algorithm-based machine-learning system to train it to distinguish between speech directed at infants and adults. The system was then tested using data from further snippets of speech – if no differences existed between speech directed at infants and adults, the system would end up assigning them by chance. The results, published in the journal Current Biology, reveal that the system was able to differentiate between different mothers. What’s more, about 70% of the time it was able to work out whether the sounds were from baby talk or adult chat. As well as suggesting that timbre might be an important factor in how infants recognise voices, and when adults are talking to them, Piazza says the work could prove useful in developing educational tools for children. “For instance maybe using a realistic timbre of [baby talk] when designing some kind of virtual [voice] that is geared towards enhancing communication skills or maybe even teaching a child a second language,” she said, adding that the approach used might also help unpick whether other types of social interactions, such as romantic conversations, involved a shift in timbre. Dr Catherine Laing, an expert in infant language acquisition at the University of Cardiff who was not involved in the study, described the research as fascinating, adding that it opened up new avenues for research. “Really what we need to know now is how infants respond to this – does this tone of voice actually affect the way that infants learn speech,” she said. “We know that is true for pitch – pitch range and higher pitch facilitates language development – but is the same true for these vocal fingerprints?” And with babies able to hear in the womb and recognise their mother’s voice from birth, timbre might also play a role there, too, she said. “Maybe this is actually really important in the infant’s connection with the mother.” Ultimately, says Piazza, the study ties into a broader body of research showing that baby talk is an important mode of communication. “It is not something to be embarrassed about at all,” she said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2017/oct/12/eu-refuses-to-engage-on-rights-of-britons-living-in-europe-after-brexit","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-12T12:24:34Z","webTitle":"EU 'refusing to engage on rights of Britons living in Europe'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/oct/12/eu-refuses-to-engage-on-rights-of-britons-living-in-europe-after-brexit","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/oct/12/eu-refuses-to-engage-on-rights-of-britons-living-in-europe-after-brexit","fields":{"headline":"EU 'refusing to engage on rights of Britons living in Europe'","bodyText":"Britain’s hopes of securing the continued right of a million British citizens currently in Europe to live anywhere in the EU after Brexit is being thwarted by the bloc’s refusal to engage with proposals from London, according to sources close to the negotiations. The British government has called on the EU publicly and privately to guarantee onward movement rights, which would allow British nationals living in one country to move to any other after Brexit. The Brexit secretary, David Davis, has suggested that in return the 3.5 million EU nationals living in the UK could have an indefinite right of return, should they ever move to another country. His proposal was not part of the UK’s opening position paper on citizens’ rights, but British negotiators shifted ground in an effort to reach an agreement. The British negotiating team made the offer of a trade-off during a week of talks at the end of September, after some discussion of the topic in earlier rounds. Davis raised the issue publicly during a joint press conference with the EU’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, on 28 September. It is understood, however, that there has been no further movement in this week’s talks in Brussels, to the frustration of the British team. Davis gave a hint of his irritation during a press conference in Brussels on Thursday to mark the end of the October round of negotiations, when he told reporters: “We look forward to hearing the European Union’s response to this.” Barnier responded: “That question remains on the table and we are willing to discuss it at the appropriate time.” One source said Barnier had personally appeared open to agreement, but that he was being boxed in by what was described as a lack of flexibility by the EU27, who appeared unable to decide whether such a compromise was acceptable. The difficulties that have arisen on the issue of onward movement are said to symptomatic of the fact that the article 50 guidelines EU leaders agreed in April have put an overly tight leash on Barnier. Theresa May has repeatedly called for greater creativity from the EU. During Thursday’s press conference Davis also called for the European council to adapt Barnier’s mandate to allow the two sides to make progress. “We don’t see the need to change the mandate at the moment. The first phase has not closed. It’s not a blow to Britain, it’s just the state of play,” the EU source said. A spokesman for the European commission declined to comment. Jane Golding, the Berlin-based chair of British in Europe, who has been championing the cause of UK citizens who live in the EU, said the issue was extremely important for the livelihoods of those she represents, although she said she recognised that the EU needed time to respond. “A lot of people do cross-border work, who may need to move in the future due to work, and it is not just important to us but for EU nationals in the UK,” she said. “We were told by both sides that we would be able to continue our lives as if Brexit had never happened. This is why we are campaigning for citizens’ rights to be ring-fenced from the rest of the talks.” On Thursday, Barnier said he would not be able to tell the European council summit next week that sufficient progress had been made on the opening withdrawal issues, including citizens’ rights."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2017/oct/11/conservative-mps-nicky-morgan-tim-loughton-brexit-retention-of-child-refugees-rights","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-11T16:59:38Z","webTitle":"Theresa May expected to make concessions over 'Henry VIII' powers","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/oct/11/conservative-mps-nicky-morgan-tim-loughton-brexit-retention-of-child-refugees-rights","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2017/oct/11/conservative-mps-nicky-morgan-tim-loughton-brexit-retention-of-child-refugees-rights","fields":{"headline":"Theresa May expected to make concessions over 'Henry VIII' powers","bodyText":"Theresa May is likely to agree to a new parliamentary committee to help weed out excessive use of Henry VIII powers after Brexit as she seeks to head off a rebellion, according to Tory MPs pushing for the change. Several Conservative supporters of the idea told the Guardian they believe the prime minister will back down on the issue because she cannot risk losing a vote when the EU withdrawal bill returns to the House of Commons later this month. The amendment, signed by 15 Conservative MPs along with a number of Labour colleagues, has a chance of passing because of May’s slim parliamentary majority of 13 aided by the DUP. The purpose of the EU withdrawal bill is to transpose legislation from Brussels into British law to ensure a smooth exit process. However, May is facing a rebellion over so-called Henry VIII powers that would allow ministers to tweak secondary legislation as it is transposed. Dominic Grieve, the former attorney general who tabled the key amendment, told the procedure committee on Wednesday that the bill represented the “most extraordinary arrogation of powers” by the executive that he had seen during 20 years in parliament. He said there needed to be an exceptional mechanism for dealing with secondary legislation, where MPs would sift through statutory instruments to decide whether they needed full parliamentary debate or not. This would help stop legal challenges against secondary legislation arising out of the process of transposing EU law into British law, Grieve said. “The purpose of this amendment is not to put a spanner in the works of carrying out Brexit. If we’re leaving, we have got to have a credible piece of legislation for carrying it out,” he said. John Penrose, another Conservative supporter of the amendment who sits on the pro-Brexit European Reform Group (ERG), said: “The amendments are gathering support and adherence and people now understand why they are important and responsible. “If these changes are made, we will ensure the bill delivers a working statute book on the day after we leave the EU whilst not derailing Brexit.” A second area where the government may be forced into concessions include strictly narrowing down the circumstances in which Henry VIII powers can be used. A slightly smaller group of Conservatives and opposition MPs is pushing for an amendment to require the final deal with the EU to be approved by statute passed by parliament. The government could potentially make concessions by giving verbal commitments in the Commons, laying its own amendments or accepting amendments put down by Conservative MPs. Hundreds of amendments have been tabled to the EU withdrawal bill, which is likely to return to the Commons for more detailed scrutiny in the next fortnight. Another amendment that could gain traction was laid on Wednesday by two leading Conservatives, who want to push the government to commit to allowing refugee children to reunite with their families under post-Brexit immigration law. Nicky Morgan, the former education secretary and a prominent remain supporter, and the former children’s minister Tim Loughton, who backed leave, submitted a proposal to ensure child refugees have the same rights to be reunited with family members in the UK as they currently have under EU law. It is understood that a number of Labour, Liberal Democrat and SNP MPs will pledge their support for the measure in the coming days. The children’s charity Unicef UK has previously said vulnerable children could end up being permanently separated from their families unless the government specifically includes family reunification rights in post-Brexit immigration law. Refugees have the right to be reunited with extended family members in the UK under the EU’s Dublin III regulation, but the UK’s own immigration law covers only children and their parents. Campaigners have said the government should commit to widening its definition of family to allow refugee children to be reunited with siblings, grandparents, aunts and uncles. Morgan and Loughton’s amendment would ensure this happens. Unicef UK’s deputy director, Lily Caprani, said the amendment was “a display of the political will” in favour of helping child refugees, and urged MPs to add their names to the amendment. “The UK must urgently establish a lasting solution for unaccompanied children desperately needing to be reunited with their close family members in the UK,” she said. “Brexit must not lead to our nation doing less for the world’s most vulnerable children.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/oct/12/british-isis-member-sally-jones-white-widow-killed-airstrike-son-islamic-state-syria","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-12T08:18:38Z","webTitle":"British Isis member Sally Jones 'killed in airstrike with 12-year-old son'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/12/british-isis-member-sally-jones-white-widow-killed-airstrike-son-islamic-state-syria","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/oct/12/british-isis-member-sally-jones-white-widow-killed-airstrike-son-islamic-state-syria","fields":{"headline":"British Isis member Sally Jones 'killed in airstrike with 12-year-old son'","bodyText":"The British member of Islamic State Sally Jones is believed to have been killed, along with her 12-year-old son Jojo, in a US airstrike. Although there is confidence she is dead, it is impossible to be categorical given the inability to collect evidence on the ground. Other members of Isis have been reported dead only to reappear. Jones, dubbed “the white widow” by some in the press, was a regular propagandist on social media. She had more than 20 handles on Twitter but there has been no activity from her in recent months. The Sun reported that the CIA had told its UK counterparts Jones was killed by a Predator drone strike near the Syria-Iraq border in June. It added she had last been seen fleeing from Raqqa and heading for the Syrian border town of Mayadin. Many Isis members have fled the city as the organisation has gradually been squeezed. The Pentagon was unable to confirm she had been killed. Maj Adrian Rankine-Galloway, a Pentagon spokesman, said: “I do not have any information that would substantiate that report but that could change and we are looking into this.” Jones, a former punk musician, was born in Greenwich, south-east London, but then moved to Chatham, Kent. After converting to Islam she travelled from the UK to Syria in 2013 to join her husband and fellow Briton Junaid Hussain, who was killed in a US drone strike in 2015. It was after Hussain’s death that the British press began to refer to her as “the white widow”. She is not the only jihadist to be given this nickname, which has also been used for Samantha Lewthwaite – the widow of 7/7 London attacker Germaine Lindsay. Both Hussain and Jones were accused of trying to recruit extremists in the UK to carry out attacks. She was placed on a UN sanctions list that included a travel ban and freeze on assets, and a hit list for US bombings. Jones used her social media accounts to recruit women to Isis and provided practical advice on how to travel to Syria. She also encouraged individuals to carry out attacks in Britain, offering guidance on how to construct home-made bombs, and shared pictures of herself posing with weapons. Jones posted messages in support of Isis as well as extremist comments such as: “You Christians all need beheading with a nice blunt knife and stuck on the railings at Raqqa ... Come here I’ll do it for you.” A Foreign Office spokeswoman said: “We do not comment on matters of national security.” Maj Gen Chip Chapman, the former head of counter-terrorism at the Ministry of Defence, said Jones would have been a “significant” target as a result of her alliance with Hussain and her role in recruiting Isis fighters. Referring to reports her son was killed in the strike, he told Press Association: “It is a difficult one because under the UN Charters he is under the age of what we would classify as a soldier.” He continued: “Even if he got up to really bad things, he shouldn’t have been targeted. We don’t know for sure whether he was with her or not.” Sabrina Siddiqui and agencies contributed to this report"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2017/oct/12/paraswimmers-verbally-abused-by-coach-climate-fear","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-11T23:02:00Z","webTitle":"Para-swimmers bullied and verbally abused in coach’s 'climate of fear'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/oct/12/paraswimmers-verbally-abused-by-coach-climate-fear","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/oct/12/paraswimmers-verbally-abused-by-coach-climate-fear","fields":{"headline":"Para-swimmers bullied and verbally abused in coach’s 'climate of fear'","bodyText":"The duty of care scandal engulfing Olympic and Paralympic sport has plunged to a new low as British Swimming admitted disabled swimmers, including vulnerable teenagers, were subjected to a “climate of fear” while training for Rio 2016. The former head coach of British Para-Swimming, Rob Greenwood, has left his post and the governing body took the rare step of publicly apologising to athletes he was found to have verbally abused and used discriminatory language about, as well as their families. The Guardian understands the situation was deemed so serious that a group of affected athletes, which includes Paralympic champions, were offered complimentary psychotherapy sessions if they required help coping with the trauma of the abuse and subsequent investigations. The performance director, Chris Furber, has also faced internal disciplinary action although this is in regard to management failings and a “lack of empathy” towards athletes. He is not accused of abuse or discrimination. A source close to the investigation said that in terms of scale it was the most grave of a growing list of athlete-welfare scandals and again calls into question the no-compromise model which dictates Olympic and Paralympic sport in the UK. “In terms of seriousness on a scale of 0-10 I would put it at an eight or nine,” said the source. “You have people with varying disabilities, from learning difficulties through to visual impairments, and it has affected people who are both under 18 and adults who came forward in confidence – in double figures. “The severity of it was that free psychotherapy sessions were approved for anyone who wanted it,” the source added. “The culture of fear was such that you can imagine the pressure of giving evidence to an inquiry and they were also having to recall incidents that they’d rather not. It was very sad indeed.” In October 2016, the British Athletes Commission – an independent members’ association for elite athletes in Olympic and Paralympic sport – heard allegations of bullying and discrimination from 13 swimmers. An initial inquiry by a legal firm found the claims warranted further investigation. Information was passed to British Para-Swimming which in turn enlisted two investigators, both former police officers experienced in safeguarding in sport, to carry out an independent check. They interviewed 13 athletes and 10 members of staff over eight months. It is understood that Greenwood, who took over as head coach of British Para-Swimming in 2013, left his post before the investigation began. The revelations have caused deep concern within UK Sport, the funding agency which allocated more than £11m in public and lottery money to the elite Para-swimming programme in the four-year cycle leading to the Rio Games. It said in a statement: “UK Sport can confirm that we are now in receipt of the report from British Swimming. We will now carefully consider it before confirming what if any actions we may need to take in response to the findings.” The swimmers were enormously successful, winning 47 medals, 16 of them gold, and finishing second in the medal table, contributing to Greenwood being handed the High Performance Coach of the Year award by Sports Coach UK in November 2016. Months later he was gone in a cloud of controversy and suspicion. The chairman of British Swimming, Maurice Watkins, said: “On behalf of British Swimming I want to apologise to the British Para-Swimming athletes and their families who have faced unacceptable behaviours and comments. I have written to those athletes and their families I understand have been affected by this. “In the pursuit of excellence, we recognise there have been failings in the culture and communication within British Para-Swimming. We are correcting that, recognising the need to ensure strong athlete welfare in our sport. British Swimming has in place a robust action plan, which follows a lengthy and detailed inquiry designed to make sure transparent procedures are followed and adhered to. These procedures are being widely communicated. We want to ensure a closer working relationship with the British Athletes Commission. Our goal continues to be medal-producing performances, consistent with medal targets, in a positive culture.” It is understood Furber, who joined British Para-Swimming as performance director in 2013 from British Cycling, where he was head coach of the disability programme, will remain in his position. Swimming is one of a number of Olympic and Paralympic sports forced to admit duty of care failings over the past 18 months. It started with the sprint cyclist Jess Varnish who, in April 2016, accused Shane Sutton, then performance director of British Cycling, of bullying and discrimination. Sutton continues to deny the allegations. An independent investigation found he presided over a “culture of fear” despite British Cycling’s enormous medal success on the world stage. This week the Guardian revealed fresh claims of discrimination at British Bobsleigh where the head coach Lee Johnston allegedly said: “Black drivers do not make good bobsleigh drivers.” British Rowing conducted an investigation last year after the coach Paul Thompson was accused of bullying although he was later cleared of wrongdoing. He has denied all allegations. In July a coach in British Canoeing’s high-performance team resigned after an internal investigation into claims of grooming and sexual assault, as revealed by the Guardian. The chair of the British Athletes Commission (Bac), Victoria Aggar, said: “The British Athletes Commission is pleased to have been able to support its members through the independent investigation recently undertaken by British Para-Swimming. The Bac remains focused on supporting its members and looks forward to working with British Para-Swimming, and all other national governing bodies now and in the future, to support a healthy and positive culture for all athletes.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2017/oct/11/chris-kirkland-depression-interview","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-11T17:59:46Z","webTitle":"Chris Kirkland: ‘I didn’t want to wake up in the morning.

It just starts again’","bodyText":"Chris Kirkland felt trapped, paralysed, desperate. But the former England and Liverpool goalkeeper was terrified that he might have further to fall. “What happened to Gary Speed was the thing that really worried me,” Kirkland says, with reference to the Wales midfielder’s death in 2011. “I didn’t know how far away I was from that. Hopefully, a long, long way. “I always ask myself: ‘Would I have done something to myself? Would I have harmed myself? I like to think I wouldn’t have done. I certainly didn’t sit there one night, thinking, right, I’ve got to … you know. But you think about it. You do, yeah. Because you don’t want to wake up. “I said to my wife, Leeona, that I couldn’t wait to go to sleep at night and just be clear. But then, I didn’t want to wake up in the morning because it just starts again. I’d never have done it because of Leeona and our daughter, Lucy. But I was worried how close I was to the next step. That’s why I said: ‘I need to stop playing football.’” It was August last year and Kirkland was mired in a battle against depression – the insidious illness that he says started to creep up on him in 2012, after his departure from Wigan Athletic, a club he loved and did not want to leave. Kirkland had signed a one-year contract at Bury in June 2016 but he came to feel overwhelmed. He simply could not continue. Bury were hugely supportive and the club’s manager, Dave Flitcroft, showed why he is cut out to be a leader of men. Flitcroft told him to get away, take his time, seek help but, Kirkland being Kirkland, he decided to give it one more try. “I restarted training but, on the third day, I was in a five-a-side game, there were shots coming in and I just wasn’t diving,” Kirkland says. “I was thinking: ‘I don’t want to be here any more.’ I walked off, I went straight up to Dave and I said: ‘I can’t do it anymore. I need you to rip my contract up.’ That’s when the statement came out.” In his statement Kirkland talked about how he needed “time and space away from the game”; that he was retiring at 35 after a 17-season professional career in order to put his “family’s future and well-being first”. It did not disclose the specifics of the depression. “It was because I was ashamed,” Kirkland says. “I wasn’t getting any help at that point. Nobody knew. But it was straight after that when I said to Leeona: ‘I have to do something here’.” It is sometimes referred to as the lightbulb moment; when it finally becomes clear that there is a fundamental problem. Kirkland reached out to Michael Bennett, the head of player welfare at the Professional Footballers’ Association, and the path to recovery would be illuminated. Kirkland is no longer ashamed or embarrassed and he wants to tell his harrowing story so that others who are suffering in silence might feel the confidence to seek help. He is scheduled to speak at the PFA’s mental health and emotional wellbeing conference on Thursday at St George’s Park. “It’s easy for me to talk about it now because I’ve seen a way out of it,” Kirkland says. “That is the biggest thing and I want other people and other players to know that you’ve just got to talk. I never saw a way out of it until I started to talk about it. There was a fear. But as soon as you talk, that’s when you’re helping yourself and your family.” Kirkland sits in the lounge of his home in Aughton, to the north of Liverpool. Leeona is there, too, and so is the family dog, Sam. The veneer of comfort is inscrutable. Footballers have got it all, haven’t they? But depression is no respecter of reputation and it spreads furiously beneath the surface. Kirkland remembers “crying my eyes out” when he said his goodbyes at Wigan after six years – he had fallen from favour under Roberto Martínez – and, although he would be the No1 at Sheffield Wednesday for the next two seasons, he could feel “things starting to slip”. “As strange as it sounds, I managed to block it out during matches,” Kirkland adds. “I don’t know how. But the anxiousness was getting the better of me – with the travelling, for example. If I had to stay over in Sheffield, I was panicking.” Kirkland lost his place in the Wednesday team to Keiren Westwood in 2014-15 and he describes that season as “when it started to show; when I just wanted to shut down completely”. Wednesday would still offer him a new contract for the following season but he did not sign it. “I was going to,” Kirkland says. “It was the first day of pre-season, I was in the gym and I was going to go up and sign my contract in the next 10 minutes. But something just said: ‘I can’t stay.’ “I went in and said that I’d got problems. I didn’t tell them what they were. I just said I needed to be nearer to home because of the anxiety of the travelling over there and being away. Would I get stuck in traffic? Would I have to stay over? They were all gobsmacked, even if they knew that something was not quite right.” Kirkland signed a one-year deal at Preston North End but the downward spiral continued. He lost a dear friend to cancer at the beginning of 2016 while his dog, Max, died in the same week. Each was a shattering blow to his increasingly fragile psyche. Kirkland has never been a big socialiser and was always uncomfortable with his position in the public eye. As the depression tightened its grip, he became reclusive. “It’s a big knock-on thing and, eventually, you don’t want to go out,” Kirkland says. “You don’t want to talk to people. You put your phone on silent and you don’t reply to anyone. I couldn’t wait to come home. It’s a vicious circle and you just can’t get yourself out of it. “I couldn’t think properly. I couldn’t see a way of functioning. I didn’t want to get out of bed. I didn’t want to do the stuff that I’d always done. I just didn’t want to do anything. I wanted to shut myself off.” Leeona says that it was like losing her husband for four years. Kirkland nods. “I wasn’t the person she married,” he says. “Leeona’s family are in Scotland, mine are in Leicester, we’re tight-knit and I’ve always taken it upon myself to be the man of the house. I was embarrassed that I couldn’t look after the family properly. “I didn’t know what was happening. Obviously, you read stuff and I had a feeling it was depression but I wasn’t diagnosed, at the time, because I never said anything to anyone.” Kirkland felt he had coped with what came his way at the start of his career, when his uncommon mixture of height, agility and bravery marked him out for stardom. He became the most expensive goalkeeper in English football when Liverpool paid Coventry City £8m for him in 2001 – he was 20 years of age – while hyperbole tracked him. David Platt, the England Under-21 manager, called him the “best young goalkeeper in the world” while Sven-Göran Eriksson, the England manager, described him as the “future of English goalkeeping”. Kirkland would win his one and only senior cap as a second-half substitute against Greece in August 2006. However, Kirkland has since learned that it might have been impossible for him to compartmentalise the various demands and stresses. As Leeona puts it, they “pile up on top of each other before you get to a point where it all just explodes”. Kirkland’s injuries are a key part of his story and the perception of him. He suffered terribly at Liverpool and during a season-long loan at West Bromwich Albion in 2005-06, when one of his lay-offs was caused by a laceration to the kidney that left him urinating blood. The injuries themselves, to quote Kirkland, “knocked the stuffing out of me” but so, too, did the view of him as a serial crock. Post-2006 he had an excellent fitness record. “That’s one of the things that has griped at me – that people say I was always injured, when I wasn’t,” Kirkland says. Kirkland’s other regret is linked to the injuries that held him back at Liverpool. “I always wonder, and I can’t help it, where I would have got to if I had been injury-free,” he says. “My career could have been a lot better. When people say Chris Kirkland, they say: ‘Always injured.’ It’s not like: ‘Chris Kirkland; he won the Champions League.’ Like the top players. That’s just another factor that has piled up.” Kirkland might have won the Champions League with Liverpool in 2004-05 but, having started in four of their group phase ties, including the decisive 3-1 home win over Olympiakos, he was ruled out by injury for the remainder of the campaign. He was in the stands, together with Leeona, for the penalty shoot-out victory over Milan in the final and, to add to the insult, the team flight headed back from Istanbul without them. “They didn’t wait for us,” Kirkland says. “We got left and we missed the parade. Apparently, my medal was given to somebody else. We watched the parade on TV but only for a bit. We had to turn it off. So, that was a bit of a kick.” Kirkland reflects, too, on how he was only ever one error from being “crucified in the papers” – a goalkeeper’s lot is thankless – while he came to be more aware of the excruciating pressure in matches once he got to Wigan and relegation was a part of the equation. Then, there was the incident in October 2012 when, playing for Wednesday, he was blindsided by a pitch-invading Leeds United fan and punched in the face. Kirkland carries plenty of scars but they are beginning to heal. These days he will get out of the house and do something if he does not feel great instead of locking the doors. He has set up the Chris Kirkland Goalkeeper Academy for young hopefuls while he also coaches his daughter’s under-11s team. She is a goalkeeper too. Kirkland says that he would like to get into counselling to help those affected by mental health problems and there is no doubt that his own sessions with a woman in south Manchester – facilitated by Bennett and the PFA – have changed his life. “She has worked wonders,” Kirkland says. “I saw her at least once a week at first and now, I’m at once every two or three weeks. She’s given me coping mechanisms, such as breathing techniques, because I struggle a lot with anxiety; I still do. It’s an ongoing process but I now know that I can and will get through it.” In the UK the Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123.In the US, the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline is 1-800-273-8255.

After a long night of college carousing, the Old Etonian would often end up at the Silver Top, an elderly diner in the heart of Providence, which had been serving the same greasy, roadside staples since the 1930s. In December 2007, a decade and a half after his US sojourn, Byng took everything he had learned about beef patties, buns and the restaurant business and opened the first branch of his burger empire, Byron, in west London. The British hamburger has never been quite the same. To date, Byron has served more than 24m burgers at 70 locations across Britain. Originally backed by Gondola Group, the owners of Pizza Express and Ask, in 2013 the business was acquired by Hutton Collins Partners for £100m. Byng stood down as CEO earlier this year, but he left the meat sandwich market transformed, from the Big Macs and gastropub grub of the late 20th century into a burger universe that incorporates fast-food; so-called “better” burgers, flipped by the likes of Five Guys and Shake Shack; and premium burgers such as the Byron, the Honest Burger or the Bleecker Black. The UK burger business is now worth a super-sized £3.3bn, according to market research firm Mintel. The rise of the burger from a scapegoat for the obesity crisis to the symbol of a dining revolution was fuelled by a combination of social media and recession-era economics, and it established a whole new class of restaurant: inspired by simple street food, led by untrained chefs and advertised via Twitter. The gourmet burger has certainly dented the dominance of the old fast-food giants. But it has also disrupted the entire restaurant food chain. Before Byron, Britain’s leading purveyor of premium burgers was Gourmet Burger Kitchen, launched in London in 2001 by a trio of New Zealanders. But while GBK’s menu was replete with elaborate, bastardised burger recipes (among the ingredients of its signature “Kiwiburger” are beetroot and pineapple), Byron went back to basics. “GBK messed about with ‘global influences’; that’s not what I want from a burger,” says food writer and burger connoisseur Helen Graves. “I think a burger has specific parameters. Byron were groundbreaking because they made a fresh-tasting burger and didn’t mess about with it: it’s just a standard patty, lettuce, pickles and sauce, American-style.” Ten years ago, the hamburger was an object of suspicion, thanks to Eric Schlosser’s book Fast Food Nation (2001) and the 2004 documentary Super Size Me, which had vividly portrayed the health and environmental damage wreaked by the fast-food industry. Byron sidestepped that controversy by focusing on quality ingredients, by offering healthier-sounding sides such as courgette fries, and by serving its burgers alone (the fries cost extra) on a white plate, thus elevating the burger’s status from junk food to restaurant dish. If Byng was the modern burger’s Lonnie Donegan – the first person to popularise an American style in the UK – then Yianni Papoutsis was its Lennon and McCartney. Papoutsis was a technician for the English National Ballet, who had experience of burger-flipping at the Burning Man festival in Nevada, and who had travelled America eating old-school diner food and educating himself about how best to mince one’s beef, toast one’s buns and grill one’s onions. “The best burger I ever ate in the US was at a tiny little diner opposite an amusement park somewhere in New England,” Papoutsis says. “I can’t even remember its name. I’d gone there for breakfast and chatted to the owners over the counter for so long that it got to lunchtime. The burger was a game-changer: really, really simple, but made with such care.” In summer 2009, he bought a burger van, opened a Twitter account and started cooking on an industrial estate in south London. Graves was the first to review the Meat Wagon. A reader of her influential blog, Food Stories, had spotted the #MEATwagon hashtag, “discovered this little burger van in a carpark in Peckham and emailed me about it,” she recalls. “I went down there, ate one of Yianni’s big, juicy, filthy, drippy burgers, wrote about it on my blog and it blew up from there. It couldn’t have happened without Twitter.” The online buzz had also attracted pub owner Scott Collins, and when the meat wagon was stolen in late 2010, he and Papoutsis teamed up to open a punky, pop-up diner, MEATeasy, above the Goldsmith’s Tavern in New Cross. Londoners dutifully made the journey to the then-barely-fashionable corner of the city to sample Papoutsis’s signature “Dead Hippie” burger, made with a special sauce whose recipe remains a closely guarded secret. If MEATeasy’s remote location and authentically scuzzy decor made it more attractive to questing millennial foodies, then that was just luck, says Papoutsis. “We set up in the only places we could afford or arrange. All our sites have been abandoned and unloved for some time and we’ve gone in and salvaged them. We had to decorate MEATeasy with pages from my old books because we didn’t have enough money for paint. I think it worked because it was true to itself. It wasn’t a piece of scenery; it was what it was.” Their first permanent venue, the cavernous MEATliquor, opened less than a year later beneath a multistorey carpark near Oxford Street. It didn’t take reservations, nor run a waiting list, yet punters queued in the winter cold for over an hour to eat a Dead Hippie. Six years on, Collins and Papoutsis have 13 London sites and expect to hit £17m in sales in 2017. When MEATliquor opened, Gavin Lucas, then a staff writer for Creative Review, had just launched Burgerac, his website devoted to London’s burgeoning burger scene. “Yianni’s success was to do with several factors coming together,” he says. “People lost their jobs in the recession and started to wonder if they could make a living without working for the man. Meanwhile, social media took hold; suddenly, you could turn your passion into a stall without having a bricks-and-mortar premises, without hiring a brand agency to get the word out.” The era also created a generation of 20- and 30-somethings keen to eat restaurant food that was both affordable and worthy of Instagram. Polpo founder Russell Norman, who launched the first of his unpretentious Italian restaurants in Soho in 2009, joined the London burger boom by opening a Brooklyn-style diner, Spuntino, two years later. “People still wanted to eat out,” he says, “but it was more acceptable to spend money in scruffy places like ours, where the average bill was low, than in more formal places. The value-added, fun element meant you were still getting an experience that helped lift the recession blues in an appropriate, unflashy way ... A meal at MEATLiquor is as much about the story, the design, the tongue-in-cheek attitude and the service-with-swagger as the excellent grub.” In the months and years after MEATliquor’s launch, a string of premium burger joints opened across London and the UK. Some, like Patty &amp; Bun and Honest Burger, have grown into thriving chains. Others, like Lucky Chip and Bleecker Burger, have maintained just a handful of beloved sites. Soho House founder Nick Jones launched Dirty Burger. Burger &amp; Lobster, whose first branch was in Mayfair, decided to sell burgers for £20 each, with remarkable success. Northern England’s answer to MEATliquor, Almost Famous, made the national news in 2013, when a woman dislocated her jaw at its Liverpool branch while trying to eat the triple-patty “Kids in America” burger with pretzels and candied bacon. By the time the US “better burger” chains Shake Shack and Five Guys finally arrived on these shores in 2013 – to a loud fanfare – the British were already making burgers every bit as tasty as the Americans. (There are now seven Shake Shacks and 80 branches of Five Guys in the UK.) MEATliquor provided the paradigm for a new business model: a food truck and social media operation that acts as both rehearsal and advertisement for a future bricks-and-mortar location. And Papoutsis’s burgers were emblematic of a new class of street food restaurants, which devoted their efforts to making one dish extremely well. “The burger brigade and beyond – chicken wings, hot dogs, ribs – take what was once thought of as junk food but give it the same high-quality attention to detail that is the domain of so-called fine-dining chefs,” says Norman. That’s a lot harder than it sounds, especially in a crowded market, adds Papoutsis: “A burger is a very simple thing, but the simplest things are the ones you have to do the best, because everyone can see and taste it on its merits.” Over an undoubtedly successful decade, Byron has nonetheless faced challenges. In 2015, the chain was forced to add a warning to its menus about the health dangers of undercooked meat, after the Food Standards Authority expressed concern that pink-middled gourmet burgers were putting people at greater risk of food poisoning. Byron faced another controversy in July 2016, when its management reportedly collaborated in an immigration sting on its own staff that saw 35 people detained by immigration officers. Activists later released hundreds of cockroaches at two London branches in protest. The company also suffered a dip in profits last year, which it attributed to the “increasing intensity of competition.” While most of these restaurants are spreading slowly around the country, London already seems saturated with burger businesses. Within 10 minutes’ walk of the King’s Cross headquarters of the Guardian, for example, there are branches of Five Guys, Honest Burger, MEATliquor and Burger King – and two McDonald’s. The nearest Byron is just 20 minutes’ walk away. Yet Simon Cope, who joined Byron in July as its new managing director, says there is still space in the market. All told, Cope estimates there are fewer than 400 premium burger restaurants in Britain. (Nando’s alone has 340 UK locations.) And while the burger boom has “forced the likes of McDonald’s to look at what they offer and ask how they can change their quality,” he says, what it has really disrupted is home dining: “The sheer level of people who eat out now is so much higher than it was 20 years ago. We’ve simply given people the option, rather than having an average quality hamburger from a supermarket, of having a better-quality hamburger from a restaurant.” The emergence of large-scale home food delivery businesses such as Deliveroo and UberEats has added yet another option: having your premium burger brought to your door. Deliveroo faces potential action from several local authorities in London for bypassing planning rules by setting up temporary kitchens in carparks and on industrial estates, where food is made exclusively for delivery by chefs from restaurants reportedly including MEATliquor and GBK. Maybe the pertinent question, then, is not how much the market can grow, but how much better the burgers can be. Once you have mastered the art of putting a piece of meat between two pieces of bread, what next? For Cope, who runs a £100m business, the focus is on consumer demand. At a time when vegetarian food is becoming almost as popular as burgers, that could mean developing “the very best premium vegetarian burger in the country,” he says. Hawksmoor, the award-winning London steak restaurants, have looked to the classics for inspiration. The group recently added a burger to its menu called the Big Matt: a gourmet tribute to the Big Mac, created by Hawksmoor executive chef Matt Brown. According to Helen Graves, it is a “masterpiece”. (At £12 to the Big Mac’s £2.99, it had better be.) Gavin Lucas, who spent two years running his own burger pop-up at a Marylebone pub, says the perfect burger is an elusive dream, and a burger chain is not the place to go looking for it: “As soon as you have more than about 10 branches, you can’t work with a butcher, you have to work with wholesalers. And as soon as you start imagining the tonnage of cow that’s going into those businesses, it’s harder to remain in love with their burger,” he says. “The best burger in terms of absolute quality won’t be from a burger chain. It’s probably in a restaurant or a pub, conjured up by a chef who wants to do something special. To make a great burger, you have to have really good suppliers – and you have to have love in your heart.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"money/2017/oct/14/app-idea-downloads-financial-success","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-14T06:00:00Z","webTitle":"Got an app idea?

Then, right at the end, he showed us this last thing which was only an image – a sketch of some coloured blocks, a flock of birds and some smoke and dust.” For some reason, Hed says, he felt that single sketch conveyed a lot of energy. “There wasn’t a proper game idea behind it at that moment. But I fell in love with that image and its energy. I just got a feeling that this was the game we should develop.” At the time Rovio, the company Hed had co-founded, was devoting most of its resources to developing games for other people. “Angry Birds was our 52nd game and it started off as a side project.” Iisalo’s sketch eventually became the now-famous game in which players must help angry-looking birds save their eggs from their enemies the pigs. But with little time and budget allotted to it, the app’s development hit setbacks. “At one point, after the summer holidays, we felt the spark was gone and we nearly killed it. Thank God we didn’t.” Just months after its release in December 2009, Angry Birds was the number one paid app in Apple’s App Store. By 2011, 123 million people had downloaded it and it had become the best-selling app of all time. It has since been downloaded more than 3.7bn times and spawned an animated series, toys, cookbooks, bird books, comics, soft drinks and a blockbuster movie. When Rovio launched on the stock market a fortnight ago, it was valued at more than $1bn. “Of course, there have been moments of elation and happiness, but when I think back, what I remember feeling most is worry,” says Hed. “I knew exactly how fragile our success was, and how hard it is to get to the number one spot.” If you have an idea for an app, you will be glad to hear that the money generated by downloads, mobile commerce and in-app advertising in the UK is increasing. By 2021 it is estimated that the UK app economy will be worth about £83bn, up from £22bn last year, and the average in-app spend of £3.50 per hour per person in the UK will rise to £8.35 an hour in the next five years, the analytics company App Annie predicts. Creating a popular app could certainly prove lucrative. Nearly 5,000 developers are estimated to have made more than $1m in 2016, and a survey of more than 22,000 developers by SlashData last year found almost one in five earn more than £19,000 a month. However, the survey also found that 41% of developers earn less than £75 a month on average, and the vast majority (71%) earn less than £45,000 a year. So how do you make money from apps? “There is no simple answer, because if there was everyone would be successful at it,” says Jason Laan, whose photo app Face Swap Live was one of the top paid-for apps in the Apple App Store last year. “My app was successful because people could create funny photos and videos and then share them. It had a viral component to it.” Nearly 1,000 apps are submitted to the app store each day, and Laan estimates he is competing with more than 13 million other developers. “There are tons of amazing apps out there that no one knows about. To stand out from the competition you need to make something that people want to use, and that you can get users to know about.” This is why, he says, many popular apps at the moment are from celebrities or shows, or reflect a current meme: “They are riding a marketing wave.” Marketing can make all the difference, suggests Rego Apps founder, Allen Wong, who became a multimillionaire off the back of his police scanner radio app. “A slightly inferior app can outsell a superior product if your competitor markets their app well. Every sale lost to a competitor puts you further down on the search results list and the ranking charts. Without being on the top of those lists, you lose exposure to potential buyers and that further puts you lower down the list.” Ian Schenkel, who earned £8m from his app PrintCentral, says many developers make the mistake of spending far too much money on developing a shiny, beautiful interface rather than prioritising their marketing budget and getting their app released. “As a start-up you need to create a striking app that’s appealing and functional, and then as you go along you can update it. The most important thing is to be clever about your marketing.” After spotting a gap in the market in 2010 for an app that allowed people to print from their iPads, Schenkel and his brother quickly built and released PrintCentral before Apple incorporated a printing functionality into its operating system. At one point they were selling a £4 download every 50 seconds. “By the time Apple’s system had caught up, we had momentum and we’d learned stuff about the market.” Marketing an app, he says, doesn’t have to be hugely expensive. “PR is important – getting stuff written about your app and getting reviews – and so is social media. Utilise your network.” Haven’t got a network of users, testers, tech journalists and investors? Then you will need to build one before you launch, says the Junto Network founder Danielle Newnham. She ran an award-winning mobile app agency for seven years and has written two books about tech entrepreneurs. “You can create an incredible app, but if no one can find it on the app store it won’t do well.” She advises entrepreneurs to write blogs about their app, give talks, rope friends into testing, befriend other techies, read up on similar apps and target the journalists who covered them. “Get people involved and emotionally engaged in what you are doing, so that when you do launch they can help spread the word.” She also recommends framing the purpose and function of the app with a story you can tell. “Half the battle with marketing an app is finding a unique story which helps to sell the product.” Katie Massie-Taylor took this storytelling approach when she and Sarah Hesz, a friend she met in a playground, launched Mush, a social app for parents dubbed “Tinder for mums”. “We thought there needed to be a more modern ways for parents to find each other and avoid feeling lonely,” she says. They built the app for £50,000 while on maternity leave, launched it 18 months later, got some positive press and say they now have hundreds of thousands of users. But because their app is free their revenue is via in-app sponsorship; they only recently managed to start paying themselves a salary. “With social networks, it’s about getting a critical mass of users before you’ve got enough value for the customer that they’re willing to pay for it,” says Massie-Taylor, adding that venture capitalists understand this approach, and Mush has attracted a £1.2m investment. “To be a viable business, we know we’ll have to start charging our members for a certain element of usage in the future. But we want the basic app to always be free so we can fulfil our original mission to help parents connect.” Newnham, Schenkel and Hed all advocate this “freemium” model, where a basic version of an app is offered for free, but users must pay for premium content or enhanced features or to eradicate annoying adverts or watermarks. “There is this myth that charging for your app will make you the most money the quickest, but what mobile gaming has taught us is that the freemium model works very well,” says Newnham. “It is now very hard to make money from a paid app unless you have a loyal following. We are given so much content for free nowadays that consumers won’t want to jump through hoops or part with cash. But if your app is easy and appealing to download, and engaging enough that using it becomes a habit, they will happily pay extra further down the line.” Develop your aptitude • “The path to success lies in originality,” says Danielle Newnham. “Find the problem and then innovate the solution.” She explains that successful apps take an age-old problem of convenience, such as finding a parking space, and create an innovative way to solve it. • “Think about your target audience and how you can make it as mass market as possible,” says Niklas Hed. “If it’s a game, look at whether the game mechanics, graphics and genre fit that audience. Then consider how, in a world of free games, you can monetise the app in a way that the audience feels is a good trade for a good experience. They need to feel more than happy to put money into the game. If all those aspects are aligned, your app doesn’t need to be perfect – just good enough.” • “Make sure your app has global appeal,” says Ian Schenkel. “Don’t limit your app to your local market – it may be quite cheap to translate it into other languages.” • “Be open to different ways of making money from your app,” explains Katie Massie-Taylor. “This can buy you time to work out how to make more money long term. But don’t get distracted from the end goal of providing amazing value to the customer.” • “Make your app creative and engaging,” says Newnham. “Apps like Marvel can help you turn sketches into usable prototypes.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"technology/2017/oct/11/government-considers-classifying-google-facebook-publishers","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-11T19:11:38Z","webTitle":"UK government considers classifying Google and Facebook as publishers","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/oct/11/government-considers-classifying-google-facebook-publishers","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2017/oct/11/government-considers-classifying-google-facebook-publishers","fields":{"headline":"UK government considers classifying Google and Facebook as publishers","bodyText":"Karen Bradley, the culture secretary, has said the government is considering changing the legal status of Google, Facebook and other internet companies amid growing concerns about copyright infringement and the spread of extremist material online. The internet groups are considered conduits of information rather than publishers under UK law, meaning they have limited responsibility for what appears on their sites. However, the chairman of the media regulator Ofcom said on Tuesday she believed the likes of Google and Facebook were publishers, raising the prospect that they could eventually face more regulation. Bradley said she was wary of labelling internet companies publishers but that the government wanted to find a balance between harnessing the benefits of the web while making it safe for users and protecting intellectual property. “We need to get the balance right so that we have a free vibrant internet that we can harness all the benefits from while protecting the intellectual property that is ultimately the thing that differentiates the United Kingdom from other parts of the world,” she said. “I am looking into this. I am not sure the publisher definition in UK law would necessarily work in the way that people would like it to work. I think it would end up being very restrictive and make the internet not work in the way we want it to work. “We need to be careful here that what we do is not a sledgehammer to crack a nut – a piece of legislation where we say under UK common law these platforms are now publishers, which could impact on freedom of speech, civil liberties and the ability of people to enjoy the benefits that the internet brings. But we have to do this in a way that doesn’t allow harm.” Bradley made her comments as she was speaking to MPs on the digital, culture, media and sport committee. She also said the government could introduce new laws to regulate internet businesses. Bradley said she wanted the UK to be the “safest place to be online” but that she was “clearly not” happy with the status quo and internet companies need to do more. The government has this week proposed that internet businesses pay for measures to combat and raise awareness about online bullying and other web dangers. The voluntary levy on leading web players was part of a new internet safety strategy, which also includes proposals for a code of practice for social media companies. However, Bradley said she was ruling nothing out in going further. “I would like to do as little legislatively as possible because I think legislation is a blunt instrument that often doesn’t deliver what you want it to deliver. But I don’t rule out bringing in new laws if that is what is required,” she said. The culture secretary praised internet companies for being “proactive” on eradicating indecent images of children online and said she sensed a willingness among businesses to do more. Bradley also answered questions from MPs about the BBC, Channel 4 and 21st Century Fox’s proposed takeover of Sky. Last month Bradley announced she was referring the Fox and Sky deal to the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) for a six-month investigation on the grounds of media plurality and broadcasting standards. Fox is controlled by Rupert Murdoch and his sons Lachlan and James. Bradley said she referred the deal because a report by Ofcom created “sufficient uncertainty” about the tie-up. She pledged she would make the final decision on the deal following the CMA investigation on the basis of evidence, saying: “It is not based on personal emotion or feelings or views about the people involved.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2017/oct/11/jamie-george-saracens-england-eddie-jones","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-11T21:16:00Z","webTitle":"Saracens’ Jamie George ready to impose authority to impress Eddie Jones","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/oct/11/jamie-george-saracens-england-eddie-jones","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/oct/11/jamie-george-saracens-england-eddie-jones","fields":{"headline":"Saracens’ Jamie George ready to impose authority to impress Eddie Jones","bodyText":"Jamie George started three Tests for the Lions in the summer, but the Saracens hooker looks destined to return to the bench for the start of England’s autumn international campaign against Argentina at Twickenham next month with Dylan Hartley standing in his way. The pair will renew their rivalry on Sunday when Northampton face the holders Saracens in the European Champions Cup at Franklin’s Gardens and while the England head coach, Eddie Jones, will watch with interest, the prime reason he has favoured Hartley since taking charge at the end of 2015 is the leadership qualities of the Saints’ captain. “Leadership is something I need to add,” said George. “I am trying to bring it to my game and I feel good when I am expressing an opinion. It definitely makes me more engaged and brings out the best in me as a player. As a consequence I feel my relationship with the coaches has improved.” Hartley did not make the squad for the Lions tour to New Zealand, four years after being included but having to pull out because of suspension. George has spent his England career on the bench but saw off the challenges of the Ireland captain, Rory Best, and Wales’s first-choice hooker, Ken Owens, to cement his place in the Test side. “I feel I developed hugely as a player on the tour,” said George, who scored a hat-trick of tries against Wasps on Sunday. “It has given me increased confidence and I put expectation on myself because I want to play to a standard I am proud of. I think I set the standard in the second Test in New Zealand and base all my performances on that. “I played with intensity and physicality and I now realise where I need to be. The week building up to that second Test was the best week that I had. I’ve put a really big focus on this season doing a lot of extras.” Asked what he needed to do to become an England starter after 17 caps from the bench, George replied: “It’s a tough one. I don’t know the answer because if I did, I’d be doing it. The messages from the England coaches are that I have to improve in certain areas. The consistency of my performances needs to remain high. I can’t afford to have periods where I’m in and out of games. I have to make sure I am getting the ball in my hands a lot and making dents with my physicality in defence and attack. “I’ve never wanted to be second-choice, but it’s the way that it has fallen. I’ve learned a lot from my time at Saracens. When I started, I was third-choice behind John Smit and Schalk Brits. I learned the value of patience. When you’re not playing, it’s such an important time for you to improve.” He added: “When I am away with England, it is an opportunity to improve and make the most of it. I thought I did that pretty well in the Six Nations.” Jones made the point this year about George drifting in and out of matches and the pair spoke during this month’s national squad camp in Brighton. The head coach, who took England to Argentina in the summer, has made few public comments about the Lions tour, saying it had nothing to do with him. “Eddie just wants me to keep striving to get better,” said George. “He was happy with some parts of my game [with the Lions] but there are areas he wants me to work on. It all goes back to consistency and making sure that I am on it all the time and don’t dip.” Northampton will have to be on it for 80 minutes on Sunday, and not just because Saracens have won the tournament for the past two seasons without losing a match. The Saints, who expect their England flanker Tom Wood to be fit, were beaten 55-24 by Sarries at Twickenham on the opening weekend of the season. “There has been an edge to training this week,” said George. “Everyone knows the importance of the match. We are the defending champions and want to get our campaign off to a flying start in a tough group. We had a magician in last week, Pete the Heat, who pointed out that the trick happens before the big reveal. What we took from that is working off the ball. People see the tries, but it is about what we do before that.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"science/2017/oct/12/more-than-25-million-people-dying-in-agony-without-morphine-every-year","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-12T22:30:16Z","webTitle":"More than 25 million people dying in agony without morphine every year","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/oct/12/more-than-25-million-people-dying-in-agony-without-morphine-every-year","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2017/oct/12/more-than-25-million-people-dying-in-agony-without-morphine-every-year","fields":{"headline":"More than 25 million people dying in agony without morphine every year","bodyText":"More than 25 million people, including 2.5 million children, die in agony every year around the world, for want of morphine or other palliative care, according to a major investigation. Poor people cannot get pain relief in many countries of the world because their needs are overlooked or the authorities are so worried about the potential illicit use of addictive opioids that they will not allow their importation. “Staring into this access abyss, one sees the depth of extreme suffering in the cruel face of poverty and inequity,” says a special report from a commission set up by the Lancet medical journal. In Haiti, for instance, says the report, there are no nursing homes or hospices for the dying and most have to suffer without pain relief at home. “Patients in pain from trauma or malignancy are treated with medications like ibuprofen and acetaminophen,” says testimony from Antonia P Eyssallenne of the University of Miami School of Medicine. “Moreover, nurses are uncomfortable giving high doses of narcotics even if ordered to do so for fear of being “responsible” for the patient’s death, even if the patient is terminal. “Death in Haiti is cruel, raw, and devastatingly premature. There is often no explanation, no sympathy, and no peace, especially for the poor.” A doctor in Kerala, India, which has a palliative care service, told of the arrival of a man in agony from lung cancer. “We put Mr S on morphine, among other things. A couple of hours later, he surveyed himself with disbelief. He had neither hoped nor conceived of the possibility that this kind of relief was possible,” said Dr M R Rajagopal. But when he returned, morphine stocks were out. “Mr S told us with outward calm, ‘I shall come again next Wednesday. I will bring a piece of rope with me. If the tablets are still not here, I am going to hang myself from that tree’. He pointed to the window. I believed he meant what he said.” The commission’s three-year inquiry found that nearly half of all deaths globally – 25.5 million a year – involve serious suffering for want of pain relief and palliative care. A further 35.5 million people live with chronic pain and distress. Of the 61 million total, 5.3 million are children. More than 80% of the suffering takes place in low and middle-income countries. Jim Yong Kim, president of the World Bank, said things had to change. “Failure of health systems in poor countries is a major reason that patients need palliative care in the first place. More than 90% of these child deaths are from avoidable causes. We can and will change both these dire situations.” Morphine is hard to obtain in some countries and virtually unobtainable in others. Mexico meets 36% of its need, China meets 16%, India 4% and Nigeria 0.2%. In some of the world’s poorest countries, such as Haiti, Afghanistan and many countries in Africa, oral morphine in palliative care is virtually non-existent. Oral and injectable morphine is out of patent, but costs vary widely and it is cheaper in affluent countries like the USA than in poor countries. A second issue is “opiophobia” – the fear that allowing the drugs to be used in hospitals will lead to addiction and crime in the community. “The world suffers a deplorable pain crisis: little to no access to morphine for tens of millions of adults and children in poor countries who live and die in horrendous and preventable pain,” says Professor Felicia Knaul, co-chair of the commission from the University of Miami, calling it “one of the world’s most striking injustices”. Knaul says she only realised that many people suffered without pain relief when she was working to improve access to cancer treatment in low-income countries. “I was shocked. I had no idea. When people were showing me the data I thought it can’t be in this world,” she told the Guardian. She had also experienced the need for morphine herself after a mastectomy for breast cancer. “When I woke up I couldn’t breathe because the pain was so bad. If they hadn’t arrived with the morphine I don’t know how I would have got through it.” By the time she was 18, she had seen her father suffer without adequate pain relief, before he died in Canada. “I don’t think that we have cared enough about poor people who have pain,” she said. “It doesn’t make them live any longer. It doesn’t make them more productive. It is simply the human right of not suffering any more pain and we don’t care about that for people who are poor.” The commission recommends that all countries put in place a relatively inexpensive package of effective palliative care for end of life conditions that cause suffering, including HIV, cancers, heart disease, injuries and dementia. One of their most emphatic recommendations, says Knaul, “is that immediate-release, off-patent, morphine that can cost just pennies should be made available in both oral and injectable formulations for any patient with medical need. The disparity and access abyss between the haves and have-nots is a medical, public health and moral injustice that can be effectively addressed by the commission’s recommendations.” • This article was amended on 13 October 2017 because an earlier version suggested that Felicia Knaul grew up in Mexico.

Sir Mark Prescott’s filly will be the Club’s first runner at the meeting, and heads to the December bloodstock sales a few weeks later. Frankie Dettori, who rode Lady Aurelia at York, was so convinced that he had beaten Marsha that he punched the air in celebration a stride after the line, and said afterwards that he was “dazed” to discover that Marsha and Luke Morris had got up in the final stride to win by the minimum margin. Lady Aurelia, who is trained in the US by Wesley Ward, is also being trained for the Turf Sprint and is 11-8 favourite to gain her revenge in San Diego, with Marsha on offer at 5-1 with several bookmakers to confirm the York form. Morris and Prescott will also be making their debuts at the Breeders’ Cup meeting, in a race in which Marsha will be chasing the richest prize of her career. The Turf Sprint, which has yet to be won by a European-trained runner in eight previous runnings, is worth $550,000 (£416,000) to the winner, more than twice the £198,000 that Marsha earned for her owners in the Nunthorpe. “We were offered a place [under the Win-and-you’re-in scheme] after York,” Dan Downie, Elite Racing Club’s manager, said on Wednesday. “We didn’t want to say anything until after Chantilly [where Marsha was second in the Prix de l’Abbaye], and we just made the final decision earlier this week. “It doesn’t look the strongest division [in US racing] and that was another reason that we felt she’d got nothing to lose. It’s going into the unknown travelling her over there, and it’s five furlongs at Del Mar, but she’s done everything so far and we think she’s obviously very smart and should take her chance. “It’s great for the Club to have a runner at that meeting. We were meant to have one a couple of years ago but it rained at Santa Anita and she was a late withdrawal. There are 10,500 members in the Club now and it’s a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, and the last time she will run in our colours as she will be going to the sales afterwards.” Marsha and Lady Aurelia are likely to have several pounds in hand of next month’s field in terms of ratings, and Downie is looking forward to the possibility of a rematch. “We thought we ought to try again to see if we can beat her by a bit further this time,” he said. “I saw her on Monday and I have to say she looked fantastic. You’d want them both to arrive in top form and both to run their race and it will be a real spectacle, hopefully.” Bryan Cooper suffered an unfortunate start to his new role as Alan Potts’s retained jockey in Britain on Wednesday, when he was unseated from the second of his two rides at Ludlow, just as he appeared to be moving into contention. Mick Thonic jumped the third-last fence well but then stumbled on landing, giving Cooper little chance to stay in the saddle. Earlier on the card, Cooper was last of 12 finishers aboard Exxaro in the card’s feature handicap chase, after his mount made several jumping errors. Ayr racecourse, which lost all three days of its biggest Flat meeting in September due to a patch of waterlogged ground, will stage a precautionary inspection at 8am before its final Flat card of the season on Thursday. The meeting is due to be run on the hurdles course and the going was heavy, soft in places on Wednesday with more rain forecast during the day.

It’s an urgent necessity’","bodyText":"Hurley’s first novel, The Loney, was widely praised. Stephen King declared: “It’s great. It’s an amazing piece of fiction.” Originally published by a small press in a run of just 300 copies, it went on to win the Costa best first novel of the year and book of the year at the British Book Industry awards. Your new novel, Devil’s Day, is set in a remote farming community called the Endlands. How did it begin its life? It was the landscape that informed the novel, and really started that process. It’s based on an area north of Preston, where I live – the Trough of Bowland. Essentially, it’s a stretch of moorland that goes north from Preston and over towards Yorkshire. It’s a really unspoilt, untrodden place, and it occurred to me, as it did when I was writing The Loney, that this was a place that had been missed off the map in terms of literary fiction. What was special about it? Those kinds of places are really quite rare nowadays, where you can go and not see anybody for hours. That’s what drew me to it – that it was a genuinely desolate, lonely place. I’ve asked myself a number of times what draws me to those kind of places, but I think it is an escape, partly, and a fascination with the natural world; this feeling that we are a part of it, but yet it’s something separate from us as well. Despite its harshness, it’s certainly somewhere that could make you feel released from the modern world… I think that’s partly what John, in the novel, appreciates about the place. There’s a kind of reduction – a simple sort of living. There are only certain things that are of value, only certain things which are worth doing because they contribute to the community; and if they don’t, then they don’t do them. There is a kind of very attractive simplicity about living in a place like that – all the superfluous crap that the modern world throws at you and you have to digest and consume and aspire to do doesn’t really exist in that community. Yet there is also the unpredictability of the elements that is quite menacing and threatens to undermine all this. Indeed: curses, the devil, inter-family violence. It’s not Wordsworth, is it? No! It’s kind of the opposite. I never wanted to write it in a romantic kind of way. Religion is a theme in both your books… Obviously The Loney was predominantly about faith. Devil’s Day is probably not quite so much about organised religion, but there are definite parallels between the two books. It’s a kind of giving over to something bigger, a faith in something much bigger than yourself, where the individual doesn’t matter so much as the group. They’re both about a kind of fundamentalism. You were raised a Catholic and served as an altar boy. It must have given you an understanding of ritual. I can understand the attractions of being in the tribe, because there’s a protection that’s afforded to you – whether spiritual or communal. Those very insular, inward-looking communities are absolutely reliant on myth and ritual for their own stability and survival. They have to keep telling these stories about their own self-reliance, or strength, or importance, in order for them to exist. It took you a while to start writing – what finally made the difference? I was a teacher for many, many years, and it came to the point where I thought if I’m ever going to have the opportunity to write a novel, I need to not be teaching – it’s an all-encompassing job. I got a part-time job in a library, which was a lot quieter, and it allowed me time to write. Over three or four years, I wrote The Loney. It’s not an option about whether you write or not, really. You have this urgent necessity. Tell me about the Stephen King moment. I just got an email one day saying, “Stephen King’s read your book”. What, the Stephen King? Like a lot of writers of my generation, we grew up reading his short stories and novels – my teenage years were spent doing that. For somebody of that stature to have read it was great – but for him to say what he said about it was amazing. • Devil’s Day by Andrew Michael Hurley is published by John Murray (£12.99).

In a break with tradition, Charles will place his 91-year-old mother’s floral tribute at the base of the Cenotaph in London on 12 November while an equerry will lay 96-year-old Prince Philip’s wreath. It is the first time the Queen will be present at the Remembrance Day service and not lay a wreath. The Queen and Philip will watch the ceremony from a balcony at the Foreign Office overlooking the Cenotaph in Whitehall, traditionally used by female royals including the Duchess of Cornwall and Duchess of Cambridge. A Buckingham Palace spokeswoman said: “The Queen wishes to be alongside the Duke of Edinburgh and he will be on the balcony.” Philip retired from solo public duties earlier this year, but will still accompany the Queen on certain occasions. The Remembrance Day service would require the elderly couple to stand for a significant amount of time. The Queen’s wreath is laid on behalf of the nation. The service is seen by the Queen as one of the most important events in her diary and she has only missed it on a handful of occasions because of either being abroad on tour, or due to pregnancy. Her decision to hand the responsibility to Charles is illustrative of how both Buckingham Palace and Clarence House see the heir gradually taking over more of his mother’s duties. Since she no longer undertakes long-haul travel, Charles already represents her on official visits overseas, including at the biennial Commonwealth heads of government meeting."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"education/2017/oct/11/boys-will-not-attend-class-with-those-they-have-abused","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-11T18:54:28Z","webTitle":"Boys 'will not attend class with those they have abused'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2017/oct/11/boys-will-not-attend-class-with-those-they-have-abused","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/education/2017/oct/11/boys-will-not-attend-class-with-those-they-have-abused","fields":{"headline":"Boys 'will not attend class with those they have abused'","bodyText":"The government will introduce rules to stop boys who sexually abuse other children at school from being allowed back in the same classroom, schools minister Nick Gibb told a committee of MPs investigating sexual harassment and violence within schools. Gibb said official guidelines needed to be clear that abusers could not return to classes alongside their victims, and told the Commons women and equalities committee that the government will shortly launch a consultation to make the required changes. Gibb was pushed to explain the present policy by Jess Phillips, MP for Birmingham Yardley, who suggested the guidance could be made clearer if it said that pupils who committed peer-on-peer sexual abuse could not be placed alongside their victim. “Where there is such a case, the perpetrator and the victim should not be in the same classroom,” Gibb said, adding that the guidance “cannot anticipate every single possible circumstance that could occur”. Last year a report by the committee called for urgent action to end widespread sexual harassment of girls by their peers at school. “Do you think it is acceptable, either to the girls, or the schools, that two years will have passed for this guidance to come into force when we called for immediate action?” Phillips asked Gibb. Gibb replied that the general election had slowed down the government’s response, and pledged that interim advice would be issued shortly. Sarah Green, of the End Violence Against Women coalition, said the group was pleased the government had finally responded to the committee’s recommendation. “In the worst cases our members come across, schools are worried about being seen to treat an ‘unproven’ allegation seriously and girls commonly leave school. Adult women in good workplaces would never be treated this way,” Green said. “We hope the minister’s commitment to new guidance is fulfilled without delay. And we hope schools are able to use the experience and skills of specialist sexual violence organisations to help them respond to this endemic abuse.” Maria Miller, the committee chair, told Gibb that the panel had been told of schools that “do not routinely report these things to the police”, citing figures from a BBC Panorama documentary suggesting a 70% increase in school-based peer attacks. “The lack of a protocol, or information or guidance on how you then deal with that situation, seems to be something that is leaving headteachers flummoxed,” Miller said. “I find it extraordinary that young girls are being asked to go back into school, into class, with people who have raped them.” Since the committee’s 2016 report was published, the Children and Social Work Act has made relationships education compulsory for all primary and secondary school pupils, as well as sex education for secondary pupils. The recent Panorama documentary revealed that about 30,000 instances of children sexually assaulting their peers – including 2,600 attacks that may have taken place in schools – had been reported to police in the past four years. The data from 38 police forces in England and Wales found that reports of sexual abuse and attacks rose from 4,600 in 2013 to nearly 7,900 in 2016. Miller said: “The committee is perplexed as to why the government is not acting with more urgency. “I understand that the education wheels move slowly, but we are talking about children being abused in schools on our watch and that just has to change quicker than I think we are hearing.” Gibb told the committee that the advice to schools is regularly updated, and that the government will also be publishing specific guidance for headteachers on peer-on-peer abuse within schools."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2017/oct/12/boar-war-the-forest-of-dean-pixies-fighting-against-the-cull-of-wild-pigs","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-12T05:00:32Z","webTitle":"'Boar War': the Forest of Dean pixies fighting against the cull of wild pigs","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/oct/12/boar-war-the-forest-of-dean-pixies-fighting-against-the-cull-of-wild-pigs","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/oct/12/boar-war-the-forest-of-dean-pixies-fighting-against-the-cull-of-wild-pigs","fields":{"headline":"'Boar War': the Forest of Dean pixies fighting against the cull of wild pigs","bodyText":"Drew Pratten admits it can be a little unnerving to suddenly come upon a wild boar in the forest. “They are very big. When they growl at you it’s primal. You get the sort of feeling deep in your stomach that you get when you hear a lion roar. But these animals don’t want to hurt anyone. If you slowly back away they are fine. We should all be living peacefully together.” Pratten, a 49-year-old marketing consultant, is one of a band of dedicated animal rights activists in Gloucestershire pitting itself against marksmen and government officials in what is being dubbed the “Boar War”. The Forestry Commission has set up gun towers from which marksmen cull the powerful pigs that roam the ancient woodland between the river Severn and the Welsh mountains. A 30-strong group calling themselves the Forest of Dean Wild Boar Cull Saboteurs is determined to stop them. The “pixies”, as the activists term themselves, have been accused of tactics ranging from knocking over gun towers to smearing excrement over gate locks (they deny the second allegation). A Gloucestershire police inspector said the activists were wasting taxpayers’ money while local politicians are calling for both sides of the boar dispute to come together to find a peaceful solution. Pratten, 49, who acts a spokesperson for the saboteurs, met the Guardian at the Speech House, a 17th century former hunting lodge at the centre of the Forest of Dean. He pointed out the signs of the creatures’ presence: the turned earth where they had foraged for insects and roots; the flattened bracken where they had slept. “The boar should be seen as a massive asset to this place. It’s the one thing these days that the Forest of Dean is known for but at the moment they are being demonised.” Pratten smiled when asked if he is a pixie and replied: “I have taken part in direct action.” Denying any member of his group had smeared excrement, he said: “It’s childish, it doesn’t help. If you want to disable a lock there are better ways of doing that.” In previous years the Forestry Commission built wooden towers from which to shoot from. “The wooden towers were knocked over in the wind or by pixies. Some were dismantled,” Pratten said. This year the commission set up metal ones to reduce maintenance costs and vandalism. Critics say they look like the sort of structure that you might come across in a prison of war camp. “You’d need an angle grinder to tackle one of those,” said Pratten. “And nobody’s got an extension lead that long.” But there are softer ways of disrupting the cull. “They put bait out, you take the bait you put it somewhere else. Simple. We’re saying don’t eat it over here, eat it over there.” Boar became extinct in England 300 years ago. The original modern Dean population established after an escape from a wild boar farm in the 1990s and an illegal release in 2004. Average litter sizes in the Dean are between six and 10 piglets, nearly twice that of their cousins on the continent. They have no natural predators – except man – and the recent mild winters have helped populations soar. The Forest Commission, the government department that manages more than 7,000 hectares (17,300 acres) of land in the area, defines the boar as feral. It says the most obvious sign of the boar is the damage caused to grass verges, parks, sports pitches and church-yards but it reports there have been incidents of people being chased by boar and dogs being killed. The commission says there are also “wider social impacts” of boar, such as older and more vulnerable people being afraid to go out at dusk or at night for fear of meeting one of the animals. In addition, it points out that the number of road traffic accidents involving boar overtook those involving deer in 2013. The commission put the boar population in 2016-17 at 1,562, though some activists believe this figure is inflated. It has set a “target” population at 400. During the 2016-17 cull, 492 animals were killed – a number that also includes those killed in road accidents. While some of the activists believe contraception could be a way of managing the population, the commission has authorised shooting. Residents in the town of Cinderford on the fringe of the forest are split. Butcher Cameron Swaine sells boar sausages, burgers and steaks (though bought from private local landowners rather than the Forestry Commission, whose meat is sent out of Gloucestershire). “I understand people get upset when their garden is ruined by boar but for me they are part of the forest,” he said. Marion Jayne, landlady of the Fern Ticket pub, said she felt sorry for the “poor little piggies”. “When I drive home late at night you see foxes, rabbits, deer and boar. If people don’t like them they shouldn’t live in the forest.” Bar worker Corrie Thomas, 22, had a close encounter with a boar in his car recently: “It clipped me – or I clipped it. Luckily it was a small one.” Dog lover Jeff , who did not want to give his surname, said the animals made life in the forest more difficult: “You have to be very careful where you walk, they can be dangerous. I have to keep the dogs on a lead.” Councillor Tim Gwilliam, the leader of the Forest of Dean council, said he believed the boar – if properly managed – could boost the local economy by attracting more visitors. He called on central government to take a grip of the situation. “I bet if they were trotting around Parliament Square they’d be sorted,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"science/2017/oct/15/plantwatch-autumn-and-leaves-are-falling-but-for-the-wrong-reasons","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-15T20:30:40Z","webTitle":"Plantwatch: Autumn and leaves are falling, but for the wrong reasons","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/oct/15/plantwatch-autumn-and-leaves-are-falling-but-for-the-wrong-reasons","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2017/oct/15/plantwatch-autumn-and-leaves-are-falling-but-for-the-wrong-reasons","fields":{"headline":"Plantwatch: Autumn and leaves are falling, but for the wrong reasons","bodyText":"The autumn tree colours are appearing, but all is not quite what it seems. Horse chestnut leaves started falling weeks ago like crispy brown pieces of paper, a sign of leaf miners infesting the trees. These are the caterpillars of a tiny moth, and a big tree can be infested with about 2m of these pests, which weakens the tree. Even more pernicious is a disease of horse chestnuts called bleeding canker, which can kill the tree. These are just two of many new pests and diseases attacking British trees in recent years. Native oak trees are being hit by acute oak decline, a disease causing black weeping fluid to seep from splits in the bark on the trunks of mature trees, and a severe infection can lead to the death of the tree within a few years. The disease is mostly found across East Anglia, the Midlands and south-east England, but it appears to be spreading. In the 1970s, Dutch elm disease killed off Britain’s elm trees, since when there’s been a steady increase in new pests and diseases of our trees, often caused by importing infected trees without proper checks. Climate change aggravates the problem, because these alien pests and diseases can become more established in a warmer climate, and existing ones can thrive. Our woodlands are more vulnerable to serious tree pests and diseases because 77% of England’s broadleaf woodlands are made up of just five tree species - oak, ash, beech, sycamore and birch. It shows the urgent need to plant a wider range of native tree species."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2017/oct/14/wake-me-when-im-gone-odafe-atogun-review","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-14T09:01:03Z","webTitle":"Wake Me When I’m Gone by Odafe Atogun review – magical thinking in Nigeria","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/oct/14/wake-me-when-im-gone-odafe-atogun-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2017/oct/14/wake-me-when-im-gone-odafe-atogun-review","fields":{"headline":"Wake Me When I’m Gone by Odafe Atogun review – magical thinking in Nigeria","bodyText":"Odafe Atogun’s second novel is set in a Nigerian village that could almost be described as magical. It is ruled by a despotic king and his council of priests; their worldview is, not surprisingly, patriarchal and ultra-conservative. Any form of dissent or innovation is punished with banishment, or death. Widows must marry within a prescribed period after losing their husbands; if they don’t, their children are taken away to live with their uncles, or in extreme cases exiled to the town limits and left there to forage or beg for their food. It is a cruel system crying out to be challenged, if someone is willing to pay the steep price that accompanies such defiance. An unlikely challenger emerges in the form of the beautiful and kindly Ese. Ese has just lost her husband and must now face the brunt of the king’s merciless decree: she stands to lose her only son, Noah. Meanwhile, the precocious Noah has forged a strong bond with the town’s homeless orphans and convinced his mother that they must care for these children, even if it means facing the king’s wrath. It is a strong and eventful opening, and the stakes continue to rise. The king, it transpires, is hopelessly in love with Ese – he has always been, even before she married her late husband, Tanto. Marrying the king would offer Noah better odds of survival, even though the king’s many wives sometimes kill off each other’s male children to improve their own sons’ chances. But the rub is, as Ese explains to the king, she will only marry a man she loves, and she is not in love with him. As in his first novel, Taduno’s Song, Atogun has combined folkloric elements with a strong central character to create a haunting and unusual narrative. His style is redolent of earlier African authors such as Amos Tutuola, Flora Nwapa and Gabriel Okara, who wrote what were loosely called “novels of local colour”, where the author pretends the colonial encounter never happened, and modernity is a distant phenomenon happening in the faraway city. Once in a while a visitor from the city will appear, exotic and interesting, but always viewed with suspicion. The Africa of such narratives is made up of hermetically sealed societies and plotlines are often influenced by the intervention of the supernatural. The main characters’ greatest opposition is usually tradition and taboo, and those who use them to control and exploit the masses. Clearly the gods love Ese. When she escapes her home village and arrives in another village with a similar tradition but with a younger, wiser king, she meets an older woman who tells her she has been waiting for her arrival for many years; the gods had foretold Ese’s arrival. The woman becomes Ese’s guardian and overnight Ese becomes rich and influential. The reader is of course expected to accept this divine intervention at face value – the implication being that Ese was chosen because of her purity of heart, and as a reward for her undeserved suffering at the hands of the village patriarch –and yet one can’t help but wonder what would have happened to Ese without this rich benefactor. Would she have been able to effect her changes to society without her new-found riches and influence, or would she have been another victim of tradition and patriarchy? The critic James Wood, writing about David Mitchell’s The Bone Clocks, cautioned against introducing the supernatural into modern narratives. He claims that such devices relegate the characters to secondary status, robbing them of agency and turning them into mere vehicles for the whims and wishes of the gods. The human should always be at the centre of events; characters must stand or fall by their ingenuity alone, not by arbitrary divine intervention. However, in Atogun’s defence, he is clearly not trying to write a modern tale. His story could be said to be an allegory about the endless contest between good and bad, and how the universe sometimes – but not always –sides with the good against the bad. Tradition can harbour both the good and the bad; Ese’s example shows that the bad must be resolutely and uncompromisingly opposed. It is a stark, almost puritanical worldview, but one whose severity is modified by this author’s beautiful imagery and evocative language. • Helon Habila’s The Chibok Girls: The Boko Haram Kidnappings &amp; Islamic Militancy in Nigeria is published by Penguin.

Muhammad Bayazid, who studied film-making in the US and was in Turkey promoting his upcoming film The Tunnel, was stabbed on Tuesday night while heading to a meeting with a supposed businessman who had promised to help raise funds for his project. He was described on Wednesday evening as being in a stable condition after hours in intensive care. “Last night he was very unstable, he was stabbed in the chest close to the blood vessels that provide blood to the heart, so there was massive bleeding,” Samah Safi Bayazid, Muhammad’s wife, told the Guardian by phone. “Thank God he is awake and conscious.” “It was a miracle that he survived,” she added, saying she believed the attack was an assassination attempt. Bayazid was working on a film dramatising the story of a Syrian-American man who spent 20 years in the prison in Palmyra, where thousands of Islamists and opponents of the Assad regime languished or were summarily executed. The prison was demolished by Islamic State when it conquered the city in 2015. A friend who was with Bayazid when he was stabbed said he had asked if he could join him for a meeting with a businessman who had a proposal for how to raise funds for the film. The supposed businessman had made contact online, claiming he wanted to personally invest in the film because he had also suffered in prison in Palmyra. The businessman had invited Bayazid to dinner at his villa, but when they arrived at the given location they did not find a residential building. They were instead approached by a man who asked to speak to Bayazid, and after inquiring about his name, stabbed him in the chest while he was still sitting in the car’s passenger seat. The friend, who was still in the car, then rushed Bayazid to hospital. “Along the way he lost a lot of blood and fainted a few times, but we arrived at the emergency room in time,” the friend said. “He has started his recovery, and we have contacted the police and authorities and informed them about all the details of the incident.” Turkey hosts an estimated 3 million Syrian refugees, including opposition activists and members of rebel groups who fought to overthrow Bashar al-Assad. Isis has violently targeted Syrian journalists based in Turkey in recent years after they reported on the group’s abuses in areas it controlled such as Raqqa. In September, two Syrian opposition journalists and activists, Orouba Barakat and her daughter Hala, were found dead in their Istanbul apartment with their throats cut. The attacks against Bayazid and the Barakat family appeared to specifically target opponents of the Syrian government, which is now within sight of victory following six years of civil war. Bayazid was arrested and tortured in Damascus in 2011, and was later granted asylum in the United States. He and his wife co-founded a film studio, producing works focused on human rights, religion and humanitarian issues. They garnered broader attention when they publicly announced their latest project, The Tunnel. “When we chose this life we knew what it meant, because we aren’t from places like America where we can express our opinions,” said Samah Safi Bayazid. “It’s very hard if you’re an Arab to fight against oppression, your life is always in danger. He was stabbed and I nearly had a stroke just because we wanted to do a film on human rights.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/oct/11/making-the-numbers-add-up-in-the-catalonia-poll","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-11T17:19:00Z","webTitle":"Making the numbers add up in the Catalonia poll | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/11/making-the-numbers-add-up-in-the-catalonia-poll","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/oct/11/making-the-numbers-add-up-in-the-catalonia-poll","fields":{"headline":"Making the numbers add up in the Catalonia poll","bodyText":"You uncritically adopt the claim that a “silent majority” of Catalans oppose independence (Puigdemont speech gives no clarity on Catalan independence, 11 October). The figures do not support this. In most opinion polls held prior to recent events, both proponents and opponents of independence formed a minority, with the difference being made up by those who did not know. During the last regional elections, only 39% voted for explicitly unionist parties, 47% voted for pro-independence parties, while 13% voted for parties who were equivocal on independence. It is correct that the official turnout in the referendum of 1 October was below 50%, but that fails to take into account the closure of polling stations and confiscation of votes by the police. In fact, the number of votes in favour that were counted would have been enough to secure a majority at the record-high turnout level of the last regional election. On 8 October, hundreds of thousands of people protested in Barcelona against independence. A show of strength, yes, but no majority, and somewhat undercut by the fact that some of the attendants had come from outside Catalonia. The reality is that we can’t know what Catalans want until a legally binding referendum is held. As the Scottish independence and Brexit referendums have shown, opinion polls can be wrong and people will change sides – in both directions – due to the dynamics of a real election campaign. The strategy of the Spanish government seems to be above all to obstruct such a real test of opinions, and my worry is that your newspaper is falling for this. Oliver Urs Lenz Ghent, Belgium • Let’s stop reducing complex problems like the constitutional status of Catalonia, or our own relationship with the EU, to a blunt choice of just two supposedly mutually exclusive opposites. We could start by reading the works of Ramón Llull, the Majorcan who, 700 years ago, suggested a better voting procedure would be multi-optional and preferential. Let us further remember that the EU has made some terrible mistakes, as for example when the Badinter commission insisted on a plebiscite in Bosnia, or when in Kiev it promoted majority rule up until the very day Viktor Yanukovych fled into exile. In fact, of course, “all the wars in the former Yugoslavia started with a referendum” (Oslobodjenje, 7 February 1999), and the same is now true of the conflict in Ukraine. Peter Emerson Director, the de Borda Institute • Giles Tremlett reveals that in the Catalonia v Spain impasse: “At stake are five centuries of coexistence with the rest of Spain.” Indeed: not dissimilar to the centuries of coexistence between Ireland and England that inspired the Easter Rising of 1916. Dominic Keown Cambridge • Simon Doubleday rightly criticises the Francoist ideal of unity (Opinion, 10 October). This holds that no region of Spain should have the right to separate under any circumstances. But he goes on to propose a two-thirds “super-majority” for Catalan independence in any future constitutional referendum, which effectively rules out independence. Imagine requiring this absurd margin for Scottish independence. A simple majority of votes cast was an appropriate criterion for the Scottish referendum. As it was, despite my pro-remain view, for Brexit too, because Brits do not have the same redistributive obligations to poorer European countries as to poorer parts of Britain. Catalonia is morally different because it is the richest part of Spain after Madrid and the Basque country. So the bar might be raised to, say, 55% to deter other rich European regions such as northern Italy from separating. Joseph Palley Richmond upon Thames, Surrey • The essence of the Catalans’ claim is the so-called “right to self-determination”, which is “the right of peoples to determine their own political status and to be free of alien domination, including formation of their own independent state”. Ironically, on 24 March 1999, a Spanish aircraft from the Nato alliance was among the first Nato planes to bomb Belgrade for denying the right to self-determination to the Albanian Kosovans. The action was also supported by the Catalans. But it came to haunt them both: the Spanish government for enthusiastically supporting the Kosovans’ claim, and the Catalans for naively believing that they would be rewarded for their staunch support. The only constant and unfortunate feature that emerges from those episodes is that the application of the “right” is dependent, not even on politics but on ideology; that the “right” can only be exercised by units that live in the countries that are deemed “undemocratic” or enemies of the west. This is also an inevitable conclusion from the UK foreign secretary’s statement that the Catalan referendum was “illegal” because Spain is a close ally and a good friend. This echoed Margaritis Schinas of the European commission, who, asked to explain the difference between the Kosovo and Catalonia episodes, said: “Comparisons between Spain and Serbia could not be drawn because Spain is a member state.” Dear Catalans: you will have to give up on your claim because you live in a democracy! In fact, if I am allowed to predict, it seems that the Catalans will settle with a financial deal in this episode in the same way as the Basque people managed in 2011. Dr Miroslav Baros Sheffield Hallam University • The Guardian appears to have moved to using a barely qualified description of the illegal Catalan referendum as one “in which 90% of participants voted in favour of splitting”, without the reminder that over half of possible voters boycotted the vote (Catalan government suspends declaration of independence, 11 October). If a short form is needed then “in which 55% of Catalans showed that they did not want a referendum, never mind independence” would be more accurate, providing a much better reflection of the state of opinion in Catalonia. It is time the Guardian reconsidered its automatic support for any group that disturbs the peace on supposed national or ethnic grounds. John Hall Bristol • “I am still going to declare independence from Spain, but I am giving them some time, a window.” With these words, Catalan president Carles Puigdemont betrayed the hopes of his brave people’s dream of independence from Spain – because the people of Catalonia did not brave the clubs and gas of the Spanish police in order to vote for a “window”. Puigdemont’s cowardice has not appeased the Spanish prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, who has refused to acknowledge the prospect of an independent Catalonia and has shown the brutal methods he is prepared to use to preserve the Spanish state. Puigdemont simply does not have the luxury of “some time”. He must declare full independence while he can. He should recall the warning of Louis Antoine de Saint-Just: “Those who make revolutions halfway only dig their own graves.” Sasha Simic London • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"travel/2017/oct/14/villaroger-les-arcs-redevelop-green-ski-resort-france-french-alps","type":"article","sectionId":"travel","sectionName":"Travel","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-14T09:00:03Z","webTitle":"Villaroger, Les Arcs’ poor relation, set to reinvent itself as ‘green resort’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2017/oct/14/villaroger-les-arcs-redevelop-green-ski-resort-france-french-alps","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/travel/2017/oct/14/villaroger-les-arcs-redevelop-green-ski-resort-france-french-alps","fields":{"headline":"Villaroger, Les Arcs’ poor relation, set to reinvent itself as ‘green resort’","bodyText":"Most skiers have heard of Les Arcs, but few know about Villaroger, a rustic village at the far north-eastern tip of the ski area with a handful of chalets, one bar, two restaurants and a couple of old chair lifts. It is known by locals as “the dark side”, not just because of its north-facing slopes, but because Villaroger is about as far removed from the apartment blocks of Arc 2000 and Arc 1600 as it’s possible to get. This winter, however, things are looking brighter. Forty new snow cannons have been installed on the slopes above Villaroger to make sure there is enough of the white stuff to keep the village accessible throughout the ski season, and link it to the vast ski terrain of Les Arcs and La Plagne. Next year another 26 cannons will go in, at a total cost of €1.8m, and within three years a faster, more efficient system of ski lifts will open. Accessibility has been a problem in the past. The village sits at an altitude of just 1,200 metres, and the rickety old chair lifts take a long time to ascend the steep slopes. There are just two pistes in and out, a blue and a red (or some fine off-piste above the hamlet of Le Planay), and the red is often left ungroomed so that it develops moguls the size of igloos. In poor years, Villaroger can be snow-free at the beginning and end of the season, so skiers wishing to access Les Arcs’ slopes from there have to make the 20-minute drive to Bourg-Saint-Maurice, and then take a seven-minute funicular ride up to Arc 1600 (and do the same again in reverse at the end of the day). The new snow cannons should provide season-round ski access to the village as well as linking to some 200km of pistes in Les Arcs (and a further 225km in La Plagne. It is all part of a long-term plan to make Villaroger into what mayor Alain Emprin calls “a green ski village”. This will involve the building of high-quality chalets either side of the village, providing a total of 750 beds, along with shops, a ski school and more bars and restaurants. Emprin said: “We are installing green energy systems, and relocating all power and telecoms cables underground. The village will become car-free and we will expand facilities for non-skiers such as the snowshoe trails currently surrounding the village.” The addition of 750 new beds to a settlement with a permanent population of perhaps half that will inevitably bring massive changes, but Emprin said: “We want to retain the village character as much as possible, so there will be no large hotels or loud nightclubs. Our aim is to grow while retaining our character and offering a better ski experience.” For now, Villaroger appeals to people who want to concentrate on skiing without all the “loud” distractions. The terrain is suited to skiers of intermediate level and above, and includes access to one of the world’s longest pistes, the black/red Aiguille Rouge, descending 1,200 metres from 3,226-metre Aiguille Rouge. Nightlife consists of La Ferme, a low-key bar-restaurant that’s often closed by 9.30pm, and the bijou La Goyet restaurant. Those wanting to burn the midnight oil are out of luck unless they bring their own party. Guaranteed snow, even the manmade kind, is sure to provide a better ski experience, and if all the other planned developments are done without spoiling the Alpine feel of the village, Villaroger will no longer be seen as Les Arcs’ poor relation. • Eurostar services from London St Pancras to Bourg-Saint-Maurice via Paris cost from £196 return (8hr 20min); it’s then a 15-minute shuttle bus ride to Villaroger.

There is no time to wait or waste,” said Mu Sochua from Berlin. After the Cambodian opposition leader, Kem Sokha, was arrested last month, Mu Sochua, his deputy in the Cambodia National Rescue party (CNRP), fled to Germany. “Whatever Mr Hun Sen wants, he gets. People are so fearful,” she told the Guardian. In the run-up to July 2018 polls, the government has shuttered radio stations and newspapers, kicked out civil society groups and last week it attempted to dissolve the CNRP, the main opposition party. Warning of “the death of democracy” under Hun Sen, Mu Sochua said a government-controlled supreme court was likely to rule in his favour against the CNRP. “That will totally destroy and set back democracy, way back,” she said of the lawsuit against her party, which Human Rights Watch has described as a “naked grab for total power”. “All the elements for building democracy in Cambodia have not just been weakened, but totally put into silence,” she added. After the south-east Asian nation emerged from years of war, it has worked ostensibly as a democracy since 1993. While government harassment has been widespread, a reasonably free and critical press has survived, as well as functioning elections every five years. The current crackdown appears motivated by the opposition’s significant and unexpected electoral gains during 2013 national elections, which it very nearly won. Taken aback by the sudden surge, Cambodia began a policy of imprisoning opposition leaders, including Sam Rainsy, the founding president of the CNRP, who is now in exile. But it was the June 2017 commune elections – which saw the CNRP take close to 44% of all seats – that proved the resilience of the opposition’s popularity and led to the recent ramped-up purge. The opposition had presented a bona fide threat to Hun Sen’s three decades in power. The government has since forced the closure of a famed long-running paper, the Cambodia Daily, as well as radio stations that re-broadcast Radio Free Asia and Voice of America’s Khmer language service. “The ruling party, to make sure they don’t lose the next election, eliminated the independent voices, which is the radio. Because radio really reaches out to the most remote areas,” said Mu Sochua, who is globally renowned for her decades of women’s rights work and even served as a minister in Hun Sen’s coalition government for six years before resigning in 2004. “It’s been a very, very fast process. A rollercoaster for democracy, going towards the dissolution of the only and the main opposition party in Cambodia.” Last month, CNRP leader Kem Sokha, a veteran rights campaigner, was arrested by more than 100 police officers and charged with treason. That left the party in the hands of Mu Sochua and two other vice-presidents, one of whom is also outside the country. Only Kem Sokha’s lawyers can visit him, and when they do guards place a microphone and camera inside the cell, Mu Sochua said. Many of CNRP’s members of parliament, as well as senior party staff, have since fled the country of 16 million people. Hun Sen has threatened that more opposition leaders are in danger. “This isn’t over yet with one arrest: I would like to send out a message,” he said this month. Twenty-six opposition MPs, close to half of their parliamentary presence, are already out of the country, Mu Sochua said. Two legislators and a senator are in jail, while seven MPs have court charges against them, she added. Mu Sochua was warned by two sources, one in the ministry of defence and one in the ministry of interior, that she would be next, she told the Guardian. “I’ve always wanted to stay inside, despite the pressure. But this time, I really do not feel safe,” she said by phone. Her mission now, she said, is to persuade foreign powers – including Australia, Britain, France and the United States – to implement targeted sanctions and visa restrictions on Hun Sen’s associates, many of whom are hugely wealthy and travel abroad regularly. Statements of condemnation are not enough, she said. “He couldn’t care less. One more statement and he would just throw it in the bin. “That’s what the international community has to realise. To wake up, now. It’s not too late for Mr Hun Sen to reconsider. If the international community were to step up their action now, even take one action. It has not happened,” she said. “Look at the speed at which Mr Hun Sen is pushing. Mr Sokha was arrested on the third of September. I fled just a week ago on the sixth of October … It’s all very much calculated.” The Guardian contacted the foreign ministries of Australia, Britain, France and the US for a response on Mu Sochua’s request. All expressed concern at the deteriorating political situation but did not make reference to sanctions. US senators John McCain and Dick Durbin introduced a resolution last week that called on the US state and Treasury departments to consider putting top Cambodian officials on a list that could stop them entering the United States. Cambodia has said there is no reason for sanctions and it is committed to the rule of law. Observers say Hun Sen is able to rely on his main global ally, China, to support him financially and politically. When asked about Kem Sokha’s arrest, China said it “supports the Cambodian government’s efforts to protect national security and stability”. Meanwhile, Hun Sen is also emboldened by a United States under President Donald Trump that has lessened its criticism of autocratic rulers worldwide. “China has moved very fast,” said Mu Sochua. “To leave the democratic world, to choose China, it terrifies the people of Cambodia.” She said the opposition had no plans to run in the next election unless there is change. It would be “political suicide for the opposition because we won’t win because it will be totally rigged … If we play the game of Mr Hun Sen, we may as well kill ourselves politically.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/oct/11/dual-citizenship-mps-negligence-must-not-be-rewarded-greens-lawyer-says","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-11T02:59:02Z","webTitle":"Allowing MPs to plead ignorance on citizenship will cause 'radical instability'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/oct/11/dual-citizenship-mps-negligence-must-not-be-rewarded-greens-lawyer-says","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/oct/11/dual-citizenship-mps-negligence-must-not-be-rewarded-greens-lawyer-says","fields":{"headline":"Allowing MPs to plead ignorance on citizenship will cause 'radical instability'","bodyText":"Accepting that politicians who are ignorant of their foreign citizenship can sit in parliament will lead to “radical instability” and a repeat of the eligibility chaos of 2017, the court of disputed returns has heard. The former solicitor general, Justin Gleeson, told the court on Wednesday it should reject the commonwealth’s case that parliamentarians with no knowledge of their dual citizenship are eligible because they did not “voluntarily obtain or retain” allegiance to a foreign power. Gleeson, on behalf of the former independent MP Tony Windsor who is challenging Barnaby Joyce’s eligibility, argued allegiance derives from one’s status as a foreign citizen regardless of whether one is aware of it. A parliamentarian’s dual citizenship creates an “irremediable conflict irrespective of their knowledge of it”, he said. The former solicitor general gave the example of a dual Greek-Australian citizen conscripted into military service in Greece despite ignorance of their foreign citizenship. Gleeson also noted New Zealand criminal law has extra-territorial effect on its citizens, which would have rendered Joyce susceptible to the criminal law of New Zealand before he renounced his dual citizenship on 12 August. The friend of the court, Geoffrey Kennett, agreed that there may be “duties under foreign law that could conceivably be enforced upon a person” regardless of their knowledge. Section 44 of the commonwealth constitution states that people are incapable of being chosen as a senator or MP if they are the subject or citizen of a foreign power. On Tuesday, Joyce and Fiona Nash’s counsel, Brett Walker, submitted the section does not disqualify people who did not have knowledge of their foreign citizenship and, if they discovered it, they should have a reasonable time to renounce it. Gleeson argued that such a “grace period” would allow an unknown number of people to remain in parliament with an allegiance to a foreign power for a time during which the interests of the two nations may come into conflict, such as during trade negotiations or war. If parliamentarians with no knowledge of their foreign citizenship need not renounce it, Gleeson suggested that electors, political opponents and the media would search out dual citizens in the parliament to try to force them to acknowledge and renounce it. The government’s preferred construction would lead to “a sequence like this year” with uncertainty hanging over parliamentarians’ status, Gleeson warned, and “radical instability” over the length of the grace period to be given. Earlier on Wednesday Matt Canavan’s lawyer suggested it was a strict interpretation of the disqualification of parliamentarians with dual citizenship that would lead to “genealogical witch-hunts” by political opponents. David Bennett argued that citizenship by descent passing down through multiple generations was an “exorbitant law” that would disqualify politicians with a “slender connection” to a foreign power. Bennett said that if the court recognised “indefinite” citizenship by descent as a disqualification it would give rise to “offensive inquiries” about whether a person were one quarter, one eighth or one sixteenth foreign, which was “inappropriate” in an immigrant nation. Gleeson submitted that the “ordinary” way to fix having dual citizenship is to renounce it before nominating for parliament. He said the exceptions to the general rule that dual citizens are ineligible are limited to exorbitant foreign laws or those that threaten Australia’s representative democracy, such as if a foreign power practically refused to allow Australians to renounce their dual citizenship. Earlier, the lawyer for Greens Larissa Waters and Scott Ludlam argued the court should not reward “negligence” by letting off parliamentarians who did not take “reasonable steps” to investigate their dual citizenship, Brian Walters argued that the country of one’s birth and one’s parents’ citizenship constituted “primary facts” that should prompt inquiries about one’s citizenship. Once aspiring parliamentarians had such facts and wanted to nominate for election they have “a duty not only to be honest but to be careful”, he said. “Negligence in complying with one’s constitutional obligations should never produce a better result than diligence,” he said, proposing a test of whether parliamentarians had taken “reasonable steps” to ascertain their foreign citizenship. But the Greens’ proposed test was immediately doubted by the chief justice, Susan Kiefel. Kiefel questioned how the case could “work backwards” from the conclusion in Sykes v Cleary that parliamentarians had to take reasonable steps to renounce foreign citizenship to extend it to a new requirement that they had to take reasonable steps to discover their dual citizenship. “I don’t know how you get there,” she said. Walters argued that section 44 was designed not only to prevent parliamentarians holding “split allegiances” to foreign powers but also to “remove perceptions of divided loyalty” and enhance Australians’ confidence in its parliament. He said the section should be understood as an “assertion of Australian sovereignty … that government of Australians will be only by Australians”. Repeated questioning from the bench suggested that such a reading was consistent with a disqualification of all foreign citizens but did not support the “reasonable steps” test. Walters conceded that his own clients did not take “reasonable steps” to investigate their citizenship because Ludlam, who was naturalised as an Australian at age 19, knew he was New Zealander before that, and Waters, who was born in Canada but left at 11 months of age, did not investigate whether she was Canadian. Nick Xenophon’s counsel, Andrew Tokley, argued that his British overseas citizenship did not include the “core” features of citizenship, the ability to enter and reside in Britain, and thus should not be a bar to eligibility. The hearing continues on Thursday with submissions on behalf of One Nation senator Malcolm Roberts and submissions in reply."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2017/oct/12/ange-postecoglous-influence-will-last-despite-unsure-end-to-tenure","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-12T02:00:17Z","webTitle":"Ange Postecoglou's influence will last despite unsure end to tenure | Ante Jukic","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/oct/12/ange-postecoglous-influence-will-last-despite-unsure-end-to-tenure","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/oct/12/ange-postecoglous-influence-will-last-despite-unsure-end-to-tenure","fields":{"headline":"Ange Postecoglou's influence will last despite unsure end to tenure","bodyText":"For better or worse, what an individual does at international level generally leaves the most lasting legacy in football. How followers of the game view Lionel Messi, or Zico for historical relativity, in comparison to Maradona is only one example. Although his success with South Melbourne and Brisbane Roar will be respected, Ange Postecoglou’s tenure with the Socceroos will ultimately overshadow it. Amid a turbulent period for Australian football in both technical and administrative senses, Postecoglou’s ideology at the game’s pinnacle will have the greatest impact. His successors, ultimately, will have to live up to it. If one thing can be said with certainty about Postecoglou, it’s that he knows how to back himself. Publicly criticised, his management style is characterised by an attacking, stylistic freedom unencumbered by inhibition or reserve. It showed in the Socceroos’ 2-1 extra-time win over Syria on Tuesday night, in both his starting lineup and in-game adjustments. Coming back to Sydney with a vital away goal, Postecoglou’s predecessors would have directed their team to score. However, most of those predecessors would not have risked defensive stability and conceding an away goal in the search for goals at the other end. Not so Postecoglou. With the Australian game’s immediate future at stake, he benched Aaron Mooy. Social media went into meltdown. Then, closer to kick-off, his omission took on a secondary importance, when details emerged of Postecoglou’s midfield lineup. Since the switch to a 3-2-4-1 formation against Iraq, Australia’s midfield has been conservatively shaped, with two advanced players creating the passing outlet for two behind them. On Tuesday, with Mark Milligan as the sole screener and distributor from the deeper position, the midfield morphed into something much more adventurous. With the sole purpose of even further enhancing attacking fluidity, James Troisi, Robbie Kruse and Tom Rogić would roam and interchange positions in front of Milligan. Space between Syrian lines was found throughout the match, but the ramifications of Postecoglou’s 1-3 midfield materialised first. In a similar fashion to Yōsuke Ideguchi’s goal which sealed a 2-0 victory for Japan in August, an individual error passing out of defence exposed space in transition. And, as Milligan compounded pressure on Jackson Irvine before Ideguchi’s strike, Miloš Degenek’s initial pass created a breakdown in possession. With Milligan dispossessed this time, Australia were wide open and Omar Al Soma did well to capitalise in only the sixth minute. Brad Smith’s injury in the next few minutes paved the way for Mooy to come on, but instead of retreating to reform the box midfield, he took up Kruse’s position in the advanced three. Kruse, meanwhile, shifted to the left flank. When not in possession, both Mooy and Troisi tend to retreat towards the ball, but this redefined role tempered that and allowed Milligan to penetrate. It showed with Tim Cahill’s equaliser, where Milligan, Mooy, Rogić and Matthew Leckie all combined in the lead-up. By the end of the game, Milligan had completed a gargantuan 136 passes at a 90.4% success rate. Of those 136 passes, 48.5% were to Mooy, Troisi and Rogić alone. More importantly, those passes advanced Australia’s position and forced the opposition defence to scramble. Along with Leckie and Kruse’s assertive movement, it all meant the Socceroos’ forward play was the most fluid it had ever been under Postecoglou. That capacity to stretch the defence in open play meant greater variety, even with Cahill’s presence up front influencing crosses into the penalty area. Compared to last month’s 2-1 win over Thailand, Australia had 11 less crosses (41) with more possession (76.3%) against Syria, but improved by 8.6% on successful delivery (31.7%). However, the end result to the flowing buildup play was mostly lacking, contributing to the lower total of 25 shots. It highlights the fundamental dilemma of this qualifying campaign: in the end, how much can fluidity, movement and attacking balance offset an overall lack of individual quality? This is where Postecoglou’s attacking ideology extends to the empowerment of his players. From playing Milligan as part of the three-man defence, to again deploying Mooy as an attacking midfielder after a disappointing performance against Germany in June, the Socceroos coach reflects a focus on what his players can do on a football pitch – not what they can’t. In the 109th minute, Kruse’s movement provided a passing outlet for Mooy in a congested area. Finally, with a centimetre-perfect cross to attack, Cahill provided the all-important winner. This focus became most apparent with Cahill. In the second half, the Socceroos’ all-time leading goal scorer grew increasingly peripheral as the lines stretched. In Australia’s phases of possession, he was almost non-existent. Over the second 45 minutes, Cahill attempted a mere six passes. He completed five. All of them were directed towards the defence, while four of those completed passes were not forward of halfway. Yet when substitution seemed the logical option, Postecoglou opted to bring Rogić off and showed unwavering faith to leave Cahill on, sensing he would capitalise if the service was up to scratch. The Socceroos’ victory might not have sealed progression to the World Cup, but it encapsulated Postecoglou’s attacking state of mind. However his tenure finishes, it has promoted a more developed sense of thinking when it comes to Australian football. For that aspect alone, his influence will be felt in both the short and long term."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"technology/2017/oct/11/personal-details-of-almost-700000-britons-hacked-in-cyber-attack","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-11T00:13:42Z","webTitle":"Personal details of almost 700,000 Britons hacked in cyber-attack","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/oct/11/personal-details-of-almost-700000-britons-hacked-in-cyber-attack","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2017/oct/11/personal-details-of-almost-700000-britons-hacked-in-cyber-attack","fields":{"headline":"Personal details of almost 700,000 Britons hacked in cyber-attack","bodyText":"Equifax has admitted that almost 700,000 UK consumers have had their personal details accessed following a cyber-attack, a figure far higher than previously thought. As well as affecting more Britons, the hack also resulted in significantly more damaging data being leaked on those who were affected. The information lost by the US credit monitoring firm included partial credit card details, phone numbers and driving licence numbers. The Information Commissioner’s Office said that it was still investigating the company, which had initially claimed just 400,000 British residents had been affected. “We continue to investigate what happened at Equifax and how UK citizen’s information came to be compromised,” an ICO spokesperson confirmed. “It is a complex and fast-moving case and we are working closely with other UK regulators and our counterparts in Canada and the US. “We have been pressing Equifax to confirm the scale and any impact on UK citizens and, from the outset, we advised the firm to alert and support victims.” Equifax – based in Atlanta, Georgia – discovered the hack in July but only informed consumers last month, leading the information commissioner to order the company to inform British residents “at the earliest opportunity” if their personal information had been put at risk. The move came after Equifax said a hack had exposed the social security numbers and other data of about 143 million Americans. Lenders rely on the information collected by credit bureaux such as Equifax to help them decide whether to approve financing for homes, cars and credit cards. Equifax said a file containing 15.2m UK records, dated between 2011 and 2016, was hacked and included data from “actual” consumers, as well as test and duplicate data. The company said its investigation found that it would need to contact 693,665 British consumers by post to tell them how to protect against any potential risk. Almost 13,000 consumers had an email address associated with their Equifax.co.uk account accessed in 2014, while just under 15,000 consumers had portions of their Equifax membership details – such as username, password, secret questions and answers and partial credit card details – accessed. It said nearly 30,000 had their driving licence number accessed, while the phone numbers of a further 637,430 consumers were accessed. Patricio Remon, Equifax’s Europe chief, again apologised to anyone affected by the hacking. “It has been regrettable that we have not been able to contact consumers who may have been impacted until now, but it would not have been appropriate for us to do so until the full facts of this complex attack were known, and the full forensics investigation was completed,” he said. Anyone who is sent a letter by Equifax should take advantage of the help offered to guard against potential risks. Cyber-attacks have become an increasing problem for big firms that hold large amounts of customer data. HSBC and TalkTalk are among the most high-profile British firms to be hit in recent years."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/oct/10/malcolm-turnbull-nobel-peace-prize-winner-beatrice-fihn-ican","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-10T22:42:31Z","webTitle":"Malcolm Turnbull chided for 'silly' snub to Nobel peace prize-winning group","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/10/malcolm-turnbull-nobel-peace-prize-winner-beatrice-fihn-ican","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/oct/10/malcolm-turnbull-nobel-peace-prize-winner-beatrice-fihn-ican","fields":{"headline":"Malcolm Turnbull chided for 'silly' snub to Nobel peace prize-winning group","bodyText":"When the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons was awarded the Nobel peace prize last week, the advocacy group received messages of congratulations from around the world. But in the chorus of praise for the organisation – which was launched in Melbourne in 2007 – one voice was conspicuously absent: that of Australia’s prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull. It was a snub that the group’s director, Beatrice Fihn, has described as both “disappointing” and “silly”. “Australia claims to be committed to a world without nuclear weapons and here’s an Australian-born campaign that has won the Nobel peace prize for the fight against nuclear weapons; it seems a bit silly that they can’t even congratulate us,” Fihn told the Guardian during a visit to New York on Tuesday. The prize followed a major victory for the campaign in July, when 122 countries signed a UN treaty on the prohibition of nuclear weapons, the first legally binding international agreement to prohibit nuclear weapons. Australia – along with dozens of others, including the eight countries with nuclear arms – boycotted the negotiations, and did not sign the treaty. Nonetheless, Fihn argued: “They [the Australian government] should at least welcome people mobilizing against nuclear weapons, because what are the other options? That we mobilise people in favour?” The decision to award the prize to Ican this year was interpreted by many as a rebuke to Donald Trump’s bellicose rhetoric over North Korea’s nuclear weapons programme. But Fihn argued the prize was “really a rebuttal to everyone who participates in defending nuclear weapons”. “[Trump] makes people uncomfortable with the idea of nuclear weapons. But at the same time, if you’re uncomfortable with Trump having the sole authority to launch US nuclear arsenals, then you’re really uncomfortable with nuclear weapons in general. “It means that you recognise that the deterrence isn’t foolproof, that there are moments where people will make irrational decisions.” Two days before the prize was announced, Fihn labelled Trump a “moron” on Twitter, following reports that the US secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, had used the same language in private earlier in the summer. She conceded that the prize had brought with it “a whole new responsibility”, adding: “I have to stop tweeting so much.” “It [the tweet] is still up. I can’t delete it now. And obviously it was a joke.” Fihn also welcomed what she described as the “tension and friction” in the UK over nuclear disarmament, arguing such debate was “where you make progress”. The Labour party leader, Jeremy Corbyn, who in contrast to Turnbull issued a statement congratulating Ican on the prize, has long supported disarmament, despite his party’s continuing support for the Trident nuclear deterrent system. While Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland’s first minister, sent a ringing endorsement of the treaty on the prohibition of nuclear weapons in July, despite the UK boycott. If Corbyn were elected prime minister, Fihn said, the coalition would urge him to reconsider Britain’s position. But, she said, “you can’t just sit around and wait for them [politicians] to do it, that’s not how it works any more. You have to push the conversation.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2017/oct/11/police-killings-counted-harvard-study","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-11T11:00:10Z","webTitle":"US police killings undercounted by half, study using Guardian data finds","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/oct/11/police-killings-counted-harvard-study","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/oct/11/police-killings-counted-harvard-study","fields":{"headline":"US police killings undercounted by half, study using Guardian data finds","bodyText":"Over half of all police killings in 2015 were wrongly classified as not having been the result of interactions with officers, a new Harvard study based on Guardian data has found. The finding is just the latest to show government databases seriously undercounting the number of people killed by police. “Right now the data quality is bad and unacceptable,” said lead researcher Justin Feldman. “To effectively address the problem of law enforcement-related deaths, the public needs better data about who is being killed, where, and under what circumstances.” Feldman used data from the Guardian’s 2015 investigation into police killings, The Counted, and compared it with data from the National Vital Statistics System (NVSS). That dataset, which is kept by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), was found to have misclassified 55.2% of all police killings, with the errors occurring disproportionately in low-income jurisdictions. “As with any public health outcome or exposure, the only way to understand the magnitude of the problem, and whether it is getting better or worse, requires that data be uniformly, validly, and reliably obtained throughout the US,” said Nancy Krieger, professor of social epidemiology at Harvard’s Chan School of Public Health and senior author of the study. “Our results show our country is falling short of accurately monitoring deaths due to law enforcement and work is needed to remedy this problem.” NVSS data has been collected since the late 1800s and today is responsible for, among other things, aggregating all annual US deaths. In 1949, the report added a category to capture “legal intervention” as a cause of death along with classifications like cancer, heart disease and accidents. Typically these determinations are made by local medical examiners and coroners, reported on death certificates, and submitted to the CDC. To assess how accurately that classification was being used, the team took the 1,146 police-related deaths recorded by The Counted in 2015, removed 60 cases that did not fit the criteria of the CDC’s “legal intervention” category and requested death certificate data for the remaining 1,086 individuals. They found that a majority, 599 deaths, were classified as resulting from something other than legal intervention – principally “assault”. Researchers found the accuracy varied wildly by state, with just 17.6% misclassification in Washington, but a startling 100% in Oklahoma. “[Oklahoma] had more than 30 people were killed by police there in 2015 and none of them were counted on death certificates,” Feldman said. According to the report, there were 36 cases of “legal intervention” captured in the NVSS which were not included in The Counted. “We hope that this paper is a call to action to improve public health reporting, whether that’s following a method like the Guardian did by integrating media sources better, or by changing the policy around requiring clinicians [medical examiners and coroners] to report these deaths,” Feldman said. Feldman also noted that this problem was law-enforcement specific. “Evidence suggests that the accuracy of mortality classification for homicide – an outcome similar to law-enforcement-related mortality … is very high”, the report reads. One 2014 study cited puts the figure at 99%. In 2015 the Guardian launched The Counted, an interactive, crowdsourced database attempting to track police killings throughout the US. The project was intended to help remedy the lack of reliable data on police killings, a lack that became especially visible after the 2014 unrest in Ferguson put policing in the national spotlight. Other federal databases, including the Bureau of Justice Statistics’ (BJS) arrest-related death count and the FBI’s supplementary homicide reports were similarly criticised for severely undercounting police-related deaths. Both programs have been dramatically reworked since The Counted and similar media/open source databases forced officials such as the former FBI director James Comey to admit that newspapers had more accurate data than the government on police violence."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2017/oct/11/imf-higher-taxes-rich-inequality-jeremy-corbyn-labour-donald-trump","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-11T13:30:13Z","webTitle":"IMF: higher taxes for rich will cut inequality without hitting growth","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/oct/11/imf-higher-taxes-rich-inequality-jeremy-corbyn-labour-donald-trump","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2017/oct/11/imf-higher-taxes-rich-inequality-jeremy-corbyn-labour-donald-trump","fields":{"headline":"IMF: higher taxes for rich will cut inequality without hitting growth","bodyText":"Higher income tax rates for the rich would help reduce inequality without having an adverse impact on growth, the International Monetary Fund has said. The Washington-based IMF used its influential half-yearly fiscal monitor to demolish the argument that economic growth would suffer if governments in advanced Western countries forced the top 1% of earners to pay more tax. The IMF said tax theory suggested there should be “significantly higher” tax rates for those on higher incomes but the argument against doing so was that hitting the rich would be bad for growth. But the influential global institution said: “Empirical results do not support this argument, at least for levels of progressivity that are not excessive.” The IMF added that different types of wealth taxes might also be considered. Labour seized on the report, calling for higher taxes on the rich, citing the IMF’s intervention as evidence of the need for a fairer tax system. In its election manifesto, Labour proposed a new 45% tax band on those earning more than £80,000 and a 50% rate for those on more than £123,000. John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, said: “The IMF support the argument we made in the General Election for a fairer tax system. There is no evidence to support those who scaremonger about the effects of making the rich pay fairer tax.” He added: “ Not only have the Tories slashed the top rate of tax, they still plan billions in tax giveaways to the super rich and big corporations over this parliament.” Despite claims from ministers that Labour’s tax plans would be both politically and economically damaging, McDonnell believes higher taxes for the rich would be both workable and popular. “With every day that passes the case for a change of direction at the Treasury grows. Instead of engaging in infighting in his own party the chancellor should listen to Labour’s calls for fairer taxes and increased investment, so we will build an economy for the many not the few.” Theresa May has repeatedly attacked Labour’s approach as extreme, claiming in prime minister’s questions on Wednesday that Corbyn and McDonnell are on “planet Venezuela”. But the prime minister conceded at a fringe meeting at her party’s conference in Manchester that public opinion appears to be more favourable to some of Labour’s economic ideas than Conservative strategists had assumed in the run-up to June’s general election. “We thought there was a political consensus,” she said. “Jeremy Corbyn changed that”. With Philip Hammond due to deliver his budget next month, it is unclear whether the government will press ahead with promised tax cuts for higher earners, including plans to increase the higher rate threshold for income tax to £50,000. The fiscal monitor does not mention any country by name and does not specify at what level governments should set the new higher rate for top earners. But the report stressed that cutting tax for the top 1% had gone too far - a strong hint that the IMF has doubts about the pro-rich tax plan proposed by Donald Trump for the US. Instead, the IMF said higher tax for the rich was necessary to arrest rising income inequality – the argument used by McDonnell and the Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. The fiscal monitor said most advanced economies in the West had experienced a sizeable increase in income inequality in the past three decades, driven primarily by the growing income of the top 1%. Traditionally, governments have sought to make their societies less unequal by levying higher income tax rates on the rich and using the proceeds to help those less well off either directly or through public services. But it found that income tax systems had become markedly less progressive in the 1980s and 1990s and had remained stable since then, even though growing inequality raised the need for a more progressive approach. In an IMF blog, the head of the IMF’s fiscal affairs unit, Vitor Gaspar, said the average top income tax rate for the rich country members of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development had fallen from 62% in 1981 to 35% in 2015. “In addition, tax systems are less progressive than indicated by the statutory rates, because wealthy individuals have more access to tax relief,” Gaspar said in the blog co-written with Mercedes Garcia-Escribano. “Importantly, we find that some advanced economies can increase progressivity without hampering growth, as long as progressivity is not excessive.” IMF research found that between 1985 and 1995, redistribution through the tax system had offset 60% of the increase in inequality caused by market forces. But between 1995 and 2010, income tax systems failed to respond to the continuing increase in inequality. It also said inequality should be tackled by giving a more pro-poor slant to public spending. “Despite progress, gaps in access to quality education and healthcare services between different income groups in the population remain in many countries,” Gaspar and Garcia-Escribano said, adding that in rich countries men with university education lived up to 14 years longer than those with secondary education or less. “Better public spending can help, for instance, by reallocating education or health spending from the rich to the poor while keeping total public education or health spending unchanged,” they added. In its separate global financial stability review, the IMF said it would take several years for central banks to return interest rates to more normal levels due to the risk of aborting recovery. But the report also highlighted the risk that prolonged monetary support could lead to the buildup of further financial excesses. Too much money was chasing too few assets offering a yield, the IMF said. A Treasury spokesperson said: “A fair tax system is a critical part of our plan to build a fairer society. Today, the richest 1% pay over a quarter of all income tax while 4 million of the lower earners have been taken out of income tax altogether.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2017/oct/14/russia-us-politics-social-media-facebook","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-14T13:47:11Z","webTitle":"How Russia used social media to divide Americans","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/oct/14/russia-us-politics-social-media-facebook","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/oct/14/russia-us-politics-social-media-facebook","fields":{"headline":"How Russia used social media to divide Americans","bodyText":"For the past year, the world has reeled over escalating reports of how Russia “hacked” the 2016 US presidential election, by stealing emails from Democrats, attacking voter registration lists and voting machines and running a social media shell game. Such is the focus on Russian meddling that congressional investigators are increasingly aggressive in asking the big tech companies to account for how their platforms became the staging grounds for an attack on American democracy. Early next month that scrutiny will intensify, with executives from Facebook, Google and Twitter formally invited to appear before the House intelligence committee on Capitol Hill in Washington. What has now been made clear is that Russian trolls and automated bots not only promoted explicitly pro-Donald Trump messaging, but also used social media to sow social divisions in America by stoking disagreement and division around a plethora of controversial topics such as immigration and Islamophobia. And, even more pertinently, it is clear that these interventions are continuing as Russian agents stoke division around such recent topics as white supremacist marches and NFL players taking a knee to protest police violence. The overarching goal, during the election and now, analysts say, is to expand and exploit divisions, attacking the American social fabric where it is most vulnerable, along lines of race, gender, class and creed. “The broader Russian strategy is pretty clearly about destabilizing the country by focusing on and amplifying existing divisions, rather than supporting any one political party,” said Jonathon Morgan, a former state department adviser on digital responses to terrorism whose company, New Knowledge, analyzes the manipulation of public discourse. “I think it absolutely continues.” Urgent threat, slow response In the last month – mostly through vigorous reporting and academic research – we have also learned that the impact of Russia’s Facebook infiltration was far more widespread than Mark Zuckerberg claimed when Barack Obama pulled him aside at a conference in Peru last November to inform the young titan he had a problem on his hands. As more evidence emerges revealing the extent of the Russian web invasion, it is clear that its footprint is far larger than the tech giants have ever conceded. On Facebook alone, Russia-linked imposters had hundreds of millions of interactions with potential voters who believed they were interacting with fellow Americans, according to an estimate by Jonathan Albright of Columbia University’s Tow Center for Digital Journalism, who broke the story wide open with the publication of a trove of searchable data earlier this month. Those interactions may have reinforced the voters’ political views or helped to mold them, thanks to the imposter accounts’ techniques of echoing shrill views and presenting seemingly sympathetic views with counterintuitive, politically leading twists. During the election, for example, an imposter Facebook page called “Being Patriotic” used hot-button words such as “illegal”, “country” and “American” and phrases such as “illegal alien”, ″Sharia law” and “welfare state”, according to an analysis of Albright’s data by the Associated Press. The page racked up at least 4.4m interactions, peaking between mid-2016 and early 2017. The urgency of the threat has not been matched by the response of the tech companies, critics say, as they have been slow to acknowledge the problem. A reference to Russia in an April Facebook draft report about election influence was inexplicably cut, the Wall Street Journal reported last week. Only last month did Facebook acknowledge that Russia-linked pages had bought thousands of ads on the platform. According to the Washington Post this week, Google has detected similar ad-buying activity, of unknown scope, on YouTube, Gmail and its search engine – though the company has made nothing public. The Russian imposters have also been detected on Instagram, Twitter and even Pokémon Go. Facebook did not reply to repeated requests for comment. But the gravity of the situation, whose dimensions are still unknown, was underscored on Thursday in an interview that Facebook’s chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, gave to Axios. “Things happened on our platform that shouldn’t have happened,” Sandberg said, adding that the company owed the American public “not just an apology, but determination” to address the problem. ‘Poor leadership ability’ The attackers appear to have a handy, if unwitting, ally in Trump, who is generous in spreading bile online. In certain recent cases, social media accounts linked with Russian influence operations appear to have taken cues directly and immediately from the @realdonaldtrump Twitter account, according to analysis by the Washington-based Alliance for Securing Democracy, which maintains a daily tracker of the networks in question. After Trump criticized the “poor leadership ability” of Carmen Yulín Cruz, mayor of San Juan, Puerto Rico, on 30 September, for example, Russian-linked Twitter accounts disseminated articles with “the primary theme of either discrediting” Cruz “or accusing the media of spreading ‘fake news’”, the alliance said. The week before that, the clandestine network poured accelerant on the fight picked by Trump with the mostly African American players in the NFL who kneeled during the national anthem in protest of police violence. Instead of simply echoing the president’s demand for a boycott unless the players stood, however, the Russian accounts took both sides of the issue, spreading both the hashtags #TakeaKnee and #BoycottNFL. “The ads and accounts appeared to focus on amplifying divisive social and political messages across the ideological spectrum – touching on topics from LGBT matters to race issues to immigration to gun rights,” said Alex Stamos, the chief security officer at Facebook, in the first public statement the company made on the matter. Albright’s data encompasses six Facebook pages previously linked by media investigations to Russia. The pages were not clumsily partisan, pro-Trump or anti-Hillary Clinton sites. Instead they worked by crafting identities around hot-button issues in US politics, and by wielding a crafty sympathy, in some cases, with causes seen as antithetical to Trump such as LGBTQ pride and opposing police violence. “There’s some really intricate maneuvering going on,” said Albright. “It’s definitely set up not to directly force issues but to identify people that fall into the wedge categories that can be used to influence others or to push conversations elsewhere.” The imposter pages included Secured Borders, an anti-immigrant account that grew to 133,000 followers; Texas Rebels, which parroted Lone Star state pride while criticizing Clinton; Being Patriotic, which attacked refugees while defending the Confederate battle flag; LGBT United, which subtly espoused “traditional” family values; and Blacktivists, a faux satellite of the Black Lives Matter movement. “It seems Americans should be wary of police brutality more than of Isis terrorists,” read a typical Blacktivists post, which was liked thousands of times. “Why there’s so many privileges and benefits for refugee kids, but American kids forced to grow up in poverty?” asked one September 2016 post by Secured Borders. “That’s absolutely unacceptable!!” “More than 300,000 vets died awaiting care,” read a post on Being Patriotic. “Do liberals still think it is better to accept thousands Syrian refugees than to help our veterans?” Owners of the imposter pages could post controversial – or seemingly sympathetic – messages or event announcements, and then, by inviting and observing interactions such as “likes”, comments or merely views, gather information about genuine American Facebook users, and potential voters. Those voters could then be targeted with political content that appealed to some of their most closely held sympathies. The strategy was highly effective, in terms of penetration. Albright’s research showed that the six Russia-linked Facebook pages had generated more than 18m interactions – a conservative estimate, he said – before Facebook shut them down. But those were just six accounts among “dozens and dozens and dozens of pages” that bore obvious markings shared by other accounts linked with Russia, said Albright. “Those 18m interactions are only for those six pages, just on Facebook” and not Instagram or other social media, Albright said. “So what are we talking about here, overall? We’re talking about hundreds of millions of interactions.” The accounts and others have since been removed by Facebook. But “I don’t think they’ve even begun to find” all the imposter accounts, Albright said, owing to the imposters’ verisimilitude. ‘It doesn’t fall completely on Facebook’ Morgan, the former state department adviser, called the response so far by the big tech companies to the Russian presence on their platforms a “misfire”. “What I see is Facebook and Twitter and Google trying to define this problem narrowly as about political advertising, and I think that that misses the mark,” he said. “Because the next group of people that are going to be vulnerable is American industry, especially industry that’s foundational to how our society operates. So the energy industry and the financial industry – they can be manipulated just like our electoral process. “I think a narrow focus on political advertising is ultimately going to miss the forest for the trees.” Albright agreed that “there needs to be some kind of oversight”. “It doesn’t fall completely on Facebook,” he said. “The scale at which this is happening is concerning enough that something needs to happen. We need to rethink a lot of this, because it’s definitely not working.” Everyone in the know, from the bipartisan heads of the Senate intelligence committee on down, agrees with the researchers, that more pressure needs to be applied at every level, in the tech world and in Moscow, to figure out what happened and what is still happening. Everyone, with one notable exception."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"crosswords/weekend/358","type":"crossword","sectionId":"crosswords","sectionName":"Crosswords","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-11T00:00:10Z","webTitle":"Weekend crossword No 358","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/weekend/358","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/crosswords/weekend/358","fields":{"headline":"Weekend crossword No 358","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"world/2017/oct/10/liberian-voters-peace-historic-election-under-way","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-11T08:52:31Z","webTitle":"'Everything is going to plan' - Liberians vote in first election run without UN","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/10/liberian-voters-peace-historic-election-under-way","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/oct/10/liberian-voters-peace-historic-election-under-way","fields":{"headline":"'Everything is going to plan' - Liberians vote in first election run without UN","bodyText":"Liberians have voted in large numbers in the first election run entirely by the country’s institutions and security forces since the civil war. Police officers and election officials who had been preparing for months took their places at polling stations, listening sympathetically to complaints about impatient voters pushing in the queue and missing names on the rolls. Though there were reports of ballots not arriving at stations until mid-afternoon, and of a politician being arrested after handing out money, such incidents appeared to be fairly isolated. A video of police dealing with “election violence” which circulated on Facebook turned out to be just a drill. “Everything is generally calm and going to plan. I can’t give you any numbers but I think voter turnout will be very high,” said the head of the national electoral commission, Jerome Korkoya. The two elections in which Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, Africa’s first elected female leader, was voted president were managed in large part by the UN. This time, Liberian police commissioner Gregory Coleman said: “We are in the driver’s seat and the UN’s in the back watching.“Our intervention as a police force comes as a cultural shock to people used over the years to seeing the police as a weapon of the government – and not as a tool of the state – to be used against them.” The police had a reputation for extrajudicial killings and rape during the war. They still have a reputation for corruption – perhaps unsurprising given an ordinary patrol officer’s annual salary is $1,800 (£1,360), while a senator’s is $200,000. “We’re trying to be that force that writes the history over, because there has never been a case where there’s been elections held in Liberia unilaterally handled by Liberian security where its integrity was not questioned,” Coleman said. “We’ve gone through years of war, and the police have been restructured and reformed. We are prepared to do it this time and do it right – non-partisan, neutral and accessible to all.” John Mahama, the former president of Ghana who led the regional election observation mission, said despite tension and fear among some voters who waited a long time to vote, the run-up to the election, voting and counting had gone well. “The mission believes... Liberia is on track to achieve a credible poll thus far - I’m using my Kenyan experience - thus far.” The chair of the National Elections Commission admitted however that there had been problems and said that they would try to “standardise the recruitment” of polling officers in future. “Voters were confused. Sometimes they stood in line for an hour or two and were then told they were not in the right place. There was a lot of frustration,” said the chair, Jerome Korkoya. Observers agreed. “I don’t think it was well-organised,” said Oscar Bloh of the Election Coordinating Committee, pointing out that while electoral officials worked through the night to collect and count votes, in many cases security personnel left, leaving them vulnerable. Other problems included disorganised queues and ballot papers arriving late, he said. In one incident in Bong County, young people who, upon arriving at their polling station and seeing that their names were not on the list, set up a road block that caused long delays. He said it was not clear whether these incidents would affect the outcome of the election. “We’re not sure yet of the scale of the problem,” he said. Voters had jostled and sweated in a queue on Peace Island, a collection of tin-roofed houses perched on a bit of high land in the middle of a swamp in Monrovia. Undeterred by the long wait in the sun, the women who made up most of the queue spoke of the need for better education, roads and healthcare as they waited. Liberia’s lack of infrastructure before the war, and the devastation caused by the conflict, meant that the government’s promises to rapidly turn it into a middle-income country were too good to be true. But that did not mean Liberians did not believe in them, and many feel disillusioned that the jobs, schools, electricity and roads that they thought were coming have not appeared. More than anything, however, Peace Island’s residents spoke of the need to maintain stability. Some of them fled their homes during the war and were living in camps before they came to the area in the mid-2000s. Others were demobilised soldiers who built small houses with their $540 payout, and so another name for the area is 540. “When we came here, we said we wanted peace. That’s why it’s called Peace Island,” said Agnes Morris, who was one of the first people to move in, as she watched the queue of voters shuffle forward. “Names have an effect. That’s why you don’t just call your child any name. You call them Blessing, Joy, Rejoice. You don’t call them Dog. Now, it’s peaceful here because of the name.” Peace held for the day, but analysts say that if there is violence it is likely to happen before the run-off, which is almost guaranteed to take place as there are 20 candidates in the first round. “We’ve worked hard to talk about peaceful elections before, during and after,” said Ruth Caesar, a member of the women’s peace movement and an election observer. “We women are the keepers of the peace. It’s a badge we wear. When the war started in 1989, a lot of atrocities were committed, and women didn’t like that. We felt if we didn’t come and make peace among men, they would wipe all of us out.” Under Morris’s definition, true peace has not been achieved. “Peace is not just about fighting. It’s about whether you have clean water, electricity, if your kids can go to school. Then you have peace.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2017/oct/10/theresa-may-refuses-to-say-if-she-would-vote-for-brexit-in-fresh-poll","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-10T19:45:02Z","webTitle":"Theresa May refuses to say if she would vote for Brexit in fresh poll","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/oct/10/theresa-may-refuses-to-say-if-she-would-vote-for-brexit-in-fresh-poll","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/oct/10/theresa-may-refuses-to-say-if-she-would-vote-for-brexit-in-fresh-poll","fields":{"headline":"Theresa May refuses to say if she would vote for Brexit in fresh poll","bodyText":"Theresa May has refused to say if she would vote for Brexit if another referendum were held today, saying instead she would have to “weigh up the evidence” before deciding what to do in the current situation. The prime minister, who voted to remain in the EU in last year’s poll, struggled to give clear answers on Brexit issues during an LBC radio phone-in on Tuesday, and admitted there was no plan for what would happen to EU citizens living in the UK if no deal was agreed with Brussels. May initially said she would not deal with hypothetical questions, but when repeatedly pressed by the presenter, Iain Dale, on how she would vote if there was a fresh referendum, she gave a series of long responses to avoid answering the yes/no question. “I voted remain for good reasons at the time, but circumstances move on … you’re asking me to say how would I vote in a vote now against a different background, a different international background, a different economic background.” Pressed again, she said: “I could sit here and I could say ‘Oh, I’d still vote remain or I’d vote leave’ just to give you an answer to that question. I’m being open and honest with you. “What I did last time round was I looked at everything and came to a judgment and I’d do exactly the same this time round.” Opposition parties said May’s responses showed she was not fully committed to the Brexit she was promising to deliver. Jo Swinson, deputy leader of the Liberal Democrats, said it was “staggering that even the prime minister isn’t convinced by the government’s approach to Brexit”. Former Labour Europe minister Chris Bryant said her responses showed May “clearly doesn’t believe in Brexit in her heart of hearts, [which] makes her hard Brexit policy all the more irresponsible”. Within the Tories, May is under pressure on all sides after a disastrous Conservative party conference speech and faltering talks with the EU. While the hard Brexit supporters fear she is veering towards a relationship too close to the EU, the soft Brexit wing are concerned the government is putting more effort into preparing for the possibility of no deal being reached. Donald Tusk, the president of the European council, said earlier on Tuesday that the EU and the UK may need to start planning for such a scenario if negotiations do not speed up. He ruled out any chance of “sufficient progress” on the financial settlement, citizens’ rights and the Irish border being made by the time of a council summit on 19 October, which would have allowed wider trade talks to begin, as originally planned. In a significant shift in tone, Tusk also appeared to suggest that, should the impasse continue past Christmas, both sides might need to move into an emergency footing to address the consequences of failing to reach a deal. Earlier on Tuesday, the EU’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, responded to May’s suggestion in the Commons on Monday that the “ball was in the EU’s court”, following a series of concessions offered in the prime minister’s Florence speech. “Brexit is not a game. Don’t forget it,” Barnier said, as he emerged from a lunch with the UK’s Brexit secretary, David Davis, on the second day of the fifth round of negotiations. Some Conservative Brexit supporters in the government have been pushing May to show she is serious about the prospect of walking away from the EU by committing money in the budget to preparations. But Philip Hammond, the chancellor, made clear in an article for the Times that it would be irresponsible to put billions aside for a hard Brexit when the government is still trying to achieve a deal. May was pressed on the issue of a no-deal situation in her LBC interview but struggled to answer the questions of what would happen in that scenario to EU citizens living in the UK. When an EU citizen who has lived in the UK for 31 years asked three times for reassurances that she would retain her rights if there is no deal, May said: “We’ve looked at the rights of people staying here if we get a deal, that’s what we’re working at. “What I’m going to say to Nina is, we will look at the arrangements to put in place if there is no deal. We are doing work on that at the moment. The government across the board is doing work on that.” May has made an offer to Brussels to guarantee the rights of the 3 million EU citizens living in the UK, which would be enforced by the British courts while taking EU law into account. But the talks have stumbled over the issue because the EU wants the European court of justice to safeguard the rights of its citizens. Asked why she could not just say she guaranteed they would be able to stay with the same rights if there is no deal, she said: “Well I’m going to get a bit technical here. There are certain rights that pertain to somebody that is an EU citizen here in the UK by virtue of being an EU citizen, things like the benefits that they’re able to access in relation to their home country and the UK. “Some of those issues would fall away if there was no deal because there wouldn’t be an agreement between us and the EU. So we would have to look at those issues separately in a no-deal scenario. “But my overall message is I want EU citizens to stay here in the UK and I want to be able to guarantee those rights to enable those people to stay. We’re not going to be throwing EU citizens who are currently here in the UK out of the UK in the future.” Asked about what would happen to British citizens in EU countries, she said: “We don’t know what would happen to them. EU members states would have to consider what their approach would be.” Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour leader, said the lack of a guarantee was unacceptable and that May’s “chaotic handling of Brexit means no deal is a real risk”. The LBC call-in got even worse for the prime minister when a Conservative member rang in to urge her to stop clinging on to power as her continued premiership would lead to a “guaranteed Corbyn win at the next election”. “Can’t you see the only slim chance we have got of avoiding that is fresh leadership?” he asked. “And the longer you cling to power, unfortunately, the more you increase the certainty we’ll all be under the hard-left socialism of Corbyn.” May said she wanted to lead the party into another election in 2022, saying she was “no quitter” and wanted to get on with delivering Brexit and her domestic agenda. Asked about plots against her leadership, she laughed off the attempt to oust her by former party chairman Grant Shapps. She said she had “parliamentary colleagues with a variety of views” but disagreements should be aired in private. May also refused to say she was frustrated with Boris Johnson, the foreign secretary, for undermining her leadership with his own interventions on how to carry out Brexit. But she did not deny rumours that there will be a reshuffle within weeks, which could see him moved or demoted to another role. Asked what Johnson would have to do to be sacked, she said: “Boris is foreign secretary and I appointed him. As with every other member of the cabinet, he agreed with the policy we developed and discussed in relation to Brexit that I set out in my speech in Florence.” May’s position has been looking more precarious since the party conference, with a growing number of Tory MPs mulling the idea of replacing her with a caretaker leader to carry out Brexit. It is understood senior Brexit backers in the government have been urging leave-supporting MPs to “hold the line” and refrain from publicly criticising her approach. However, her equivocation over whether she would vote for Brexit is unlikely to go down well with Conservative Brexit supporters, who are already frustrated by the government’s decision to effectively submit to EU jurisdiction, budget payments and free movement during a two-year transition period."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2017/oct/11/middle-income-earners-tax-hit-to-pay-for-coalition-company-cuts","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-11T05:43:06Z","webTitle":"Middle-income earners' tax hit to pay for Coalition company cuts","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/oct/11/middle-income-earners-tax-hit-to-pay-for-coalition-company-cuts","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2017/oct/11/middle-income-earners-tax-hit-to-pay-for-coalition-company-cuts","fields":{"headline":"Middle-income earners' tax hit to pay for Coalition company cuts","bodyText":"The government’s plan to return the budget to surplus is heavily reliant on personal tax increases across every income bracket but hitting middle-income earners hardest, the Parliamentary Budget Office has revealed. Middle income earners (with an average taxable income of $46,000) will experience the highest average tax increases of any income quintile, jumping 3.2 percentage points, from 14.9% to 18.2% over the next five years. The PBO’s paper, released on Wednesday, reveals for the first time how the Turnbull government’s projected budget surplus in 2020-21 is relying on specific increases in average personal income tax rates. The tax hikes reflect a seismic shift in the taxation burden from businesses to individuals. The personal tax increases are necessary to compensate for the government’s controversial $65.4bn company tax cut. According to the PBO, the average tax rate on individual Australians is estimated to increase by 2.3 percentage points between 2017-18 and 2021-22. But there are large differences between income quintiles. Taxpayers in the first income quintile (the lowest 20% of income earners) will see their average tax rate increase by 0.2 percentage points over the next five years. Taxpayers in the second income quintile will see their average tax rate increase by 2.5 percentage points. Taxpayers in the fourth quintile will see their average tax rate increase by 2.3 percentage points. Taxpayers in the fifth quintile (the highest 20% of income earners) will see their average tax rate increase by 1.9 percentage points. The PBO report shows the Turnbull government is relying heavily on “bracket creep” to bring the budget back to surplus. Bracket creep is the phenomenon whereby taxpayers shift into higher tax brackets when their nominal incomes grow, due to inflation and/or real wages growth. The PBO says the government’s projected budget surplus is relying heavily on more than 1 million Australians shifting into higher tax brackets over the next five years, where their average tax rates will increase. Projections show over 900,000 taxpayers will move from a marginal tax rate of 32.5% to 37% between 2017-18 and 2021-22. Similarly, 700,00 people are projected to move from a marginal tax rate of 19% to 32.5% over the same period. “In addition to the effect of nominal income growth, average tax rates are projected to increase due to policy changes, most notably the policy decision to increase the Medicare levy from 2019-20,” the PBO report says. Two weeks ago award-reliant workers in the fast food, hospitality, retail and pharmacy sectors lost millions of dollars in income collectively after their public holiday penalty rates were cut in Victoria, Queensland, New South Wales, the ACT and South Australia. According to the McKell Institute, a Labor-aligned thinktank, those workers may have collectively lost between $4.7m and $9.5m on the grand final weekend, depending on how many were rostered on. The PBO warned earlier this year that the Turnbull government’s plan to return the budget to surplus on the back of rising personal income tax relied heavily on a sharp acceleration in wages growth over the decade. It warned the “significant slowdown” in wages growth experienced in the past few years suggested this gamble by the government was subject to “downside risk”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/oct/10/wall-street-journal-turkey-ayla-albayrak-prison","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-10T23:29:32Z","webTitle":"Wall Street Journal reporter convicted in Turkey over 'terrorist propaganda'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/10/wall-street-journal-turkey-ayla-albayrak-prison","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/oct/10/wall-street-journal-turkey-ayla-albayrak-prison","fields":{"headline":"Wall Street Journal reporter convicted in Turkey over 'terrorist propaganda'","bodyText":"A Wall Street Journal reporter has been convicted of producing “terrorist propaganda” in Turkey and sentenced to more than two years in prison, in a ruling that has drawn sharp criticism from press freedom advocates. Ayla Albayrak, who was charged over an August 2015 article in the newspaper, was convicted in absentia, and was in New York at the time the decision was made. “We call on Turkish authorities not to contest Ayla Albayrak’s appeal and to drop all charges against her,” said Nina Ognianova of the Committee to Protect Journalists in a statement. “Dozens of journalists are imprisoned for their work in Turkey and this conviction is a signal that conditions for the press are continuing to deteriorate. Rather than dispensing justice, Turkey’s judicial system has become an instrument of persecution.” The court convicted Albayrak of violating the country’s anti-terror law and sentenced her to two years and one month in prison in connection with a Wall Street Journal article published in 2015. The offending story chronicled the government’s efforts to quell unrest among the nation’s Kurdish separatists, “firing tear gas and live rounds in a bid to reassert control of several neighborhoods”. “The decision shows the extent to which the authorities did not want the operations that were going on in Turkey’s southeast to be reported on,” Albayrak said in a statement. Dow Jones, which publishes the Wall Street Journal, said an appeal was already in the works. Turkey jails more journalists than any country in the world, according to the CPJ and Amnesty International. “This ruling against a professional and respected journalist is an affront to all who are committed to furthering a free and robust press,” said William Lewis, publisher of the Wall Street Journal. “We call on those who share this commitment to make their voices heard. “We have stood by Ms Albayrak’s side for nearly two years as we have robustly pursued all available options to defend this baseless prosecution, and we will continue to stand with her as we seek to overturn this conviction.” Albayrak graduated from the University of California, Berkeley, and has been reporting from Turkey since 2004, including with the Journal since 2010. Since a failed coup against President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan in 2016, Turkey has become one of the world’s largest jailers of journalists, with 178 behind bars. The crackdown has also ensnared a number of foreign reporters: in February, Deniz Yücel, a reporter for the German newspaper Die Welt, was jailed on terrorism accusations and remains in custody. The French journalists Loup Bureau and Mathias Depardon were each also detained on separate occasions while reporting in south-east Turkey and were subsequently released. The conviction also comes as diplomatic relations rapidly deteriorate between the US and Turkey. On Tuesday, the US suspended nearly all types of visa services for Turks after a US consulate employee in Turkey was arrested on suspicion of having ties to the US-based Turkish cleric Fethullah Gülen, whom Erdoğan’s government blames for the coup attempt. Albayrak, who said that she said shouldn’t have been surprised by the ruling, but was, said: “It also shows, yet again, that the international media is not immune to the ongoing press crackdown in Turkey.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/oct/11/harvey-weinstein-lea-seydoux","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-11T19:11:45Z","webTitle":"'I had to defend myself': the night Harvey Weinstein jumped on me | Léa Seydoux","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/oct/11/harvey-weinstein-lea-seydoux","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/oct/11/harvey-weinstein-lea-seydoux","fields":{"headline":"'I had to defend myself': the night Harvey Weinstein jumped on me","bodyText":"I meet men like Harvey Weinstein all the time. I have starred in many films over the last 10 years and have been lucky enough to win awards at festivals like Cannes. Cinema is my life. And I know all of the ways in which the film industry treats women with contempt. When I first met Harvey Weinstein, it didn’t take me long to figure him out. We were at a fashion show. He was charming, funny, smart – but very domineering. He wanted to meet me for drinks and insisted we had to make an appointment that very night. This was never going to be about work. He had other intentions – I could see that very clearly. We met in the lobby of his hotel. His assistant, a young woman, was there. All throughout the evening, he flirted and stared at me as if I was a piece of meat. He acted as if he were considering me for a role. But I knew that was bullshit. I knew it, because I could see it in his eyes. He had a lecherous look. He was using his power to get sex. He invited me to come to his hotel room for a drink. We went up together. It was hard to say no because he’s so powerful. All the girls are scared of him. Soon, his assistant left and it was just the two of us. That’s the moment where he started losing control. We were talking on the sofa when he suddenly jumped on me and tried to kiss me. I had to defend myself. He’s big and fat, so I had to be forceful to resist him. I left his room, thoroughly disgusted. I wasn’t afraid of him, though. Because I knew what kind of man he was all along. Since that night in his hotel room, I’ve seen him on many other occasions. We are in the same industry, so it’s impossible to avoid him. I’ve seen how he operates: the way he looks for an opening. The way he tests women to see what he can get away with. He also doesn’t take no for an answer. I once went with him to a restaurant and when he couldn’t get a table he got angry and said: “Do you know who I am? I am Harvey Weinstein.” That’s the kind of man he is. I’ve been at dinners with him where he’s bragged openly about Hollywood actresses he has had sex with. He’s also said misogynistic things to me over the years. “You’d be better if you lost weight,” he said. That comment shocked me. One night, I saw him in London for the Baftas. He was hitting on a young woman. Another time, at the Met Life ball, I saw him trying to convince a young woman to sleep with him. Everyone could see what he was doing. That’s the most disgusting thing. Everyone knew what Harvey was up to and no one did anything. It’s unbelievable that he’s been able to act like this for decades and still keep his career. That’s only possible because he has a huge amount of power. In this industry, there are directors who abuse their position. They are very influential, that’s how they can do that. With Harvey, it was physical. With others, it’s just words. Sometimes, it feels like you have to be very strong to be a woman in the film industry. It’s very common to encounter these kinds of men. The first time a director made an inappropriate comment to me, I was in my mid-20s. He was a director I really liked and respected. We were alone and he said to me: “I wish I could have sex with you, I wish I could fuck you.” He said it in a way that was half joking and half serious. I was very angry. I was trying to do my job and he made me very uncomfortable. He has slept with all of the actresses he filmed. Another director I worked with would film very long sex scenes that lasted days. He kept watching us, replaying the scenes over and over again in a kind of stupor. It was very gross. Yet another director tried to kiss me. Like Weinstein, I had to physically push him away, too. He acted like a crazy man, deranged by the fact that I didn’t want to have sex with him. If you’re a woman working in the film industry, you have to fight because it is a very misogynistic world. Why else are salaries so unequal? Why do men earn more than women? There is no reason for it to be that way. Hollywood is incredibly demanding on women. Think about the beauty diktats. All of the actresses have botox at 30. They have to be perfect. This is an image of women that is bizarre – and one that ends up controlling women. This industry is based on desirable actresses. You have to be desirable and loved. But not all desires have to be fulfilled, even though men in the industry have an expectation that theirs should be. I think – and hope – that we might finally see a change. Only truth and justice can bring us forward. Léa Seydoux is a French actor.

On Tuesday night, however, after the Socceroos squeaked past Syria 2-1 to reach the final stage of World Cup qualifying – a play-off against, most likely, Honduras or Panama – he allowed himself the indulgence of a smile. Though only a wry one, mind. “We always find a difficult way to do things,” he said. He’s not wrong. Since their journey to Russia 2018 began in June 2015 with a twitchy 2-1 away win against Kyrgyzstan, the Socceroos’ World Cup qualification journey has been as circuitous and wrenching as one of those budget flights to Europe in which the layovers are longer than many marriages and the flight paths resemble the etchings of a lunatic. That trend continued with the Socceroos’ come-from-behind extra-time win in Sydney last night. As many a bitten nail will suggest this morning, it was a win that was as close to a crushing loss as the width of the right-hand upright that denied centre forward Omar Al Soma a late, late equaliser and 10-man Syria a second, and decisive, away goal. Despite dominating possession (76%-24%) and shots (25-7) – as occurred in the first leg in Malaysia, and, to an absurd degree, in the final group qualifier against Thailand in Melbourne – it took an 118th-minute Tim Cahill header for the Socceroos to defeat a bullish Syrian team whose directness and pace on the counter often rattled Australia’s fine china and made them look skittish in defence. Indeed so effective was Syria’s approach I can’t have been the only observer wondering if it wouldn’t hurt the Socceroos to take a leaf out of their book every now and then and put their strangulation by triangulation game plan to one side in order to pin the ears back and go at ’em like Melbourne tram inspectors. Postecoglou seemed to concede as much in his team selection, giving the veteran Cahill a rare start and sticking him up front to play off the shoulder of the last defender. Although Postecoglou explained after the match that his decision to play Cahill was an acknowledgement of Cahill’s experience and calmness under pressure, it was an old school approach. Importantly it was one that played to Cahill’s strengths, gave the Syrian defenders something to worry about and opened up space for Australia’s playmakers, Aaron Mooy (who, surprisingly, started from the bench) and Tom Rogic. The result, of course, was that Cahill scored both of Australia’s goals with his head; the equaliser and, much later, as penalties loomed, and Australian cardiologists kept one eye on their pagers, the all-important winner. Cahill now has 50 goals for his country, a phenomenal return. And yet, despite the fact that Cahill’s early goal was created with a fast break – after Rogic gave Matthew Leckie a ball to chase and the winger played a perfect first-time cross to Cahill’s golden bonce – the Socceroos reverted back to their slow-build up play thereafter. When the crosses did come in they were delivered either too late or, like the majority of Australia’s corners, too short or wide of the mark. Finally, though, just when it was needed, just when it seemed Australia’s indirectness and wayward shooting would be their undoing, Australia were rewarded for their statistical dominance and perseverance, with Cahill’s head being found one more time, on this occasion by Robbie Kruse. As a nation celebrated it may also have entertained the thought that Australia’s continued reliance on a 37-year-old striker explains, in part, why this World Cup campaign has been such a slog. But who ever said qualifying for a World Cup was easy? Ask Argentina how easy it is, ask the Netherlands. These world footballing heavyweights are standing on the precipice of elimination. Yet the Socceroos’ World Cup dream remains intact. They are not the most talented squad we have had in recent times, they may even be trying to play a style of football they’re ill-equipped to play, but they’ve endured the travails of the past two years, the away trips to far flung reaches of the globe. And here they are still, enjoying the opportunity to wonder what the weather is like in Central America at this time of year. It’s been a wobbly, imperfect campaign, but it’s not over yet."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"business/2017/oct/12/kobe-steel-scandal-car-general-motors-auto-train-aircraft","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-12T10:21:54Z","webTitle":"Kobe Steel chief admits scandal has hit trust as car checks spread","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/oct/12/kobe-steel-scandal-car-general-motors-auto-train-aircraft","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2017/oct/12/kobe-steel-scandal-car-general-motors-auto-train-aircraft","fields":{"headline":"Kobe Steel chief admits scandal has hit trust as car checks spread","bodyText":"The chief executive of Kobe Steel has said a deepening scandal over false inspections data may have spread beyond Japan, and conceded that his company now had “zero credibility”. US carmaker General Motors is the latest manufacturer to check whether its cars contain falsely certified parts or components sourced from the the firm, Japan’s third-biggest steelmaker. “General Motors is aware of the reports of material deviation in Kobe Steel copper and aluminium products,” the company’s spokesman Nick Richards said. “We are investigating any potential impact and do not have any additional comments at this time.” The scandal has forced some of Japan’s best-known manufacturers to confirm the safety of products sourced from Kobe Steel. Toyota and Nissan are among about 200 affected companies, and Hitachi said it had used Kobe Steel parts in trains built for the UK market. “Products used met safety standards, but they did not meet the specifications that were agreed between us and Kobe Steel,” a Hitachi spokesman said. Pressure is mounting on Kobe after it admitted last weekend that it had falsified figures about the strength and durability of its aluminium and copper products, which are used in cars, aircraft, space rockets and defence equipment. Its chief executive, Hiroya Kawasaki, apologised on Thursday and promised that the firm would report to the trade ministry on the results of urgent safety inspections within a fortnight. He also said the cause of the falsified data would be explained within a month. “The credibility of Kobe Steel has plunged to zero. We will make efforts to regain trust as soon as possible,” Kawasaki told reporters after meeting government officials. The scandal is one of several to have embroiled Japanese manufacturers in recent years, and has called the country’s reputation for quality control into question. The car parts maker Takata has paid $1bn (£756m) in penalties in connection with defective airbags that have been blamed for at least 16 deaths worldwide. Earlier this month, Nissan recalled all 1.2m new cars it sold in Japan over the past three years after discovering that final vehicle inspections had not been performed by authorised technicians. Nissan used Kobe Steel aluminium in the hoods and doors of some of its vehicles. “As hoods are related to pedestrian safety, we are working to quickly assess any potential impact on vehicle functionality,” it said. Toyota also confirmed that the material has been used in hoods and rear doors of some of its vehicles. The aircraft maker Boeing said it was inspecting Kobe Steel products, but that it had no reason to believe safety had been put at risk. Kobe Steel also supplies materials to the carmakers Ford, Honda, Mazda and Subaru as well as Mitsubishi Heavy Industries. Yoshihiko Katsukawa, a managing executive officer at Kobe Steel, said the scandal could widen depending on the results of an investigation by an outside law firm into cases of data falsification stretching back a decade. “We can’t rule out the possibility that the external investigation will find other cases,” Katsukawa said. No Kobe Steel customers had raised safety concerns or cancelled contracts with the firm, he added. Shares in the company stabilised on Thursday after about $1.6bn was wiped off its market value in two days.

The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences added its voice to the growing chorus of disgust against the alleged behaviour of a man it awarded a best picture Oscar to in 1999 for producing Shakespeare in Love. It said it would hold a special meeting on Saturday to discuss allegations against Weinstein amid speculation it could follow Bafta’s lead in suspending his membership. “The Academy finds the conduct described in the allegations against Harvey Weinstein to be repugnant, abhorrent, and antithetical to the high standards of the Academy and the creative community it represents,” it said in a statement. On Thursday, French actor Florence Darel became the latest star to accuse the producer of sexual harassment. Darel, 49, who first came to notice in Éric Rohmer’s A Tale of Springtime in 1990, told French media that Weinstein had promised to help make her big in America if she became his “part-time” mistress. She said she first had to reject his advances after Weinstein’s company Miramax bought the 1993 fashion industry comedy À La Mode in which she appeared. “We had a little premiere in New York and he wouldn’t stop calling me so that I would come to the party afterwards. Because I could see what he was up to, I pretended that I was with the lead actor in the film so he would leave me alone,” she told Le Parisien newspaper. The following year, pushed by her agent, she agreed to meet Weinstein in a Paris hotel. “He talked to me about a film he wanted to make about World War II and then he began to tell me that he found me very attractive and wanted to have an affair with me,” Darel added. “I told him I was very much in love with my partner, but he said that that didn’t worry him and he wanted me to be his mistress for a few days a year. That way we could work together. Basically, he said that if I wanted to make it in America, it would be through him,” the actor said. “I told him I had to go and left,” she added. Darel joins a string of other high-profile actors, including Gwyneth Paltrow, Angelina Jolie, Léa Seydoux and Cara Delevingne, who have accused the producer of sexual harassment or assault. Three women have accused Weinstein of rape. Weinstein denies allegations of non-consensual sex. In a statement issued on Wednesday in response to his wife’s decision to leave him following the allegations, Weinstein said: “I support her decision, I am in counselling and perhaps, when I am better, we can rebuild. Over the last week, there has been a lot of pain for my family that I take responsibility for.” In video footage published on Wednesday, Weinstein told reporters: “Guys, I’m not doing OK but I’m trying. I gotta get help... You know, we all make mistakes….second chance I hope.” The film industry is facing questions about why it did not act earlier to censure Weinstein. His reputation for sexual harassment was such an open secret in Hollywood that it was the source of sitcom jokes and a knowing reference at an Academy Awards nomination ceremony. Announcing the nominees for best supporting actress in 2013, the comedian Seth MacFarlane said: “Congratulations, you five ladies no longer have to pretend to be attracted to Harvey Weinstein.” MacFarlane confirmed the joke was prompted by allegations made by Jessica Barth, one of more than a dozen women who have recounted sexual harassment by Weinstein. The Palme d’Or-winning actor Seydoux also joined the ranks of Weinstein’s accusers this week, saying she had to defend herself after he allegedly jumped on her and tried to kiss her. Writing in the Guardian, the star of Blue is the Warmest Coloursaid Weinstein stared at her “as if I was a piece of meat”. She added: “We were talking on the sofa when he suddenly jumped on me and tried to kiss me. I had to defend myself. He’s big and fat, so I had to be forceful to resist him.” British supermodel Delevingne also claimed Weinstein made unwelcome advances towards her in a hotel room. In a statement posted on Instagram she said she was left feeling “very powerless and scared” when he invited her to his hotel room and tried to make her kiss a woman. On Wednesday night, police in Los Angeles were called to a “family dispute” at the home of Weinstein’s daughter, a day after his British wife, Georgina Chapman, said she was leaving him over the allegations. The Los Angeles police department said Weinstein was not there when officers arrived and no crime had been committed."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"artanddesign/2017/oct/13/we-were-the-real-cowboys-indigenous-spaghetti-western-premieres-at-tarnanthi","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-12T23:13:57Z","webTitle":"‘We were the real cowboys’: Indigenous spaghetti western premieres at Tarnanthi","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2017/oct/13/we-were-the-real-cowboys-indigenous-spaghetti-western-premieres-at-tarnanthi","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2017/oct/13/we-were-the-real-cowboys-indigenous-spaghetti-western-premieres-at-tarnanthi","fields":{"headline":"‘We were the real cowboys’: Indigenous spaghetti western premieres at Tarnanthi","bodyText":"It has all the ingredients of a classic western: a dastardly gold heist; the villain’s face on a wanted poster; three shootouts; and two mobility scooters. The mobility scooters are a necessary addition. Many of the stars of Never Stop Riding, a 10-minute spaghetti western shot over one day at Wellborn Station near Indulkana – an Indigenous community in the APY lands about 360km south of Alice Springs – are well past the age of 70. The film was the brainchild of three senior Yankunytjatjara men – Peter Mungkuri, Jimmy Pompey, and Alec Baker – who wanted to get young men in their community interested in horseriding and stock work as a way to keep them occupied and encourage them not to drink alcohol. On Thursday they watch as it plays on a loop at the Art Gallery of South Australia, ahead of the opening night of the Tarnanthi festival of Indigenous art. All three men worked as stockmen from the 1940s to the late 1960s, before settling in Indulkana. They are now senior artists but still wear the well-worn akubras of their station days, the felt hardened with time and sun and darkened with sweat. Baker was seven years old when he came to Granite Downs station in South Australia, and saw a white person for the first time. Mungkuri was 12. Both settled into station life. “I never learned no school,” Baker tells Guardian Australia. “I learned horses, that’s all. Riding horses.” Mungkuri, who surprised and slightly alarmed Iwantja Arts centre staff by vaulting onto a horse when they arrived at the station earlier this year, and chasing them to get their speed up, says he could ride for hours – days – without getting tired. “I never got sick of it,” he says. “I just stayed all the time. “We learned about riding, breaking, training brumbies, branding horses, branding cattle … we lived before with a good thing. No drink and none of any of that. Just horses, riding, going out, putting up a fence – it was all a good thing.” When they came back into town they would get called “cowboys”, Mungkuri says. They would watch films starring Clint Eastwood and John Wayne and scoff. “We were the real cowboys.” Their own film has a slightly less complicated plot than The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly, but is considerably more fun. Told across seven acts, it opens with a shot of wanted posters for Vincent “the wild” Namatjira – the great grandson of Albert, also an artist. It’s followed by several scenes of co-conspirators in the great gold theft triumphantly holding their prizes aloft. The gold, the audience is told, belonged to Andy. A man named Johnny stole it. There follows three shootouts: the classic one-on-one at high noon (Andy’s man wins), followed by a two-on-one (Andy’s man wins again), and an inexplicable six-on-one, in which Andy’s man again emerges victorious. In between the first and second shootout is a brief interlude featuring Baker and another man on mobility scooters taking pot shots at the younger men, who attempt to ride away on horseback. The final act is a dance number, a feature that is tragically omitted from many westerns. Mungkuri is sitting cross-legged on the bench in front of the film as it plays in the art gallery, laughing merrily. They were famous cowboys when they were younger, he says in the introduction to the film. For the three months that the film is played at the gallery, they will be famous once again. Fifteen men from Indulkana took part in the project. They camped overnight at Wellborn Station in June and spent the first day teaching the younger men to ride. Most had never sat on a horse before. “He said, ‘jump on!’ and the horse took off,” Eric Barney, one of the younger men, tells Guardian Australia. The senior men plan to repeat the trip with school-aged boys from the community. “Young people: we got to put them in school, but they’ve got to be taught hunting, ceremony and all that,” Mungkuri says. “He got to be learning our culture too, that’s why he’s making trouble and he drinks the grog – he doesn’t learn culture.” The Tarnanthi exhibition at the art gallery of South Australia runs from 13 October to 28 January.

McGowan had earlier tweeted “fuck off” to actor Ben Affleck and accused him of lying about his knowledge of Weinstein’s history of sexual misconduct. She announced the 12-hour suspension in an Instagram post. During this period she is not able to send tweets or retweets from her account, unless she deletes “tweets that violate our rules”, the notification from Twitter said. Twitter told the Guardian that McGowan’s account was temporarily locked because one of her tweets included a private phone number, which violates the company’s terms of service. “The tweet was removed and her account has been unlocked,” a spokeswoman said in a statement on Thursday. “Twitter is proud to empower and support the voices on our platform, especially those that speak truth to power,” she added. “We stand with the brave women and men who use Twitter to share their stories, and will work hard every day to improve our processes to protect those voices.” McGowan has been a vocal figure in the Weinstein scandal since the New York Times broke the story last week and has been using Twitter to express her support for other women who have come forward, as well as to attack those who she sees as being complicit, including the Weinstein Company board of directors and high-profile Hollywood figures such as Matt Damon and Affleck. On Wednesday, Affleck apologised to actor Hilarie Burton for groping her during an appearance on MTV’s Total Request Live in 2003. He had earlier published a statement condemning Weinstein for alleged acts of sexual harassment, prompting the Twitter responses from McGowan, who claimed Affleck was aware of the mogul’s behaviour. McGowan has been one of the most high-profile actors to have accused Weinstein of sexual misconduct, alleging the film producer sexually harassed and assaulted her when she was in her early 20s. She reportedly received a settlement of $100,000 from Weinstein over an incident that took place in a hotel room in 1997. Twitter has not made the exact conditions for locking an account public. However, on its support page it says that if it detects behaviour that may “inhibit other people’s ability to express themselves freely”, it “may temporarily limit certain account features”. The move by Twitter is likely to reignite controversy over its free speech and harassment policies, after the company recently said it would not ban Donald Trump over his tweets apparently threatening war with North Korea.

But she finds it hard to do so in most public mosques in this small city on the Indonesian island of Java. The reason, she says, is that she began life as a man. According to Shinta, transgender people in Indonesia find it hard to pray at ordinary mosques, where men and women are divided and they often elicit hostile reactions from other congregants. It was for this reason that Shinta helped found the Pondok Pesantren Waria al-Fatah, the world’s only Islamic boarding school for transgender people. “In the public mosque we made people uncomfortable. We needed a safe place for trans women to pray,” she says. Since its establishment in 2008 the boarding school, or pesantren, has become a safe haven for trans people from across Indonesia, the world’s largest Muslim-majority nation. “In here you can be with a women’s clothes or men’s clothes, it’s up to you,” Shinta says. “It depends how comfortable you are.” The school sits in a warren of narrow lanes in a quiet neighbourhood of Yogyakarta, housed in a 19th-century joglo, a traditional Javanese wooden house once owned by Shinta’s grandmother. Its walls are painted bright green; outside in the yard stray cats scavenge and laundry billows in the breeze. The school has a shifting membership of around 40 mostly LGBT people. Unlike most pesantren, where students are in their teens or early 20s, the students here are generally older, and include four transwomen who live here full-time. One of them is Yumi Sara, 50. She has lived at the boarding school since 2010, while working as an HIV/Aids advocate in Yogyakarta. “Allah doesn’t care if you are gay or transgender or anything else,” she says, taking drags on a clove cigarette as the evening call to prayer echoes across the city from nearby mosques. “Transgender is a beautiful creature created by Allah.” “Making a place like this is a statement,” says Mario Prajna Pratama, the chairperson of Plush, an LGBT rights organisation in Yogyakarta. “It’s like, if you do not want to give us access to pray, we will create our own.” In Indonesian, trans people are referred to as waria, a combination of the Indonesian words for woman (wanita) and man (pria). Waria are nothing new in Javanese culture, but they nonetheless face persistent discrimination and are often pushed to the edges of society. Refused jobs by many employers, who require that applicants describe themselves as either male or female, many find work in the arts, as traditional dancers and street performers, or in more dangerous and marginal fields such as sex work. In addition to holding weekly prayers and Koranic readings, Shinta frequently visits university campuses to educate young people about LGBT issues. But the increasing visibility of the LGBT rights movement has prompted a backlash from political and religious conservatives. Homosexuality and transgenderism are not illegal in Indonesia, but the past year has seen a spike in anti-LGBT rhetoric and actions by the authorities. Earlier this month police raided a sauna popular with gay men in the capital Jakarta, arresting 51 people. While most were released a short time after, five have been held for violations of Indonesia’s loosely defined anti-pornography laws. A similar raid in May netted more than 140 arrests. The Indonesian Psychiatric Association has claimed that transgender people have mental disorders, and the country’s parliament is currently debating a law that would ban LGBT characters from national television shows. In May two gay men were publicly caned in conservative Aceh province for violations of the region’s sharia laws, which outlaw homosexuality. As with the fundamentalist campaign that led to the jailing of Jakarta’s former governor, Ahok, on blasphemy charges, Pratama says anti-LGBT politics have become a unifying issue for conservatives. “To make them unite, they need an issue. What can make them unite? One of the things is the LGBT,” he says. The Pondok Pesantren Waria al-Fatah has not been immune from the backlash. In February 2016 the school was forced to close for four months after threats of violence from conservative groups, including a local vigilante group calling itself Front Jihad Islam (FJI). After the local authorities proved unresponsive to her appeals, Shinta says she agreed to close the school temporarily. Abdurrahman, the leader of FJI, claims the boarding school is violating Islamic precepts. “In the Qur’an it is said that men should not behave like women,” he says at his home outside Yogyakarta. “It violates sharia.” But many local residents are supportive of the pesantren and its mission. One is Arif Nuh Safri, a religious teacher, or ustadh, based at the Institute of Qur’anic Studies outside Yogyakarta, who volunteers his time to take prayer sessions and Qur’anic readings at the school. Arif says everyone has the right to access religious truths. “When we talk about religion, we talk about humanity,” he says. “If we talk about religion but don’t respect humanity, it’s no use.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2017/oct/12/imf-says-australia-has-one-of-the-fastest-rising-income-inequality-rates","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-12T05:14:24Z","webTitle":"IMF says Australia has one of the fastest rising income inequality rates","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/oct/12/imf-says-australia-has-one-of-the-fastest-rising-income-inequality-rates","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2017/oct/12/imf-says-australia-has-one-of-the-fastest-rising-income-inequality-rates","fields":{"headline":"IMF says Australia has one of the fastest rising income inequality rates","bodyText":"Australia is among countries with the highest growth in income inequality in the world over the past 30 years, according to the International Monetary Fund. Vitor Gaspar, the IMF’s director of fiscal affairs, has told an audience at the launch of the IMF’s latest Fiscal Monitor that Australia’s income inequality growth has been similar to the US, South Africa, India, China, Spain and the UK since the 1980s. Last month the treasurer, Scott Morrison, said that income inequality was not getting worse in Australia. Morrison told the Business Council of Australia in late September that Treasury and the Reserve Bank had found, in specific analysis of current wage fundamentals, that Australian wages were growing slowly across most industries in the economy, and most regions of the country, so the slow growth was evenly shared. However, he would not release the Treasury analysis. Gaspar said IMF staff had used the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development’s income distribution database, Eurostat, and the World Bank’s Povcalnet data, among other sources, to calculate that income inequality had increased in nearly half of the world’s countries in the past three decades, and Australia had experienced a “large increase” in that time. “Most people around the world live in countries where inequality has increased,” he said. The IMF’s latest Fiscal Monitor, released overnight, is dedicated to the global growth in income inequality. It warns that while some inequality is inevitable in a market-based economic system as a result of “differences in talent, effort, and luck”, excessive inequality could “erode social cohesion, lead to political polarisation, and ultimately lower economic growth”. It also warns that income inequality tends to be “highly correlated” with wealth inequality, inequality of opportunity, and gender inequality. In July this year, when dismissing the Labor party’s plan to crackdown on trusts and other forms of tax minimisation, Morrison claimed that income inequality was actually getting better in Australia. “The latest census showed on the global measure of inequality, which is the Gini coefficient, that is the accepted global measure of income inequality around the world and that figure shows it hasn’t got worse, it has actually got better,” he said. He was technically right – if you only consider the last few years. The Gini index is the most widely used measure of inequality. It looks at the distribution of a nation’s income or wealth, where 0 represents complete equality and 100 total inequality. The 2016 census showed the Gini coefficient for equivalised disposable household income in Australia fell from 0.333 in 2013-14, to 0.323 in 2015-16. Morrison did not mention that the Gini coefficient had been even lower in 2005-06, at 0.314. Earlier this year, the OECD economic survey of Australia in April found “inclusiveness has been eroded” in the past two decades. “The Gini coefficient has been drifting up and households in upper-income brackets have benefited disproportionally from Australia’s long period of economic growth,” the report said. “Real incomes for the top quintile of households grew by more than 40% between 2004 and 2014, while those for the lowest quintile only grew by about 25%.” In July the Reserve Bank governor, Philip Lowe, when asked about his views on inequality at a charity lunch in Sydney, said it had grown “quite a lot” in the 1980s and 1990s and had risen “a little bit” recently, but it was important to make a distinction between income and wealth inequality. “Wealth inequality has become more pronounced particularly in the last five or six years because there’s been big gains in asset prices,” Lowe said. “So the people who own assets, which are usually wealthy people, have seen their wealth go up.” He said income inequality had increased slightly in recent years, but wealth inequality was more pronounced because of rising asset prices."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2017/oct/12/lawsuit-claims-border-patrol-violated-constitution-by-searching-delta-plane","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-12T19:53:58Z","webTitle":"Lawsuit claims border patrol violated constitution by searching Delta plane","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/oct/12/lawsuit-claims-border-patrol-violated-constitution-by-searching-delta-plane","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/oct/12/lawsuit-claims-border-patrol-violated-constitution-by-searching-delta-plane","fields":{"headline":"Lawsuit claims border patrol violated constitution by searching Delta plane","bodyText":"The Department of Homeland Security is facing a class action lawsuit over an incident in which all the passengers on a domestic flight were held and searched by US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agents before being allowed to get off their plane – potentially in violation of the US constitution. The action, filed in New York, is part of an ACLU-backed effort to force the department and its subsidiary agencies, CBP and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice), to clarify their position on an unusual and potentially unconstitutional inspection procedure it described as “routine” in press reports at the time. The suit claims that after Delta flight 1583 from San Francisco landed at New York’s JFK on 22 February, passengers had their identity documents seized and searched, a violation of constitutional protections against unreasonable search and seizure under the fourth amendment. “The officers did not have any legal justification for seizing and searching these passengers,” said the ACLU’s deputy legal director, Cecillia Wang. “This is a serious and illegal erosion of our basic civil liberties. Because CBP publicly took the position that this action was pursuant to policy and a ‘routine’ matter, we are compelled to take action to ensure that this doesn’t happen to passengers on future flights.” The lead plaintiff in the case, Kelley Amadei, who was on the flight with her seven-year-old son, told the Guardian that CBP’s demand had made her feel “intimidated and confused as to why they would be asking for our IDs at the end of a flight. I felt like they weren’t looking for any one person because they were checking everyone. I felt violated.”The CBP said that its agents, acting on an Ice request, asked to see passengers’ identification as they searched for an immigrant who had received a deportation order after multiple criminal convictions for domestic assault, driving while impaired and violating a protective order. “An individual with a final order of removal from a federal immigration judge was scheduled to be on a flight from San Francisco to JFK on the evening of 22 February, in furtherance of the removal process,” Ice said in a statement provided to the Washington Post. “It was later determined that the individual was not placed on the flight in San Francisco.” In the suit, Amadei and eight other plaintiffs claim two uniformed CBP officers “positioned themselves in the doorway of the airplane, forcing passengers to queue inside and delaying their exit”. The officers, the suit alleges, “made it clear, through their own conduct and by directing pre-arrival announcements by the flight crew, that compliance was not voluntary and that passengers would not be permitted to disembark until they showed their identification documents”. The plaintiffs further claim the officers did not have a warrant permitting search or seizure of the passengers or probable cause to believe that anyone on the plane had committed a crime. Amadei says she went to ask the officers why the passengers had been detained, and was told “you have nothing to worry about, leave it alone”. “It felt like an unwarranted search and request for identification in a situation that did not call for it. When no explanation was given the feeling that our fourth amendment rights had been violated were amplified.” “It was a show of force. I’ve been nervous that it could happen again, or that I might be detained for no reason. It’s given more of a sense of awareness, a sense of living in a police state.” Amadei also says she does not accept the official explanation for the search. “If they were looking for an individual who was known, why were they checking every single person on the flight, male, female, regardless of age and regardless of race.” Her son, she says, was also shaken by the experience. In the court papers, she states: “My son was so scared that he asked if our family was in trouble and whether everything was OK.” The suit seeks a permanent injunction barring the government from seizing and conducting warrantless and/or suspicionless identification checks of passengers disembarking from domestic flights. “We feel compelled to bring this suit because CBP said the search was consistent with agency policy,” says the ACLU’s Wang. The civil rights body sent a letter expressing concern over the CBP action in September and asking the agency to confirm under what authority it had acted. “They did not respond so we feel we need to bring the suit in order to get a court order that clarifies the fourth amendment does not permit the CBP to apprehend every passenger on a domestic flight.” The fourth amendment to the US constitution, adopted in 1792, reads: “The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2017/oct/13/you-say-tomato-retailers-say-waste-research-finds-produce-problem","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-12T17:00:09Z","webTitle":"Almost 90% of edible tomatoes thrown away based on appearance – research","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/oct/13/you-say-tomato-retailers-say-waste-research-finds-produce-problem","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/oct/13/you-say-tomato-retailers-say-waste-research-finds-produce-problem","fields":{"headline":"Almost 90% of edible tomatoes thrown away based on appearance – research","bodyText":"Up to 87% of undamaged, edible tomatoes harvested from a commercial Queensland farm were rejected and wasted based on appearance, a study has found, highlighting the problem of food wastage. Tara McKenzie, an environmental scientist at the University of the Sunshine Coast, said that at every point in the supply chain, edible tomatoes that were slightly odd-shaped or marked or deemed too small or too large were rejected because they didn’t meet market standards for premium, unblemished product. She found between 68.6% and 86.7% of the produce was rejected. The government estimates food waste costs the Australian economy $20bn each year. Researchers examined a farm in Bundaberg that had two separate supply chains running to provide tomatoes to markets in Bundaberg and Brisbane. Led by McKenzie, they followed the tomatoes from the point of harvesting through to sorting and handling, transport, and storage. The farm chosen had an annual pack volume of 4,500 tonnes, and interviews were conducted with farmers and workers along the supply chain to evaluate how decisions were made to reject tomatoes. The study did not examine preharvest losses or consumer waste. The research also found that between 70% and 84% of tomatoes grown were left in the field, because the cost of harvesting and supplying them to market was greater than any profit to be made. A co-author of the paper published in the journal Horticulturae, Dr Lila Singh-Peterson, said while supermarkets were partly responsible for demanding unblemished products, the policies of supermarkets were probably reflecting consumer expectations. “But the standards supermarkets impose on farmers are very stringent, and the farms have to meet those standards or the supermarkets will just choose another supplier,” Singh-Peterson said. “The waste is ridiculous. Regulation needs to occur at the market end so that rather than having supermarkets dictating contracts with farmers, the regulation should occur through a central market.” She added that government support for farmers was woeful. About 4% of Australian farm income could be traced back to government support, she said, compared to 61% in Norway and 52% in South Korea. “We’ve really abandoned farmers and just expect them to cope with extra market pressures,” she said. The study reported on interviews with staff along the supply chain. One field manager told the researchers: “The size we pick depends on the days’ price … if the price is a little bit high, the market wants the small tomatoes as well. Otherwise, if the price is low … we do not pick the small stuff”. Someone else commented that supermarket standards expected fresh produce to “conform like a packet of Arnott’s biscuits”. Bundaberg Fruit and Vegetable Growers cooperated with the researchers and allowed them to follow the supply chain. The organisation’s managing director, Bree Grima, said tomatoes grown in the field as those in the study were would always result in a higher level of waste than those grown in protected cropping situations. But the level of waste was nonetheless high, and was an issue growers had long been concerned about, she said. “A range of things contribute to produce being rejected including shape, size, rub marks and insect activity,” she said. “All we can do is continue to put pressure on supermarkets and show that we are at risk of leaving the industry and indeed, already a lot of us have as growers simply cannot make ends meet. We continue to have the pressure put on us from higher above and we have nowhere to go. “We want a fair price for produce and we need to create consumer awareness so people know that if they see tomatoes for two dollars per kilo, everyone involved in supplying the product is taking a cut of that and people need to think about what that means for the farmer.” The study concluded that post-harvest loss was due to “deliberate and informed actions of supply chain actors, dictated predominantly by private food standards and market value rather than a lack of access to appropriate postharvest handling infrastructure”. “Stringent product specifications enforced via private food standards due to the combination of asymmetric supermarket business practices and consumer purchasing behaviour are considered by the supply chain actors to be the fundamental cause of high food loss and waste,” the study found. “Given the notable lack of research on food loss and waste in developed countries, the results of this paper necessitate a greater research effort, particularly at the production end of the food supply chain.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2017/oct/12/assisted-dying-laws-former-ama-head-says-life-is-not-defined-by-a-heartbeat","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-12T02:05:18Z","webTitle":"Assisted dying laws: former AMA head says 'life is not defined by a heartbeat'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/oct/12/assisted-dying-laws-former-ama-head-says-life-is-not-defined-by-a-heartbeat","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2017/oct/12/assisted-dying-laws-former-ama-head-says-life-is-not-defined-by-a-heartbeat","fields":{"headline":"Assisted dying laws: former AMA head says 'life is not defined by a heartbeat'","bodyText":"Dr Brian Owler, the former president of the Australian Medical Association, has urged Victorian politicians not to waste an opportunity to pass voluntary assisted dying laws, saying “life is not defined by a heartbeat”. “Life is more,” the neurosurgeon told the National Press Club in Canberra on Thursday. “It is the experience of this world, of those around us, it’s the love and comfort of our families. “Some might say that suffering is part of life, and I agree it is. But respecting life does not mean that suffering is something that must be endured by an individual, particularly against their wishes.” His speech comes as the Victorian parliament prepares to debate assisted dying legislation on Tuesday afternoon. The legislation has been two years in the making and was informed by an extensive parliamentary inquiry that included considering 1,074 submissions and evidence from 154 witnesses. Following this inquiry the Victorian government established a ministerial advisory panel tasked with examining all of the available evidence on voluntary assisted dying from around the world. Owler was appointed chair of that taskforce, and the taskforce findings were used to inform the legislation now being considered by parliament. Owler told the National Press Club that the resulting legislation was evidence-based, tailored to Victoria, and included 68 safeguards to protect against the laws being abused. He added that in states like Oregon in the US, which has had voluntary assisted dying legislation for 20 years, the laws had not been weakened or expanded in all that time, which should dispel claims that passing legislation was a “slippery slope” to more watered-down laws. “The practice of voluntary assisted dying, which is also primarily about the relief of suffering, when practiced within an established legal framework, is wholly consistent with good medical practice and upholds the fundamental objectives of being a doctor,” Owler said. He added that he strongly supported palliative care, which in the majority of cases was adequate to relieve pain and suffering. But he added there were a minority of cases where pain and suffering could not be relieved. “Many of those most determined to see this law pass have personal anecdotes of loved ones whose death has been terrible,” he said. “People in such examples often died of cancer-related illnesses. They experienced excruciating bone pain or neuropathic pain resistant to medication.” Other conditions included chronic organ failure such as end-stage respiratory failure or heart failure, where people experienced a death akin to slow suffocation or drowning, he said. He described the pain of watching his own father die a terrible death, and of being powerless to ease his suffering despite his medical credentials. His father starved to death, “literally rotting in his bed as the ulcer on his sacrum grew”, Owler said. “I watched, president of AMA NSW and a consultant neurosurgeon, hopelessly unable to help him,” he said. “Resources and access were not an issue. I remember my despair as I politely asked one of his doctors for help to ease his suffering. He died a terrible death.” In closing, Owler said that he wanted to address Victorian politicians and send them a message. “I know that all of you went into parliament to make a difference,” he told them. “As a doctor I understand this desire. It’s what motivates doctors as well. For some of you, this may be one of the hardest decisions you make in your political career. “But to be able to make a decision, the result of which is to ease the suffering of a person who is dying, and those who love that person, to provide them with the comfort of a choice, not just for one day but for days into the future, that is a unique opportunity for our parliamentarians to exercise. “This is an opportunity not to be wasted.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/oct/13/tasmania-conservation-deal-a-legacy-from-the-stubborn-cattleman-of-kings-run","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-12T17:00:09Z","webTitle":"Tasmania conservation deal a legacy from the stubborn cattleman of King's Run","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/oct/13/tasmania-conservation-deal-a-legacy-from-the-stubborn-cattleman-of-kings-run","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/oct/13/tasmania-conservation-deal-a-legacy-from-the-stubborn-cattleman-of-kings-run","fields":{"headline":"Tasmania conservation deal a legacy from the stubborn cattleman of King's Run","bodyText":"The coastline that borders King’s Run in northwestern Tasmania is speckled with middens. The dense shell deposits poke out from the dunes beside disused four-wheel-drive tracks and rock formations. The pebble-lined shore once housed seal hides and more middens can be seen near the depressions that show where huts once sat. Elsewhere on the property, a burial site houses the bones of long-dead Tarkanya people. The heritage sites were protected for 20 years by Geoff King, a third-generation beef grazier who switched from cattle to eco-tourism in the 1990s to spare the dunes further damage. On Monday, more than four years after King’s sudden death in September 2013, the property was formally signed over to Aboriginal ownership. The purchase was the result of the determined efforts of Indigenous organisations, green groups and the King family; a chance encounter at a book signing with the former Greens leader Bob Brown; the private generosity of two enthusiastic bushwalkers; and a $325,000 donation from Wotif founder and philanthropist Graeme Wood (who also contributed funding to establish Guardian Australia). It was the culmination of a process that began more than 30 years earlier when a reported thylacine sighting and a plan to rehabilitate the public image of the Tasmanian devil sent wildlife biologist Nick Mooney tramping around the west coast. “Because I was a stranger arrived in the district … Geoff, being an insatiably curious person, stopped me in the street and said: what the hell are you doing here, who are you?” Mooney said. Unlike many other farmers Mooney had approached, King was interested in environmental conservation. It was the early 1980s. The King family, who were the first white settlers in the area in the 1880s, had been wintering their cattle on a coastal property that included King’s Run for 100 years. Their tracks had worn deep grooves in the dunes, criss-crossing vehicle tracks and creating intersections where the sand blew away. King was trying to lay branches along the paths to redirect his stock. Eventually he decided to remove the stock entirely and focus on a tourism business that Mooney suggested, holding a “devil restaurant” where visitors could sit and watch wild devils feeding on a roadkill carcass. It became one of the best known tourism experiences on the west coast. But his decision to stop farming the land and instead focus on conservation, particularly the conservation of Aboriginal heritage sites, caused some consternation, Mooney said. “Geoff was a maverick, considering third generation cattle farmer in the far north west, local football icon – he was a great cricketer and footballer – all of those things suggest a certain type of person, and to do this really threw the locals,” he told Guardian Australia. “Like he let the team down badly, that was the kind of feeling you’d get.” King campaigned heavily against recreational four-wheel driving along the coast and waged what Mooney called an “ongoing low-key warfare” with anyone who tried to drive along the track that frequently weaved out of the 30-metre wide coastal reserve and into his land. “He just stopped people coming on to his land which meant essentially they couldn’t use the tracks,” Mooney said. Many resented his decision to turn King’s Run over to conservation, and he was actively opposed on his support for the Tasmanian Aboriginal Centre’s campaign to close the four-wheel drive tracks. In 2012 the former Labor state government agreed to close 37.2km of the tracks, and in 2013 a 2km wide, 110km strip of the coastline, including King’s Run, was placed on the national heritage register for protection of its Indigenous cultural values. A promise to reopen the tracks was credited for a 13.6% swing toward the Liberal party in the electorate of Braddon the 2014 state election, but those plans have been frustrated by repeated legal challenges by the Tasmanian Aboriginal Centre who succeeded in securing a federal court ruling that off-road vehicles were damaging Indigenous heritage sites. The federal environment minister, Josh Frydenberg, is now considering a proposal by the Hodgman government to lay rubber matting on sensitive sites, allowing vehicles to drive across. One of the most strident voices in support of opening the tracks is King’s brother, Perry. The elder by 18 months, Perry King managed the family beef property jointly with his younger brother for more than 10 years following the death of their father. Both sat on the Arthur-Pieman management committee. You could always be confident of at least two locals turning up to a community consultation meeting on the west coast, Mooney joked; neither King brother would let the other appear uncontested. In the late 1990s, as King grew more interested in the environmental rehabilitation of the land, the partnership split, as did the King family holdings. Perry’s half of the coastal block runs from the southern boundary of King’s Run to the Arthur River township. He still winters his cattle on the coast and is one of only two remaining graziers to run stock on the Arthur-Pieman Conservation Area, a practice that is being slowly phased out. Perry was at the handover ceremony at King’s Run on Monday to congratulate his new neighbours. Returning parts of the family farm to Aboriginal ownership is not a step he would take, he told Guardian Australia, but it was what Geoff would have wanted. “As the next-door neighbour there I just hope it delivers the things they want it to in terms of their connection to the country,” he said. He has hosed down concerns from fellow farmers who were already incensed that the Tasmanian Aboriginal Centre had succeeded in persuading the federal court that allowing four-wheel driving along coastal tracks damaged the heritage sites. Thanks to Geoff’s vigilance – or beligerence, Perry said, depending on who you spoke to – no one has been allowed to drive along the coastal reserve that abuts King’s Run for years. “He used to have some rows with people out there,” Perry said. “He would chase them all over the place. Hardly anyone goes up that way now. It’s a battle he won.” He said that would not change under Aboriginal ownership. “I have heard some people say, ‘Oh, it’s going to deny us access’,” he said. “But I said: ‘Well, you never had bloody access anyway’.” The Aboriginal community is not interested in chasing people off the land. They just want to protect it, Aboriginal Land Council of Tasmania chairman Clyde Mansell said. Mansell said the community was planning a number of eco-tourism ventures, including continuing King’s popular devil tours. “What it does is it gives the Aboriginal community an opportunity to link back to this area uninterrupted, if you like, whereas if it’s not in ownership you’re always needing to succumb to whether people agree to us coming here or not,” Mansell told Guardian Australia. The freehold title was purchased privately by the Aboriginal Land Council of Tasmania, using money raised by the Tasmanian Land Conservancy, Wood’s donation, and a $680,000 grant from the Indigenous Land Corporation. Two of the largest donors to the Tasmanian Land Conservancy, Barbara Lowe and Debbie Hiller, friends who met on a trek through the Tarkine rainforest and later attended an event by the Bob Brown Foundation, where they heard about the push to purchase King’s Run. Together they provided $60,000 to the cause. “There was just this amazing opportunity to help,” Lowe said. “It seemed to be essential,” Hiller added. “He [King] was so committed and it has such immense value, this land.” Private purchase is not the usual route for Indigenous land acquisitions in Tasmania. Under the 1995 Aboriginal Lands Act, the Tasmanian parliament can grant freehold title to lands of significance to the Aboriginal community. The legislation was introduced in 1995 in recognition of the fact that the swift displacement of Aboriginal people during the 19th century in Tasmania meant that the newly established native title laws, which require claimant groups to demonstrate a continuous connection to the land, would be difficult to satisfy. “In 95 the Aboriginal community made a decision that native title would be a very long bow and it would be subject to complication and go on for years and years and we’d probably never see any land back,” Mansell said. “People were moved off the land fairly early, very quickly in fact. A matter of seven years and most of our people had been moved off their cultural landscape. It’s that that interferes with native title.” The Aboriginal lands trust manages 55,606ha of returned land in Tasmania, including at Preminghana, an area just north of King’s Run on the Tarkine coast that was handed back in 1999. It is the site of extensive rock carvings and one sheer rock face, marking the spot where the Tasmanian museum had the petroglyphs cut from the rock and brought to Hobart for display in 1969. It is that kind of destruction that prompted former Greens leader Bob Brown to petition the federal government for stronger protection of the area. Standing on the coastline near Church Rock, a site of cultural significance just outside the King’s Run boundary, Brown said he hoped the whole of the Tarkine would one day be returned to Aboriginal hands. “That’s just 7% of Tasmania, it’s not going to dispossess anybody of their land, it’s public lands, so I hope that in the coming century it will be Aboriginal people showing the rest of the world this rich part of the coast,” Brown said. “I come from the bush and there’s a completely unwarranted fear in some rural communities that if you recognise the Aboriginal traditional ownership and cultural relationship somehow you’re going to lose your land. That is not going to happen … to allow the Aboriginal people to connect with the land is to enrich your own ownership of it.” Guardian Australia travelled to King’s Run courtesy of the Bob Brown Foundation."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2017/oct/27/thiago-motta-midfield-psg-value-age","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-27T08:27:50Z","webTitle":"Thiago Motta: PSG’s no-frills continuity man who shows the value of age","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/oct/27/thiago-motta-midfield-psg-value-age","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/oct/27/thiago-motta-midfield-psg-value-age","fields":{"headline":"Thiago Motta: PSG’s no-frills continuity man who shows the value of age","bodyText":"There were many who thought Thiago Motta would have been deep into retirement by the age of 35. A snapped anterior cruciate ligament at Barcelona in his early 20s badly hampered his development and there were fears for his career at 26 when his injury problems were so dire he was released by Atlético Madrid. It was at this time, the summer of 2008, that Harry Redknapp gave Motta a trial for Portsmouth against Sunderland. Redknapp liked what he saw but had his doubts about the player’s knee and mobility, as did other potential suitors. Given that such a brittle joint had to hold up a 6ft 2in rugged frame it hardly seemed plausible that it would still be doing so nine years later, with Motta a central figure in a Paris Saint-German side oozing talent and heavily fancied to win the Champions League.. That Motta has won 16 trophies since then while recently fending off younger more skilful midfielders year after year at PSG is testament to his consistency. But what is it exactly that he is consistent at doing? Motta does not impress himself on a game with athletic ability (though he can tackle and he’s well-versed in the dark arts), he can hit the ball sweetly but does not score many goals, and, although his passing is accurate, his distribution is usually of the no-frills variety. He is one of those rare players whose presence itself appears to be his standout quality, the rug in the room you notice most when it’s gone. Motta was conspicuous by his absence, for instance, in that 6-1 hammering in Barcelona. And with PSG in control and pushing for a second goal when the score was 1-1 against Marseille last week, it is no coincidence they conceded shortly after replacing him with the more forward-thinking Julian Draxler. For a club often said to lack history and character, perhaps it is no surprise that PSG have placed so much value in a player brimming with both. He is their continuity man. “Thiago Motta is an important member of the squad and his leadership and knowledge of the game are really appreciated by our supporters,” said the club’s president, Nasser al-Khelaifi, when the naturalised Italian extended his contract in July after a second season in succession when it was rumoured he would retire or move on. PSG receive an awful lot of criticism for so often leaning on the huge wealth at their disposal to solve problems but they deserve credit for being able to see the worth in holding on to an experienced player when many elite clubs cannot. But even now, in his latter years, Motta is not just at the club to regale the dressing room with tales of battles of yore. Unai Emery had enough faith in him to let the €30m (£26.8m) holding midfielder Grzegorz Krychowiak join West Bromwich Albion on a season’s loan and he has started 12 of the 14 games in PSG’s so far unbeaten Neymar era despite a minor injury in the past month that has ruled him out of Friday’s game against Nice. So what does Emery think Motta brings to his team? “He has given a lot to those who have been able to work with him and he has a very specific style on the pitch,” he said last season, without elaborating on what that style is. José Mourinho, who made Motta a metronomic fixture in midfield during Internazionale’s 2009-10 treble-winning season, spoke glowingly of the player soon after he joined PSG. “His position is very well adapted and he understands the qualities and the philosophy of Paris,” he said. “They want the ball so they’ll have it. In his position, he organises, he gives tempo. He’s a fantastic player.” He also used his status in the dressing room recently to defuse the row between Neymar and Edinson Cavani over penalty duties by telling them both to grow up. To be cold and calculated about what Motta does, stand back and admire his 94% completed passing stats in Ligue 1 this season. Or his 142 touches of the ball when PSG dismantled Celtic in the Champions League, after which his midfield partner Marco Verratti said: “I hope he never stops playing. Thiago is so intelligent that his age does not matter.” Motta’s on-pitch movement (never hurried) is always economical. And unlike players who have it all to prove, he never wastes a yard. Closing off space when defending and creating it during attacking transitions are qualities that are never fully appreciated by casual observers. But Motta is adept at both. When you have played the game for as long as he has, understanding space and movement comes naturally. In 2003, when he was 20, Motta was asked by the Barcelona manager, Radomir Antic, to take on the mammoth task of shackling Zinedine Zidane in the Clásico at the Bernabéu. He did it perfectly, limiting the Frenchman’s influence and allowing his struggling side (they finished sixth that season) to pick up a point against the eventual champions. He was earmarked as a future destroyer, having grabbed Zidane by the throat while bullying him all around the Bernabéu. But his injury problems meant that he could never make the rabble-rousing defensive midfield role at the Camp Nou his own. He was on the Stade de France bench watching Edmilson and Mark van Bommel in his position win the Champions League final against Arsenal in 2006. But the point is that Motta, when still wet behind the ears, displayed the kind of supreme authority and game intelligence many players never come close to throughout their careers, no matter how long they go on for. His reading of the game has always been greater than most. And it has grown through his years at Genoa (where he played further forward), Inter and PSG. And it is that invisible quality – as well as his aura – that the French club value so highly. But perhaps trying to pigeon-hole Motta is to miss the point. We should celebrate the fact that older players of his ilk, with a more subtle skillset, are able to survive in the modern era. He regularly has younger, more alluring sidekicks in Verratti and Draxler alongside him in midfield. He also has the youthful exuberance of Adrien Rabiot as competition for the holding role in PSG’s 4-3-3 and saw off Blaise Matuidi’s combative presence. Matuidi joined Juventus in the summer. Finding the right blend of youth and experience in teams is essential and often overlooked. How Spurs, Arsenal or Liverpool could have done with a player of Motta’s self-assuredness amid recent failed attempts to win the league title. Motta’s qualities took a long time to earn international recognition – he was 29 when first capped. Perhaps it should come as little surprise that it was Italy, a nation never fearful of fielding older players, and not Brazil (the country of his birth) that recognised him. So many players are undervalued when they reach their 30s with the preference being to field footballers in their prime or with their peak years still ahead of them. Perhaps Premier League sides would have performed better in recent Champions League campaigns had there been a few more wise heads among them. When Liverpool sold Lucas Leiva shortly after his 30th birthday there was sadness among many supporters who were able to overlook his limited craft and athleticism because he so often had a stabilising effect when he played in midfield. He was the beer mat under the table who could help bring balance when his side were rocking. Many Manchester United fans feel Michael Carrick, a supreme and rhythmic passer and hugely effective tempo man, was forced into the background too soon. But Motta has survived at PSG in a similar holding role. Finding the right balance in midfield is not only about tactics and making sure players cover the hard yards. It is about knowledge, influence, intelligence. Motta is not a genius but he is an important player making the case for old heads in a game that these days seems to be putting too much value on youth."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"artanddesign/2017/oct/13/gotye-and-godspeed-you-black-emperor-to-headline-mona-foma-in-2018","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-13T00:30:18Z","webTitle":"Gotye and Godspeed You!

But if anyone thought that the flagship music festival of the Museum of Old and New Art (Mona) was going to be doing things the expected way, they were always going to be disappointed. “People might think that we’re contrarians,” said Ritchie. “And they might be right.” On Friday, Mona’s festival of music and art (Mona Foma) released its 10th festival line-up. After making waves earlier this year when Mona owner David Walsh announced that the festival would be moving from Hobart to Launceston due to his museum renovation plans, this year’s line-up announcement sees the festival split over both locations. Much of it will still take place at Mona itself, while a “mini Mofo” will run at Launceston over the first weekend of the festival period. Headlining the festival – and the Launceston line-up – is atmospheric post-rock Montreal band Godspeed You! Black Emperor, in collaboration with Canadian dance company The Holy Body Tattoo, to perform their contemporary dance and music piece, Monumental. “We’re pretty excited about that,” Ritchie told Guardian Australia. “We’ve been talking to them for several years and this is the first time that we were able to actually get it all to line up.” Godspeed You! Black Emperor will also be performing music from their new album, Luciferian Towers, on the main stage at Mona. Also included in the Launceston line-up is Gotye, who will perform an ode to the French electronic composer Jean-Jacques Perrey and the early and rare electronic keyboard instrument, the ondioline – with the Ondoline Orchestra. The Violent Femmes will also perform, backed by the Tasmanian Symphony Orchestra in Hobart. “We’re really into collaborations – even though we’re primarily a music festival, we do love collaborations with other art forms, as long as the music also has integrity,” said Ritchie. Other artists on the line-up include jazz composer and Gil Scott-Heron collaborator Brian Jackson performing with the Tasmanian Southern Gospel Choir; singer-songwriter Jamila Woods; Iraqi cellist Karim Wasfi in collaboration with and the all-girl Indigenous Australian electronic group, Kardajala Kirridarra. There’s also the esoteric Green Brain Cycle, in which Australian concert pianist and composer Michael Kieran Harvey – who “writes stuff to challenge himself”, according to Ritchie – will create a musical interpretation of Frank Herbert’s 1966 science fiction novel, The Green Brain. Tasmanian installation artist Brigita Ozolins will create a “meditative space” for Michael to perform the work in, while writer Arjun von Caemmerer will cover the walls of the space with poetry. “What I’m proud of is that we’ve been able to create almost a utopian format for presenting music,” said Ritchie. The next challenge is to create something sustainable and repeatable: “You can only make a splash so many times.” The full line-up is available on Mona Foma’s website. Tickets go on sale midday Monday 16 October. • Mona Foma’s Mini Mofo will take place in Launceston from 12–14 January, and Mona Foma’s main program will take place in Hobart from 15–22 January."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/oct/12/coalition-woos-young-people-in-private-health-insurance-overhaul","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-12T07:42:27Z","webTitle":"Coalition woos young people in private health insurance overhaul","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/oct/12/coalition-woos-young-people-in-private-health-insurance-overhaul","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/oct/12/coalition-woos-young-people-in-private-health-insurance-overhaul","fields":{"headline":"Coalition woos young people in private health insurance overhaul","bodyText":"Private health insurers will be able to offer discounted private hospital cover to people under the age of 29, and new product categories will give consumers more information about the limits of their coverage, under reforms to be unveiled on Friday. The federal health minister, Greg Hunt, will launch an overhaul of Australia’s much-criticised private health insurance system, confirming changes including the removal of natural therapies including kinesiology, naturopathy, pilates, reflexology, rolfing, shiatsu, tai chi, and yoga from health insurance policies. The changes will allow insurers to increase their excess levels, which would discount some products for consumers. Maximum permitted excesses for private hospital insurance will be increased from $500 to $750 for singles and from $1,000 to $1,500 for couples or families. People under 30 will be encouraged to sign up with discounted premiums to take effect from April 2019. Health insurers will be able to offer discounts on hospital cover of up to 2% a year for each year the consumer is aged under 30, to a maximum of 10% for 18 to 25 year olds, with the discounted rates gradually phased out once a policyholder turns 40. Insurance products will also be separated into categories. Hospital cover will be rated gold, silver, bronze and basic, and extras cover gold, silver and bronze. When consumers take out insurance with a combination of hospital and extras cover, the components will be rated separately. The new categories will take effect from 1 April 2019. The changes will also include some beneficial changes for people with mental health conditions. From April 2018, people will be able to upgrade their cover to access in-hospital treatment without having to sit out a waiting period. Private health insurers will also have less scope to impose limitations on the number of mental health sessions or treatments patients can access, like group counselling sessions, electroconvulsive therapy or transcranial magnetic stimulation. Insurers will also be able to offer travel and accommodation benefits under hospital cover instead of only under general treatment policies. Presently consumers can only claim travel and accommodation expenses if they take out top-level general treatment extras cover, and the benefits aren’t generous. The package also includes changes to expenditure on prostheses, which currently accounts for 14% of private health insurance hospital benefits paid annually. The government says there is evidence that prostheses list benefits are generally inflated when compared with the equivalent prices paid for devices in the public sector. The private health insurance ombudsman (PHIO) will also be given expanded powers to ensure insurers are meeting their regulatory obligations. In a statement, Hunt said the government was helping to reduce rising costs for health insurers “which would otherwise be passed on through higher premiums”. “We know that many people would like to be able to select a higher excess in exchange for lower premiums,” Hunt said. “That’s why we will increase the maximum excess consumers can choose under their health insurance policies for the first time since 2001. “We know that every dollar matters to Australian families and these reforms will get better value for families and make policies easier to understand.” But Labor dismissed the overhaul. The shadow health minister, Catherine King, said the bulk of Australians who rely on private health insurance, and use it regularly, would get no benefit from the government’s changes. The changes are the consequence of a review which has gone on for more than 12 months. The action is an attempt to respond to a slide in health insurance membership, and increasing criticism of health insurance products by health economists, medical experts and consumer groups."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/oct/16/shifting-sands-bondi-pavilion-revamp-square-one","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-16T00:47:50Z","webTitle":"Shifting sands as Bondi Pavilion revamp goes back to square one","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/oct/16/shifting-sands-bondi-pavilion-revamp-square-one","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/oct/16/shifting-sands-bondi-pavilion-revamp-square-one","fields":{"headline":"Shifting sands as Bondi Pavilion revamp goes back to square one","bodyText":"In the centre of Australia’s most famous beach sits an equally iconic structure, the Bondi Pavilion. The art deco building houses cafes, a bar, a theatre and change rooms. It’s used for community activities such as yoga, meditation, band competitions and arts and crafts as well as having a bar area upstairs that can be hired out. But Bondi’s grand old lady is undeniably a little tired. That’s about all people agree on. Over the past four years Bondi Pav has been at the centre of a fierce debate. It has been eyed by developers who see the potential on its first floor for restaurants and bars with views to die for, and jealously guarded by locals who view it as the public heart of their community. There have been shouting matches in council between angry locals who regard it as Bondi’s de facto town hall, and the former Liberal mayor Sally Betts, who viewed it as an embarrassment to the tourism credentials of Bondi. So when the former council proposed a $40m refurbishment, and refused to guarantee that commercial spaces would be capped at 50%, all hell broke loose in the usually laid-back beachside community. Many locals suspected a secret plan to turn the first floor into restaurants and bars with million-dollar views and equally hefty prices. Rallies starring Bondi’s famous artists, musicians and actors became a regular occurence. In the end, a more modest “phase one” plan was approved and construction was due to start. But now the new Labor-Greens council has put plans on hold and is asking the community what it really wants. How does the council balance the needs of tourists and the broader Sydney population with the locals’ passion for their community centre in a city where public spaces are increasingly under pressure? Betts was right when she labelled the change facilities inadequate. The Heritage Council of NSW has complained often about the plastic bubble on the front which houses the popular bar, The Bucket List. And there really isn’t much for tourists to see other than a nice beach when they visit. The new mayor of Waverley, John Wakefield, has moved swiftly. “This new chapter will see the creation of the Bondi Pavilion stakeholder committee which will comprise a total of 12 members,” he says. He will be calling for applications as well as inviting the Save Bondi Pavilion group, the local precinct committee and three councillors to participate. One of the issues is how to fit the competing demands into the old building. Items on the wish list include: new change rooms and facilities; a possible museum of surfing; as well as continued use of rooms for dance groups, yoga and music. Many also want to keep the two internal courtyards intact, and the council needs to preserve the revenue it gets from the existing cafes and bars. Yet the space inside the building is limited. One option is to scrap plans to expand the change rooms and build an unobtrusive new block underneath the Bondi carpark and lawns, with access from the promenade, similar to the structure that has just been completed at nearby Coogee. There is also still a question mark over whether the theatre needs to be made bigger. Wakefield says he would like to see if it’s possible to uncover the original murals of Spanish dancers in the old ballroom, which are now covered by the theatre’s raked seating. “The building itself has some heritage-listed elements, but it’s the cultural heritage which is of greatest value, and that’s what I would like to see preserved.” He says it’s now up to the community and broader stakeholders to come up with a list. “This group will be tasked with prioritising the required and desired uses of the Pavilion and the artistic direction of the Pavilion in the future. It’s expected that membership of the group will be confirmed in November, with a series of workshop meetings to take place over late November and early December. “Depending on an appropriate development consent being given in time, I hope we can begin construction in the winter of 2018,” he says. “Refurbishing and upgrading Bondi Pavilion in line with community wishes is one of council’s highest priorities.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/oct/14/we-have-to-stop-normalising-relentless-islamophobia-in-australia","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-13T19:00:40Z","webTitle":"We have to stop normalising relentless Islamophobia in Australia | Rabia Siddique","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/oct/14/we-have-to-stop-normalising-relentless-islamophobia-in-australia","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/oct/14/we-have-to-stop-normalising-relentless-islamophobia-in-australia","fields":{"headline":"We have to stop normalising relentless Islamophobia in Australia","bodyText":"Terrorised, persecuted, stateless, homeless, and, until recently, without real international support – this is the plight of the Rohingya, a Muslim minority community being forced out of Myanmar. At the hands of the Myanmar military, more than 80 villages have been burnt, leaving ten thousands of Rohingyas fleeing daily and attempting to cross into a flooded Bangladesh. Amid perennial media coverage linking Islam to terrorism and radicalisation, little has been known in the west of the persecution of Muslim minority communities like the Rohingya. Like many displaced Muslims, the vulnerable Rohingya may face fear and resentment when they settle in new communities. If by chance some of the Rohingya find refuge in our lucky country, there’s a strong possibility they will be on the receiving end of the relentless Islamophobia experienced by Muslims, in particular since 11 September 2001. But just how serious a problem is Islamophobia in Australia? As an Australian-born, modern, educated, uncovered Muslim woman, I am acutely aware I come to this issue from a position of privilege, but sadly, also some experience. As a child of a migrant growing up in 1970s Australia, when the White Australia policy was still the policy of the day and “assimilation” was the buzzword, I, like many of my Italian, Greek, Asian and Aboriginal friends, tried to fit in, to become invisible to avoid the verbal and sometimes physical attacks that came mostly from the white kids at school. While being called racist names was hurtful and offensive, most of us shrugged it off and grew into reasonably confident, productive and, eventually, accepted members of the Australian community. Largely, it was thanks to the hard work and sacrifice of our parents. In those days little was known about Islam or Muslims, and our community was relatively small, so we were lumped into the “Johnny foreigner” category until we proved ourselves worthy of respect and acceptance, but we were not specifically targeted by politicians, populists or nationalists like Muslims today. Several independent reports show that while Islamophobia has risen since 2001, the majority of incidents have been directed at Muslim women and their children. In 2004, a report to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission by the Centre for Cultural Research at the University of Western Sydney to investigate Australian Arabs’ and Muslims’ experiences of post-September 11 racism, found sharply increased incidents of racism, abuse or violence against Arab and Muslim Australians. While 93% of respondents reported an increase in racism, abuse and violence against their community; one of the most notable findings was that women experienced significantly more abuse than men. A 2015 report “Islamophobia, social distance and fear of terrorism in Australia” by professors Riaz Hassan and Bill Martin from the University of South Australia found 10% of Australians describe themselves as highly Islamophobic, 20% as undecided and 70% as less Islamophobic. Focusing education and awareness efforts on those who consider themselves less Islamophobic holds the key to changing negative attitudes towards peace-loving Muslims, says Hassan. The Islamophobia Register Australia, set up by Mariam Veiszadeh in 2014, provided a platform to report, record and analyse Islamophobic incidents. Veiszadeh observed that while extensive research and resourcing had gone into understanding radicalisation (particularly Islamic radicalisation) and addressing it as a security and a social problem, Islamophobia was under-researched, under-documented and not widely accepted as a serious issue affecting social harmony. This was despite evidence suggesting it is one of the largest contributors to radicalisation among Muslims. The pressing need to tackle Islamophobia is evident in a combined Charles Sturt University and University of Western Australia report Islamophobia in Australia. It shows Muslim women, particularly hijab-wearing women and their children, bear the brunt of most Islamophobic attacks. Some 79.6% of victims are women and 47.7% of their children are direct or indirect targets. Most perpetrators are men, and the location makes little difference. Islamophobia doesn’t recognise the heterogeneous nature of Muslim communities and the disempowering impact these attacks have on Muslim women and children over other forms of racism. This disempowerment is often related to me by my hijab-wearing friends. One friend’s daughter was deeply traumatised while walking home. A car of young white men slowed down alongside her, shouted abuse, pulled out toy guns and pretended to shoot her. She arrived home pale and shaken, vowing never to leave the house alone again. In one of many other incidents, a friend’s four-year-old son told her he didn’t think he would grow up to become a father, because he was sure he would be killed before he got older. When asked why, he referred to a letter delivered to their home earlier that week. The anonymous letter (which he had overheard his parents talking about) was a death threat. Anecdotal evidence, the experience of friends and the findings of reports dating back to 2003 all highlight a mutual normalisation of Islamophobia in Australia that must stop. The Islamophobia in Australia report finds that victims are reluctant to report the all-too-regular crimes committed against them due to the inadequate response from authorities. And witnesses, who are more likely to report these attacks, still rarely intervene to stop the harm being inflicted. Muslims, particularly Muslim women, expect Islamophobic attacks as something they must endure to be a part of Australian society. Non-Muslims often accept Islamophobia as an inevitable, if regrettable societal phenomenon. Our leaders must take primary responsibility for reversing this normalisation. But we all have a role to play. An example of how we benefit can be seen in the support I had from professionals around the country to host a careers event for Muslim students who were allegedly asked to leave a Perth careers expo because some people felt uncomfortable by their presence. The resultant event showed students and teachers that they belong here and that everyone has a responsibility to speak against bigotry. For me, it was another reminder of the importance of committing to living a life in harmony with the values most of us hold dear – the values that make Australia, all of our Australia, great.

In tense questioning in the court of disputed returns on Thursday, Robert Newlinds was accused of attempting to put a gloss on earlier findings by justice Patrick Keane that Roberts knew of the “real and substantial prospect” that he was British when he nominated for the Senate in 2016. The third and final day of hearings into the eligibility of seven parliamentarians concluded on Thursday afternoon, with chief justice Susan Kiefel noting the need to provide a decision “as soon as possible” but stating it was not always possible to immediately do so. No indication was given of when the outcome of the case will be decided, with the fate of the deputy prime minister, Barnaby Joyce, senators Matt Canavan, Fiona Nash, Nick Xenophon and Roberts still unclear. Earlier, Newlinds claimed cross-examination of Roberts had “misfired” by doubting his assertion that he always believed he was Australian. Newlinds submitted that Roberts, who was born in India to a Welsh father, was a British subject who gained Australian nationality by his decision to move to Australia not by a process in 1974. That process did not naturalise Roberts but rather formally recognised his citizenship, he claimed. The solicitor general, Stephen Donaghue, rejected that conclusion, noting that British subjects were still “aliens” until they were naturalised. Newlinds suggested it was “un-Australian” to recognise a difference between “natural-born” and naturalised Australians, who he termed “immigrant Australians”, and said that in 1974 there was no concept of “British citizenship” because “we all had the same sovereign, and none of us were a foreign power”. Donaghue, on behalf of the attorney-general, has submitted that Roberts is ineligible because he had a level of knowledge of his foreign citizenship sufficient to make retention of the citizenship a voluntary act. Newlinds said that, according to the 1999 case of Sue v Hill, Britain was defined as a foreign power in 1986 but at the time “no bells rang out in the community” to alert people of the legal change. “Without doing anything, [Roberts] went from qualified to disqualified,” Newlinds said in what amounted to a “mystical process” decided by the high court. Repeated questions from the bench cast doubts on the relevance of historical cases on citizenship before 1974 and directed Newlinds to make submissions on Roberts’ citizenship status in 2016. Newlinds defended the focus on 1974, arguing the state of the law at the time meant that Roberts’ perception that he was an Australian and only Australian was “perfectly reasonable”. “I accept that by the time we get to 2016, times have changed, the red line has either moved or the world has moved around Roberts,” Newlinds said, but suggested it was “not reasonable to expect him to have noticed” his change in status as a citizen of a foreign power. Roberts’ case argues that because he always believed he was not British he did not have the actual level of knowledge that should be the bar for ineligibility. Newlinds noted that Keane had not found Roberts knew he was British, only that there was a “real and substantial prospect” that he was. He argued that the commonwealth had never shown that that level of knowledge was sufficient to disqualify him. Under questioning from Keane, Newlinds conceded that an “honest belief” that was “irrational or unreasonably held” would not save a dual national from ineligibility. Earlier, the friend of the court Geoffrey Kennett warned that the commonwealth’s construction of section 44 required the court to determine the subjective state of mind of parliamentarians, and factual questions over their knowledge could lead to difficulties judging the credibility of witnesses and even turn on “accidental factors” like whether a contradictor subjected a politician to cross-examination. Kennett conceded that the fact that Xenophon’s status as a “British overseas citizen” did not grant him a right to enter and live in the UK “may be a reason to find Xenophon isn’t a citizen” for the purposes of section 44. Nevertheless, Kennett submitted that Xenophon could be expected to owe a duty of loyalty and gain some protection from Britain as a result of that status. Justice Keane suggested the fact Britain gives a different label to “overseas citizens” may tend to suggest a “real difference of substance” and that overseas citizens are “distinctly not” full citizens. In submissions in reply, Donaghue returned to historical material that showed at the time of constitutional convention debates the framers did not evidence an intention to exclude dual citizens who were unaware of their allegiance to a foreign power. Brett Walker, counsel for Joyce and Nash, argued that a “literal, hard-line” reading of section 44 would allow foreign laws to prevent dual Australian citizens standing for parliament, even if they had no real connection to countries of their distant ancestry."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/oct/13/which-bank-could-give-australians-a-better-bang-for-their-buck-the-rba","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-12T17:00:09Z","webTitle":"Which bank could give Australians a better bang for their buck?

The RBA","bodyText":"How would you like to be able to get most of your mortgage from the Reserve Bank of Australia at the cash rate of 1.5% rather than three times that after your bank has slapped on its margin for the same money? How would you like to forget worrying about how to exercise your “super choice” wondering how much of your money will disappear in commissions on the side and multimillion dollar senior executive salaries? You wouldn’t need to if you could access the super schemes governments already run for their own public servants. They’re professionally managed with lower fees and better investment returns than retail and industry super funds. It’s strange, given all that reform we had in the 1980s and 90s, that we didn’t make it to something as economically rational and helpful as that. Still, the Productivity Commission’s current inquiry into competition in finance gives it the opportunity to make that right with simple, compelling recommendations from the heart of the reformer’s playbook. Recall National Competition Policy from the 1990s? It institutionalised the idea that all restrictions on competition should go if they couldn’t be independently justified. Except one that is. The principle of “competitive neutrality” embodied in National Competition Policy “levelled the playing field” by protecting private businesses from competition from governments where that competition reflected unfair advantages government agencies might have – for instance exemption from tax. This made good sense. But so focused were the reformers on the benefits of private enterprise that they said nothing about levelling the playing field in the other direction – where governments were already delivering services to some while refusing them to others. And here’s the thing: because finance is riddled with “market failure” – in other words, because the incentives of those in profit-seeking financial firms align so poorly with their customers’ interests – don’t presume that private firms are more efficient. Quite the contrary. As the Grattan Institute’s Jim Minifie showed in 2015, public sector funds achieved the highest average net returns over the 14 years to 2013, exceeding those of the entire Apra-regulated superannuation industry by 1.1 percentage points, industry funds by 0.6 percentage points and retail funds by 2.2 percentage points per year over that period. With $2tn in super, there’s a vast sum at stake. And peace of mind for Australians knowing that they could access the same low-cost, professionally managed super any public servant can access rather than the current regulatory palaver of first “super choice” and then MySuper and default funds. Meanwhile there’s that set-piece talking point about whether we should have a people’s bank. Well here’s the thing: we already do. When Westpac or the Commonwealth make payments to each other or need to park or borrow some cash, they head down to the people’s bank. Which bank? The government-owned Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) – Australia’s central bank – sits at the apex of our banking system facilitating payments between you and me even as we bank with different banks by allowing those banks to make payments between each other using their RBA-provided “exchange settlement accounts”. When one bank has more money overnight than it needs, it can park it with the RBA while another with a shortfall borrows it. Given this, it’s quite misleading to think of banking as privately owned and run. It’s a public-private partnership with the RBA wholesaling basic banking services to the commercial banks and effectively guaranteeing their debts if they can’t meet them. The commercial banks then go retail franchisee and “upsell” RBA services back to us. However, as commentators around the world are increasingly realising, the internet now renders the exclusivity of this arrangement obsolete. Central banks can now make such services available to allcomers. I’ve argued the RBA should also fund the super-safe portion of mortgages – up to just 60% of the value of your home. It’s much safer than their lending to our banks via “repurchase agreements”. The economic gains from taking competitive neutrality seriously in this way are very large. A 2016 Bank of England paper that looked at central banks facilitating payments with their own digital currency estimated gains of 3% of GDP. That exceeds the PC’s estimate of the gains from national competition policy throughout the 1990s in electricity, gas, urban water, telecommunications, urban transport, ports and rail freight. Much of this gain arises from government money creation in lending to householders (under my model) or in issuing digital currency (under the Bank of England model). Currently the people’s bank – the RBA – creates about 3% of the money stock in printing banknotes with the rest created by commercial banks as they make loans (nice work if you can get it!). These new arrangements would see governments creating around half the money we use which would generate tens of billions in revenue allowing tax cuts or increased expenditure elsewhere. More promisingly still, by recommitting to a more sophisticated, less tendentious understanding of the principle of competitive neutrality we could take a first big step beyond the simplistic slogans – markets good/governments bad – that have dogged economic reform and made it such a disappointment looking back. Where market failure abounds – and that’s nowhere more true than finance – problems should be tackled on their merits with public and private sectors each playing to their respective strengths."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/oct/11/prostitution-legalised-sex-trade-pimps-women","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-11T05:00:03Z","webTitle":"Why prostitution should never be legalised | Julie Bindel","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/oct/11/prostitution-legalised-sex-trade-pimps-women","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/oct/11/prostitution-legalised-sex-trade-pimps-women","fields":{"headline":"Why prostitution should never be legalised","bodyText":"Ask the question “What should we do about prostitution?” anywhere in the world, and you are increasingly likely to get the answer: “Legalise it.” This view is based on a belief that there will always be men who pay for sex and women who sell it. Decriminalising all aspects of prostitution – including brothel-owning and sex-buying – will, according to this argument, make life safer for these women, and also make it easier to root out abuse. Those in favour of decriminalisation, including many liberals and some feminists, consider prostitution to be work, and argue that “sex workers” can be protected by unions and health and safety measures. Decriminalising the selling of sex – so that only buyers are breaking the law – means prostitutes themselves are not penalised. But even where only the buying of sex is a criminal offence, it is argued, prostituted women are forced to take risks. In recent years this argument has made big advances. In 2000 the Netherlands made formal what had already been acceptable for some years, and lifted the ban on brothels, in effect legalising the sex trade. Three years later the New Zealand government passed, by one vote, the New Zealand Prostitution Reform Act which decriminalised street-based prostitution and brothel-keeping. The opposite, abolitionist position – favoured by feminists including myself, and every sex trade survivor I have interviewed – is: prostitution is inherently abusive, and a cause and a consequence of women’s inequality. There is no way to make it safe, and it should be possible to eradicate it. Abolitionists reject the sanitising description of “sex worker”, and regard prostitution as a form of violence in a neoliberal world in which human flesh has come to be viewed as a commodity, like a burger. Abolitionists do not consider prostitution to be about sex or sexual identity, but rather a one-sided exploitative exchange rooted in male power. They believe the progressive solution to the sex trade is to assist women to exit, and criminalise those who drive the demand. In Sweden, where the law criminalising demand and decriminalising those selling sex has been in place since 1999, there has been a sea change in attitudes among citizens, with around 80% supporting their government’s approach. What I have discovered, while researching campaigns for the legalisation or decriminalisation of prostitution in the Netherlands, Ireland and the UK, is that sex industry bosses have an influential voice in such campaigns, often providing funding; and that groups claiming to represent “sex workers” are just as likely to be a voice for pimps as they are to represent the women who earn their living selling sex. If prostitution is framed as work, it stands to reason that the workers require rights. The problem is that the term “sex worker”, coined in the 1980s and increasingly used by police, health workers and the media, includes pornographers, strippers and pimps, as well as those directly selling sex. In Nevada, where brothels are legal, I interviewed a brothel owner who was pimping out a severely learning-disabled young women who had been sold to the brothel by her boyfriend’s father. The fact that the brothel this young woman was being sold from was legally sanctioned and seen as a business – no different from a restaurant – meant that the pimp was able to present herself as doing her employee a favour by giving her a job. In the UK the argument in favour of decriminalisation has won support from trade unions. The GMB set up an adult entertainment branch in 2002, which held speaking gigs at political party conferences, the Royal College of Nursing and the Women’s Institute. In 2010, having observed the growing influence of the International Union of Sex Workers, I decided to look into its background and membership. Launched in London in 2000, the union calls itself a “grassroots organisation” standing up for the rights of all those working in the sex trade. I discovered that its modest membership appeared mainly to consist of academics studying the sex trade, men who buy sex, and the odd person running specialist services – hardly representative of Britain’s sex trade. One of its members, and a spokesman, was Douglas Fox, who has been active in the Conservative party and Amnesty UK, and co-owner of a large escort agency. He proposed a motion for blanket decriminalisation of the sex trade at the Amnesty International annual general meeting in 2008. Seven years later, this became Amnesty policy. Elsewhere a similar pattern can be seen. Almost immediately after an umbrella movement aimed at criminalising the buying of sex – Turn Off the Red Light – was formed in Ireland, a counter-campaign named Turn Off the Blue Light was up and running. It turned out a convicted pimp, Peter McCormick, was bankrolling it. Another activist is John Davies, currently serving 12 years in prison for charity fraud. Prior to his conviction for scamming at least £5.5m from British taxpayers, Davies travelled the world speaking at conferences, arguing that trafficking is a myth created by feminists, and that decriminalisation is the only answer. What happens when the legalisation argument wins is shown in the Netherlands over the past decade. Just three years after the law there was changed, the government began closing down street prostitution zones and restricting the number of “window brothel” licences. In 2004 I interviewed the leader of the government-funded Red Thread union. She told me it had only 100 members and most of those were “erotic dancers” and not in prostitution at all. Karina Schaapman, Amsterdam councillor and sex trade survivor, said in 2005 that legalisation came out of the notion that women were actively choosing to be prostitutes. “But that image is incorrect,” she said. “Two-thirds of prostitutes are foreign, most often illegal, and nobody is registering them.” The former Amsterdam mayor Job Cohen said legalisation had failed to remove organised crime from the sex trade, and that he hoped to “partially reverse” the legislation. Meanwhile, the links between organised crime, violence and prostitution in New Zealand have not been severed. Views differ as to whether decriminalisation has made the situation better or worse. One report, published five years after decriminalisation, claimed it had little impact on the number of people working in the sex trade but had offered some safeguards to children and others. But the personal testimony of women who have been prostituted provides evidence that brothel owners and punters have benefited more than the women have. The good news is that the pimps don’t always win. New laws criminalising the buying of sex, and decriminalising the selling of it, came into force in Northern Ireland in 2015 and in the Republic of Ireland this year. A legal challenge to the law in Northern Ireland is being led by Laura Lee, a “sex workers’ rights” campaigner – whose backers include the pimp Peter McCormick. I hope Lee loses. I completely understand why some people, on hearing that decriminalisation offers some protection to prostitutes, support it. But hardly anyone, including abolitionists, is arguing that the women and men who sell sex should be treated as criminals. Our argument is that pimps and sex-buyers definitely should be. What those who oppose us fail to realise is that decriminalisation, as it is most commonly used and understood, also means allowing pimping, sex-buying and brothel-owning. And this is not the way forward – unless we want to make it easier for the men who run the global sex trade to make more money out of women’s bodies. • Julie Bindel is a political activist and author of The Pimping of Prostitution: Abolishing the Sex Work Myth"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/oct/11/kitchen-gadgets-review-cuisinart-spice-and-nut-grinder-as-serene-and-lethal-as-a-zen-swordsman","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-11T10:03:45Z","webTitle":"Kitchen gadgets review: Cuisinart spice and nut grinder, as serene and lethal as a Zen swordsman","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/oct/11/kitchen-gadgets-review-cuisinart-spice-and-nut-grinder-as-serene-and-lethal-as-a-zen-swordsman","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/oct/11/kitchen-gadgets-review-cuisinart-spice-and-nut-grinder-as-serene-and-lethal-as-a-zen-swordsman","fields":{"headline":"Kitchen gadgets review: Cuisinart spice and nut grinder, as serene and lethal as a Zen swordsman","bodyText":"What?

But we’re here to talk about gadgets; and in a giddy moment of sincerity due to an over-hot bath, I’m recommending one I’ve used for years. I cook a lot of Asian food, requiring fresh spices: mustard seeds you wouldn’t believe, garam masala freshly ground, still-zinging ginger. Unfortunately, this can be lot of work – my sworn enemy. While admiring the paleo-aesthetic of the pestle and mortar, I’d struggle to powder a cinnamon stick or star anise in one. So I don’t. The blades on this electric grinder are a Zen swordsman; lethal and serene. There’s no button – I place a transparent dome over the bowl containing the spices, and press down gently, so gently, as if reassuring a chihuahua. Great forces go to work. There’s divine contrast in this airy resting of fingers on dome and the violent vortex conjured within. Lifting the lid releases a visible twine of vapour, the unfolding presence of aromatic oils; you feel yourself an alchemist, if not a demigod. In addition to blasphemous urges, the machine supplies two grinding bowls with airtight lids, doubling as storage. Good for coffee beans or extra spice mix. (I no longer store mine in unlabelled baggies, sniffed at indiscriminately, a hapless dealer high on his own asafoetida.) It’s brilliant at wet rubs and pastes, too – messing chilli, garlic and galangal with fish sauce takes no time. And the dishwashable brushed metal doesn’t taint or transfer smells. You can pulse or pulverise almonds or peppercorns in vast quantities. Celebrity husband Jay-Z has taught me that being on your grind doesn’t mean risking RSI; it’s about working smarter, not harder. Nuts to tradition: I’m grateful this device has dispatched my manual efforts to the pestle and mortuary, with a wave of its lordly hand. Let’s dance again, old friend. Just mind my nuts. Any downside? Pretty analogue by 2017 standards. I’m surprised they haven’t whacked Bluetooth on it or made a “Grinder” app where you can meet spicy strangers and discuss cumin together.

Those visible men are just the tip of the iceberg, because most cases of sexual harassment never get reported. Only 27% of people who experience sexual harassment report it, according to a survey of 1,000 adults that was conducted by YouGov in 2013, 70% said they didn’t report it and 4% of respondents “prefer not to say” (those figures don’t add up to 100 because of rounding). There should be better data than that, but sexual harassment isn’t studied in the same way as other social issues. We poll Americans day in, day out about whether they approve of a president they can’t change until next election, but rarely bother to ask them about experiences that crime data doesn’t capture. The power of the men who have been publicly accused (a list which includes Donald Trump) helps to keep their victims silent. As Lauren O’Connor explained in her 2015 memo to Weinstein Company executives: “I am a 28-year-old woman trying to make a living and a career. Harvey Weinstein is a 64-year-old, world famous man and this is his company. The balance of power is me: zero, Harvey Weinstein: 10.” Those power imbalances make anonymous surveys all the more important. We have information from the US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) that reveals a great deal about allegations of sexual harassment. But the numbers say nothing about the allegations that were never made. Here are a few things that the most recent data from the EEOC does tell us: There were 6,758 receipts of sexual harassment allegations in the US in 2016. 16.6% of those charges were filed by men. Of the cases that were settled last year (some of which were not filed in 2016), the EEOC dismissed 54% because it had “no reasonable cause to believe that discrimination occurred”. A further 23% had a result for the claimant that was deemed positive. These “favorable” outcomes include negotiated settlements, withdrawals of claims but with benefits, successful conciliations and unsuccessful conciliations (the last category means “reasonable cause” was established but there was no conciliation). The remaining 23% of sexual harassment legal claims were simply closed for administrative reasons. That so few cases result in a positive outcome for the claimant probably helps to keep much of this iceberg under water. DATA Source: YouGov/Huffington Post survey of 1,000 American adults Year: Survey was conducted August 19-20, 2013 Source: EEOC sexual harassment charges Year: FY 2010- FY 2016 DESIGN Before I start illustrating a statistic like this one, I spend some time trying to understand the visual language around these issues. I did a Google image search for the phrase “sexual harassment” and found dozens of illustrations of women being touched by men on their shoulders, breasts or rears. Those depictions didn’t seem to capture the diversity of experiences of sexual harassment. I was particularly disappointed by one illustration which showed a woman at her desk, being touched on the shoulder by a man. On her desk is a framed image which seems entirely unnecessary – it’s of another man, presumably her partner. Why does the woman’s relationship status make the sexual harassment any more wrong? Changing tack, I searched for the word “unreported” and stumbled across an image of an iceberg. It felt like the right depiction to capture the fact that so much sexual harassment goes unseen and unsaid.

Last year he launched the Democracy in Europe Movement 2025 (DiEM25). He is also the author of several books. His latest is Talking to My Daughter About the Economy. Your new book, explaining the history and iniquity of capitalism, is addressed to your 12-year-old daughter, Xenia. What did she think of it? My daughter is my worst critic, so even if she likes something I do or write she is very averse to complimenting me. In this context her words of encouragement were the best I could have hoped for. Something like: “Not too bad.” Is she interested in economics? No she’s not at all interested in economics, but she’s very much interested in politics, even though she wouldn’t call it politics. She’s interested in political issues, which have to do with feminism, racism and inequality. She would never come up with the sentence: “I’m interested in politics.” But it’s the issues that matter, not the labels. What was it like writing in relatively simple terms? Did it make you reconsider your opinions? It was simultaneously highly joyous and very demanding. It was a great joy not to have to address an audience with preconceptions, but also very challenging to try to explain capitalism without referring to capitalism. But in the end, unless you can do that, you don’t understand yourself what you’re going on about. Jargon hides incomprehension. Do you want to moderate capitalism or end it? Both. Capitalism cannot end by sheer willpower. As we all know, it was a spectacular failure of the left to try to end capitalism. Capitalism has to be moderated and stabilised, because its deep crisis, as we see today, is that it does not encourage humanism. It encourages misanthropy. We must stabilise the situation and have a discussion about how the new technologies can be put to use for humanity. You describe writing the book at your beautiful island house in Aegina with its extraordinary view of the Saronic Gulf. Would you like to see a world where individuals would not enjoy that kind of material privilege? No, I would like to live in a world where we’re all privileged, and in a sense we are because I believe beauty abounds, all around us, as long as our social circumstances allow us to enjoy it and not wreck the environment. The most important ingredient for enjoyment and appreciation is to be in control of one’s life and to be able to choose your partners, and if you do that the world looks very beautiful all around you. I think this is a privilege we can all have. You write that we do not allow ourselves to think that poverty may be the product of the same process that led to our affluence. Is your enjoyment of your privilege undermined by the knowledge that it has come at the cost of others? First, yes, absolutely right. Privilege comes at the price of exploitation. No one can have millions in the bank – not that I do – and think that they have earned it. But secondly, our next-door neighbour in Aegina is a farmer who lives a fairly subsistence kind of life and has exactly the same view. I think he’s privileged too, but in a different kind of way. Happiness is rarely a function of privilege. On DiEM25’s advisory panel is Julian Assange, an Australian who fled European law by entering the Ecuadorian embassy. Is he a fit person to advise on Europe? I’m very proud to count Julian as one of my friends. You will have noticed that the Swedish prosecutor has dropped any intention of charging him. It seems absurd that someone is deemed guilty even though no charge have been laid upon him. Julian Assange is being persecuted for a very simple reason: he embarrassed the US and the surveillance establishment. Wikileaks is a brilliant attempt to turn the mirror on Big Brother. This is why Julian is effectively incarcerated in the Ecuadorian embassy. Are we to believe his accusers were part of a conspiracy to extradite him to the US? I have no interest in speculation. What I do know is that the Swedish prosecutor never charged Julian with anything. Now the US government has explicitly stated that there is a grand jury convening in secret, all ready to request his extradition on charges of espionage. The court case will be a sham. His lawyers will not be given the charges or evidence. It will be held behind closed doors and he will disappear into a supermax prison for ever. No liberal can support this process. Do you have any relations now with your former friend, the Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras? No, because I don’t think there is anything he would have to say to me. In order to carry on doing what he does he has to keep telling himself a story that he knows deep down is baseless. So the conversation between us would be extremely brief and pointless. Do you think in his heart Jeremy Corbyn was a Remainer? I believe he was persuaded by the arguments of those like John McDonnell and myself. There is no incongruity between not wanting to enter the EU and saying that once you’re in, getting out is not a good idea. The criticism that he was not passionate about the EU is ludicrous. No one can be passionate about the EU. We criticise Europe fiercely but we’re not proposing to exit it. I think that’s the position Jeremy Corbyn converted to in the end. What else are you doing at the moment, aside from writing and DiEM25? I give some lectures for financial reasons – partly to have an income for my family, and partly to support DiEM25. It’s an amazing experience to go to Hamburg and give two lectures in one day – in the morning to 500 German bankers, and then in the evening to 1,000 DiEM25 activists. I give the same speech, more or less. When I get a fantastic reception from both these audiences I realise what a deep crisis Europe is in. It is the 100th anniversary of the Russian October Revolution. When you look at its legacy, do you think it’s worthy of celebration? Absolutely. But, of course, like every other revolution in the end it went badly wrong. The celebrations must be nuanced. It’s a dialectical process in which we celebrate and mourn at the same time.

Despite repeated promises by political parties to improve their status, she said in a speech in Westminster that many victims are left feeling like “bystanders”. Lady Newlove, whose husband Garry was fatally beaten by a teenage gang in August 2007, said that there should be a right to be informed about court dates and decisions, a right to make a personal statement at trial and a right to be consulted on conditions of the offender’s release or discharge. “I am calling for a victims’ law to make the needs and rights of victims central to the delivery of justice,” she said. “Over recent years, there has been considerable debate about putting victims at the heart of the criminal justice system. So why do victims complain that the justice system leaves them feeling like bystanders? “I’m not advocating offenders shouldn’t have rights. Neither do I accept that giving rights to victims can only be at the expense of offenders. True justice requires both offenders and victims to be given rights that guarantee both are treated fairly.” Newlove also called for victims to have the right to take part in a restorative justice programme and to have a legal right of review of decisions to drop or reduce charges against a suspect. Many victims, she said, say they feel let down by inadequate support from the criminal justice system, making it hard for them to move on with their lives. Offenders have clearly defined human rights enshrined in the European convention on human rights, Newlove said. Victims, on the other hand, only have entitlements set out in a code that lawyers tactfully describe as “persuasive guidance”. She said: “We owe it to victims to feel they’re part of a productive two-way relationship with the criminal justice system, where their experience and trauma counts. In short, we have a moral obligation to go the extra mile in supporting victims through their justice journey. “Achieving the ambition of putting victims at the heart of our criminal justice system can never be achieved without cost. But to the victims, it’s a right that is priceless.” Garry Newlove died of his injuries two days after the attack. She was given a peerage in 2010 and appointed victims commissioner two years later."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2017/oct/10/liverpool-sadio-mane-hamstring-injury-senegal-six-weeks","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-10T15:18:50Z","webTitle":"Liverpool’s Sadio Mané ruled out for up to six weeks after injuring hamstring","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/oct/10/liverpool-sadio-mane-hamstring-injury-senegal-six-weeks","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/oct/10/liverpool-sadio-mane-hamstring-injury-senegal-six-weeks","fields":{"headline":"Liverpool’s Sadio Mané ruled out for up to six weeks after injuring hamstring","bodyText":"Liverpool will hope Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain can begin to repay some of their £35m investment after Sadio Mané’s crushing injury blow. The England midfielder has endured a slow start to his Anfield career since his August move from Arsenal but following Mané’s hamstring injury – which will rule him out for around six weeks – he is likely to play a more significant role. Mané was injured on international duty with Senegal and his absence could not have come at a worse time for Jürgen Klopp with Manchester United visiting Anfield on Saturday. “The winger was substituted 89 minutes into Senegal’s 2-0 World Cup qualifying win over the Cape Verde Islands on Saturday,” a Liverpool statement read. “It has now been confirmed that he picked up an injury during that fixture that could keep him out of action for up to six weeks.” Mané, who scored 13 Premier League goals last season despite missing the whole of January because of the Africa Cup of Nations and the final six weeks of the campaign with a knee injury, has three in four league matches. The injury to Liverpool’s most influential player has come at a particularly bad time with Adam Lallana still struggling to regain fitness after a thigh injury. Lallana has been sent to the Aspetar sports clinic in Qatar as he continues his rehabilitation and is likely to return in mid-November, along with Mané who will miss the two Champions League games against Maribor and trips to Tottenham and West Ham, as well the visit of Huddersfield Town. Liverpool will still hope to have Mané in contention for their key European date in Sevilla on 21 November before they host Chelsea four days later in the Premier League. Klopp’s side have struggled without Mané, since his move from Southampton, averaging 2.2 Premier League goals with him in the team, compared to 1.6 goals in his absence. Last season, their form fell away dramatically while Mané was at the Africa Cup of Nations, winning just one of their seven games, against League Two Plymouth in an FA Cup replay."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"fashion/2017/oct/27/beauty-roadtest-products-for-oily-skin","type":"article","sectionId":"fashion","sectionName":"Fashion","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-27T07:30:23Z","webTitle":"Beauty roadtest: products for oily skin","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2017/oct/27/beauty-roadtest-products-for-oily-skin","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/fashion/2017/oct/27/beauty-roadtest-products-for-oily-skin","fields":{"headline":"Beauty roadtest: products for oily skin","bodyText":"Throughout my acne-riddled teenage years, my skincare routine was a cycle of bewilderment and exasperation. I conceded defeat to the constellations of spots across my face. But now in my 20s, in a job that relies on my face not looking its worst, the laissez-faire attitude I had has gone. Activated charcoal products have been a dependable oil-banishing addition to my washbag for years. Using carbon that has been treated to increase its absorbency, they claim to attract dirt and oil like a magnet – unclogging pores and dispelling acne. But do they work? L’Oréal Men Expert Pure Power Charcoal Face Wash (£6.35) is effective at stripping away grease, although the wash can be rather harsh and leaves skin feeling dry, so it would be best coupled with a good moisturiser. A much milder cleanse, Clinique For Men Charcoal Face Wash (£18) may not deliver an immediate sense of oil-relief, but after a few weeks my skin felt well-balanced and not at all dehydrated. The facial sponge has long been a skincare staple in Asia, gently buffing away dead skin cells. Konjac Facial Puff Sponge With Bamboo Charcoal (£8.99) is a neutralising, all-natural exfoliator. A week with the sponge revealed that I am an impatient scrubber who has no time for gentle exfoliation.

By the time the attack was uncovered, it had been active “for more than a year”, Proofpoint said, having already “exposed millions of potential victims in the US, Canada, the UK, and Australia” to malware by pretending to be software updates to popular browsers. Although Pornhub, the world’s largest pornography site with 26bn yearly visits according to data from ranking firm Alexa, and its advertising network have shut down the infection pathway, the attack is still ongoing on other sites. The hack was carried out by a group known as KovCoreG, Proofpoint said, who hoped to infect users with an ad fraud malware known as Kovter. This type of malicious software is traditionally used as a form of online advertising fraud to generate money through clicks on fake adverts. In this particular attack, visitors to Pornhub were redirected to a website which claimed to be offering a software update for their web browser, including Chrome and Firefox, or to the Adobe Flash plugin. If they downloaded and opened the file it installed Kovter, taking over their machine and using it to click on fake adverts. Those fake clicks then generated real money for the websites the adverts are hosted on - typically spam-filled sites no normal user would ever visit. “While the payload in this case is ad fraud malware, it could just as easily have been ransomware, an information stealer, or any other malware,” Proofpoint said. “Regardless, threat actors are following the money and looking to more effective combinations of social engineering, targeting and pre-filtering to infect new victims at scale.” Pornhub did not reply to a request for comment. Malvertising campaigns are a popular way for malware authors to spread their infections, said Javvad Malik, security advocate at AlienVault. “In 2016, Google removed 112m bad ads which aside from malware, included illegal product promotion and misleading ads,” he said. “The issue being that there are insufficient controls to place an advert with an ad network, making it far easier to get a malicious app accepted by an official app store. This has led to an upturn in the number of reputable organisations distributing malvertising.” Mark James, a security specialist at IT firm ESET, said that Pornhub was likely a preferred target for the bad actors. “The audience is possibly less likely to have security in place or active as people’s perception is that it’s already a dark place to surf,” he said. “Also, the user may be less likely to call for help and try to click through any popups or install any software themselves, not wanting others to see their browsing habits.” Major sites including New York Times and BBC hit by ‘ransomware’ malvertising"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"science/2017/oct/16/astronomers-witness-neutron-stars-collide-global-rapid-response-event-ligo","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-16T14:00:11Z","webTitle":"New frontier for science as astronomers witness neutron stars colliding","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/oct/16/astronomers-witness-neutron-stars-collide-global-rapid-response-event-ligo","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2017/oct/16/astronomers-witness-neutron-stars-collide-global-rapid-response-event-ligo","fields":{"headline":"New frontier for science as astronomers witness neutron stars colliding","bodyText":"The collision of a pair of neutron stars, marked by ripples through the fabric of space-time and a flash brighter than a billion suns, has been witnessed for the first time in the most intensely observed astronomical event to date. The extraordinary sequence, in which the two ultra-dense stars spiralled inwards, violently collided and, in all likelihood, immediately collapsed into a black hole, was first picked up by the US-based Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (Ligo). As its twin detectors, in Louisiana and Washington state, picked up tremors in space-time that had spilled out from the merger 130m light years away, an alert went out to astronomers across the globe. Within hours, 70 space- and ground-based telescopes swivelled to observe the red-tinged afterglow, making it the first cosmic event to be “seen” in both gravitational waves and light. Dave Reitze, executive director of Ligo, said: “What is amazing about this discovery is it is the first time we’ve got a full picture of one of the most violent, cataclysmic events in the universe. This is the most intense observational campaign there has ever been.” Einstein first predicted the existence of gravitational waves a century ago, but the first experimental proof that space itself can be stretched and squeezed took until 2015, when Ligo scientists detected a collision of black holes. But this dark merger, and the three detected since, were invisible to conventional telescopes. This time, as the stars collided, they emitted an intense beam of gamma rays and the sky was showered with heavy elements, resolving a decades-old debate about where gold and platinum come from. Neutron stars are the smallest, densest stars known to exist: about 12 miles wide, with a teaspoon of neutron star material having a mass of about a billion tons. The core is a soup of pure neutrons, while the crust is smooth, solid and 10 billion times stronger than steel. The 100-second hum picked up by Ligo told the story of how the two stars, each slightly heavier than the sun, approached their death. Initially separated by 200 miles, they circled each other 30 times a second. As they whirled inwards, accelerating to 2,000 orbits each second, the signal rose in pitch like a slide whistle. Two seconds later, Nasa’s Fermi space telescope picked up an intense burst of gamma rays, emitted as shockwaves rushed through jets of matter funnelled out of the poles during the monumental impact of the collision. What happened next is uncertain. A neutron star weighing more than twice the mass of the sun (the combined mass here) has never been seen before – but neither has a black hole so small. Theoretical predictions suggest an almost instantaneous gravitational collapse into a black hole is most likely. “Neutron stars are at this sweet spot between a star and a black hole,” said Prof Andreas Freise, a Ligo project scientist at the University of Birmingham. “When two of them collide, we expect them to immediately collapse into a black hole, leaving behind a bit of dust and stuff.” David Shoemaker, spokesman for the Ligo Scientific Collaboration, said: “It’s [probably] the first observation of a black hole being created where there was none before, which is pretty darn cool.” The observations herald a new era of rapid-response astronomy, in which transient and unexpected cosmic events can be observed in detail for the first time. When Ligo’s software picked up a signal at 1:41pm UK time on 17 August, Shoemaker was one of a small team at Ligo to be alerted by a ringtone on his phone reserved for when black holes or neutron stars collide. “My phone went off and I smiled,” he said. Within an hour, the detection had been confirmed by Virgo, a European gravitational wave detector near Pisa, the source of the signal had been triangulated to a small patch of sky and a global alert was triggered. Prof Stephen Smartt, of Queen’s University Belfast, was leading a five-day observation run of supernovae on the New Technology Telescope at La Silla, Chile, when the news came in. “We dropped everything and pointed at that bit of sky,” he said. “This was the most unusual object we’d ever seen.” Smartt’s team, and those on other telescopes, observed the faint new blob and measured its spectrum to assess the chemical composition. The blob was a fireball of radioactive heavy chemical elements, known as a kilonova, that had been blown out from the collision at one fifth of the speed of light shortly after the gamma ray burst. Previously, scientists had speculated that the sheer force of neutron star collisions would be enough to force extra neutrons into the nuclei of atoms, forging heavy elements like gold and platinum, but until now this idea was purely theoretical. “People have been looking for that forever,” said Freise. “This is the first real confirmation that heavy elements such as gold, platinum and uranium are either solely or predominantly produced in binary neutron star collisions,” said Reitze. “The wedding band on your finger or the gold watch you’re wearing was most likely produced a billion years ago by two neutron stars colliding. That’s pretty cool.” Earlier this month, three US scientists who played a crucial role in the development of Ligo were awarded the Nobel prize in physics for the first detection of gravitational waves. Shoemaker pointed out that two of the new laureates – and others – had been working on the project long before it captured the world’s attention “This kind of thing doesn’t happen because there are suddenly neat instruments,” he said. “It’s decades of work and people working together in a collaborative way. It’s quite phenomenal.” The findings were published on Monday in a series of papers in journals including Science, Nature and Physics Review Letters."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2017/oct/11/google-and-facebook-to-be-asked-to-pay-to-help-tackle-cyberbullying","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-11T07:42:02Z","webTitle":"Google and Facebook to be asked to pay to help UK tackle cyberbullying","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/oct/11/google-and-facebook-to-be-asked-to-pay-to-help-tackle-cyberbullying","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2017/oct/11/google-and-facebook-to-be-asked-to-pay-to-help-tackle-cyberbullying","fields":{"headline":"Google and Facebook to be asked to pay to help UK tackle cyberbullying","bodyText":"Internet companies such as Google and Facebook are to be asked to pay for measures to combat and raise awareness about online bullying and other web dangers, under a UK government internet safety strategy outlined on Wednesday. The proposed voluntary levy on social media firms and other leading web players is among a series of measures in an internet safety green paper, the product of a consultation process announced in February. A press release about the green paper – the culture department did not release the full document in advance – said the levy would target issues such as cyberbullying, online abuse and children being exposed to pornography on the internet. The paper also proposes a so-called social media code of practice to boost efforts to combat online bullying, intimidation or humiliation, and an annual “internet safety transparency report” to show progress on such issues. Another plan would involve supporting tech startups to build internet safety into their products from the beginning. However, all the measures would be voluntary and would involve persuading tech giants to move some of their existing awareness and enforcement programmes on to a more centralised basis. If companies refuse to take part, it is understood ministers would consider a legislative approach, but there are as yet no plans as to how this could happen. The culture secretary, Karen Bradley, defended the decision to make the levy voluntary, after the Conservative manifesto had promised legal powers to enforce a levy on internet companies. Speaking to BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, she said: “I don’t rule out legislating if that’s what we need to do but I’m hoping to do it working with the the companies. “We are concluding on how best we do it. Taking legislation through the House of Commons and Lords is not the easiest way to do it.” She added: “It’s not backing away at all. It’s saying what is the best way to do this.” Bradley insisted a non-legislative route was “quicker, more effective, and gets a better result for everybody.” She hinted that the government could change the status of social media companies to make them publishers rather than platforms, which could mean greater regulation of their content. “Legally they are mere conduits but we are looking at their role and their responsibilities and we are looking at what their status should be. They are not legally publishers at this stage but we are looking at these issues,” she said. The green paper will flesh out existing plans for relationship and sex education in schools to be extended to include ideas about online safety, and encouragement for social media firms to better promote their web safety plans. Research carried out by a team of academics for the green paper found that almost 20% of 12- to 15-year-olds had in the last year encountered something online that they found “worrying or nasty in some way”. Bradley said that although the internet was a huge force for good, “it has caused undeniable suffering and can be an especially harmful place for children and vulnerable people”. She said: “Behaviour that is unacceptable in real life is unacceptable on a computer screen. We need an approach to the internet that protects everyone without restricting growth and innovation in the digital economy. “Our ideas are ambitious – and rightly so. Collaboratively, government, industry, parents and communities can keep citizens safe online, but only by working together.” Tom Watson, the Labour deputy leader, said: “Everyone agrees on the need to deal with abusive and harmful content online. Parents worry about what their children see on the internet, and too many people experience cyberbullying and online intimidation. “We’re pleased the government has accepted Labour’s call for compulsory sex and relationship education in schools, including online safety education, as well as for codes of practice for social media companies to prevent abuse. “But this announcement is short on detail. The government needs to say more about who exactly will pay the proposed levy, how much they will pay and how it will be spent. And they need to explain what transparency information they will be asking social media companies to provide.” The Liberal Democrats said the plans amounted to little more than “scapegoating and castigating internet firms” and would achieve little. The party’s home affairs spokesman, Ed Davey, said: “We must make the internet a much safer place, particularly for young people, but that means the hard graft of better education on digital, faster problem-reporting and stronger partnerships with industry. “Regrettably, this government is still in the blame game, scapegoating and castigating internet firms and failing to see the huge economic benefits of investing in better digital education. Hopefully this green paper will be the last of the weak policy reheats and signal the start of real hard work on this issue.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"fashion/2017/oct/10/new-age-earring-celine-bigger","type":"article","sectionId":"fashion","sectionName":"Fashion","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-10T17:12:19Z","webTitle":"Drop-down gorgeous: the new age of the earring","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2017/oct/10/new-age-earring-celine-bigger","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/fashion/2017/oct/10/new-age-earring-celine-bigger","fields":{"headline":"Drop-down gorgeous: the new age of the earring","bodyText":"A naked earlobe now is like leaving your phone at home – an all-day type of fail. Earrings – once the garnish of an outfit – are now the main course, or make that the dessert you get to skip straight to. To be clear, we’re not talking about an inoffensive stud that would pass a dress-code test in the City. The earrings that matter now are the kind that start conversations. Get used to lobe ache as normal service. For examples of conversation earrings, you could check out the catwalk – beetles at Gucci, twig-like strands at Louis Vuitton, triangular at Céline, red and squiggly at Emporio Armani. But, crucially, they are also appearing on the front row, fashion’s petri dish of trends. Look at the catwalk and think “fantasy”. Look at the women in the front row – the ones that, in theory anyway, also have real jobs, play-date schedules and WhatsApp dinner groups to manage – and it’s that little bit more relatable. The players here are all upping their earring game. Yasmin Sewell, the new vice-president of style and creative at e-tailer Farfetch, has some delicious olive earrings, and is wearing a great pair of gold zigzag ones in her bio on Instagram. Influencer Pandora Sykes had bright blue beaded numbers that look like something Frida Kahlo might wear. Vanessa Kingori, who will be Vogue’s publisher next year, has a nice line in classy-looking crystal earrings, while Caroline de Maigret’s topaz ones at Chanel were dreamy. Earrings are, of course, Instagram catnip. Tilly Macalister-Smith, an ex-Vogue staffer now based in New York, started her Instagram account Ear After Ear in 2016 to document fashion’s rediscovery of the earring. It may sound niche, but it’s actually engrossing – and increasingly required – viewing. The emergence of earrings as big news again in fashion was kickstarted last year with huge hoops at Céline and the “face” earrings at JW Anderson. For SS18, they were at Topshop and Burberry – the diamante single earrings are already on wishlists even if they’re not available until next year. But they have had other fashion moments: if the 60s were a golden age of the earring (see Edie Sedgewick or Nina Simone), the 80s were a highpoint, too: with Pat Butcher’s gobstoppers and Joan Collins’ crystal numbers ruling teatime telly, that was the last time big earrings were, well, this big. We’re now in the third age of the earring. Ruby Chadwick, a jewellery buyer at Liberty, says earrings make up 30% of the department’s sales, up on the previous year. She explains that this comes from reframing the idea of statement earrings – and the realisation that bigger face furniture means the opportunity to dial down the outfit effort. “It’s a definite way to dress an outfit up without being too much,” she says. “In winter it’s a great add-on to a jumper and boots that we all go to.” One of the most popular brands is Mounser, which produces sculptural earrings in silver and gold that fall just above the shoulder. “People are being a lot braver with things,” says Chadwick. “It [the earring trend] has become a lot more entrenched, a lot more people are doing it so it doesn’t feel so unusual.” Indeed, Ivanka Trump is doing statement earrings, but even that hasn’t managed to put fashionable people off yet. To subtly distance yourself from a Trumpian White House look, however, just make sure your earrings are never combined with a blowdry. To do woke earrings, the choices are a messy-hair-don’t-care situation (see Mica Argañaraz at Saint Laurent), or pared-back with short hair (Lineisy Montero at Burberry) or a simple ponytail . “I am loving hair really pared back with an amazing earring that does the talking,” says Chadwick. Also go minimal with the makeup: “I think instead of a lipstick, people are leading with an earring.” Colour is also something to consider. Chadwick recommends doing a Colour Me Beautiful on your own wardrobe: the colours that suit you in clothing will probably do the same when transferred to your jewellery box. I love a big earring and have four pairs of hot pink ones – as someone with dark hair, dark eyes and olive skin, bright pink suits me. Ruby Chadwick recommends yellow gold as a shade that suits pretty much everyone. I would add that a pair of yellow gold hoops are the universal entry-level earring. Mine have a 4cm drop and are beveled to add a bit of extra sparkle. Try those out for size, but be warned – the earring game can be addictive. It will only be a matter of time before you’re wearing proper conversation-starters."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"global/2017/oct/17/good-to-meet-you-nancy-arms","type":"article","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"Global","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-17T10:59:03Z","webTitle":"Good to meet you ...

I have always respected her intelligent and humorous opinion on many things, but particularly her outsider’s perspective on America. Around the time it became apparent that Donald Trump was serious about running, we got together for lunch. We ruminated about how nothing was really clear, “but one thing is for certain,” she said, “it will be bad.” I told her that frequently the news overwhelmed me, but I wanted to be informed, that it was going to be more important than ever to be a citizen who participated. She said she listened to National Public Radio a bit, and also subscribed to the Guardian Weekly. Between the two sources, she felt like she was getting a good worldview, without a lot of the poison that distracts us from the meat of the story. Within a week of Trump’s election, the crap faucet turned on full blast. It was hard to even understand what was going on among the media speculation and the outrage. That week I quit Facebook and subscribed to the Guardian Weekly.

And today, Harvey Weinstein was fired from the Weinstein company.” “Some of the details of what Weinstein did are pretty terrible,” Colbert said. “For example he apparently required some female employees to be present while he bathed. But that is nothing compared to this next one: a local reporter in New York said Weinstein forced her to watch him masturbate into a potted plant.” “If you ever have dinner at Harvey Weinstein’s house, avoid the fresh basil,” Colbert quipped. “This is monstrous behavior that in a just world would not have been allowed to go on for decades,” the host continued. “It is indefensible. Weinstein immediately defended it, saying, ‘I came of age in the 60s and 70s, when all the rules about behavior and workplaces were different.’ Weinstein’s lawyers called him an ‘old dinosaur learning new ways’.” “A, that’s no excuse,” Colbert replied. “B, dinosaurs did not touch themselves in front of employees. The T rex’s arms were way too short.” Jimmy Kimmel also weighed in on the report about Weinstein’s continued abuse of the women with whom he worked. Donald Trump Jr, the president’s son, tweeted at Kimmel this week inquiring about whether or not any late-night television hosts would address the allegations against Weinstein, a noted democratic donor who gave money to the Hillary Clinton campaign. “There was an exposé in the New York Times about decades of sexual harassment accusations made against the movie producer Harvey Weinstein,” Kimmel began, before detailing his Twitter spat with the president’s son, in which Kimmel replied with a video of Trump’s own infamous statement, in last year’s Access Hollywood tape, about routinely sexually harassing women. “The insinuation was that we as part of the biased leftwing media propaganda machine wouldn’t say anything about him because he’s a Democrat,” Kimmel said. “Never mind the thousands of jokes about Bill Cosby and Bill Clinton and all the other Bill’s of that ilk.” “Note to DJTJ, next time you’re defending your father and you think it’s a good idea to draw a comparison between him and a sexual predator, don’t,” Kimmel quipped. “I did promise a Harvey Weinstein joke,” he continued. “What’s the difference between Harvey Weinstein and the Pillsbury doughboy? When the Pillsbury doughboy offers you a roll, he doesn’t ask you to watch him take a shower for it.” Finally, Seth Meyers invited the women of his writing staff on the show to share their thoughts about Weinstein and the statement he released after the Times’ report was published. “It was revealed that famous Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein has been sexually harassing women and then paying them to keep quiet about,” Meyers began. “And as stunning as the allegation are, equally stunning was the apology that Weinstein issued after the article was published. Here to comment are three of our writers: Amber, Ally and Jenny.” “We want to start by applauding the women who went on the record to detail Harvey Weinstein’s terrible behavior,” one began. “So far we know Weinstein reached cash settlements with eight women, and where there are eight, there are always more.” The Late Night writers continued: “And whatever details you hear just know that means there are worse details we haven’t heard. In his apology, he blamed disrespect of women on growing up in the 60s and 70s, which would be a good excuse if he came to the present via time machine. Did he not notice things have been changing over the past 50 years?” “To make matters worse, he said he was going to go after the NRA and Trump, as if our shared politics makes his sexual assault OK,” one continued, before mocking Weinstein’s deflections. “‘Hey, I saw a guy masturbate into a plant, but it was OK because he was wearing a Planned Parenthood button.’” “When he got busted, Weinstein said ‘to make up for it, I’m starting a scholarship for women directors,’” the writers continued. “That’s just him being around more women. That’s not the solution, that’s the problem. Every woman in the American workforce has been harassed at some point. Whether it’s physical harassment or passing inappropriate comments, this is something women deal with every day.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"politics/2017/oct/10/home-office-increase-staff-brexit-mps","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-10T16:34:59Z","webTitle":"Home Office needs big increase in staff to deal with Brexit, MPs are told","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/oct/10/home-office-increase-staff-brexit-mps","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/oct/10/home-office-increase-staff-brexit-mps","fields":{"headline":"Home Office needs big increase in staff to deal with Brexit, MPs are told","bodyText":"The Home Office will not be able to meet the challenges of Brexit without “a considerable increase in resources” over and above its current 6,500 staff, two former senior immigration officials have told MPs. David Wood, the former head of Home Office immigration enforcement, told MPs at the Commons home affairs select committee, when asked directly by the chair, Yvette Cooper: “With current resources the challenges of Brexit cannot be met, certainly not smoothly.” Wood recalled the recent £100m cut to the UK Borders Agency budget, and warned that it would take at least six months to recruit and train new border officers. His judgment was supported by John Vine, the former chief inspector of borders and immigration, who told the MPs that a 10% error rate in “hostile environment” cases in which people had been denied bank or building society accounts was “a troubling percentage” and highlighted how complex decisions on immigration had “direct consequences for people living in our communities”. Vine added that it was not just about recruiting extra staff; they had to have the rights skills and be properly trained if quality error-free decisions were to be made. He warned the select committee that the post-Brexit registration of 3.6 million European Union citizens living in UK had “to be done properly” if they were to continue to feel part of society. The committee also heard a call from a leading Tory Brexiter MP, Christopher Chope, for the registration of EU nationals in Britain to start immediately using existing EU powers. Wood told MPs that there was “a vacuum of knowledge” in relation to contingency planning by the Home Office in the event of no deal, but both he and Vine warned that “a considerable increase” in border force staff would be needed to carry out the required customs checks if Britain ended up outside the EU customs union. The Home Office has said EU nationals living in Britain will have a period of grace to register and apply for “settled status” after Brexit in March 2019, but will have to pass a five-year residence test, as well as criminality and identity checks. Wood admitted that the current immigration visa system was dealing with 40-60 cases a day and had only minutes to decide applications: “It is a sausage factory with low-grade staffing. That is the problem,” said the former immigration enforcement head, adding that without the resources to cope the well-publicised errors would only be compounded. Both former senior immigration officials expressed the hope that the Home Office would use the opportunity of developing a new immigration system post-Brexit that included EU nationals to start afresh and consistently apply the rules at both the border and in issuing visas in advance. Wood suggested that newly available exit data should be used to introduce a differential visa system with “lighter touch” and less expensive visas for those nationalities with a good compliance rate. Both were also optimistic that technology could help with some of the problems of added pressure at the UK border after Brexit and could help avoid the imposition of a “hard border” with the Republic of Ireland. This could include the advanced online declaration of goods in the event of not remaining within the EU customs union."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2017/oct/12/saziso-at-least-wave-your-handkerchief-at-me-review-virtuoso-world-music","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-12T17:15:09Z","webTitle":"Saz'iso: At Least Wave Your Handkerchief at Me review – virtuoso world music","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/oct/12/saziso-at-least-wave-your-handkerchief-at-me-review-virtuoso-world-music","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2017/oct/12/saziso-at-least-wave-your-handkerchief-at-me-review-virtuoso-world-music","fields":{"headline":"Saz'iso: At Least Wave Your Handkerchief at Me review – virtuoso world music","bodyText":"Exponents of unfamiliar styles need all the help they can get, and this virtuoso group from the mountains of southern Albania has deserved celebrity backing.

Saz’iso play saze, a style that developed when iso-polyphonic a cappella folk songs, with at least two melody lines and drone backing, were matched against violin, clarinet, lute and percussion.

The second series of ITV’s Victoria duly applies The Crown formula (basically a narrative of female self-determination v stuck-in-a-rut patriarchy) to the 19th-century monarch to impressive avail, albeit with a slightly soapier, Downton quality. Tonight’s final episode puts a droop in Albert’s moustache, when politics create tension between him and the queen. John Robinson The Last Post 9pm, BBC1 It’s Christmas in Aden, but it’s not all mulled wine, eggnog and chunky sweaters. Particularly the sweaters – it’s roasting. Markham is perturbed by some of the pictures wily photojournalist Martha took while on patrol with them, and fears any ensuing scandal could play into the insurgents’ hands. Off he sends Joe to retrieve them, but that just ends up getting steamy. Talking of which, Armstrong continues his possibly dangerous dalliance with Yusra. Ben Arnold Louis Theroux: Dark States – Trafficking Sex 9pm, BBC2 In the second of his grim but wholly watchable series, Theroux looks at sex trafficking. He travels to Houston, Texas, where prostitution is especially rife. He interviews, among others, Nikki, a sex worker who refers to her pimp as “Daddy” but is terrified when she realises she has mislaid her previous night’s takings. He also talks to an unrepentant pimp imprisoned for trafficking a 15-year-old. Theroux’s avuncular manner is sorely tested. David Stubbs Electric Dreams: Real Life 9pm, Channel 4 Is futuristic policewoman “Sarah” (Anna Paquin) actually grieving widower George (Terrence Howard), escaping into a character via a VR headset? (Who wouldn’t want to be “a lesbian supercop with a flying car”?) Or is “George” just a masochistic fantasy for Sarah – who unconsciously wants to be punished? Loosely adapted from Philip K Dick’s short Exhibit Piece, another woozy, Borgesian investigation into the nature of reality and identity. Ali Catterall Snowfall 10pm, BBC2 London-born Damson Idris is the latest I-can’t-believe-he’s-a-Brit actor in American television. He plays up-and-coming South Central dealer Franklin Saint in this crack-cocaine origin story from Boyz N the Hood’s John Singleton. What gets high must come down, and this week Franklin sees the darker side of his lucrative new venture. Snowfall is an undeniable flurry of historical detail, but character development can get lost in the storm. Ellen E Jones The Gifted 9pm, Fox The X-Men spinoff about a family on the run from a sinister anti-mutant agency barrels onwards. With straight-arrow dad Reed in the hands of Sentinel Services and trouble-magnet Lorna in prison, stressed mom Caitlin (the plausibly plucky Amy Acker) has to team up with bright spark Marcos for a perilous mercy mission. Likable performances, the quicksilver pace and inventive special effects all help offset some occasionally clunky scripting. Graeme Virtue The Secret Life of the Ballroom 8pm, W With the figurative last waltz an episode away, this penultimate instalment follows preparations for the competition’s first waltz. After two wins from four competitions thus far, Mike and Donna can afford to feel bullish, but as the fifth approaches circumstances separate them, affecting preparations. Laura is also facing a struggle towards competitive action, a foot injury hobbling chances for her and Ben as they seek their first win. Mark Gibbings-Jones Film choices Antz, (Eric Darnell, Tim Johnson, 1998), 2.30pm, Channel 4 This DreamWorks animated blockbuster starts hilariously, with the Woody Allen-voiced Z-4195 on the psychiatrist’s leaf wandering if there’s more to life than being a worker ant. There is: romance with Princess Bala (Sharon Stone), while war with the termites is just around the corner. The subterranean colouring is a little grungy, but with Sly Stallone as a soldier ant, it’s inspired fun. Paul Howlett Cuban Fury, (James Griffiths, 2014), 11.15pm, Film4 Nick Frost is office worker Bruce Garrett, seeking redemption on the dancefloor. He tucked away his sequins years ago after being bullied at school, but dusts them down when the new boss (Rashida Jones) he’s fallen for turns out to be a salsa fan. Frost doesn’t quite convince as a dancer but he’s a nimble comedian, and there’s plenty of support from a vibrant cast. Paul Howlett Possession, (Neil LaBute, 2002), 11.30pm, BBC1 Like The French Lieutenant’s Woman this is a time-travelling romance, with two modern-day academics. Gung-ho American Aaron Eckhart and cool Brit Gwyneth Paltrow delve into the secret lives of a Victorian poet (Jennifer Ehle) and her married lover (Jeremy Northam). The modern tale is a flimsy thing compared to the beautifully performed period piece in a flawed but interesting adaptation of AS Byatt’s 1990 Booker prize-winning novel.

It is in that light that we should view Theresa May’s unveiling of the latest race equality audit, with the accompanying website. Information is power. We can whinge to the point of saturation about individual disproportions in schools, or health, or policing or housing, but the big picture is much more powerful. That’s why those who fare quite well from inequality didn’t really want us to see it. We knew it would be grisly. But not as unsightly as this. We know black pupils are permanently excluded from school three times as often as white British pupils. Why is that? That at key stage 2, 71% of Chinese primary school pupils met the standard for reading, writing and maths, but just 54% of white British pupils and 13% of white Gypsy and Roma pupils did. How’s that explained? That Dorset police were seven times more likely to arrest black people last year than Essex. That in Stockport’s primary schools fewer than a quarter of black 11-year-olds reached the required standard in reading and maths, while in Sunderland the figure was more than three-quarters. What happens in Sunderland that doesn’t in Stockport? If we are serious about fairness – about the one-nation part of one-nation Toryism – isn’t it about time we had transparent stats to work with? There will be griping. Already from the right, accusations that May is surrendering to the antiracist lobby and encouraging a grievance culture. Moans from Munira Mirza, former adviser to and loyalist of Boris Johnson, he who so memorably described our piccaninny smiles. Risible. This is a well-trodden path. Minorities who say things should be fairer are uppity, women who claim their rights are strident. Rare is the group advantaged that gives it up easily. An audit is clearly not the same as action. But it provides a basis on which to demand action. And as owners of this data, ministers can’t plead ignorance. There’s a lesson that, in post-Brexit Britain and Trump’s America, should already be apparent. Social advance is never set in stone. Progress can be erased. That’s why, if equality of opportunity is to be a priority – as all the major parties promise – this audit information needs to be collated, updated and kept out there, front and centre. Faiza Shaheen: It’s not just race, it’s class – look at the top of the Tory party Every time new data is published on racial disparities I get into futile debates about whether it is an issue of race or class. These people need to look up a term: intersectionality. It may be wonky but the concept reminds us that it is not about either/or – it is about both. The issue of racism cannot be separated from others of classism, sexism and so on, because these systems of oppression are intimately linked. Take the issue of the disproportionate number of people of colour in lower-paid jobs. Does their income level make it simply about class, or does their race at least partly explain why they are more likely to find themselves in these jobs in the first place? The statistics that show graduates from ethnic minority communities are less likely to get jobs than their white counterparts indicate that racial discrimination seems to be present. On the flipside, if you just deal with racial discrimination but not the issue of economic inequality, you end up only equalising misery across the ethnic groups and keeping the class hierarchy in place. There is something fishy about the way in which some of these statistics are reported. There is a disparity in educational outcomes for white children against black children on free school meals, partly explained by the huge improvement in London schools, but the differences between ethnicities in the same class are tiny compared with the differences between the richest and the worst-off. When working on a BBC documentary about whether the UK will ever see a black prime minister, we found that a white state-educated child was 12 times more likely to make it than a black state-educated child, but the real difference was a white privately educated child who was 90 times more likely. Maybe the first thing the Conservative party should do to understand this data is to examine the class and race makeup of their own political party and start joining the dots. Kehinde Andrews: Tokenism at its worst, from a government that doesn’t actually care This audit is the worst kind of token gesture, made by a government that has no interest in addressing the systematic racial injustice. From the beginning it was an exercise in futility, gathering data that we already have to tell a story we are all well aware of. Racial inequality is as British as a cup of tea, and if the government did not know the scale of the problem before the audit then we should dissolve parliament immediately on the grounds of incompetence. Rather than address the problem of racism the government is using the report as a symbolic exercise to show ministers care. They don’t. Theresa May has been part of a government that has made almost every indicator of racial equality worse over the past seven years. Even the minimal efforts on stop and search were mostly superficial, publishing the stats but not really addressing the issue. Stop and search rates remain disproportionately high, and the underlying problem of ethnic minority communities and the criminal injustice system remains exactly the same. Austerity also hit these communities the hardest, while running down sectors such as education that are supposedly meant to address inequality. The attack on public sector jobs has been particularly damaging to black communities who rely on the state for careers due to severe employment discrimination. As home secretary, May presided over one of the most racist periods of Britain’s migration policy, with “Go Home” vans, mass deportations and a willingness to let black bodies drown in the Mediterranean as a deterrent. It is offensive that this same prime minister and her government are using a completely empty gesture to burnish their racial justice credentials. The report is not welcome, and is actually a backward step in addressing the serious issues that Britain faces as a nation. Dawn Foster: Why does it take a shock at the polls to wake the Tories up? It’s no surprise that the only thing capable of making Conservatives worry about race is a shock at the polls, with the Tories finding their base is whiter than ever. And the findings will be no shock to anyone living in modern Britain. Prior to austerity, inequality was a persistent issue, with race, class and gender often combining to further impede people’s life chances. In the UK where you are born and who you are born to still matters more than however much effort you put in, or your core aptitude. The Conservative mantra has always been that we live in a meritocracy, and the grafters will rise to the top: at last week’s party conference the merchandise stall stocked tea towels and mugs with a portrait of John Major and the slogan: “What does the Conservative party offer a working-class kid from Brixton? They made him prime minister.” It’s a comforting image, that handily sidesteps the nagging fact that Major remains an outlier: parliament is still disproportionately male and pale. Meritocracy comforts people, because accepting that some people have it easier than others dims the gleam from your own achievements. No one thinks they’ve had it easy, but it shouldn’t be so difficult to accept that in a country as socially divided as Britain, many people overcome far more barriers than others to reach similar positions. In Brixton a few years ago on Christmas Day I sat in a soup kitchen with homeless men, but also many local working-class kids, whose parents struggled to put a Christmas dinner on the table and were relying on charity to feed them on a day of celebration. Government cuts are worsening conditions and life chances for millions: housing costs, benefit sanctions and in-work poverty are making people’s lives a misery around the UK, and the cuts fall disproportionately on women and specific ethnic groups. The poorer educational outcomes for white working-class kids aren’t a surprise: schools are struggling to retain teachers and fund basics such as glue sticks. Teachers talk of children coming to school hungry, and holiday hunger is straining food banks that are already inundated. Children can’t learn while distracted by hunger in schools that are struggling to function financially. And what comes after school? In post-industrial towns, forgotten economically, it’s low-paid, insecure work if you can’t make it to university, and increasingly, even if you do graduate. Inequality this deep shouldn’t affect a country as rich as Britain, but for as long as we cling to the idea that anyone can succeed with enough persistence, we will continue to ignore the social and economic barriers caused by cuts to public services and a socially divided education system."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"environment/2017/oct/23/tim-flachs-endangered-species-in-pictures","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-23T16:58:46Z","webTitle":"Tim Flach's endangered species – in pictures","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/oct/23/tim-flachs-endangered-species-in-pictures","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/oct/23/tim-flachs-endangered-species-in-pictures","fields":{"headline":"Tim Flach's endangered species – in pictures","bodyText":"Tim Flach sees his Hasselblad H4D-60 camera as a means to its end: capturing the character and emotions of an animal. Until now his interest has been in the way humans shape animals, but in his new book, Endangered, he poses the question of what these animals, and their potential disappearance, mean to us. Twenty months of shooting and six months of assembling has resulted in a collection of more than 180 pictures. “In some cases we put up a black background in a zoo or a natural reserve, in others it meant being underwater with hippos or great white sharks.” On his homepage, Flach namechecks his photographic idols like Irving Penn or Guy Bourdin but also Picasso. Understanding the picture and its protagonists seem more important to him than the technical circumstances that led to the picture. The photographs cover diverse themes around the topic of threatened ecosystems and species. Among the latter are well-known ones like the extinct passenger pigeon, rediscovered species like the Lord Howe Island stick insect, or the last of their kind, like the northern white rhinoceros. “I wanted an array of endangered species which represented various aspects, some better and some lesser known,” Flach says. “I went to pursue the rare Saiga antelope and visited their habitat by the Caspian Sea during the summer, waiting in a hideout close to where they go to drink. But then I realised the weather conditions were so extreme that the heat had distorted the pictures. So we went back in the winter when it was -30C and I was lying down on the ground in camouflage for three days using the longest possible lens, and finally got the shot.” Saiga antelopes cannot be maintained in zoos because their bones are so light that they would crash in a transport container. Locals persecute them for their horns and hunt them down on mopeds. “Often the less exciting images have the most interesting backstories.” By including pictures of landscapes, Flach also tries to paint the whole picture of how we deal with nature: “I see linking the animals back to their habitat as the most important objective. The habitat is something that is essential to the conservation of endangered animals. “The most important message is that it’s not simply images of animals but that every aspect of our being is influenced by the natural world around us. With over seven hours a day that we spend on the internet, it becomes clear that we don’t have the same sensibilities that our predecessors had to their environment. I want to point to the ecological drivers of humanity through portrayals of animals and I chose some candidates to demonstrate that.“Insects might not interest everyone but they are essential for sustaining life. As soon as their numbers are diminishing, many things are not controlled anymore.” As we don’t know when the tipping points of a system could occur, we need to appreciate things before they are gone, he says. “For our own wellbeing we have to reconnect with the wild.” Monarch butterfly, Danaus plexippus. IUCN Red List status: Not evaluated. The monarch butterfly has been a focus of entomologists since the 1970s. A decade later, the IUCN marked the monarch migration as a threatened phenomenon, realising that fewer and fewer of these butterflies seemed to make their way to their winter quarters in California and Michoacán, Mexico. Figures show a 74% decline between 1997 and 2016 and have led to conservation measures, like the protection of Mexican forests under the North American Monarch Conservation Plan. White-bellied pangolin, Phataginus tricuspis. IUCN Red List status: Vulnerable. Each year, female Pangolins give birth to only one baby and breed very slowly due to their solitary nature. The pangolin is threatened all over the world, from Africans eating them as bushmeat to their use in China and Vietnam where they are turned into handbags or medicine. Their pulverised scales are said to cure asthma, nosebleeds, or cancer. In 2000, a zero-export quota on wild-caught Asian pangolins was introduced and in 2014 the IUCN status of all eight species were listed as “threatened with extinction”. Bengal tiger, Panthera tigris. IUCN Red List status: Endangered. The number of Bengal tigers decreases with the loss of their habitat. The cultural history of India also contributes to the sinking numbers – for example, the tradition of eating tiger liver for courage. The situation worsened after the South China subspecies disappeared by 1985, with Chinese poachers turning to the Bengal tiger. Even though China has banned the use of tiger bone, a black market persists. Today, more than 50 tiger reserves exist in India, providing a home for the remaining 2,500 individuals. Coral near Heron Island, Queensland, Australia. Protruding here and there among these plates are other corals, including Pocillopora (the fat green fingers, upper right) and Acropora (branching corals, bottom left and top). By day, Montipora corals survive through a symbiosis with an algae, which produce energy through photosynthesis. At night, they fan out and trap surrounding zooplankton with their tiny polyps. Social life in a coral therefore broadly resembles a utopian commune with the added benefit of an “intranet”. The polyps communicate and even share food and algae. Polar bear, Ursus maritimus. IUCN Red List status: Vulnerable Until 1973, when strict controls were introduced, polar bears mainly suffered from hunting. Today, vanishing ice cover poses a threat to all species in the Arctic food chain, from polar bears to seal, down to plankton, which is reduced due to lower oxygen content in warmer water. Seals, the bear’s prey, need the ice cover for protection and pupping. Without them, polar bears are forced to swim further and further through ice-free seas to find their essential food source. To avoid over-exhaustion and save energy, this individual hunched down in a snow pit during fierce weather conditions. Common hippopotamus, Hippopotamus amphibius. IUCN Red List status: Vulnerable In 2003, surveys showed that the number of hippos had dropped by 95% during eight years of civil war in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Hippos are hunted for bushmeat but have become the focus of poachers interested in their ivory canines following the 1989 ban on trading elephant ivory. International trade out of several African countries is restricted, but the law is not yet enforced on the ground. Today, African elephants outnumber hippos four to one. Frog eggs, Agalychnis annae. IUCN Red List status: Endangered During the rainy season, yellow-eyed tree frogs lay their eggs over still water. After mating, the female deposits a batch of jelly-coated eggs on a leaf or branch. This keeps them safe from fish and other aquatic predators. A week later they hatch and the tadpoles wriggle free of the jelly, drop into the water, or are flushed in by raindrops. Ploughshare tortoise, Astrochelys yniphora. IUCN Red List status: Critically endangered An adult ploughshare tortoise, mainly found in Asia, is worth tens of thousands of dollars on the black market. Even though live trade is banned, it has risen in recent years and incidents of tortoises stuffed into suitcases have often been reported. Hidden among items such as socks, nappies or plastic bags, the animals were intercepted in Bangkok or Mumbai and returned to Madagascar. But often they die from the stress on the journey. Captive-breeding stations have been set up in Madagascar and more than 600 individuals have been raised. As the tortoises were often stolen by smugglers, the captives now receive a painless engraving on their shells. Richard Lewis of the Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust said they hate to do it, “but we believe this will be a genuine deterrent”. Military macaw, Ara militaris. IUCN Red List status: Vulnerable Military macaws are caught for the pet trade and endangered through the loss of their habitat. In 2007, Defenders of Wildlife estimated that each year 78,500 birds were caught in Mexico, and a quarter of their original habitat has been cleared for logging and agriculture. Today, fewer than 10,000 military macaws are spread over an increasingly patchy area. In 2008, Mexico issued an export ban on its 22 parrot species but illegal trade – much of it on the local market – continues. White-backed African vulture, Gyps africanus. IUCN Red List status: Critically endangered It takes one hour for a flock of vultures to strip a cow carcass to its bones. Like this, they fulfill a useful role in the ecosystem. In parts of India, Nepal, Cambodia, Spain and southern Africa, approved carcasses of cattle and pigs are dumped, creating so-called “vulture restaurants”. It assures a safe food source for the critically endangered birds but also brings revenues in local tourism. Abattoir legislation in most parts of Europe is stricter, but there are now moves to relax the laws and thereby give back some of the bird’s traditional food sources.

A big, bold view of both fills its beach-facing galleries. In the spectacular new concrete-roofed extension that opens this week, there are no views, just lots of bright natural light streaming in from above. Then again, instead of views, there are the works of all the 20th-century artists who settled in Cornwall and created the strand of British modernism that led to this museum’s existence. The airy paintings of Peter Lanyon and the organically orotund casts and carvings of Barbara Hepworth have never looked better than they do in the reborn Tate St Ives. Even for a sceptic like me, who doesn’t believe British abstract art ever rivalled the likes of Mark Rothko or Jackson Pollock, the union of this art with the seascapes that inspired it is compelling. Unfortunately, the abstract artists who created the St Ives school are much more at home here than the first contemporary artist to show in its grand box of a new exhibition space. Rebecca Warren is left seeming like a metropolitan interloper who’s not sure why she is here or what her art is for. Warren’s exhibition fails to fill the vast room it is in. Her sculptures are dotted around the space rather than inhabiting it convincingly. Some are terrific, but the whole is less than the sum of its parts. It’s a pity because Warren is a hugely interesting sculptor. Her art is sensual, tactile, meatily physical. She moulds clay and casts it, and forces massive pieces of steel together. Her new works include colossal totemic figures cast in bronze and painted with a deliberate childlike sloppiness. Their grotesque hints of faces and bulbous hands give them a crudely humanoid aspect, their chaotic forms warped by bulges, ridges, drips and gloops. What are these beings? They resemble ancient pagan standing stones or primitive Celtic statues, but the joke is surely that they also resemble the intense abstract homages to such mysterious totems that were sculpted by 20th-century modernist artists, from Hepworth to Henry Moore. We’re on familiar terrain here: artists have been parodying modernism for some time. Warren’s parodies assault the patriarchy of Moore. They look like soft molten phalluses, with pink bows as a feminine touch. She makes the same point with a steel construction in the style of Anthony Caro: it has been painted pink and sports a fluffy pom-pom. This is all fine as far as it goes. Yet Warren does not seem to know what she wants this exhibition to achieve. Her collages of wood, paper and other scraps mounted on MDF, some lit by glowing pink neon tubes, don’t communicate very much. Her hard-edged metal abstractions don’t even look like they were made by the same artist as the blobby monoliths. Yet, amid the confusion and lack of impact, a group of brilliant figures stand in postures of monstrous, creepy grandeur. They are called Los Hadeans and they truly belong in Hades. Weird monkey faces, bizarre postures and long spindly outgrowths make these creatures truly strange, funny-peculiar and haunting. Warren has a comic talent for the carnal, the erotic, the monstrous that is perfectly encapsulated in her 1998 sculpture Helmut Crumb. She’s a surreal figurative artist, not a cool abstract one. Why does she get lost in abstraction here? It drains the sex and humour from her art. Perhaps it is hard to resist taking on the abstract tradition at St Ives, its home in Britain. The uplifting modernism of this new exhibition space also seems to demand something different from the playful wit that comes naturally to her. The trouble with parodies of 20th-century modernism is that they ultimately suggest a lack of belief in any purpose to art. Leaving Warren’s show and contemplating the Hepworths and Ben Nicholsons, you have to admire the idealism and vision of the artists who, in the last century, headed for Cornwall to find some kind of truth.

At least two members of May’s pro-EU dominated cabinet, Liz Truss and Jeremy Hunt, have said they would change their vote in favour of Brexit if a referendum were held tomorrow. Others including the loyal culture secretary, Karen Bradley, have followed the prime minister’s uncertain lead in refusing to give a straight answer. “There isn’t going to be a second Brexit referendum. We are delivering Brexit. I believe in Brexit,” she told ITV’s Good Morning Britain. But asked whether she would describe herself as remain or leave, Bradley replied: “We are leaving the European Union, I am making sure we leave. I’m part of a government that is leaving, so I guess you would say leave.” Remain-backing cabinet members yet to be given the same question will be pondering their answers, as senior divisions continue to be exposed on the type of Brexit deal the government is trying to secure. Truss said that her expectation of immediate economic damage from a leave vote had turned out to be wrong, and acknowledged that Treasury forecasts of its impact were not accurate. Speaking to BBC2’s Daily Politics Truss said: “All of us had to make a judgment on what we thought the future would look like. I made a judgment thinking it would be bad for the economy. “Since we have left, it has been more positive, so the facts have changed and I have changed my mind.” Asked whether this meant she now accepted the Treasury’s dire forecasts about leaving the EU were wrong, Truss said: “No forecast is completely accurate. No one has a crystal ball. “I believed that there would be major economic problems. Those haven’t come to pass and I have also seen the opportunities. The other thing is that there was a big moment on 23 June when British people voted to leave and it was an expression about what kind of country we wanted to be. I think that has changed the debate in this country as well.” Earlier this month Hunt told LBC’s Iain Dale that the “arrogance of the EU” in response to negotiating offers by the UK had influenced him to change his mind on the issue. On Tuesday May told Dale she did not answer hypothetical questions. Dale pressed her on the issue, by pointing out that Hunt had given a clear answer to the same question. “If he says he can change his mind, I don’t quite understand why you can’t, seeing as you are prime minister leading us into Brexit.” May replied: “What I did last time around was I looked at everything and came to a judgment and I’d do exactly the same this time around. But we’re not having another referendum and that’s absolutely crucial.” During prime minister’s questions on Wednesday, the SNP’s Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, asked her why she could not give a “straightforward” answer. She said: “There is no second referendum. The people of the United Kingdom voted and we will be leaving the European Union in March 2019.” At least 20 members of May’s cabinet backed remaining in the EU in the run-up to last year’s referendum."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"travel/2017/oct/15/top-10-family-good-value-ski-snowboard-holidays","type":"article","sectionId":"travel","sectionName":"Travel","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-15T06:00:23Z","webTitle":"10 of the best-value family ski trips","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2017/oct/15/top-10-family-good-value-ski-snowboard-holidays","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/travel/2017/oct/15/top-10-family-good-value-ski-snowboard-holidays","fields":{"headline":"10 of the best-value family ski trips","bodyText":"Les Contamines, France Action Outdoors is the UK partner of UCPA, a French non-profit group that works to make outdoor sports holidays affordable. Its all-inclusive ski trips offer some of the best value going, with ski hire and 12 hours of tuition included in the price. Les Contamines, in the Mont Blanc region, is a friendly, quiet resort with higher than average snowfall that’s often overlooked in favour of big-hitting neighbours Chamonix and Megève. The slopes are especially suited to beginner and intermediate skiers, and the town is picturesque. • From £654pp at half-term (departing 10 February) with action-outdoors.co.uk, including 7 nights’ full-board, 6½ days’ lift pass, 12 hours’ ski instruction, 6½ days’ ski equipment hire and evening entertainment. Accommodation-only options are available and under-3s go free. Return Eurotunnel crossings from £150 per car. Tolls and fuel about £136 according to viamichelin.com Pamporovo, Bulgaria Food and drink bills can push even the best-planned ski holiday over budget, but that’s not a worry at Hotel Perelik in Pamporovo, Bulgaria (booked through Crystal Ski Holidays), as all food and drink is included in the price – as are lift passes, kit hire and ski school. Pamporovo is a sunny resort with lovely views, great terrain for beginners and intermediates and a highly rated ski school. It’s also easy to navigate. Kids will love the hotel’s bowling alley, games room, swimming pool and pizzeria. • From £944pp based on four sharing at half-term (departing 10 February) with crystalski.co.uk, including flights, transfers and 7 nights’ all-inclusive accommodation. Reduced rates for single parents sharing a room with children Stöten, Sweden Aside from the astronomical pricing, one of the most frustrating things about skiing in the Alps in the school holidays, especially February half-term, can be the crowds. This isn’t an issue in super-quiet Stöten (pronounced “stir-ten”) as it’s barely on the radar of British skiers and snowboarders, and its wide, pristine slopes are quiet even at peak times. The resort is small and cosy, and the gentle terrain is perfect for beginners and improvers. Fun non-ski options include dog sledding, snowmobiling and swimming. • From £679pp at half-term (departing 11 February) with skisafari.com, based on two adults and two children self-catering at Stöten Mitt Apartments (option to upgrade to half-board), including flights and transfers. Ski hire costs around £65 a week, ski school around £103 and a week’s adult lift pass is £166 (stoten.se) La Thuile, Italy A speedy lift system to spread guests efficiently around the mountain is important at peak times, to avoid spending the holiday queuing. La Thuile’s modern lifts certainly do that, which makes for quiet slopes, many of which face east, so the snow stays in good condition for longer. The resort has lovely views of the Matterhorn, Monte Rosa and Mont Blanc and plenty of long, wide runs great for intermediate skiers and snowboarders and beginners who want to progress. La Thuile also links with the French resort of La Rosière. • From £525pp at Easter (departing 1 April) with crystalski.co.uk including self-catering accommodation in Planibel apartments, flights to Gatwick and transfers. A beginner ski or snowboard pack including lessons, lift pass and kit hire costs £392 Vallorcine, France Reasonably priced family ski holidays are hard enough to find, let alone ones that include kid-pleasing activities such as circus skills, igloo building and torch-lit snowshoeing. Yet La Source is offering just that in Vallorcine this winter with its Ski, Yoga &amp; Circus Camp. Families can ski by day in Vallorcine, which is connected to Le Tour in the Chamonix valley but has its own quiet nursery slopes (Chamonix can be unbelievably crowded at half-term), and by night children can join a circus workshop and put on a show at the end of the week. • From £795 for adults and over-12s, £635 for 5-11 years at half-term (departing 10 February) with sourceholidays.com, including full-board accommodation, daily yoga, circus skills and lift passes.

Lessons extra St Anton, Austria Popular resorts such as St Anton can be prohibitively expensive at peak times but Esprit Ski has a good deal for the Austrian favourite this Easter, and what’s more the chalet is in the resort’s charming centre within easy reach of the slopes. St Anton is renowned for appealing to advanced skiers and snowboarders but it’s also great for families, especially at the dedicated children’s areas of Nasserein and up at Gampen, while the ski school has a good reputation for bringing on first-time skiers and children. Off the slopes, kids can enjoy ice skating, tobogganing and indoor tennis. • From £947pp at Easter (departing 8 April) with espritski.com, including seven nights’ full-board, return flights from Bristol and transfers.

The four-man pods are comfy and cosy, and the site is well maintained with its own cafe-restaurant. Pillows and sheets are included, but guests have to bring towels and sleeping bags or duvets. Laax is a top-quality resort, especially for snowboarders, with its superpipe and some of the best snow parks in Europe. It’s also a good place for children to learn to snowboard, with mini-snowboard-specific obstacles. • £422 for five nights in a four-person pod at Easter (arrive 7 April) with pitchup.com.

Laax can be reached in 2 hours by shuttle bus from Zurich airport (£57 each way) Arinsal, Andorra On the border between France and Spain in the Pyrenees, Andorra has historically been a good choice for British families seeking value for money. In recent years, resort costs have risen but it still has the edge on price compared with the Alps. This is especially true for eating out, and Arinsal has a great range of restaurants including pizza, burgers, Mexican and sushi. It’s also the most family-focused resort in Andorra, with a good ski school and plenty of beginner and intermediate terrain including some lovely tree-lined skiing in the linked resort of Pal. Non-ski activities include snow tubing, snow biking and dog sledding. • From £918pp at half-term (depart 11 February) with igluski.com, including flights from Manchester, transfers and half-board hotel accommodation.

It’s Slovenia’s oldest ski resort and offers good value for British skiers and snowboarders, especially when compared to the Alps. The ski area is full of gentle blue runs, making it perfect for beginners and improvers wanting to build confidence, and the ski school teachers are friendly and speak good English. Special offers this winter for families include buy-one-get-one-free on kids’ kit hire and ski school tuition, as long as two adults have rented kit and booked at the ski school too. • From £915 at half-term (depart 11 February) with balkanholidays.co.uk, including flights from Gatwick, transfers, half-board accommodation at the Ramada Hotel, and entry to the Aqua Larix water park Valmorel, France Valmorel is a nice looking purpose-built resort in the Tarentaise valley. It doesn’t offer much of a challenge for more advanced skiers, but its quiet green runs and easy blues make it perfect for beginners and children. The resort is car-free in the centre with gentle nursery slopes and play areas for younger children, while the bars and restaurants are good value for the Alps. Peak Retreats offers reasonably priced ski-in, ski-out accommodation with indoor heated swimming pool and paddling pool. • From £315pp at Easter (arrive on 31 March) based on five sharing with peakretreats.co.uk, including self-catered accommodation and Eurotunnel crossing.

The colours of 2017 are revealed in the latest John Lewis retail report, in which the department store identified the key trends of the year – and the itemsbut have now passed their sell-by dates. The passion for millennial pink – described by the fashion glossies as blush with a hint of beige – has driven sales of everything from shoes to sofas. Sales of men’s pink T-shirts, says the department store, have soared 74% this year. Its a similar story with yellow: specifically, the bright hue of actor Emma Stone’s dress in the Oscar-winning musical La La Land. Sales of sunshine-yellow fashions have climbed 44% this year. And khaki was the must-have colour for any fashion-conscious shopper, male or female. The summer months, said the department store, were peak-khaki season. Now in its fifth year, John Lewis’s annual take of the shopper’s pulse also monitors shopping trends. It says that what its customers have really been looking for this year, amid political turmoil, is a little escapism. What else could explain a 99% surge in sales of pool inflatables , a 22% rise in mermaid-themed products and why shoppers might snap up anything emblazoned with unicorns , from bedding to wallets and water bottles? “A touch of the exotic and the fantastic helped people escape from the serious side of life,” said a spokesperson. The success of the reality TV show Love Island also helped boost sales of unusual-shaped inflatables such as donuts and watermelons. Fast falling out of favour have been workaday items such as satnavs, e-readers, analogue radios and vegetable spiralisers. John Lewis plans to remove satnavs from stock following plummeting sales. The spiraliser fad fizzled out, with sales collapsing by 40%. Colour-coordinated power suits have been given the thumbs down by female shoppers, along with push-up bras. For men, cummerbunds are out – but there is no sign that beards are moving off-trend. The department store said it now sells more than 20 beard-grooming products. Unexpectedly back in favour were bookcases – possibly a result of the “shelfie” craze, which has seen people posting pictures of their books and knick-knacks on social media – together with the Rubik’s Cube, record players and personal organisers. In the toy department, the hit of the year was the fidget-spinner, a here-today-gone-tomorrow craze that came and went in the spring. “How we shop continues to change at pace,” said Peter Cross, John Lewis’s director of customer experience, citing figures that showed nearly two thirds of visits to the store’s website are via mobile phone or tablet. “Shops now need to combine the very best products with the latest, most immersive experiences. For many customers, their phones are the remote control for their lives, with their shopping, banking, social networks and to-do list in one place.” In the home, shoppers took inspiration from Californian-style home styling to snap up cactus prints, although the retailer predicts that next year will be the year when snakes, monkeys and toucans feature heavily on jungle-style furnishings. Velvet sofas have been the look of the year for the living room, while the kitchen products that have shown the fastest sales included fat-free Eaziglide frying pans, egg gadgets and avocado tools, which saw sales rise 40%. Traditional teapots, butter dishes and eggcups all experienced a surge in sales, but many people now prefer to eat from a bowl rather than a plate. The renewed popularity of gin prompted a doubling of sales of cocktail glasses, especially wide-bowled gin balloon glasses."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"law/2017/oct/12/sentencing-council-urges-tougher-jail-terms-for-terrorist-plotters","type":"article","sectionId":"law","sectionName":"Law","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-11T23:01:24Z","webTitle":"Sentencing Council urges tougher jail terms for terrorist plotters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2017/oct/12/sentencing-council-urges-tougher-jail-terms-for-terrorist-plotters","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/law/2017/oct/12/sentencing-council-urges-tougher-jail-terms-for-terrorist-plotters","fields":{"headline":"Sentencing Council urges tougher jail terms for terrorist plotters","bodyText":"Terrorist plotters are likely to be imprisoned for longer terms under new sentencing guidelines drafted in response to the surge in attacks this year. In its first comprehensive review of terrorist offences, the judicial body which promotes consistency across the courts has recommended tougher punishments, particularly for those convicted of preparing acts of violence. The consultation, published by the Sentencing Council, suggests that using social media to spread terror messages and encrypted communications to avoid detection should both count as aggravating factors in the severity of any offence. The new guidelines are consistent with the existing maximum sentence of life with a minimum term of 40 years, but the proposals are likely to result in increased punishments for cases at the lower end of the scale. The main change applies to offences under section 5 of the Terrorism Act 2006, which covers the preparation of terrorism. The Sentencing Council draft guidelines call for a sentencing range for the lowest-level crimes of between three to six years, compared with 21 months to five years under the existing guidance. Many of the offences under review come before the courts in such low volumes that it is difficult to establish an accurate picture of current sentencing practices. The offences covered include sections of the Explosive Substances Act 1883 as well as more recent anti-terror legislation. Terror attacks where deaths occur are charged as murder. Given the heightened terrorist threat, the Sentencing Council said, it decided to “accelerate” production of its guidelines. They will replace existing guidance issued by the court of appeal last year. “These latest acts of terrorism have involved far less sophisticated methods, many using motor vehicles, or knives, with devastating effects,” the Council notes. The availability of extremist material online had led to people becoming self-radicalised. “When considering these actions in the current climate, where a terrorist act could be planned in a very short time using readily available items as weapons,” the Council says, and “...where acts of terrorism can be committed by many rather than a few highly-organised individuals, these offences are more serious than they have previously been perceived.” Among factors which might reduce the culpability of an offender, it is suggested, is where someone has “engaged in very limited preparation of terrorist activity” or provided only “limited help, assistance or encouragement”. The chairman of the Sentencing Council, Lord Justice Treacy, said: “We want to ensure that courts have comprehensive guidance for dealing with these extremely serious cases. Offences vary greatly and could include someone who tries to make a bomb, another who urges others to join a terrorist organisation or a group plotting a murderous attack on the public. “Our proposed guidelines set out a clear approach to dealing with this wide range of offences to ensure appropriate sentences are passed to punish offenders and disrupt their activities.” Responding to the proposals, the justice minister Dominic Raab said: “Having extended the scheme for appealing unduly lenient sentences to those who radicalise individuals or turn a blind eye to terrorism, these new guidelines will help ensure we have the most rigorous and robust sentencing in terrorism cases.” The Sentencing Council is independent of the Ministry of Justice. It was set up to promote greater transparency and consistency in sentencing. Its consultation on the draft guidelines will last six weeks; the guidelines will come into force early in 2018."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"artanddesign/2017/oct/13/astrnauts-russians-wim-wenders-polaroids-lisson-gallery-week-in-art","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-13T10:56:02Z","webTitle":"Opera in space, Russia after the revolution and Wim Wenders' snaps – the week in art","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2017/oct/13/astrnauts-russians-wim-wenders-polaroids-lisson-gallery-week-in-art","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2017/oct/13/astrnauts-russians-wim-wenders-polaroids-lisson-gallery-week-in-art","fields":{"headline":"Opera in space, Russia after the revolution and Wim Wenders' snaps – the week in art","bodyText":"Exhibition of the week Ilya and Emilia Kabakov: Not Everyone Will Be Taken Into the Future The aftermath of Russia’s October 1917 revolution is explored in some of the most haunting installations ever created. • Tate Modern, London, 18 October-28 January.

Officials at the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) say that the government and its partners are only providing 200,000 meals a day to meet the needs of more than 2 million people. That is a daily shortfall of between 1.8m and 5.8m meals. “We are 1.8 million meals short,” said one senior Fema official. “That is why we need the urgency. And it’s not going away. We’re doing this much today, but it has to be sustained over several months.” The scale of the food crisis dwarfs the more widely publicized challenges of restoring power and communications. More than a third of Puerto Ricans are still struggling to live without drinking water. However, Fema provides no details on food deliveries, keeping its public statements to the most general terms. On its website, Fema says it has provided “millions of meals and millions of liters of water”. In fact many of those meals are military ready-to-eat meals that civilians find hard to digest if consumed for more than a few days. Now the biggest provider of cooked meals says Fema is putting its operations at risk of closure. World Central Kitchen, founded by chef José Andrés, cooks and distributes 90,000 meals a day through a network of local chefs and kitchens. Its Fema contract, to provide just 20,000 meals a day, ended on Tuesday. Fema insists it is bound by federal rules that mean it will take several weeks for a new contract to emerge to feed more Americans. “There is no urgency in the government response to this humanitarian crisis,” Andrés said. “They have all the officials and armed guards at headquarters, but they have no information about the island. They don’t even have a map they can share about who needs food. Fema is over-paying and it is under-delivering.” According to Donald Trump, his own response to the disaster in Puerto Rico has been exceptional. “Nobody could have done what I’ve done for Puerto Rico with so little appreciation. So much work!” he tweeted on Sunday. The tweet was posted along with a White House video of helicopters and trucks in Puerto Rico, and a title card saying, “What the fake news media will not show you in Puerto Rico.” However, the Trump administration has limited insight into whether food is getting distributed and how many hungry Americans are struggling to find food. Trump is receiving little appreciation from the American people for his response to the Puerto Rico disaster. According to a recent poll for the Associated Press, just 32% of Americans approve of Trump’s performance after Hurricane Maria devastated Puerto Rico. That poll was conducted before Trump visited the island last week, when he tossed paper towels into a crowd in San Juan. The mayor of San Juan called the sight of him throwing rolls of paper “terrible and abominable”. Conditions on Puerto Rico remain dire; just 16% of islanders having access to electricity. While commercial flights have resumed, and most gas stations have reopened, much of the island’s economy remains at a standstill. Less than 400 miles of the island’s 5,000 miles of road are open to traffic. Many residents are voting with their feet and leaving their homes behind. The population of the island of Vieques has declined from around 9,000 to little more than 6,000, according to relief workers."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/blog/2017/oct/11/usa-world-cup-2018-qualification-failure-soccer","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-11T11:46:13Z","webTitle":"Stubbornness and lack of talent: the factors that doomed USA's World Cup","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2017/oct/11/usa-world-cup-2018-qualification-failure-soccer","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/blog/2017/oct/11/usa-world-cup-2018-qualification-failure-soccer","fields":{"headline":"Stubbornness and lack of talent: the factors that doomed USA's World Cup","bodyText":"The shock is just now beginning to subside after the US men’s national team was eliminated from contention for the next summer’s World Cup in Russia. Every result that could have doomed them on Tuesday night came about, with Honduras and Panama’s respective wins combining with the US’s own 2-1 loss at already eliminated Trinidad &amp; Tobago to knock Bruce Arena’s men out. The list of what didn’t doom the United States’ qualifying campaign is lengthy – vastly greater resources and spending power relative to the rest of the Concacaf region, first and foremost – but before the autopsy begins in earnest, below are four things that consigned the US to desperate failure. Home defeats to Mexico and Costa Rica Coach Bruce Arena’s comment that the “hotshot” European powerhouses should try to qualify out of Concacaf, and the insinuation that it is somehow more challenging than in other federations, inspired much guffawing. Those scorning Arena had justification. (Good luck surviving a bad draw in Uefa or CAF, Bruce). There’s a case to be made that Concacaf has the most lenient road to the World Cup. In few other regions could Mexico have made it to Brazil three years ago with just two wins out of 10 qualifiers, for example, or with just three, as the US would have if El Tri and Costa Rica had done them a favor on Tuesday night. What Arena was alluding to, however, were the logistical and practical concerns that are unique to Central America and the Caribbean. In few other regions, for example, do visitors have to wade through a moat to get to practice the day before the match. Stories of inhospitable kickoff times and late-night phone calls to team hotels are legion. What that all means is that taking care of business at home is paramount. Win your home games, and you’re in, no matter what happens on those pesky road trips. The United States failed to obey that cardinal rule. The USMNT fell to Mexico in what had previously been the fortress of Mapfre Stadium – two days after the election of President Donald Trump, some of a certain political persuasion will remind you with the same dark comedy that inspired Omar Gonzalez’s own goal on Tuesday – and lost to Costa Rica in New Jersey last month. That Costa Rica loss, especially, coming when it did, put the US in a position in which they absolutely needed an away result. As we saw so vividly, that can come back to bite teams. Lack of difference-makers in their primes As explained in depth by Brian Sciaretta over at American Soccer Now earlier this month, the USMNT are plagued by a puzzling dearth of talent between the ages of 23 and 27. The reasons behind that glaring development gap are myriad – that players those ages were born before Major League Soccer came into existence, that every nation ebbs and flows with its talent production – but its impact was clear enough this campaign. The US leaned too heavily on veterans who had clearly lost a step, like poor Tim Howard, who was so lauded for his heroics against Belgium in Brazil but has lacked his former reflexes for a while now. It has also heaped far too much responsibility onto the shoulders of 19-year-old Christian Pulisic. Pulisic has legitimate, game-changing quality. He’s already as gifted as just about any other American soccer player, ever, and it is a great shame for football fans everywhere was that he has been robbed of a turn on the World Cup stage. Pulisic was dominant last Friday night against Panama and scored a world-class goal against T&amp;T. He’s also young, and sometimes inconsistent, like when he struggled to establish himself in that aforementioned Costa Rica match. Such are the dangers of leaning too heavily on players either on the back end of their careers or still growing into their prime. A stubborn willingness to stick with coaches through more than one World Cup cycle To write off this collapse as merely a function of a down talent cycle is to be far too lenient on the powers that be. Even without difference-makers in that age group, this team had more than enough talent to qualify. MLS, the domestic league, is as strong as it’s ever been. Pulisic plays for Borussia Dortmund, one of the biggest club teams in the world. Blame should also be pointed squarely at Arena, at former coach Jürgen Klinsmann, who oversaw the home loss to Mexico and the 4-0 hiding in Costa Rica, as well as at federation president Sunil Gulati, who hired both of them. This has been a trend since the first time Arena was in charge. His 2002 squad made the deepest run of any US team in the modern era, taking Germany to the wire in the World Cup quarter-finals. At the end of his second cycle in 2006, though, the team flopped, going three-and-out in Germany. Bob Bradley also guided the US to the World Cup knockout rounds a year after a stirring run to the 2009 Confederations Cup final … and was let go midway through his second cycle after the team’s form fell off. So Klinsmann’s trajectory should’ve been easily to chart when he inked a contract extension the year before his US team reached the round of 16 in 2014. Instead, he stuck around long enough to dig the hole this group could not climb out of. A couple of bad breaks Any of the three fluky plays that sank the US would’ve been extraordinary on its own. First, Gonzalez sliced an attempted clearance off the outside of his boot and into his own net, an own goal that would’ve been stylish even if he had been attempting to score. Then Honduras boinked their game-winner off the crossbar, off the back of the Mexican goalkeeper’s head and over the line. Panama’s tying goal didn’t even make it that far – replays conclusively showed that Blas Perez’s shot next made it completely over the goalline – but it was credited anyway (fans hoping for a reprieve on that one may well be disappointed: it sounds like US Soccer won’t appeal. “As far as I know there is no recourse. Decisions of the referee are final,” spokesman Michael Kammarman told CBS Sports.) Taken together, it’s fine to acknowledge that this was a remarkable bit of ill fortune to strike in the same night. It’s also fair to point out that the US has so much going for it relative to its peers that it never should have been so susceptible to bad luck so late in the campaign – and that this result will have repercussions for years to come."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"film/2017/oct/12/school-life-review-documentary-headfort","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-12T12:00:40Z","webTitle":"School Life review – endearing doc about an unusual Irish prep","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/oct/12/school-life-review-documentary-headfort","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2017/oct/12/school-life-review-documentary-headfort","fields":{"headline":"School Life review – endearing doc about an unusual Irish prep","bodyText":"This endearing documentary tracks life at Headfort, a boarding prep school in Ireland where an assortment of kids, mostly local but also further flung corners of the world, grow and seemingly flourish under the tutelage of some especially gifted teachers. Although it would seem all the staff at the school care deeply about their charges, the focus is most of all on a married pair, John and Amanda Leyden, who have been with the school for over 40 years. She inspires the pupils with her passionate love of literature; he teaches them not just Latin but also how to do pretty credible ensemble renditions of Teenage Kicks in the school’s graffiti-covered music building.

He quoted the Citizens Advice description of UC as a “disaster waiting to happen” and claims from the IPPR thinktank and the Child Poverty Action group, both of whom said it would result in more children in poverty. Corbyn said that even the former prime minister, John Major, had called it unfair and unforgiving. He described how “Georgina”, who had written to him, was left all summer with no money and had to rely on her family, then made a final point on the 55p per minute cost of the UC helpline. Corbyn asked May to pause the rollout of UC because it drives up debt, poverty and homelessness. May’s responses varied little. She acknowledged problems in UC’s rollout and said they were being addressed, and twice pointed out that those in financial distress could apply for advance payments. She said the underlying justification for UC had not changed – that the Labour scheme it replaced incentivised claimants to not work and had trapped 1.4 million people in out-of-work benefits. Corbyn retorted that the last Labour government had lifted a million people out of poverty. Corbyn finished by listing a string of failures from “a government in chaos” and said the Conservatives were “more interested in fighting among themselves” than solving these problems. “If a prime minister can’t lead,” he asked, “shouldn’t she leave?” This raised the temperature somewhat. May, having listed achievements from her government’s record, brought up Shelter’s criticism of Labour housing policy from the party’s conference, where she also referred to the antisemitism row. Verdict More often than not these days PMQs feels like a draw, and today was no exception. Corbyn chose a topic on which the government is exceptionally vulnerable, and his questions were good and emotive, but he never asked anything specific enough to unsettle May, and she did a reasonably competent job of brushing it all aside with a broad-brush defence of welfare reform … although this did prompt one of the best retorts from Corbyn. Not for the first time, he was effective in defending the record of the last Labour government. Both leaders saved their TV soundbites until the end, and at this point Corbyn threw in a rather casual call for May to stand down. If the leader of the opposition is saying the PM should resign, you would normally expect them to make a bigger deal of this. May responded with a pre-cooked but better than usual generalised broadside about the Labour conference. Memorable lines Isn’t it the case that if the prime minister can’t lead she should leave? Corbyn calls for May to resign. And all that before the shadow chancellor admitted a Labour government would cause a run on the pound. May rounds up the highlights from Labour conference."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/oct/26/rioja-rueda-rose-new-wave-wines-versus-tradtional-fiona-beckett","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-26T16:00:05Z","webTitle":"New-wave wines for a new generation of wine drinkers","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/oct/26/rioja-rueda-rose-new-wave-wines-versus-tradtional-fiona-beckett","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/oct/26/rioja-rueda-rose-new-wave-wines-versus-tradtional-fiona-beckett","fields":{"headline":"New-wave wines for a new generation of wine drinkers","bodyText":"One of the challenges that faces wine producers is the need to adjust to the tastes of younger drinkers without losing their traditional customer base. If you’ve been a fan of, say, rioja for years, more mature, oakier vintages such as Booths’ Gran Norte Rioja Reserva 2011 (£12.50; 13.5% abv) may be most to your taste, whereas if you’re a recent convert, you may prefer a more vibrant style such as the Ramón Bilbao Rioja Viñedos de Altura 2014 (£12.50 Great Western Wine; 13.5% abv), which went perfectly with the suckling pig I had at a Peruvian restaurant the other day. If you don’t see the words reserva or gran reserva on the label, chances are it’s a modern rather than traditional style. New-wave riojas are more likely to be made by newer wineries or run by the younger generation who have made wine in other countries and are seeking a point of difference from larger producers who prioritise consistency. Aldonia, for instance, specialises in garnacha rather than the traditional tempranillo, which is one reason for its 15% abv. That’s £12.80 from Tanners (or £10.80 if you buy three or more bottles). Interestingly, rueda has also changed character from the pungent, citrussy, sauvignon-like style of a couple of years ago to a smoother, lusher, more textured white that would appeal to younger drinkers. If you’ve never tried it, or it never really appealed to you (me neither), you could do a lot worse than take advantage of the last few days of Waitrose’s 25%-off offer on Beronia Rueda 2015 (£6.99; 13% abv). You never know, it may end up being your default winter white. Rosé, too, has been through various permutations over the past decade. First, it became darker, to combat the idea that it was a wine for wimps – not that Charles Melton’s Rose of Virginia (£15.47 thedrinksshop.com; 13.5% abv) is a particularly butch name. Then it became paler, in response to the increased popularity of Provençal rosé. And now, there are rosés that look and taste more like a light red: Bull &amp; Giné Rosat (£18 Highbury Vintners; and a massive 14.5%), from Priorat, is a case in point. There’s an element of fashion to this progression, sure, but also a question of personal taste. Most events I host end up with the room divided 50:50 over the wines we’re tasting, regardless of price. If, for example, you like a blanc de blancs (sparkling wine, usually champagne, made from white grapes) that makes a good aperitif, you may not take to a richer, toastier blanc de noirs (fizz made from dark-skinned grapes), which needs food to show it at its best. matchingfoodandwine.com"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"politics/2017/oct/19/we-can-take-it-almost-anywhere-how-brexit-threatens-the-uks-creative-industries","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-18T23:01:07Z","webTitle":"‘We can take it almost anywhere’: how Brexit threatens the UK’s creative industries","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/oct/19/we-can-take-it-almost-anywhere-how-brexit-threatens-the-uks-creative-industries","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/oct/19/we-can-take-it-almost-anywhere-how-brexit-threatens-the-uks-creative-industries","fields":{"headline":"‘We can take it almost anywhere’: how Brexit threatens the UK’s creative industries","bodyText":"At least 40 screens line the white-brick and plate-glass walls of Jellyfish Pictures’ industrial-style office near London’s Oval, but the space is strangely silent: the powerful computers they are hooked up to are all somewhere else. “Lots of companies in computer graphics, visual effects, animation, you’d hear the hum of the machines,” says Phil Dobree, Jellyfish’s CEO. “This is virtual. It means we can take it almost anywhere.” And they might. With 200 employees on four London sites, Jellyfish is a highly successful part of a hugely successful UK industry. Fuelled by Pinewood, Shepperton and Harry Potter, Britain has become a world-leading centre for movie visual effects, or VFX. UK-based firms provide Oscar-winning VFX and computer graphics (CG) for blockbusters such as as Gravity and Interstellar. Jellyfish – a multiple Bafta winner – has done Star Wars Rogue One and The Last Jedi, plus countless TV dramas and docs. But, says Dobree, if the industry is among the world’s very best it is because it “has easy access to the very best”. More than 30% of people working in the UK sector, including at Jellyfish, are EU nationals. Brexit could wreck that. “We have EU animators, modellers, riggers, lighters, compositors, CG supervisors,” Dobree said. “All the key skill areas. From Spain, Italy, France; from junior to very senior. These people are difficult to train and extremely sought after.” About half are contract workers. “Often, when you’re doing a short-term job – a commercial, a TV series – you need people for a month or two,” Dobree said. “Right now, we can fly them in pretty much the next day. So what happens after 2019?” The same question is being asked across the UK’s booming creative industries, an unsung economic powerhouse encompassing everything from advertising to architecture, including music, film, TV, creative tech, video games and the visual and performing arts. It employs nearly 2 million people – 25% more than in 2011. It is the fastest growing area of Britain’s economy, producing goods and services worth some £87bn a year – more than the UK’s car, life sciences, oil and gas and aerospace industries combined. Its exports reached £21.2bn in 2015, nearly 10% of the UK’s total and almost 45% more than five years earlier. “We should be seen as either the most, or one of the most important, future-proof engines for growth in the UK economy,” says John Kampfner, the chief executive of the Creative Industries Federation. “But one of the key reasons we’re so successful is that Britain is so ... open. The question is: is that soluble in Brexit?” Some 96% of the federation’s 1,000-plus members told a survey last year they did not want Britain to leave the EU. Their Brexit worries include maintaining access to vital EU grants that have financed countless, often small arts companies and co-funded major cultural venues. With the EU by far its biggest market, creative firms are also concerned by more technical issues about being outside the single market and in new trade deals, such as effective standards, regulatory and legal frameworks, intellectual property and copyright, the free flow of data and the digital single market. Kampfner said the sector’s biggest concern “pretty much revolves around talent and free movement. It’s about our access to the best people, the implications of any new immigration system for employment, freelancers, touring and festivals”. The federation publishes a detailed report on the question on Thursday, in which it is expected to call for free, same-day movement for creatives, if necessary through the introduction of special creative visas. If there are new restrictions, they must be “incredibly easy to navigate”, said Kampfner. More than 70% of UK creative firms employ EU nationals, and 60% use freelancers, the federation says. Around 47% of all creative workers in the sector are freelance and most do not earn big money – often far below the £30,000 to 35,000 salaries currently needed to qualify for a non-EU visa. Any post-Brexit immigration regime aimed at deterring EU nationals and aligning the current system with rules for non-EU immigrants, such as that outlined in a leaked Home Office document last month, could prove catastrophic: some 57% of creative firms already report serious skills shortages, mainly due to shortcomings in the UK education system. “But it’s not just the practicalities,” Kampfner added. “It’s atmospherics, too. It’s one thing to permit people to come and work in Britain, another to welcome them. Think of the brilliant young creative from, say, France, who comes here, does a bit of bar work to pay the rent, works his way up freelancing in his field, and five years later is a star ... They just won’t come. They’ll go to Berlin, or Paris, or Athens, or Lisbon. Anecdotally, numbers are already down.” Free movement of EU labour, which the government seems determined to oppose, is a concern across all parts of the sector. “Companies must be able to continue to attract the very best talent, and make decisions based on artistic rationale and repertoire requirements rather than on sovereignty,” said Steven Roth, the executive director of Scottish Ballet. Caroline Rush, the chief executive of the British Fashion Council, said at the opening of London Fashion Week last month that since the British education agenda could not support creativity in the way the industry needed “we need to welcome and support international talent to come to the UK”. Bait Studio, a design and VFX company in Cardiff that has worked on the BBC’s Casualty and other dramas such as Decline and Fall, is currently hiring more than 20 extra staff for several months to work on a feature film. Most will come from the EU, said managing director Jon Rennie. “Not because we make a point of hiring from outside the UK – we try to hire locally if we can,” Rennie said. “But we want to bring in absolutely the best possible people for the job, and we need to be able to do it fast or the work will go elsewhere.” Peter Rogers, the company’s creative producer, said the industry “needs free movement to continue”. Despite its attachment to Wales, the business was ultimately highly mobile, both men said. They had already heard of rival VFX companies “hedging their bets” by exploring a move to Ireland. Back at the Oval, Manuel Reyes, 36, a senior computer graphics supervisor at Jellyfish, agreed the situation was tricky. “Everyone’s worried. At work, we’re very reassured. But generally ... you feel more uncomfortable. You start looking at other openings. So yes, if there are more hurdles, we’ll go somewhere else.” But without something as “close as possible to free movement” after Brexit, said his boss, Dobree, “Britain’s CG and VFX industry will simply move on.” And without fast access to talent, “the industry will die” in the UK. “We’re smart, we’re flexible, we already face sky-high real estate and other costs. We’re here because the talent is here and if it isn’t we can bring it here. The bottom line is this: if the government doesn’t get this right, these films and shows will no longer be made in Britain.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2017/oct/13/boy-review-taika-waititi-james-rolleston-maori-comedy","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-13T05:00:23Z","webTitle":"Boy review – big-hearted Maori coming-of-age comedy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/oct/13/boy-review-taika-waititi-james-rolleston-maori-comedy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2017/oct/13/boy-review-taika-waititi-james-rolleston-maori-comedy","fields":{"headline":"Boy review – big-hearted Maori coming-of-age comedy","bodyText":"Now that New Zealand’s Taika Waititi has hit the big league directing Marvel’s Thor: Ragnarok, his second film, 2010’s Maori coming-of-age comedy Boy, is finally released in the UK.

Like Waititi’s 2016 indie hit Hunt for the Wilderpeople, it’s a paean to the strength and resilience of kids, though in its raw and less polished way it’s a little less corny. Set in 1984, Boy (James Rolleston) is a bright, full-of-beans 11-year-old with a lovely open face. Boy hero worships his dim-witted criminal dad (Waititi, giving a dynamite comic performance, like a biker Ali G, with a mullet and crap prison tattoos). It’s heartbreakingly sad watching Boy’s illusions shatter as he begins to see his father for the cringeworthy immature man-child he is. And with a level of emotional realness missing from most quirky indie comedies, Waititi lets in the thought that, in this deprived rural community, a promising kid like Boy might grow up to be a man like his dad.

The no-strings-attached fellowships, which have previously gone to writers including Claudia Rankine and Ta-Nehisi Coates, are intended “to encourage people of outstanding talent to pursue their own creative, intellectual, and professional inclinations”. Two novelists were among this year’s selection of 24 fellows, which included mathematicians, historians, computer scientists and anthropologists. Ward was picked for novels “exploring the enduring bonds of community and familial love among poor African Americans of the rural South, against a landscape of circumscribed possibilities and lost potential”. Nguyen was chosen for “challenging popular depictions of the Vietnam war and exploring the myriad ways that war lives on for those it has displaced”. Nguyen, whose novel The Sympathizer won a Pulitzer prize in 2016, said in an interview with the MacArthur programme that he “grew up deeply immersed in the stories of the Vietnamese refugee community in California, and aware that the stories and the depths of emotions were completely invisible and inaudible to the larger American population”. “The Vietnam war was very important to the way Americans saw, or didn’t see, people like me,” he said. “And I realised that the ways Americans were telling stories about this war were completely erasing the Vietnamese experience. I began thinking that one of literature’s tasks was to give voices to the voiceless and to humanise people, and this is especially true for minorities in this country.” His books of short stories, The Refugees, “worked exactly in that register, trying to humanise Vietnamese people. But eventually I realised this was a task doomed to defeat, because we’re already human, why would we need to humanise ourselves?” When he wrote The Sympathizer, Nguyen added, he decided he was “done with trying to prove the humanity of Vietnamese people. Our task is not to humanise, our task is to claim the same rights and prerogatives of subjectivity and identity and complex humanity and inhumanity that the majority reserves for itself.” He hoped that people would take from his work – which also includes the acclaimed nonfiction study of the war’s impact, Nothing Ever Dies – “the necessity of thinking and feeling from the position of people who are not like them”. “It’s a natural human tendency to think and feel for people who we think are like us, and this is both very human and very disastrous,” he said. “It’s partly what gets us in to war and conflict, because we can’t imagine the perspectives of other people”. The MacArthur Foundation said that Nguyen’s work “not only offers insight into the experiences of refugees past and present, but also poses profound questions about how we might more accurately and conscientiously portray the victims and adversaries of other wars”. Ward won the National Book Award in 2011 with Salvage the Bones, which follows four siblings in the days immediately before and after Hurricane Katrina. She spoke of the influence of her Mississippi upbringing. “In my family and in my community, I see people struggling with drug addiction, with poverty and the effects of generational poverty, I see people struggling with lack of access to healthcare,” she said. “If I’m honest about the people that I love … then I need my characters to live through the same things that the people I love and care about are living with and struggling with. I know it’s been easy for people who are not familiar with them to stereotype them, to see them as being only one thing, to flatten them. That bothers me, because I know that they are people like anyone else, and that they struggle with the same things that all human beings struggle with. I hope people who read my books … feel empathy for us and really see us as complicated people.” Announcing her as one of its 2017 fellows, the MacArthur Foundation praised Ward for writing “prose that is simultaneously luminous and achingly honest”, in which she “captures moments of beauty, tenderness, and resilience against a bleak landscape of crushing poverty, racism, addiction, and incarceration”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"music/2017/oct/15/beck-colors-review-a-hymn-to-hedonistic-pop","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-15T06:59:24Z","webTitle":"Beck: Colors review – a hymn to hedonistic pop","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/oct/15/beck-colors-review-a-hymn-to-hedonistic-pop","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2017/oct/15/beck-colors-review-a-hymn-to-hedonistic-pop","fields":{"headline":"Beck: Colors review – a hymn to hedonistic pop","bodyText":"It’s typical of the restless Beck that his follow-up to the pensive Morning Phase is a loose-limbed hymn to hedonistic pop.

But one museum in Rome’s eastern suburbs is home to 200 squatters, 80 of them children, who live among and protect the works of art. In 2011, curator Giorgio de Finis came across a former salami factory occupied by homeless migrants and organised art events and performances there. These, in collaboration with the inhabitants, grew spontaneously into the Museo dell’Altro e dell’Altrove di Metropoliz, or Maam (it means Museum of the Other and the Elsewhere). It quickly became one of Rome’s most important contemporary art spaces, with murals, paintings and installations by more than 300 artists from around the world. Many of them incorporate remnants of the site’s previous use as a slaughterhouse or, taking inspiration from its residents, address ideas of discrimination, xenophobia and nationalism. A room once used for stripping carcasses features a giant mural of strung-up pigs. Livestock cages serve as part of an installation about the lives of prisoners and migrants. All artwork is donated as a gesture of support for the illegal museum that works on no budget. But visitors often show more interest in Maam’s occupants than in its art. Since occupying the abandoned factory in 2009, the migrants (from Morocco, Peru, Sudan, Eritrea and Ukraine as well as several Roma families) have transformed factory buildings into homes, painted with murals. Maam’s halls serve as a gigantic playground for the children, and some artists have designed playrooms which are at the same time works of art. The citizens of Maam, most of whom are poor and unemployed, maintain the museum together with curator de Finis. To protect their privacy and for fear the police might try to evict them, they open the museum only on Saturdays and for occasional special events. Entry is free, although visitors are invited to make a donation. • Via Prenestina 913, on Facebook"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"world/2017/oct/11/catalonias-suspended-declaration-of-independence-what-happens-next","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-13T15:14:59Z","webTitle":"Catalonia's suspended declaration of independence: what happens next?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/11/catalonias-suspended-declaration-of-independence-what-happens-next","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/oct/11/catalonias-suspended-declaration-of-independence-what-happens-next","fields":{"headline":"Catalonia's suspended declaration of independence: what happens next?","bodyText":"What exactly happened in the Catalan parliament on Tuesday night? The Catalan president, Carles Puigdemont, signed an independence declaration, paving the way for the region to split from Spain. However, he said the effects of the declaration would be suspended for a few weeks while his government sought dialogue to resolve the long-festering dispute with the Spanish state. What was the basis for the declaration? Puigdemont says the results of the referendum on 1 October have given the regional government a mandate to create a sovereign republic. According to the Catalan government, 90% of the votes it has been able to count were cast in favour of splitting from Spain. The Catalan government says it has counted 2.3 million votes, but that a further 770,00 have not been included in the final count as they were seized by Spanish police attempting to stop the vote. There are 5.3 million eligible voters in the region. Is the Spanish government open to negotiation on the referendum results? No. Spain’s prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, has repeatedly said the referendum was illegal and a clear violation of the country’s 1978 constitution, which is based “on the indissoluble unity of the Spanish nation, the common and indivisible homeland of all Spaniards”. The country’s constitutional court ruled against the poll. On Wednesday morning, Rajoy asked Puigdemont to clarify whether or not independence had been declared and warned that his answer would inform the Spanish government’s decision on moving to suspend Catalonia’s autonomy. So what happens next? Rajoy has said he is willing to take the unprecedented step of invoking article 155 of the Spanish constitution, which allows the central government to take control of an autonomous region if it “does not fulfil the obligations imposed upon it by the constitution or other laws, or acts in a way that is seriously prejudicial to the general interest of Spain”. He may feel that the Catalan government has gone too far with Tuesday’s declaration and needs to be stopped. Pedro Sánchez, the leader of the Spanish Socialist party, offered another solution on Wednesday, saying that he and Rajoy had agreed to study a possible constitutional reform of Spain’s autonomous region to try to end the crisis. Other available options include declaring a state of alarm, a state of emergency or even martial law in Catalonia. How would such a move go down in Catalonia? Very badly. Tensions are still running high after the violence during the referendum and there is resentment at the continuing deployment in the region of thousands of Spanish Guardia Civil and national police officers. What’s more, it’s unclear how the Catalan police force, the Mossos d’Esquadra, would respond to the suspension of regional autonomy and the imposition of direct rule from Madrid. Their Spanish colleagues have accused them of failing to police the referendum effectively, and the chief of the Mossos, Josep Lluís Trapero, is being investigated for sedition by Spain’s national court amid accusations that the force failed to assist Guardia Civil officers who raided government buildings and arrested 14 Catalan officials last month. What about external mediation? Although Donald Tusk, the president of the European council, made an 11th-hour intervention on Tuesday, calling on Puigdemont to respect the constitutional order and not do anything that would hinder dialogue, only Switzerland has shown itself willing to step in to mediate the crisis. The European commission has insisted the Catalan question is an internal matter for the Spanish government. Speaking to parliament on Wednesday afternoon, the prime minister categorically dismissed suggestions that the crisis could be solved through international mediation. Explaining that Spain’s indissoluble unity, as guaranteed by the constitution, was not up for discussion, he added: “There is no possible mediation between democratic law and disobedience or illegality.” Where does all this leave Puigdemont? The Catalan president will be hoping that his move to de-escalate the crisis by suspending the effects of the declaration will spur the international community into action. However, his gamble has angered many Catalan independence campaigners who had been expecting a blunt and immediately binding declaration. His junior coalition partners, the far-left CUP, had hoped for an unequivocal gesture. “We believed that today was the day to solemnly declare a Catalan republic, and we probably missed an opportunity,” the CUP MP Anna Gabriel said on Tuesday night. More pressingly, the Spanish government may sense weakness in Puigdemont’s position and act accordingly. This article has been amended to make clear that Switzerland has offered to mediate between the two sides, and to provide more information on the referendum results"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/oct/11/brexit-betrayal-uk-fight-equality-isolationism-anti-discrimination","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-11T08:17:36Z","webTitle":"Brexit will be a betrayal of the UK’s fight for equality | Claude Moraes","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/oct/11/brexit-betrayal-uk-fight-equality-isolationism-anti-discrimination","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/oct/11/brexit-betrayal-uk-fight-equality-isolationism-anti-discrimination","fields":{"headline":"Brexit will be a betrayal of the UK’s fight for equality","bodyText":"In the week that the UK government publishes an audit concluding that racial injustice is still a huge problem in Britain, there is a deafening silence on Brexit’s lose-lose meaning for equality and anti-discrimination. One of the saddest consequences of Britain leaving the EU is that it will bring to an end many years in which the UK has actively advanced EU-wide anti-discrimination legislation. From gender equality to equal pay, EU racial equality and equal employment directives that prohibit discrimination on the grounds of disability, sexual orientation, religion and age at work, the UK has played its role in improving the protection of large groups of citizens. And were we staying in the EU, Britain could play a key role in advancing much-needed new legislation on the principle of equal treatment. This holy grail of EU legal reform would ensure the protection of citizens against discrimination on the grounds of religion and belief, disability and age or sexual orientation in employment – and, crucially, in all areas of life that are not yet covered by legislation, for example healthcare, housing or education. At the moment only the ground-breaking race equality directive already covers both employment and all other sectors. Much EU equality and anti-discrimination legislation remains unknown to those who work outside the field. This is often because the casual Euroscepticism of our discourse over the years has ensured that when the UK government transposed EU legislation to meet EU standards or even gold-plated our anti-discrimination legislation to go further, it was often the case that the EU was not even mentioned. At worst, equality and anti-discrimination laws, and employment laws in general, have been denigrated along with the general denigration of the EU and its institutions as a sign of overregulation or interference. In fact, many of our social employment protections are now being reassessed and valued, as an increasingly flexible workforce – often under zero-hours contracts – understands the need for good employment protection. Much of this, as many people are now aware, comes from the EU. But the hugely positive contribution of the UK in Brussels on behalf of a wide variety of vulnerable groups has been overlooked back in Britain. This is particularly dispiriting when we consider that the overall effect of Britain’s input has been to provide good standards of protection for large sections of society, such as older people. These are now mainstream priorities where the effect of improving standards and laws is critical. Anti-discrimination campaigners meeting at the European parliament this week considered the impact of Brexit on their work. These are people who have tried to improve the rights of LGBT communities or to fight racism, and have done so together across Europe because they understand that the EU is a community of values and not just a single market. They also know their struggles are far from over, with homophobia rising again and racism a day-to-day reality for non-white European citizens. Brexit’s impact on the EU and equality will have some surprising outcomes. A small one is the number of non-white MEPs – currently only 1.6% of the total number of 751 – and around half are from the UK. After Brexit the European parliament will become even less diverse. This makes the rise in populism and hate crimes even more alarming. Institutions that protect minorities, such as the Fundamental Rights Agency – as well as the hundreds of community groups, NGOs and equality bodies that dispense vital legal advice – require support. But the EU losing the UK as a net contributor could damage funding for rights overall. UK organisations working in equality and nondiscrimination are at risk of becoming more isolated and losing the advantages of fruitful dialogue with their European counterparts. As Brexit approaches, there are serious concerns on two levels: watering down anti-discrimination legislation in the UK; and a possible UK bill of rights that would mean withdrawal from the European convention on human rights, already being advocated by many on the Eurosceptic right. The equality agenda in the EU has by no means kept at bay the rise in populism and discrimination, Islamophobia and antisemitism, especially in the context of the refugee and migration crisis. However, it has always been critical for the EU to legislate in this area, given the imperative that its citizens should be able to live, work and study in any EU country, free from discrimination. Everyone understands that the Brexit referendum took place in an atmosphere of anti-immigrant and isolationist rhetoric that has continued to divide the UK. The challenge post-Brexit, even under a principled and committed Labour government, will be to ensure that equality and human rights continue to be treated as priorities. In the worst-case scenario, we face an isolationist Britain in the field of anti-discrimination and equality, one that becomes regressive because it has less funding for equality bodies. I’m worried that the government will end up betraying generations of vulnerable people. • Claude Moraes is a Labour MEP, and chairs the European parliament’s civil liberties, justice and home affairs committee"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"sport/2017/oct/10/aiba-president-wu-ching-kuo-suspended","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-10T19:06:05Z","webTitle":"Aiba’s Wu Ching-kuo suspended after financial mismanagement claims","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/oct/10/aiba-president-wu-ching-kuo-suspended","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/oct/10/aiba-president-wu-ching-kuo-suspended","fields":{"headline":"Aiba’s Wu Ching-kuo suspended after financial mismanagement claims","bodyText":"The controversial leader of amateur boxing’s governing body, Aiba, has been suspended from his role after allegations of “financial mismanagement” and corruption with a return to post highly unlikely. Wu Ching-kuo’s turbulent 11-year reign is set to end after the Aiba disciplinary commission voted unanimously to suspend him. The 70-year-old is alleged to have accumulated debt of 15m Swiss francs for the organisation through poor financial management and auditing. He is also accused of trying to depose the members of Aiba’s executive committee who challenged his leadership. This year an executive committee member was removed by Wu after raising questions about possible “deficiencies and irregularities” in Aiba’s finance and governance – before being dramatically reinstated by Swiss courts. In its decision, the disciplinary commission ordered “the immediate suspension of president Ching-Kuo Wu from the presidency of Aiba, including, but not limited to, suspension of all powers, functions, duties, and responsibilities associated with the office of Aiba president”. An extraordinary congress is due to be held next month with all the national federations present and a vote on Wu’s future will be held. It is thought he is unlikely to receive the backing required to remain at the helm of the organisation. Aiba is no stranger to controversy. At the Rio Olympics last summer the organisation was pilloried after a series of dubious decisions. The Irish boxer Michael Conlan claimed he had been “robbed” in his fight with the Russian Vladimir Nikitin.

Cooper’s new role as the first-choice rider for Potts’s runners from British stables means that he will also be aboard Finian’s Oscar, a leading novice hurdler last year and one of the new season’s most exciting chasing prospects, if he makes his much-anticipated debut over fences at Chepstow this weekend. Robbie Power, who has been riding for Potts both in Ireland and Britain in recent months and took the Cheltenham Gold Cup aboard the owner’s Sizing John in March, will continue his association with Potts but only aboard horses – including Sizing John – that are stabled in Ireland. Colin Tizzard, who received horses in the Potts string for the first time last season and trains an increasing number of the owner’s runners, suggested recently that Cooper “might ride a few” for the stable in the coming season. In fact, Cooper is now likely to become a familiar face on British tracks, and on Tizzard-trained runners in particular, having previously ridden almost exclusively in Ireland apart from the major festival meetings at Cheltenham and Aintree in the spring. “It’s fantastic,” Cooper said on Tuesday. “I can’t believe it, to be honest. I’m definitely looking forward to it and it’s a great opportunity. They have some fantastic horses. I haven’t spoken to Colin or anybody, but I’ll be there [in the Tizzard yard] on Thursday morning and I imagine I’ll know a bit more then.” Cooper landed his first high-profile job in 2014 when he took over from Davy Russell as O’Leary’s principal jockey, and he enjoyed a number of big-race successes for Ireland’s biggest owner, including victory in the 2016 Cheltenham Gold Cup aboard Don Cossack. His three-year spell in the role was plagued by injuries, however, and he missed a number of important winners as a result, including the victory of Petit Mouchoir in this year’s Irish Champion Hurdle. Danny Mullins and Jack Kennedy, who rides regularly for Don Cossack’s trainer Gordon Elliott, had both started to pick up regular rides in O’Leary’s purple colours and the Gigginstown operation announced in July that it would not employ a No1 jockey this season. It seemed that Cooper’s opportunities at the top level might be limited this season as a result, but the link-up with Potts and Tizzard should ensure that he gets plenty of chances to add further Grade One wins to the 34 already on his record. In addition to Finian’s Oscar, a dual Grade One winner last season and a 6-1 chance with Hills to win any race at next year’s Cheltenham Festival, Cooper will also be the new rider aboard Fox Norton, a dual Grade One winner last year and a leading ante-post contender for the King George at Kempton on Boxing Day, and Alary, a big-money purchase from France last season who has not, as yet, lived up to his billing as a live Gold Cup contender. The only cloud over Cooper’s immediate future is the lack of any significant recent rain at Chepstow, where Tizzard has several promising runners entered on Saturday in addition to Finian’s Oscar. Alary is in the field for a valuable handicap hurdle, while Vision Des Flos, who took the prestigious Land Rover Bumper at the Punchestown Festival in April, could make his hurdling debut in the first race on the card. “It is very much up in the air at the minute because of the ground,” Tizzard said. It is getting harder by the day and I don’t want to run any of them on firm ground, not just Finian’s Oscar. There is a bit of rain due tomorrow, but we will see what happens.

The team’s current left-winger, James McClean, did not go to college but he has views on those subjects that have earned him a degree of scorn from people who object simplistically to his refusal to wear a poppy on Remembrance Day. Another reason some Premier League followers dislike the West Bromwich Albion winger is that his skillset is limited and his tackling does not always recognise the border between full‑blooded and over-the-top. Those are fairer criticisms but, on the other hand, they also allude to the reason why McClean has many admirers: if a footballer plays for years in the Premier League despite not being blessed with much finesse, then he must have exceptional quantities of other qualities, such as energy, moxie and commitment to a cause. McClean has those by the bucketload – along with, yes, a splash of finesse, as he demonstrated when firing in the winning goal against Wales on Monday. That is why he has been the outstanding player of the Republic of Ireland’s World Cup qualification campaign so far and the perfect on-field ambassador for their manager, his fellow Derryman Martin O’Neill. If McClean did not exist, O’Neill would have to invent him. Although Ireland’s captain, David Meyler, said that the manager worked meticulously on team shape before the showdown in Cardiff, giving precise collective and individual instructions, O’Neill tends not to preach an elaborate philosophy; rather his greatest managerial strength is his ability to transmit a spirit, a rousing cussedness whereby he and, to an extent, his team seem happiest when making opponents uncomfortable. No one does that more wholeheartedly and more effectively than McClean. The manager’s approach can seem an irritatingly modest ambition against teams whom Ireland might be able to outclass, but it often works well against supposed superiors, which is why Ireland’s finest exploits in this campaign have been in the away matches against the three countries seeded above them in Group D. They took seven points from the nine available from trips to Austria, Serbia and Wales. In the two victories from those matches – in Austria and Wales – McClean scored the decisive goals with crisp finishes that made light of the high stakes. Those finishes showed maturity and polish, proving there is a decent and improving craftsman there as well as a formidable warrior. He also scored twice in the win in Moldova. With four goals he is Ireland’s highest scorer in the qualifiers. Overall, his 55 caps have brought 10 goals (a very respectable tally for a wide midfielder) and 10 yellow cards – not as many as you might expect for a player of his style and reputation, although it is still true that there are times when he, and the person he is tackling, would be better off if he took a deep breath before diving in. Joe Allen would no doubt agree after being forced off the pitch in Cardiff as a result of being shunted by McClean into Meyler, whether intentionally or out of clumsiness. For most of this campaign, however, McClean has channelled his combativeness well and turned himself into a valuable performer. One senses that composure does not come as naturally to him as it appears to for, say, Callum O’Dowda, the 22-year-old who shone with elegant menace on his first competitive start against Moldova last Friday. O’Dowda was full of dynamic thrust in that match but also made astute decisions, in contrast with the over-eagerness that more experienced payers, including McClean, had shown when chasing an equaliser in September’s home defeat by Serbia. O’Neill must have toyed with the idea of starting O’Dowda in Cardiff – but not for long. Because, lapses and all, McClean has earned his manager’s trust. Before Monday’s match, much was made of the potential consequences to Wales of Gareth Bale’s absence. But O’Neill evidently had not forgotten that Bale did not make much of an impact in March when the sides drew in Dublin. In that match McClean angered the Real Madrid player by ending one of his runs with a robust and perfectly fair challenge in the fourth minute. Bale seemed affronted and distracted thereafter and his most memorable contribution to the match was a splenetic tackle on John O’Shea for which he could have been sent off. McClean, by contrast, was declared man of the match for the intelligent and inspiring way in which he harnessed his ability and emotion after a buildup in which he had been given time off to attend the funeral of his friend and former Derry City team-mate Ryan McBride, and also to mourn the death of the former Sinn Féin politician Martin McGuinness, whom he regarded as a friend and hero. McClean scored more goals for Ireland during this campaign than he has mustered in 74 Premier League appearances for West Brom. Maybe that is an indication of the lower quality of international football. Or maybe it is evidence that playing for his country brings the best out of McClean. Either way, he has become a player on whom O’Neill and Ireland can count."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"politics/2017/oct/10/theresa-may-lbc-interview-brexit-john-crace","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-10T19:09:49Z","webTitle":"Maybot adopts radio silence over Brexit | John Crace","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/oct/10/theresa-may-lbc-interview-brexit-john-crace","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/oct/10/theresa-may-lbc-interview-brexit-john-crace","fields":{"headline":"Maybot adopts radio silence over Brexit in LBC interview","bodyText":"It was probably an algorithmic glitch.

When you’re trying to reboot yourself as a caring, sharing prime minister in command of your government after a disastrous conference speech, you need all the help you can get. Presenter Iain Dale homed straight in on that speech. “How did you feel?” he asked, inviting Theresa to open up. And for a short while she did, albeit somewhat awkwardly. She hadn’t quite known what was going on when she had been given the P45 but didn’t feel under any threat. But when Dale pressed her a little further, she instinctively reverted to Maybot. If she had only said: “You know what? I felt like I was dying inside and wanted to run off stage and have a good blub,” then she might have won over her audience. Because that’s the prime minister that everyone who had witnessed her meltdown had seen. Instead she stuck to her programmed script. She had wanted to continue because she had some important things to say about student finance and housing that no one had listened to. “I want a country that works for everyone,” she said. Or should we make that “A Country That Works or Everyon ”? Theresa was also somewhat disingenuous in her insistence that Grant Shapps should have kept his misgivings about her leadership private, as it was her office who had made them public, but she got back more into empathy mode when callers questioned her about the racial disparity audit. After a fashion. “Thank you for saying that things have improved a bit,” she said to Carl, who had just described how pissed off he was at being stopped and searched by the police so frequently. Carl sounded understandably a bit confused, so Dale took over. What was she going to do to make the situation better given that so few black people trusted the Tories? The Maybot wasn’t entirely sure, but when she found out which home secretary had authorised those van adverts telling illegal immigrants to go home or be arrested then she would give her hell. Things really began to fall apart when the topic moved on to Brexit. Nina from Islington wanted to know if she would guarantee EU citizens rights in the UK in the event of no deal. “I’m looking for the best deal,” said the Maybot, failing to engage with the question. “But you’re the one who brought up no deal in your statement yesterday,” Dale pointed out. “No I didn’t,” insisted the Maybot. She clearly needed some more Ram installed. Three times the prime minister refused to give any assurances one way or the other – “It’s technical” she said feebly – before eventually mumbling something about not throwing any EU citizens out of the country. Though pushing them a bit or making them feel so unwelcome that they would want to leave of their own accord were still very much on the table. Dale then asked how she would vote if there was another EU referendum. Now the Maybot was in terminal freefall. “I’m not going to answer hypothetical questions,” she replied, her voice laced with panic. Dale kept going. He knew how he would vote, why couldn’t she say how she would? Would she vote to leave? The Maybot garbled out a barely coherent, non-committal reply. Brilliant. The prime minister had effectively said that she did not believe in her own government’s Brexit position. Then came the Boris question. Would she sack him? “Boris is the foreign secretary,” she said in a depressed monotone. Yes. But was she the prime minister? By now the Maybot was clearly desperate for the interview to come to an end. Her attempt to show herself as both compassionate and in control had backfired badly. Dale had got more out of her in 30 minutes than Jeremy Corbyn had in 15 months of prime minister’s questions. But Dale was having too much fun to stop. “Do you mind if I just ask you a couple more questions,” he asked. The Maybot reluctantly agreed. Which member of the cabinet would she want with her on a desert island? Theresa thought for a minute before replying, “Dr Liam Fox.” Dale could barely contain his surprise. If there’s one cabinet minister everyone can agree is a bit useless, it’s Fox. If all her other answers hadn’t done for her, then that one surely had."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"crosswords/weekend/359","type":"crossword","sectionId":"crosswords","sectionName":"Crosswords","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-18T00:00:16Z","webTitle":"Weekend crossword No 359","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/weekend/359","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/crosswords/weekend/359","fields":{"headline":"Weekend crossword No 359","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/oct/11/morning-mail-catalonia-delays-independence-push","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-10T19:53:27Z","webTitle":"Morning mail: Catalonia delays independence push","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/oct/11/morning-mail-catalonia-delays-independence-push","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/oct/11/morning-mail-catalonia-delays-independence-push","fields":{"headline":"Morning mail: Catalonia delays independence push","bodyText":"Good morning, this is Eleanor Ainge Roy bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Wednesday 11 October. Top stories The Catalan government has suspended its declaration of independence, after hundreds of thousands of people took to the streets across the region and Spain to oppose the move. The Catalan president, Carles Puigdemont, says he will pursue negotiations with Spanish government in the hope of resolving the conflict, pulling the region back from the brink of an unprecedented showdown with Madrid and the worst political crisis to shake Spain for 40 years. The appeasement from Catalonia comes nine turbulent days after the referendum poll, in which 90% of participants voted in favour of splitting from Spain. The referendum was marred by violence after Spanish police acting on court orders attempted to stop the vote, raiding polling stations, seizing ballot boxes, beating voters and firing rubber bullets at crowds. Addressing the Catalan parliament on Tuesday evening, Puigdemont said that while the referendum had given his government a mandate to create an independent republic, he would not immediately declare unilateral independence from Spain. “We propose the suspension of the effects of the declaration of independence for a few weeks, to open a period of dialogue,” he said. “If everyone acts responsibly the conflict can be resolved in a calm and agreed manner.” Hours before the announcement, Donald Tusk, the president of the European Council, appealed directly to Puigdemont to back down. “Diversity should not and need not lead to conflict, the consequences of which would obviously be bad for the Catalans, for Spain and for the whole of Europe,” he said. The allegations against the Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein have intensified, with three women accusing him of rape, and Gwyneth Paltrow and Angelina Jolie saying he sexually harassed them when they were young actors. Asia Argento, an Italian actress and director, Lucia Evans, a former aspiring actor, and one unnamed woman accused Weinstein of forcing them to engage in sex or sex acts in a New Yorker piece written by Ronan Farrow. A spokeswoman for Weinstein said he “unequivocally denied” the allegations of rape. A raft of Hollywood celebrities have now publicly condemned and cut ties with Weinstein since the scandal broke last week, including Dame Judi Dench, Meryl Streep and Kate Winslet. Cometh the hour, cometh the man. Tim Cahill, so often the Socceroos’ saviour, again stood up to be counted when it mattered, scoring twice in a draining 2-1 extra-time win over Syria last night that keeps alive Australian hopes of reaching a fourth consecutive World Cup finals. One last two-legged playoff, likely against Honduras or Panama, awaits Ange Postecoglou’s side. The Coalition’s decision not to extend NBN fibre connections to people’s homes is continuing to blight the scheme. Emergency coordinators around the country are warning executives that households could be cut off from the communications network for days in the event of disasters. The cheaper copper wire connection that Tony Abbott and Malcolm Turnbull insisted should be used instead of fibre will not be robust enough to withstand damage from floods or wildfires, they say. Extending the life of Liddell power station would only increase the cost of energy, while expanding the Snowy hydro scheme would only partially offset the resulting increase in prices. That is the conclusion of analysts at Reputex who also note that spending $900m to prolong the life of coal-burning Liddell would jeopardise 4000MW of new renewable projects. Sport Liverpool’s Sadio Mané has been ruled out of play for six weeks after injuring his hamstring. It is hoped Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain can begin to repay some of Liverpool’s £35m investment in poaching him from Arsenal and take up the slack of mid-field in Mané absence. The International Cricket Council is trying to impose some sort of order on a system that has been growing wild for more than 100 years, with their top executives meeting in Auckland this week to discuss the launch of a World Test Championship, with the league slated to start in 2019. The idea was first mooted in 1997. After 22 years of glacial progress, has this latest burst of action come too late? Thinking time What do we do about Milo? The controversial ex-Breitbart writer and “alt-right” darling Milo Yiannopoulos is touring Australia later this year and Jeff Sparrow says he can’t be ignored – and that protest is the best reaction to his radical ideas. “In general, bad things don’t disappear when we close our eyes,” Sparrow writes. “Historical experience shows that, if they’re not confronted, rightwing extremists flourish, using their meetings and marches to recruit and intimidate.” America’s 2 million truck drivers have been mythologised in popular culture, with their instantly recognisable caps and bottomless coffee consumption at roadside diners. But as self-driving, automated trucks inch ever nearer to American roads, what will become of the American trucker, when this distinctive way of life is no more? “I’m scared to death of that [automation],” says Jeff Baxter, an Iowa truck driver. “I can’t operate a pocket calculator!” Tony Abbott’s controversial speech in London, in which he compared climate science to pagan sacrifice, was the definition of climate denial mythology and scare-mongering, Graham Readfearn writes. He says the former prime minister’s speech was “chock-full of internal contradictions”, including Abbott’s suggestion there may be a conspiracy to tamper with temperature readings while admitting that the globe was warming. What’s he done now? Donald Trump has challenged his secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, to an IQ test and suggested the outcome is a foregone conclusion. Responding to the allegation that Tillerson called the president “a moron” earlier in the year, Trump told Forbes magazine: “I think it’s fake news. But if he did [say] that, I guess we’ll have to compare IQ tests. And I can tell you who is going to win.” Media roundup The Courier Mail reports on ex-Ipswich mayor Paul Pisasale, who is facing allegations of corruption, fraud and perjury.

Inner London’s location, its dense road network and high buildings mean that it suffers from poorer air quality than many parts of the country. We are assisting the mayor of London by developing a low emission neighbourhood, leading a London-wide clampdown on idling engines, and banning diesel from our own fleet. We have created a City Air App, which gives low pollution travel routes to over 20,000 Londoners and use our planning powers to ensure new buildings are energy efficient and low emission. This is having a positive effect and we welcome the mayor’s decision that from 1 January 2018 all newly registered taxis are zero-emissions capable. But more needs to be done. We want to see existing diesel private hire vehicles removed from fleets as soon as possible to protect the public from exposure to toxic diesel emissions – with current licences phased out by 2020. Jeremy Simons Chairman of the environment committee, City of London Corporation • It’s deplorable that we continue to expose our children to lethal levels of air pollution. Such pollution is harmful to everyone, but for children the risk to their health is even higher. Their exposure is much greater and they absorb and retain pollutants in the body for longer. The mayor’s plans to tackle pollution by introducing the T-charge in central London from 23 October 2017 and a low emission zone in 2019 are welcome, but 9,500 Londoners a year are dying prematurely due to air pollution now. We need more widespread action and we need it sooner. The focus has to be on reducing car use. Motorised traffic is the biggest source of air pollution and a huge 23% of peak-time traffic is made up from those on the school run. One of the easiest and most effective ways to improve air quality is to enable more families to walk to school. Air pollution is a growing problem for all of our major towns and cities, with the Guardian and Greenpeace’s joint investigation in April finding that over 2,000 schools are within 150 metres of a road emitting illegal levels of NO2. The solution is the same across the UK: we need to create safe walking routes and encourage more children to walk to school. October is International Walk to School Month; it’s time to join the rest of the world in taking steps to fight air pollution.

Nicholas Purnell QC, for the defence, gave the example of March 2014 when the finance team forecast a monthly sales shortfall of £108m versus internal targets for the UK food business – only for that figure to be reduced by £32m some 24 hours later. “I’m simply pointing out it can move overnight from £108m to £75.6m,” said Purnell. “I’m pointing out what can happen in a business as complex as Tesco.” Carl Rogberg, the former finance director of Tesco UK, John Scouler, the former commercial director for food, and Christopher Bush, the former managing director of Tesco UK, have all been charged with one count of fraud by abuse of position and one count of false accounting. The three men deny any wrongdoing and have pleaded not guilty. The case relates to an alleged hole in Tesco’s accounts revealed by the grocer in September 2014. The supermarket admitted it had previously overestimated profits by about £250m. The Serious Fraud Office launched a criminal investigation into accounting practices at Tesco in October 2014. Purnell was questioning Amit Soni, the whistleblower who alerted the grocer’s most senior management to a £250m profits misstatement in 2014. His warning prompted the company to make a statement to the London Stock Exchange that wiped £2bn from the value of the business. Referring to the altered forecast Soni explained: “More information was available ... that suggested the gap to budget was going to be lower.” Purnell suggested the change in the numbers was the “hangover” or “legacy” of something that happened at every period end as events “just before the close and the clean-up immediately after” were taken into account. The trial continues."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"fashion/2017/oct/14/mens-fashion-jury-harry-styles-justin-trudeau-skepta","type":"article","sectionId":"fashion","sectionName":"Fashion","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-14T06:00:00Z","webTitle":"The men’s fashion jury on Harry Styles, Skepta, Justin Trudeau and more","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2017/oct/14/mens-fashion-jury-harry-styles-justin-trudeau-skepta","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/fashion/2017/oct/14/mens-fashion-jury-harry-styles-justin-trudeau-skepta","fields":{"headline":"The men’s fashion jury on Harry Styles, Skepta, Justin Trudeau and more","bodyText":"Justin Trudeau Reverend Richard Coles, musician turned vicar, broadcaster and Strictly contestant He’s a handsome fellow, but he looks like he’s wearing the sartorial version of dad dancing. Greg Rutherford, British long jump champion and Olympic gold medallist White trousers terrify me. Not just because they’re very “female divorcee having a moment”, but because I’d need so much Daz to make sure my children didn’t ruin them before I left the house. Rick Edwards, author of Science(ish), presenter and broadcaster He’s dressed like the world’s most average man. I guess the belt is interesting. I can never get these to work, so maybe I’m feeling repressed jealousy. Stephen K Amos, comedian If you saw Donald Trump dressed like that, you’d think, “No, that’s not right.” But Trudeau looks like he’s about to go boating. Helen Seamons, the Guardian’s menswear fashion editor JT could have tried a bit harder with his Pride look. The stripy belt wants to be a rainbow, but is four colours short. White jeans are too high-maintenance for real life, and on a march everyone’s mobile with refreshments, which to my mind equates to higher odds of spillages. Donald Glover RC He looks smashing. Purple was my favourite colour as a child, but I can’t wear it now because I’m not a bishop. Still, I do love to see it on others. GR It’s all too matchy-matchy for me, but I do like suits in unconventional colours, so props for that. Childish Gambino isn’t afraid of fashion, so he (and he alone) can pull this off. RE He’s wearing something awful, but he looks fantastic, so I’m confused by this image. He seems to be taking style cues from the Joker, a natty dresser but also a comic book villain – not a group generally renowned for being style icons. SKA The suit is amazing, the colour complements his skin tone, it’s very smartly cut; he just looks incredibly chic. HS Three cheers for Donald Glover and red carpet risk-taking. Full marks for his “dress for the award you want” strategy: nothing sets off gold better than purple, a regal classic, and what could be a better accessory than two Emmys? Skepta RC I adore this look. He looks like a super-cool undertaker. Sadly, it’s not one I could adopt: there’s a fine line between compelling and sinister. GR The sunglasses, the shirt, the coat, the trousers, the shoes… everything was going great, until he visited Claire’s Accessories. RE I really like this. The coat length is perfect, and I like the cuffs just poking out: it looks fitted and well-tailored. He looks excellent. I’m quite jealous. SKA He needs the shades to block out the glare coming off that brooch. Last time I saw a brooch that fine was on my grandmother, Constance. HS Do you know what that crystal brooch is? It’s the medal for the fastest wearing of a catwalk look after a show (Burberry). He might even have taken it off the model’s back as they passed by. Bonus points for the beret, the on-trend hat this winter. John Legend RC I always have to wear black – it’s part of the uniform of being a high church vicar – so I rather like something patterned. It’s certainly an interesting look. GR I love the bomber. I think it’d look better with a plain black T, but who am I to argue with a bloke who’s married to Chrissy Teigen? RE I like the trousers. I’m all about a drawstring waistband these days: what a treat for your waist. But then there’s the thorny issue of what the hell he’s doing with his top half. It makes your eyes go funny. SKA I’m convinced that the T-shirt is attached to the jacket. Like one of those jumper-shirt combos you might have worn to school. HS It’s quite Hampton Court gift shop, no? A tapestry menagerie from Henry VIII’s banqueting hall reimagined as a men’s twinset. I don’t hate it, but I am pretty sure my mum has the tea towel. Harry Styles RC He has budgies on his moobs: they look as if they’re flying away from his armpits. I think this is a wonderful fashion thing that I’m just not getting. GR I tend to wear a lot of black myself, and you can’t go wrong with a black skinny jean, but the shirt gets a thumbs down. I really like birds, but swallows? That’s been done to death. Now, if it were a pair of pigeons, I might be on board. RE I like the shirt a lot. It reminds me of a souvenir jacket, in shirt form. SKA With that face and mane of hair, he can wear what he likes. Just look at the name, Harry Styles: he’s an originator of trends, not a follower. HS Full disclosure: in my eyes, Harry can’t put a foot wrong. The boots are bang on trend and I love this shirt – it’s quite a meta choice, and matches his chest tattoos. Armie Hammer RC This outfit is high in my esteem – it’s the only thing I could possibly imagine wearing. Although I would look like someone who’d retired early and run out of money. Still, on him it’s very guy-next-door-who-has-a-six-figure-income. GR If a zombie apocalypse struck, this is what I’d want to be wearing. RE He’s essentially wearing my winter look so I’m all for it. SKA Brown shoes with the right outfit can work, but I’m not sure here. HS This is a perfectly fine casual look from Hammer, but it does look a bit like he forget he was supposed to be at an event and has abandoned his shopping trolley in the cereal aisle and dashed here. Verdict: a little underwhelming but the components are all good staples. Nice sweatshirt. Noel Fielding RC I admire the liveliness of this ensemble - it’s distinctive and unusual. GR If my memory serves me correctly Noel Fielding once wore a smock dress emblazoned with his own face, so this isn’t the zaniest of outfit choices. It’s not necessarily that the outfit’s awful, more that the fur on the gilet is matted to the point it looks as though it’d wield the faint aroma of fox piss and doughnuts. RE You can’t really judge Noel by other fashion standards because he’s 100% doing his own thing. You still look at him and think that’s a hot man, because it’s carried off with such zeal. SKA I’d imagine a lot of this comes from a vintage shop, though of course we all know that when we say ‘vintage’ what we actually mean is ‘secondhand’… they may even be a dead person’s clothes. He looks great. HS Noel marches to the beat of a different style drum to most of us. I’m a fan of his jazzy GBBO shirt collection, but not these sausage-skin jeans teamed with one of Kate Moss’s castoff gilets circa 2011, though he looks happy enough.

Salvator Mundi, one of the 15 or so known to be by the artist, was lost for centuries before its authenticity was confirmed in 2011. Christie’s in New York on Tuesday unveiled what it called “the biggest discovery of the 21st century” – the haunting, mesmerising painting of Christ holding a crystal orb in his left hand and raising his right in benediction. Salvator Mundi (Saviour of the World) was, and is, enormously significant because of its rarity. It is the first discovery of a Leonardo painting since 1909. Loic Gouzer, Christie’s chair of postwar and contemporary art in New York, said bringing it to the market was a “once in a lifetime” honour. “Salvator Mundi was painted in the same timeframe as the Mona Lisa, and they bear a patent compositional likeness,” he said. “Leonardo was an unparalleled creative force, and a master of the enigmatic. “Standing in front of his paintings, it becomes impossible for one’s mind to fully unravel or comprehend the mystery radiating from them – both the Mona Lisa and Salvator Mundi are perfect examples of this. No one will ever be able to fully grasp the wonder of Leonardo’s paintings, just as no one will ever be able to fully know the origins of the universe.” News of the painting’s existence emerged in 2011 when it was included in the National Gallery’s blockbuster Leonardo exhibition. It was known that Leonardo had produced a painting of that name, but it was assumed it had long ago been destroyed. The work, painted between 1506-13 for King Louis XII of France, has a fascinating history. In the mid-17th century it was listed in an inventory of the collection of Charles I of England, and it is thought to have hung in the private chambers of his wife, Henrietta Maria of France. It was later in the collection of their son, Charles II. The next reference to the work is in 1763 when it was in a sale organised by Charles Herbert Sheffield, the illegitimate son of the Duke of Buckingham. He ordered the auction of artworks following the sale of what is now Buckingham Palace to the king. It then disappeared for 140 years – until 1900, when it was bought by Sir Charles Robinson as a work by Bernardino Luini, a follower of Leonardo. It went into the Cook Collection at Doughty House in Richmond, southwest London, and remained there until the collection was dispersed. The painting next appeared at a Sotheby’s auction in 1958, where it sold for £45. It then disappeared again until it was purchased at a small regional auction house in the US by a consortium of American businesspeople in 2005. At this point, it was attributed to one of Leonardo’s pupils, Giovanni Antonio Boltraffio, but clearly there was a hunch – a desperate hope perhaps – that the work was by the master himself. Six years after that purchase, following research and authentication which involved the world’s leading Leonardo experts, it was confirmed as the real deal and was the star of the National Gallery show. Alan Wintermute, a senior specialist in old master paintings at Christie’s, called it the “holy grail” of old masters. “To see a fully finished, late masterpiece by Leonardo, made at the peak of his genius, appear for sale in 2017 is as close as I’ve come to an art world miracle,” he said. “It has been more than a century since the last such painting turned up and this opportunity will not come again in our lifetime. I can hardly convey how exciting it is for those of us directly involved in its sale.” Since its discovery, it has been through more twists and turns with, at one point, Dallas Museum aggressively raising money to buy the painting to help make the city an “arts destination”. It is understood to have been sold privately for more than $75m in 2013. The painting is to travel to Hong Kong, San Francisco and London before it is sold by Christie’s in New York on 15 November. Unusually, it will be sold at the auction house’s big postwar and contemporary art sale, “a testament to the enduring relevance” of the picture, said Gouzer.

When the prime minister was taking questions about her Brexit plans on Monday, Anna Soubry, Conservative MP for Broxtowe, asked about the no-deal scenario – whether the UK would “jump off the cliff”. At which point a male voice, dripping with derision, chimed in: “There is no cliff!” Hansard doesn’t record the source of the intervention. It could have been one of dozens of Tories who despise talk of cliffs. The prime minister is not among them. She has been taken on an illustrated tour of the edge by her advisory council of business leaders. They describe the elevation and the effect of high-velocity impact: the return of customs controls; barriers to trade; the rupture of supply chains; investors rerouting money and jobs to the continent. May had come to the Commons fresh from a meeting with those experts in economic gravity, and duly restated her intention to negotiate an “implementation phase”, to run for two years after departure day. It will look rather like EU membership, with mutual market access “on current terms”. Hardliners hate this idea, smelling betrayal – a plot, driven by the Treasury, to enact “Brexit in name only”. They mistrust the prime minister’s assurance that she is only easing the outward path. But they also don’t want a parachute because they crave the giddy surge of adrenaline that comes from a giant leap. There is a contradiction here that the likes of John Redwood and Bernard Jenkin do not acknowledge, perhaps even to themselves. To make “no deal” sound acceptable, they must belittle the scale of upheaval, yet the only reason for accepting it would be to accelerate drastic change. They do not acknowledge the cliff but they dream of launching from its edge, soaring over the Atlantic once the EU shackles are broken. The psychology of this is rooted in pre-Brexit Conservative folklore. It starts in veneration of Margaret Thatcher’s pugnacious dismantling of state-run industry in the 1980s. I don’t intend here to relitigate the case for and against those reforms. The point, for the Brexiters, is not whether Thatcher’s vision was the best one (this is beyond question in Tory theology), but that it could be done only by economic violence. The status quo needed smashing. Tories have subsequently defined political heroism as willingness to inflict tough love. As John Major put it in 1989, when serving as Thatcher’s chancellor: “The harsh truth is that if it isn’t hurting, it isn’t working.” He was talking about controlling inflation, but the maxim has become liturgy in the church of Conservative radicalism. Interrogate the Brexit no-dealers on detail and they concede that their plan hinges on a doctrine of pain for gain. They advocate the abandonment of tariffs, inviting the world’s exporters to flood Britain with their wares. Thus would a beacon of free trade be lit on Albion’s shores, inspiring others to repent of their protectionist tendencies. This might bring cheap produce to supermarket shelves (consumer gain) but sabotage UK farmers, who would be undercut by an influx of American and Antipodean meat (producer pain). Manufacturers would suffer too, but that is an intended consequence of opening the doors to invigorating winds of competition. The whole point is to sweep away inefficiency and blow down zombie businesses while fanning the flames of innovation. In this model, the UK economy is a vast pre-Thatcher coalfield that refuses to accept its obsolescence and must be made to confront it by force. If the timid will not jump into the future, they must be pushed. There are countless problems with this, not least the inane strategy of unilateral economic disarmament, surrendering upfront any leverage with the US and others ahead of trade talks. Britain already has an open, liberal, globalised economy. It has problems with low productivity, an underpaid workforce, patchy infrastructure and, thanks to Brexit, regulatory uncertainty. It is unclear how those issues are addressed by setting fire to agriculture and industry, then waiting for phoenixes to rise from the ashes. What fascinates me is hard Brexiters’ blindness to the political consequences of a pain-for-gain doctrine. Have they not visited places where voting Conservative is culturally taboo? Do they still not understand how the experience of rapid deindustrialisation produced anti-Tory allergens in the communal bloodstream? Can they not imagine the anger of people who feel pain without the gain? For a party so doctrinaire about markets, the Tories are strangely uninterested in the balance of supply and demand in the business of government. They have spent seven years cutting the supply side and waiting for demand to shrink too. But people are stubbornly attached to the idea that politicians should help them through hard times. Voters might resent high taxes and unresponsive public services, but the idea of the state as the enemy is the preserve of an ideological fringe. A lesson of the past few years is that fear of economic abandonment stokes protectionism and nationalism. Backbenchers warn darkly of a public backlash if the Treasury is allowed to dilute Brexit, but it is hard to think of a better formula for inflaming Trumpian rage than the brutal shock accompanying the no-deal scenario. The smarter leave campaigners knew the limited appeal of turbo-Thatcherism, which is why they pretended that £350m would be available to subsidise free public healthcare. It wasn’t that they couldn’t fit “We will break up the NHS at the behest of vast US corporate lobbies” on the side of a bus. And at no point did leave campaigners claim that a deal with the EU was dispensable. They said it would be easy. Only when the cliff comes into view do they start denying its existence, while reaching to grab the wheel from Theresa May to steer towards the edge. As it gets closer, they will switch to saying the leap is necessary and good – that Brussels has blocked the roads, that the icy water below has restorative properties, that Brexit must hurt to work. But for whom? There will be a tiny minority exhilarated and enriched by the ride. The rest will see what is really going on: that we are not flying but falling. • Rafael Behr is a Guardian columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"books/2017/oct/14/john-green-turtles-all-the-way-down-ocd-interview","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-14T11:00:00Z","webTitle":"John Green: ‘Having OCD is an ongoing part of my life’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/oct/14/john-green-turtles-all-the-way-down-ocd-interview","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2017/oct/14/john-green-turtles-all-the-way-down-ocd-interview","fields":{"headline":"John Green: ‘Having OCD is an ongoing part of my life’","bodyText":"There is a scene late in US author John Green’s new novel, Turtles All the Way Down, where his protagonist, Aza Holmes – a bright, troubled teenager, as Green’s heroines generally are – goes through an ordeal so distressing it is difficult to read. Aza has obsessive compulsive disorder, and the “tightening gyre” of her thoughts has taken over. Green catapults his reader right into the middle of Aza’s desperate mental state as she becomes increasingly panicky over the possibility of being infected with the bacterium C. diff – “do you want to die of this do you want to die of this because you will you will you will you will” – eventually scooping handfuls of hand sanitiser into her mouth, gagging and vomiting as her mother tries to stop her. Green, who has OCD himself, says it was “very hard to write”. “I wrote it right at the last, in the last revision. That’s as close to my experience as I could get.” Turtles All the Way Down, Green’s seventh novel and one that is long awaited by his massed armies of fans – he has more than 5 million followers on Twitter – is his “most personal”, says the young adult writer, “in the sense that it’s not entirely confined to the past for me. Having OCD is something that is an ongoing part of my life and I assume will probably be a part of my life for the rest of it.” Green has “had this obsessive thinking problem” since childhood. For a long time it was hard “to talk directly about it, and I felt a lot of embarrassment”; part of writing it into his fiction was a desire “to find some kind of form or expression that would shake it out from within me and allow me to look at it”. Aza – or Holmesy, as she is known to her best friend, Daisy – is Green’s narrator. The novel opens as the girls hear on the radio about the $100,000 reward which has been offered for a fugitive billionaire, Russell Pickett. Aza, it turns out, used to know his son Davis because they’d “gone to Sad Camp together … this place down in Brown County for kids with dead parents”. Daisy convinces Aza that they’ll be able to find Pickett and claim the reward, and the wannabe detectives hop into Aza’s old canoe and paddle down the river to the Pickett mansion. While the novel is filtered through Aza’s perspective, OCD is only one theme. There’s also Daisy’s burgeoning fame as a Star Wars fan fiction writer, Pickett’s decision to leave his fortune to his pet tuatara (a kind of large reptile) and, of course, romance, friendship and high school. It has been nearly six years since Green topped the charts with his sharp, funny, moving story of the romance between two teenagers with cancer, The Fault in Our Stars. That novel was inspired by the time Green spent working as a chaplain in a children’s hospital after university; it has now sold more than 23m copies, been adapted into a hugely successful film, and seen Green named one of the 100 most influential people by Time magazine. No pressure, then, for the follow-up. “In one way it gave me the luxury of time, the ability to take as long as I wanted,” says Green. There were “a few abandoned novels along the way that got kind of scrapped for parts”. But “it’s also true that I felt very scared of writing, because I was in the shadow of this success”, he says, admitting to being “super nervous” about the next novel’s reception. “I remember thinking when I was writing my first book, ‘The great thing if I get the opportunity to do this again will be that I will then know how to write a book.’ Then when it came time to write my second book, I was like, ‘I have no idea how to write a book,’ and each time that was the case. I think that’s part of the reason my books have come out relatively slowly. I seem to have to figure it out anew each time.” His first novel, 2005’s Looking for Alaska, was written while he was working as a publishing assistant and production editor at the book review journal Booklist, entering data and reviewing books and slowly realising this might be something he could do himself. He’d write at night and at the weekend, labouring for three years with his editor at Booklist, a children’s author herself, to turn it into something that was ready to send out to publishers. Drawing on his experiences at boarding school, the book is narrated by Miles Halter, who sets out to “seek a Great Perhaps”, in the words of Rabelais, at Culver Creek boarding school. There, he meets the beautiful, unsettled Alaska. It didn’t make the bestseller list – that wouldn’t happen until 2012, seven years after it came out, once The Fault in Our Stars had boosted all Green’s backlist – but it did win him one of the US’s biggest young adult prizes, the Printz award. Green would go on to write novels including Paper Towns, about a boy’s quest to find the vanished Margo Roth Spiegelman, “the most fantastically gorgeous creature that God had ever created”. His teenagers, whatever they’re dealing with, are bright, nerdy, articulate and funny, much like Green himself. He has no desire, at the moment, to write an adult novel – it’s clearly that period of flux, of burgeoning adulthood, which draws him in. “I was never very in touch with teenage culture ... what I’m interested in, or most interested in, is the emotional experience of being a teenager,” he says – how teens “approach those experiences without irony”. Now 40, married with two children and living in Indianapolis, Green has memories “of really intense emotional experiences from high school that I draw on a lot. I focus on that and hope I will be forgiven for not understanding Snapchat.” He also began, in 2007, a project that would end up bringing him one of the biggest followings among writers today. He and his brother Hank started sending each other video blogs on YouTube, talking about everything from haircuts to books to world affairs. One begins: “Good morning, Hank. It’s Friday, October 26th. Today I’m going to discuss the political situation in Nepal while eating five sheets of toilet paper.” They have made more than 1,000 videos, which have been viewed more than 600m times. The community call themselves the Nerdfighters – the name comes from Green’s misreading of an arcade game, Aero Fighters, as Nerdfighters – and take as their motto “DFTBA” (“Don’t forget to be awesome”). Through side ventures including Project for Awesome, which sees thousands of people posting videos advocating for charities, they have raised millions for charity.Green has always had “some kind of other job” while he writes, whether it was on Booklist, or writing for the trivia magazine Mental Floss, or more recently working on the educational video series Crash Course, which he launched with his brother in 2012. “I like not having to think of myself as only a writer because that’s sort of stressful,” he says. “I still don’t usually say when I meet people and they ask me what I do that I’m an author … I’d say that I make educational videos, that would be true, and also ends the conversation 99% of the time.” Despite this, when it comes to the world of young adult fiction, it doesn’t get bigger than Green. With great success comes great scrutiny, and Green seems more aware of criticism than most authors. “I never think of myself as being very good,” he says. It’s hard, given his success, not to see this as disingenuous. But the way he picks over the issues in his books gives it the ring of truth: he knows perfectly well what critics dislike about his novels, and Turtles All the Way Down is, in some ways, an answer to them. So what about the accusation that his teenagers are preternaturally smart? “First, I do think teenagers are smart, and we miss out by failing to listen to them or take them seriously,” he says. “I’m much more interested in how we sound to ourselves than how we technically sound.” And anyway, “in this book I try very hard not to [do this]. Aza hardly says anything. Her thoughts are very carefully articulated, but she can’t really articulate them in speech.” He gives short shrift to those who accuse him of populating his books with a series of beautiful troubled girls. Paper Towns was, he says, written “very aggressively against” the trope of the manic pixie dream girl, while “I hope that Aza does not come across as a manic pixie dream girl – I don’t think she exists to solve Davis’s problems.” Her OCD, meanwhile, means it’s almost impossible for her to have a normal romantic relationship. Green has addressed critics online, acknowledging what he sees as his weaknesses – “I tell too much and show too little. My plots are thin. I’m too fond of turning phrases” – while taking on those criticisms he sees as unfair: “all this crap about how I fetishise brokenness and lift up misogynistic constructions of young women and romanticise suicide is just, I think, totally unfair”. And he has been very careful, he says now, not to romanticise Aza’s OCD. “I do think we stigmatise mental illness a lot in our culture … we don’t devote nearly enough resources to its treatment so people who can’t afford or access high-quality mental healthcare are doubly disadvantaged. I also think that we at times romanticise mental illness – the reason I wanted Aza to be nicknamed Holmesy is that, while I love Sherlock Holmes, my experience has been that my OCD would make me a terrible detective. In the first chapter, Aza doesn’t notice that her best friend has dyed her hair, she’s so deep inside herself. I do not feel my obsessiveness has come with a secret power … It comes with a complete inability to apprehend the world outside of myself unless I treat my mental health problems consistently and with care. So I really wanted to try and write against those stigmas and romanticisations.” Aza’s core problem is one Green understands intimately. “She is forced to think thoughts that she doesn’t want to think and she’s unable to choose what she thinks about for extended periods of time. That can be really destabilising … If I am beholden to these thoughts, then what are the implications of that for me being a sovereign creature of free will, or at least enough of an illusion of free will that I can make my way through the day without having to feel this constant onslaught of fear that I’m just a passenger in this skin-encased bacterial colony that is my body? “Aza’s problem is not only the obsessive thought spirals or the compulsive behaviour she uses to manage them,” he continues. “The problem is also that these thoughts really undermine her entire sense of self. That’s something I am pretty familiar with … I find it profoundly scary not to feel like I’m able to choose my thoughts, and it’s also just exhausting and infuriating: when it’s happening you feel like it’ll never end. I’m also really lucky that this is mostly treatable in my case and there are things I can do to make it better.” “There have been periods when this has been a disabling part of my life and there have been periods when this has been a pretty small part of my life,” he says. Turtles All the Way Down is intended to show how “most people with chronic mental illnesses also live long, fulfilling lives”. • Turtles All the Way Down is published by Puffin.

It hails the people who put themselves out there in pursuit of their art. It eulogises the addicts, the ill, the unpredictable, the ones in whom the flame burns bright. It tends not to lavish such affection on those who keep the fire alight, doing the grunt work of going outside to chop up the logs, drying them out and putting them on the fire to feed the flames. Hence the lack of excitement about the Beach Boys’ Mike Love announcing his solo record Unleash the Love. Admittedly, it’s hard to get enthusiastic about an album that includes a rerecording of Do It Again featuring former ER star John Stamos on drums, but lack of excitement turned into open mockery on social media, where music writers rolled their eyes at the latest hubristic gesture from the man who is rumoured to have told Brian Wilson, as he stretched his artistic wings in the 1960s: “Don’t fuck with the formula.” But lots of bands have their Mike Love. That’s because they need one. The Mike Love keeps the band going. The Mike Love makes sure all the members are in the right place at the right time (or makes sure there is someone capable of doing that on the band’s staff), makes sure there is a right place – a gig or a studio – to be, makes sure everyone will be able to make a living. But being the Mike Love means being the enemy of rock’n’roll. If you’re the Mike Love, you’re the breadhead with no art. Mick Jagger is a Mike Love. As Keith Richards drifted further into drug addiction, it was Jagger who kept the wheels on the Rolling Stones’ bus. It was Jagger who had to salvage the band’s career when Richards was arrested for possession of heroin in Toronto, causing the record companies who had been queuing up to sign the band to flee in terror. It was Jagger who had to deal with not only Richards, but also Ronnie Wood freebasing cocaine. It was Jagger who oversaw the Stones’ transformation in the 1980s into rock’s most efficient moneymaking machine – thereby ensuring lifelong security for Richards, Wood and everyone else connected with the Stones. His thanks for that was to be mocked in Richards’ autobiography for having a small penis – and to feel the audience direct their love towards his bandmate every times the Stones play. Johnny Ramone was a Mike Love. Throughout much of the 1980s, he was leading a band in which Dee Dee Ramone was a committed heroin addict, Marky Ramone was an alcoholic and Joey Ramone struggled to function, owing to his obsessive compulsive disorder and other mental health problems. Oh, and Johnny and Joey barely to spoke to each other after Joey’s girlfriend left him for Johnny, whom she duly married. Through that, Johnny kept the Ramones working and on the road, making money, despite never achieving stardom, and helping to secure their legacy. He even consented to Joey’s song The KKK Took My Baby Away – the KKK being Johnny – appearing on their album Pleasant Dreams. Of course, it’s Joey who was loved, while Johnny was viewed as the martinet Republican taskmaster. Roger Waters was a Mike Love: he had to take responsibility for forcing out Pink Floyd’s co-founder, Syd Barrett, and recalibrate them into something different, something that could last. He might be regarded as capricious, controlling and cold, but no Waters means no Wish You Were Here and no The Dark Side of the Moon. No ongoing career for David Gilmour, the former Floyd member of whom it’s OK to think well. Mike Love, naturally, is the ultimate Mike Love and he is widely despised for it: for being a bully, for forcing Brian Wilson into things he was unfit to do, for claiming credit for things he deserves no credit for, for turning the Beach Boys into his personal fiefdom. Well, faced with the incapacities of Brian and the wildness of Dennis Wilson – the man who, let’s not forget, brought Charles Manson into the Beach Boys’ camp – what was he meant to do? Love, as the Beach Boys might put it, kept the summer alive. When Brian was barely able to write, he reinvented the Beach Boys as “America’s band”, making them as popular in the mid-1970s as they had been in their heyday. The musicians who become Mike Loves do so because they are the ones who have the clearest understanding that music is a career. They have to concentrate on the tedious logistics because, if they don’t, nobody is going to eat. That’s when they become regarded as the money-grubbing jerks. But there are Mike Loves who have avoided the fate of becoming despised. Johnny Marr was the Smiths’ Mike Love – he had to manage the band, deal with Morrissey’s caprices, face up to the fact that Andy Rourke had slipped into heroin addiction and keep the group churning out music. No wonder he decided he had had enough and slipped away to just be a guitar player. The Mike Loves never get the credit they are due. In rock’s great cast of Friends, they are the perpetual Gunther, the one in whom we have no emotional investment. Well, without the Mike Loves, there would be no Brian Wilsons to adore. So, let’s hear it – even if only quietly – for the derided heroes without whom rock’n’roll would long since have curled up despairingly into the foetal position.

A statement from the Registered Organisations Commission: Investigation into the National Office and the Victorian Branch of the Australian Workers’ Union (AWU), under Section 331 of the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Act 2009. The Registered Organisations Commission (ROC) commenced an investigation on 20 October 2017 into whether donations made to GetUp Limited during the financial year ending 2006 were approved under the AWU’s Rules and separately, whether donations to a range of recipients during the financial year ending 30 June 2008 were approved under the AWU’s Rules. Those investigations relate to whether the making of any of these donations amounted to contraventions of numerous civil penalty provisions of the predecessors to the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Act 2009 (RO Act). Since the investigation commenced, the ROC received information which raised reasonable grounds for suspecting that documents relevant to this investigation may be on the premises of the AWU (at both its Sydney National office and its Victorian Branch office) and that those documents may be being interfered with (by being concealed or destroyed). The ROC has put the information to a magistrate, who earlier today issued warrants under section 335K of the RO Act to enter the Sydney National office and the Victorian Branch office of the AWU to seize documents related to the ROC’s investigation. The RO Act provides that warrants under section 335K authorise the Australian Federal Police, with other assistance, to enter premises, search for and seize documents. This afternoon, officers of the AFP executed these search warrants in Sydney and Melbourne on behalf of the ROC. Section 337AC of the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Act 2009 (the RO Act) provides that it is an offence for a person to engage in conduct that results in the concealment, destruction or alteration of a document relating to an investigation being conducted, or about to be investigated by the ROC. The ROC is unable to comment further on this matter, as it remains an open investigation. Meanwhile, back in estimates ... A statement from a government spokesperson has just come through: The AFP is completely independent of Government. It is absurd and false to suggest the AFP is in any way politicised. Labor is attacking the independence, integrity and professionalism of the AFP and its officers. This is an offensive slur and a disgraceful distraction. This matter was referred to the Registered Organisations Commission weeks ago and it is important it is allowed to investigate without hysterical smears from Labor. This baseless attack is a repudiation of what Bill Shorten said in 2015: “We recognise that the AFP is independent, they’ll make their own decisions about what they choose to investigate or not and that’s as it should be. We should never forget that when Mr Abbott and his team were in opposition they were constantly writing to the AFP on all sorts of matters. But let’s be very clear here, we believe the AFP’s an independent institution and it makes its own decisions.” (Source: Bill Shorten, doorstop interview: Melbourne: 19 July 2015) *end statement* I’m transcribing as quick as I can, but Brendan O’Connor was speaking exceptionally fast, so it is a little heavy going. Here is a bit more. I am afraid to say, as a result of today, it is clear now that the government is using the power of the state and using taxpayers dollars to attack its political opponents. Nothing has changed since the conduct of the royal commission, this is just a continuation of the same approach by this grubby prime minister, this loser of a prime minster, who when he can not control his own government, when he can not develop any policies he calls the police. He goes on. Let’s look at the history of this government, the royal commission called three Labor leaders, it has never happened in our history, since federation, two prime ministers and a Labor leader called to two royal commissions. And now, we have a situation where we have a registered organisation commission established – what is their first public act? To raid the union offices of the AWU in an attempt to attack them. In an attempt to smear federal Labor and its leader. Now, indeed the prime minister does have questions to answer. He needs to explain what he knew about these raids, what he knew about the role of the commission and indeed the minister, who of course who is responsible for oversight of this commission, the minister for employment must explain exactly the role she had in these raids, because it is quite clear now that if this was a one off I would understand that there might be some scepticism, but it is clear now that there is never an end to the political abuse of commonwealth agencies by this government. When Malcolm Turnbull is in trouble, he calls the police. Brendan O’Connor: What we know is, that the Registered Organisations Commission, a body that was established after the double dissolution has been used by the government, by minister Cash and by the prime minister in an attempt to attack federal Labor and the leader of the opposition. What we know is clearly, as a result of the referral by the minister to the registered organisations commission they have sought to use their coercive powers to deploy police to raid offices to deal with what could be a civil matter at best. Now, let’s look at the pattern of behaviour of this government since it was elected in 2013. They established the royal commission into their political opponents, they summoned three Labor leaders including Bill Shorten to those royal commissions, they had, in sofar as the last royal commission was concerned, they had Bill Shorten in the stand for two days, asking him 900 questions and there were no findings against the federal leader Bill Shorten, and yet this continues. It continues because Malcolm Turnbull when he is under pressure, calls the police. Malcolm Turnbull called the police i relation to senate staff at the beginning of the last federal election, Malcolm Turnbull threatened to call police n the night of the election because he wasn’t happy with the result. Malcolm Turnbull has clearly misused the police. Now today, we of course discovered through senate estimates that there are resource issues with the Australian Federal Police, there are areas that are under resourced to the extent that very serious drug importation crimes are occurring without sufficient resources deployed by the AFP. At the same time that that was uncovered, we have a situation where the government is treating the police as its play thing, using the police to investigate a civil matter, an allegation that was made 10 years ago, about whether in fact money was authorised and provided to a third party. Now it is clear, from anyone watching, any reasonable person, any independent person would be well aware that this is the intervention by the prime minister, an abuse of ministerial power, the abuse of police resources at a time when police should be dealing with far more serious matters. Malcolm Turnbull now must explain what office his office and he played what role his minister and her office played in engaging with the registered organisation commission, a body by the way that federal Labor said we will not support, because it could be used to attack the political opponents of the government. And what has happened? It’s first public foray we see the registered organisation commission was used in a matter in an attempt to attack the federal leader, the federal Labor leader Bill Shorten. Well, we said it was going to be used for base political purposes, it clearly is now being compromised, as a result of the conduct today. As I say, there is a patten of behaviour, a royal commission, a discredited royal commission, we found out the commissioner was raising money for the Liberal party, even so, that royal commission did not find against Bill Shorten after two days of questioning and yet the government is relentless in misusing its powers and misusing the resources of the federal police. “I think it is extremely politically motivated ... our union has been operating for 130 years ... but they are purely looking at Bill Shorten’s time,” Walton says. “Why is the AFP here today, to raid the union offices in search of a couple of pages of historic minutes from 10 years ago,” ask the national secretary, Daniel Walton. The union says it received notification on Friday that an investigation had been opened but had no warning of this step, calling it “extraordinary”. The union boss Sally McManus describes the raids as “an attack on democracy” and “a sad day for democracy”. “None of these allegations, even if they are true, warrant this conduct,” O’Connor says and ends the press conference. O’Connor says “this grubby prime minister is willing to use the police like his play thing” and calls the raids, by a civil regulator, over a matter from 10 years ago “remarkable”. O’Connor: This is a civil regulator and yet we have crime fighters raiding offices because of the role of civil regulator … the priority of this government is about deploying police for civil matters … against their political opponents. He says the government treats the federal police as its “play thing”. O’Connor: I saw the raids happening on television, the first I saw of it, was when it was public ... I did not know of these raids until they were happening and I dare say the federal leader did not know. Of course the media knew, because all the cameras were waiting outside two premises … and indeed the government knew. “He beggars belief that this is not a political raid, it beggars belief,” O’Connor says of the commission’s first public act. He says the prime minister needs to explain what he knew of the raids, what his role was and what Michaelia Cash’s role was. “It is clear now that there is never an end to the political abuse of commonwealth agencies by this government.” He says the raids validate Labor’s decision not to support the Registered Organisations Commission because it believed it would be used against the government’s opponents. He said Labor did not support the ROC “because it will be used for political purposes, base political purposes”. He accused the government of using “taxpayer dollars to its attack its political opponents” and hits out at this “loser prime minister”. Brendan O’Connor has gone live in a press conference slamming the raids on the AWU offices. He is not mincing his words: “Malcolm Turnbull, when he is under pressure, calls the police ... Malcolm Turnbull clearly has misused the police.” He says it is a “civil matter at best” and calls it “an abuse of ministerial power, an abuse of police resources”. The AWU’s Victorian secretary, Ben Davis, has spoken to media outside the union’s Melbourne office. While we’re talking about the AFP and its protection of the prime minister’s Point Piper home, I’ve been reminded of this joke Malcolm Turnbull made on the Today show on 18 October. I’ve got a big power bill but not least because I’ve got a small police station in my garden, as you know. The AFP have just posted a statement in response to the ABC story on the leaked internal memo which dominated question time (and some of the ABC estimates hearing). Tuesday, 24 October 2017, Publish time: 5:31pm The AFP is disappointed an internal working document, which sought to provide confidential operational advice and revealed operational sensitivities, has been made public as this undermines the AFP’s ability to ensure its resources are used efficiently, effectively and appropriately. This is now subject to a Professional Standards investigation. Over the past 12 months, the AFP and its partners have made record drug seizures, dismantled significant and multi-national organised crime syndicates, and disrupted a number of plots with people allegedly planning to carry out terrorist attacks in Australia. The AFP makes decisions daily on operational priorities, resourcing and determining which matters pose the greatest risk to the safety and security to the Australian community, and directing its resources where they are most needed. The AFP has systems in place to manage its resources as flexibly as possible against the highest priorities. The AFP has a broad range of Protection obligations in Sydney (including the AFP’s own people and premises). Protecting Prime Ministers and Australian high office holders has always been part of the AFP’s operational remit. The provisions in place for Prime Minister Turnbull are entirely consistent with both the current enhanced security environment and protection measures in place for previous Prime Ministers. The challenges for law enforcement have evolved significantly over the past decade. This calls for the use of innovative operational practices and techniques, including offshore disruption when the AFP feels that this is the most appropriate way to manage a criminal investigation. Technological advances and increasingly complex criminal methodologies require the use of more specialist capabilities. In this year’s Budget, the Government invested an additional $321.4 million to bolster the AFP’s capability, and ensure the agency is best-placed to combat its future challenges. *end statement* And some more: Labor’s employment spokesman, Brendan O’Connor, has released a statement of his own on the AWU offices’ raids. On the same day Parliament was told that Turnbull’s cuts to the AFP have meant serious crimes like drug smuggling could not be properly investigated, we see these extraordinary raids. Turnbull and his Government openly directed the Commission to start this witch hunt. He is entirely responsible for this turn of events – it’s an alarming misuse of ministerial power. The Liberals have already wasted millions of taxpayers’ dollars on their witch hunt into unions. They will stop at nothing to attack workers and their representatives. This is the NBN raids during the election campaign all over again. Australians will see this for the desperate tactic that it is. *end statement* Sky News has been showing images of the AFP raid on the AWU offices. Looks like it is going to go on for a while. (Just an update on this–Sky are not the only media outlet there, but they are showing live pictures. The raid has been going on for a while and as far as I can see the ABC broke it. Then media outlets headed to the AWU Sydney and Melbourne offices) Over in the legal affairs estimates hearing and George Brandis and Penny Wong have been discussing the appointments of former Coalition MPs to things like the administrative appeals tribunal. It has been jokingly referred to by some wags as the “no Liberal left behind” policy. Wong pointed out that six of the 23 full-time members of the AAT have strong links back to the Liberal party, or 26%. Brandis says that he does not “consider service in parliament as a disqualification”. A rough transcript of some of the afternoon’s hearing follows: Wong: It is the case that the 76 appointments you made on the eve of the election last year, none were made through committee process? Brandis: Most of those appointments were reappointments. [Secretary of AG department] Chris Moraitis: I cannot recall any committee process being used in those appointments, or recently. Wong: How many of all the appointments you made were advertised, or recommended by selection committee? Brandis: [Takes on notice] Wong: Do you recall a selection committee being established at all by this government in any appointments? Moraitis: No. Wong: How many of the appointments that the government has made to the AAT since protocol put in place have been recommended for appointment without any process whatsoever? Brandis: There’s always been a process … Wong: What is it? Brandis: [Neither] Justice Kerr nor [David] Thomas [president of the AAT] have ever raised a complaint with me that they were dissatisfied about how complaints were being handled. Wong: You announced appointments at end of September. Did the president supply you with a list of positions that needed to be filled? If so when? Brandis: I have had a very full process with the president about appointments. Wong: How many were reappointments recommended? How many were publicly advertised ... Brandis: [Takes on notice] Wong: Did you advertise any of them? You don’t remember? Brandis: I want to check. [Takes further questions about full-time v part-time appointments on notice] Wong: You’re responsible for about 95% of appointments to the AAT? Brandis: Sounds about right. I am going to take an educated guess that the AFP raid has something to do with the allegations in this story, published by the Australian yesterday Brad Norington reported: Bill Shorten faces investigation over a large sum of union funds he donated to his own election campaign in 2007 – possibly without proper approval – when he led the Australian Workers Union and first ran for parliament. The Registered Organisations Commission is understood to be inquiring into a $25,000 union payment that Mr Shorten arranged to help his campaign as Labor’s candidate in the federal Victorian seat of Maribyrnong. Also under scrutiny are two other AWU donations to Labor candidates in federal seats that were handled by Mr Shorten when he was in charge of the union — $25,000 for Petrie in Queensland and $20,000 for Stirling in Western Australia. The commission’s investigation of these AWU donations during the 2008 financial year is in addition to another it started on Friday into Mr Shorten’s union handout to GetUp! in 2006 when he sat on the activist group’s board as well as leading the AWU. A bird (a currawong, I think) was trapped in the mural hall this afternoon. It’s bogong moth season in Canberra, which sends the birds inside. Here is the announcement on the high court judgments.

In other One Nation news, one of the party’s policies has managed to pull off the impossible and has united both the Queensland Labor party and the LNP in condemnation. Terri Butler also had a few things to say about it: One Nation’s policy, announced today, to allow visitation rights to fathers regardless of an emergency protection order, puts women and children’s safety at risk. This policy is abhorrent. Why is One Nation ignoring Australia’s family violence crisis? Australians look to elected representatives to keep women and children safe, not recklessly expose them to the risk of violence and harm. This policy is life-threatening. Pauline Hanson has a woeful record in relation to violence against women and children. In June 2016, the Townsville Bulletin reported on her comments as follows: “We need a full overview of the child support system and the family law courts to find the answers (because) you know some (women) are going out there and claiming domestic violence because they’re told ‘I don’t like the colour of your dress’,” Ms Hanson said. “They (women) are making frivolous complaints and it’s time that our court system (is looked at) – especially for men who are the subject of domestic violence themselves. “Men have nowhere to go – (domestic violence against males) is very widely spread. “I want to sit down with these (male-focused) organisations, these groups, and give them a voice, because they feel like they’re not being heard.” Townsville Bulletin – 10 June 2016 And in her recent first speech to Senate, when she returned to the Parliament, she said: HANSON: Children are used as pawns in custody battles where women make frivolous claims and believe they have the sole right to the children. Children have two parents and, until we treat mums and dads with the same courtesy and rights, we will continue to see murders due to sheer frustration and depression and mental illness caused by this unworkable system. First Speech to Parliament – 14 September 2016 Violence against women is an epidemic. Victim-blaming, and making victims less safe, is destructive and wrong. I congratulate the Queensland Minister, Shannon Fentiman, and the Shadow Minister, for jointly opposing One Nation’s latest policy today. It stands in stark contrast to the actions of the Minister for Women, Liberal Senator Cash, who hugged Senator Hanson. The policy that One Nation has today announced is not only ignorant; it is incredibly dangerous for women and their children. One Nation have stooped to a new low with this policy, proving that they cannot be trusted to keep the community safe. *end statement* “One more question here. The ABC, I’ve read somewhere or maybe Ms Guthrie said, has more investigative journalists than anyone else. In Australia. Is that correct?,” Malcolm Roberts asks. It is correct, he’s told. “Yet, none of the ABC’s investigative journalists have recently confirmed or recently found in what we have done, just ourselves, in investigating the CSIRO through there own presentations. SO there is a whole other side to this climate debate that I never hear about it on the ABC. One of the characteristics of groupthink, people who participate in groupthink actually think they are doing the right thing? “ “I am sure we all think we are doing the right thing,” Alan Sunderland says. You know what investigative journalists did manage to find out? That Malcolm Roberts was a dual citizen when he nominated to parliament. Despite the repeated denials. And the “hand-on-heart” protestations all the documents were in order. It was reporting, which, like climate reporting, is not based on what we feel, or choose to believe, but in what the facts say. Let’s see what the high court has to say about those empirical facts on Friday. Alan Sunderland responds to the groupthink discussion: “One of the things we pride ourselves on at the ABC, we certainly don’t pride ourselves on being perfect, but we pride ourselves on having the most, the greatest level of commitment of any Australian media organisation, to a set of editorial standards designed to challenge preconceptions, to deliver impartiality, to deliver accuracy, for a whole range of outcomes to make sure we can be trusted as a media organisation that doesn’t engage in bias, in inaccuracies, in group think or anything else you want to discuss. Malcolm Roberts thanks Sunderland, but says: “I can assure you that a lot of people I listen to across Queensland and around Australia do not see the ABC as anything but groupthink. With the exception of regional reporters in Queensland.” Malcolm Roberts moves on to groupthink. Without irony. He has made a point of calling it “Your ABC” in his questioning. “One definition is group pressures leading to groups making faulty decisions through deterioration through mental efficiency, reality testing and moral judgment,” Roberts offers. “That’s One Nation for ya,” quips Sarah Hanson-Young. Google tells me that definition came from a site like this, which looks like it was built in the 1990s. “Let’s consider commentators moonlighting as journalists,” Roberts says. He is talking about Insiders. He says only five of the 32 journalists who recently appeared (the past eight weeks) were “right of centre”. Also worth noting, one of the biggest ideological warriors in parliament, who is part of the one of the most ideological parties seen in Australia, “does not like the term right and left but that is what our society has degenerated into”. Alan Sunderland, the director of editorial policies, said Insiders is “a program which does not bring together leftwing and rightwing commentators to provide leftwing and rightwing prospectives on the news. Insiders is a program which by and large seeks to bring together senior journalists, the majority of them working in the press gallery and others who are senior commentators on the matter of politics.” Roberts doesn’t say how he came to the conclusion of who is left and who is right. That is an average of 0.625 conservatives per episode and that is not including Talking Pictures presenters. So over a total of eight weeks, 15.6 %, and, if you include the Talking Pictures commentators, it is only 12.5. So I am not advocating you must have rightwing and you must have leftwing, I am advocating you must have balance. Do you consider when we have only 12.5% of the commentators from the right wing, do you consider that to be fair and balanced representation of our society? It might be worth noting that it was on Insiders that Pauline Hanson made her now infamous anti-vaccination comments. Sunderland says given he doesn’t understand how Roberts has done his analysis on who is left and who is right, it is difficult for him to respond. “I take it you are finding it difficult to understand about the concepts of fair and balanced,” Roberts concludes. “I am just questioning your assumptions,” Sunderland says. “Just because it is what you believe, Senator Roberts, doesn’t make it true,” Sarah Hanson-Young says. Malcolm Roberts has just stepped up to the microphone for the ABC estimates. “This will be good,” Sarah Hanson-Young says. His first question is on how the Australian public “can trust you without the facts, if they just simply go on opinions”. Michelle Guthrie: “We don’t go on opinions”. Just extraordinary scenes in both question time and estimates. Mike Bowers, as always, was catching it all. In estimates Michelle Guthrie is being asked about the possibility the competitive neutrality review could conclude that there should be a paywall on the ABC’s iView online TV playback service. Guthrie said that the idea “would seem to be double-dipping” because the Australian public had paid for ABC programming and would have to pay again to access it on iView. “They’ve already paid for the programming, in terms of taxpayer funding,” she said. “iView is simply taking those programs and making them available in a different window.” Asked if she’d raised this concern with the minister, Guthrie responded: I’ve certainly raised my view that ABC has operated within dual environment since the beginning. Just because technology and audience habit is changing doesn’t mean the ABC is the cause of any economic difficulties [of commercial broadcasters]. That trend is happening everywhere in the world. The idea we might have to retract from particular platforms is not the expectation of Australian people. Back to estimates and Linda Reynolds is pressing the ABC representatives in estimates about how that question time came about. A Dixer to Michael Keenan on “the measures the government is taking to protect our community from our worst criminals” ends with Keenan saying this: Now let me show you what is the current situation. This is the current situation. This is the status quo that the Labor party supports. 42% of Commonwealth child sex offences do not spend one day in prison. Not one day. And of the 58 ... {I] want to repeat that, Mr Speaker, because this is a status quo that the Labor party supports. 42% of the files not spending one day prison, not one day. 58% of those actually do go to prison, the most common length of time served is six months. Tony Burke interrupts on a point of order asking Keenan to “withdraw the statement that there are members that want to see paedophiles on the street”. Tony Smith says he didn’t hear the minister say that and there is a back and forth where the Speaker says he has to balance “what is very robust debate, with frankly, freedom of speech”. It ends with a division after Burke moves the minister be no longer heard. And that is most likely the end of question time. Following a Peter Dutton Dixer (the government has switched from energy to how it is protecting Australians) Bill Shorten again asks about the AFP budget. “How can the prime minister claim he is cracking down on drug importers on a scale never seen before when an AFP leak says thanks to his 184,000,000-dollar cuts to the AFP, the federal police was unable to properly investigate the importation of 1.6 tonnes of cocaine and an additional 600kg cocaine importation from Mexico? Malcolm Turnbull responds: As the minister has said, the track record of the AFP in intercepting drug importation speaks for itself. The way in which the Labor party wants to challenge the competence, the efficiency of the AFP is disgraceful. The Labor party have no ... no basis for the claims they have made. We know that we have provided the Australian federal police with record levels of funding. We know that they are intercepting drugs on a scale unprecedented. I note the challenge, the threat is also unprecedented. When we ask the Labor party for some real support in this place on law enforcement, where do they stand? Where does Labor stand? Where does Labor stand on punishing people who commit sexual offences against children? We have asked for mandatory sentences. You know why? Because we want to make sure they go to jail! That’s why. We want to make sure they go to jail. Where is Labor? Labor won’t support that. Labor won’t support that and perhaps they can explain why they don’t want to support, why they won’t support managed or offences, mandatory sentences for some of the most disgusting crimes in the criminal calendar. Mr Speaker, what about guns? What about guns trafficking? What about gun runners, gun smugglers? We want there to be mandatory sentences for them as well because we want to make sure they go to jail. We want to make sure there is the strongest deterrent message and that they are ... Where is Labor on that? Nowhere to be seen. Why won’t Labor support us in putting paedophiles and gun runners behind bars? Back to estimates: Michelle Guthrie has told Senate estimates about the ABC’s concerns that “fair and balanced” will be added to its charter: “We are concerned with how those words will be read by people who choose to take an aggressive view towards achieving a false balance, not based on the weight of evidence.” The words already appear in the ABC’s editorial policies but include that important rider – based on the weight of evidence. The other ABC official at the table explains that “stripped of context” the terms fair and balanced might be construed to imply “false balance and he said she said journalism”. Clare O’Neil is next on the AFP question line: Today the justice minister said the government has ‘never been more effective in the fight against drugs’ but earlier in estimates AFP Commissioner Colvin said the AFP is having to look at our organised crime work to make up the government’s $184m cut to the Australian federal police. Who is right? You or the Australian federal police commissioner? Michael Keenan: Don’t verbal a respected public servant. Don’t walk into this place and try and make out he said something that he didn’t. It is absolute nonsense to say we have cut the Australian federal police’s budget by $184m. It’s complete nonsense. As I said at the start of question time ... I’m very happy to run through the record and compare and contrast our record in government with your record when you were in government for six years which saw our law enforcement not given the support and the resources that, quite frankly, they deserve. We have invested, since 2013, $1.5bn in our national security and counter-terrorism operations. $128m to fund the serious financial crime taskforce. Very difficult crimes to investigate. We’ve got specialist capability in there with this investment to do it. $116m in the national anti-gang squad. $25m to expand the AFP as national forensic’s rapid lab capability $21m to extend the royal commission taskforce, something we know those opposite don’t support. $15m for the fraud and anti-corruption centre. On top of the resources we have given to our agencies, what is also very important is we’ve given them the powers to do their job. If the Australian Labor Party is so worried about fighting crime, why don’t they join us is in helping to lock up paedophiles? Why don’t they support what we want to do to lock up paedophiles?” And that starts a firestorm of complaint from the Labor party. Keenan did this last week as well, after he made a similar accusation. Here is what Tony Burke had to say on this: Practice 516 and 517 specifically refers to two points. One, that a comment does not need to be levelled against an individual member. It can be levelled generally to be offensive. Secondly, if language of a nature likely to create disorder is included as well as words that are generally considered unparliamentary. Specifically, criminal offences such as sedition, treason, support for corruption, deliberate dishonesty are referred to as being unparliamentary terms. Anything that associates members of parliament with in some way being approving of paedophiles is something ... in terms of directly saying, ‘They don’t want them to be locked up’, is an extraordinary claim. I would draw members’ attention to quotes from Senate estimates today that were not used by the opposition that this sort of language is going to have an impact on the chamber and both sides of politics should be above it. Christopher Pyne responds: What the minister for justice in his statement was referring to, which is well understood by the entire chamber, is that the government has legislation before the House to introduce minimum mandatory sentences for people who have been convicted of sentences to do with paedophilia and gun smuggling and the Labor party’s indicated they will not support that. It is, therefore, a statement of fact. It is not an insult ...it is not an insult to the opposition. It wouldn’t have been made as an insult to the opposition. It is a juxtaposing this government’s record on tough sentences on things like gun smuggling. Tony Smith rules: I have listened to the manager of opposition business. I listened carefully the other day to the minister for justice and what the leader of the House says – I ask forbearance of all members of the House while I complete my remarks – is quite right that is not what the minister for justice said. He didn’t refer to any legislation. He did make a very specific statement. On the manager of opposition business’s point of order, I’m very familiar with the practice and I’m very familiar with the pages. I spend a lot of time reading practice. He’s right when he says that offensive remarks directed at individuals have been asked to be withdrawn regularly and there have been occasions where speakers as far back as Speaker Sneddon has said remarks to groups to be withdrawn. It cuts both ways. You can pick what you wanted to out of all of those precedents. But I’ve reflected on what the minister said. He didn’t say what the leader of the House said. In fact, if he’d framed it that way, whilst I wouldn’t have approved, as I said the other day,that would have been a different matter but in terms of what I heard,I’m going to ask the minister to withdraw that and continue on with his answer. So how does Keenan apologise? “Well, I withdraw. I’m sorry that the facts are such a deep inconvenience.” He’s told to sit down. Christopher Pyne gets his weekly “just how terrible are the terrible unions” question and surprise, surprise the CFMEU is this week’s subject. Here is his concluding flourish: The member for Sydney was asked about the CFMEU today. She defended the CFMEU. She said this, “Unions get to have a say. Business gets to have a say. Non-governmental organisations get to have a say.” The CFMEU is no worse than any other organisation engaged in robbery, no worse than the AIG, no worse than our friends in the Country Women’s Association, or Unicef, non-government organisations, the CFMEU, CWA, the ladies who invited weary travellers for a cake at the royal show, they are the same as the CFMEU. Perhaps the member for Sydney, next time John Setka is in dispute, he have a bake-off. Back to estimates. Under questioning from Eric Abetz, Michelle Guthrie concedes that the timing of an Australian Story special on Sam Dastyari, which coincided with release of the senator’s book, was “a mistake”. But Guthrie noted the program didn’t refer to his book. “My concern was not around the program itself but around the timing ... and the way others have taken that as a tie, which didn’t exist,” she said. The ABC story they are fighting over, is this one Greg Hunt says some things about energy. Dixers will be the death of me. But the main game is Bill Shorten and Malcolm Turnbull and their battle over the AFP funding today. And both are getting visibly annoyed. Shorten: Given the prime minister just advised the parliament to listen to the AFP, does the prime minister consider the AFP is wrong when it says the resourcing shortages left the AFP unable to properly investigate a 1.6 tonne cocaine importation? When will the prime minister finally stop blaming everybody else and take some responsibility for the decisions that his government makes when it comes to the AFP? Turnbull: The Labor party’s commitment to the rule of law would be taken somewhat more seriously if they weren’t wholly owned and beholden to the CFMEU. Let’s have a look, let’s have a look, very important ... to look at the corporate structures to see who the shareholders are. That’s where the money comes from. The CFMEU ... As at eight days ago ... there were 84 CFMEU representatives before the courts facing a total of 896 alleged breaches of the law. The CFMEU, or its representatives, were respondents in 41 separate matters before the courts facing a total of 1,779 suspected contraventions and over $10m in penalties has been awarded against the AWU by the ABCC and its predecessors. Mr Speaker, the fact of the matter is Labor continues to defend an organisation that breaches the law as a matter of course, that treats fines as parking tickets. They know that if the leader of the opposition had the courage or the character of Bob Hawke, he would do what Bob Hawke has said, “You know what I did...” Bill Shorten: My question is to the Prime Minister. Prime Minister, we support the AFP efforts but why are the AFP advising that they lack the resources to properly investigate serious crime including drug importation? I quote the ABC online where they say, “The AFP document said New South Wales AFP did not have sufficient resources to meet the operational load”. Malcolm Turnbull: If the honourable member spent more time listening to the AFP and less time coordinating his Question Time tactics with the ABC, he’d have abetter insight into national security. Barnaby Joyce whips himself into a frenzy, combining several of his most recent favoured attack lines, some Queensland election lines, and well, read for yourself. “Unfortunately, those on the other side, a lot of university graduates, no problem with that, a lot of solicitors, but no labourers in the Labor Party. They believe labourers are politically incorrect. You can see that in Jihad they run against some of the vital coal-fired assets in our electorate. Gladstone, Stanwell, all employing blue-collar workers because the member for Flynn is not embarrassed about blue-collar workers, he has been a blue-collar worker, unlike the Labor Party, very rarely do you find someone in the Labor Party who’s done a labouring job, a labouring job. Then the teachers stick up their hand. Teachers...Where are these people who actually ever worked for a living in the Labor Party? Where are the labourers in the Labor Party? “...They don’t exist any more. We are going to make sure that we keep the jobs in Flynn, the people in Flynn,the industrial city of Gladstone, we are going to look after the people in Gladstone, rather than just the people of Annandale. We are going to make sure the basket weavers do not reign supreme in our nation. We look for to member of Maribyrnong, he used to represent them, to come to the Despatch Box and tell us about his grand vision for Australia. 50%renewables. There won’t be a job left in this place. They say today in the paper 75% of coal-fired power stations will have to be closed down. What does the member for Hunter have to say about that? The member for Shortland? What does the member for Herbert have to say about that? They say nothing because they don’t stand up for workers any more. They don’t stand up for workers anymore. We hear the piste de resistance. We are waiting for Mr Rudd’s book to come out because the moment we hear the member for Lilley, the former Treasurer of the millennia was put there as a poisoned pill. He was there to blowup Rudd. He ended up blowing up a whole budget. He ended up blowing the budget of the nation. He was there as a joke. He was there as a joke. They never saw the funny side of it. They kept him there. They made him the Treasurer of Australia. What an enlightenment the Labor Party is. What a wonderful grace for our economic future the Labor Party is. The joke is still here! I think the joke is making a comeback! Back in estimates: Next up is Josh Frydenberg, taking another Dixer on energy, where he says Bill Shorten is like “that Japanese soldier, Hiroo Onoda”. “Thirty years he was stuck in the jungle, Mr Speaker, lost in the jungle, refusing to surrender, refusing to surrender while everyone was getting on. In fact, they found the leader of the opposition there in the jungle with his emissions intensity scheme in one hand, Mr Speaker, and the climate wars in the other, Mr Speaker, and the climate wars in the other. There was the leader of the opposition.” Hardy ha, ha Then it is on to a two-in-one answer to a Labor question. “In question time today the prime minister said, ‘Every decision, every policy, every measure relating to the AFP is focused on ensuring they have the capacity to keep us safe.’ How does the prime minister describe an ABC report, “A July AFP memo revealed resourcing shortages left the AFP not properly able to investigate a drug shipment meaning it could not be properly explored”? Malcolm Turnbull: I will invite the minister to add to this answer but let me say this. In terms of intercepting drug importation, we have seen record seizures, met hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars of drugs seized and extraordinary cooperation between the AFP, Border Force and foreign police and security agencies overseas. We are cracking down on those drug importers on a scale never seen before but I should say, Mr Speaker, the challenge is on a scale never seen before and we will need to do more and more. We understand that. But the combination of great policing, great investigation, great intelligence is a credit not simply to the AFP and the other agencies with which they worked but also to the extra resources, intelligence, legislative, financial, that we are putting behind our effort to stamp out drug importation. Michael Keenan: I will just invite the opposition to look at the scoreboard that our law enforcement agencies have actually managed over the past four years. Record seizures of cocaine. Record seizures of crystal methamphetamine. Record seizures of precursors such as ephedrine. The Australian federal police, working in conjunction with Australian Border Force, working in conjunction with the Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission, and we have seen these record seizures. We have sent our law enforcement agents out to the world incredibly effectively. Taskforce Blaze in China. The only joint taskforce of any foreign law enforcement agency with the Chinese National Narcotics Control Bureau. AFP officers working side-by-side with their Chinese counterparts has stopped 13 tonnes of drugs hitting Australian streets in the past two years. We have similar taskforces with the Royal Thai Police and the Royal Cambodian Police. We have a significant problem with the high demand for illicit drugs inAustralia. We have been tackling it by tackling the supply side and our efforts have never been more effective with the law enforcement operations that I’ve just outlined. We have also tackled the demand side, particularly in relation to crystal methamphetamine or ice with the largest investment in drug and alcohol rehabilitation in Australia’s history. I’m very pleased to report to the House, because it’s the first time we’ve ever had comprehensive information, that we are seeing the embryonic start of a decrease in ice usage throughout our community. This is a direct result of the efforts of our law enforcement community combined with what we have done to decrease demand for this insidious drug. Dipping out of question time for a moment ... The ABC chief executive, Michelle Guthrie, has given a powerful opening speech in Senate estimates. Guthrie asks people who “seek to restrict the activities of the ABC”: What problem are we trying to solve here? She points to the fact that 80% of Australians are happy with the job it is doing. Guthrie: ABC independence is highly valued by the community and I submit that you cannot have it by degrees. The ABC board, which is appointed by government, is ultimately responsible for the performance of the national broadcaster and must do so by carefully balancing its obligations and audience expectations. It should not be burdened with quotas, sectional claims, red tape and political vendettas in achieving what the community expects of it.” Guthrie rejects the view that the ABC is “just a market failure broadcaster, doing only what the commercial sector does not want to do or cannot”, noting the ABC charter does not limit its activities in that way. That has never been our defining role, nor should it be in the future. Our corporate accounts, which are publicly available on our website, provide a detailed breakdown of our remuneration for all employees earning over $200,000 – all without sacrificing individual privacy, as the current law demands. In follow-up questions, Guthrie says the ABC has advice that publishing individual names next to these salaries would breach the Privacy Act, which suggests the government would need legislation to force it to do so. Julie Bishop is sent out to answer a dixer on energy. Then we are back to opposition questions, with Tony Burke asking about George Brandis’s comments about Bruce Billson from estimates yesterday. ‘It is very appropriate for backbench members of parliament to receive remuneration from third-party sources not inconsistent with their responsibility as members of parliament. It’s both consistent and commonplace.’ Is the behaviour of Bruce Billson commonplace for this government? Just how many members of the government are we talking about? “Really,” the Labor backbench queries as Burke reads Brandis’s comments (you’ll find that transcript a bit back in the blog). Malcolm Turnbull takes this one as well, but it is not an answer. The members’ interest disclosure system, which all honourable members here are very familiar with, does provide for the disclosure of income over and above a member’s parliamentary salary and it’s open to the honourable member or anyone else with an interest in the matter to go through all those disclosures and determine how many backbenchers are in receipt of income from third-party sources, as the honourable member described it. TL:DR – You want to know how many are getting paid from third-party sources, go through the register and find out. (Which doesn’t help with those who “forget” to update their register though, does it?) Andrew Wilkie has the independent question today. He uses it to make further allegations against Crown Casino and says a fourth whistleblower who has come forward “fears for his safety”. Prime minister, a fourth Crown Casino whistleblower has now come forward and levelled further serious allegations of poker machines being illegally tampered with. Significantly, he names the Crown staff he alleges told him to modify machines and asked me to give these names to the police, which I’m doing. However, this worker fears for his safety and doesn’t entirely trust the police or the regulators and, for that reason, he asks you personally, and the opposition leader, to support a transparent inquiry. So, prime minister, will you establish a parliamentary inquiry so that the Australian people can learn the truth about the casino industry and, Speaker, I seek leave to table these latest allegations? Smith doesn’t have a chance to ask if leave is granted before Christopher Pyne is on his feet: As to the last part of the question, Mr Speaker, the purpose of tabling documents is not to allow slanderous or defamatory material to be covered by parliamentary privilege and, as I haven’t seen the documents, I will not be granting leave on this occasion. That just leaves Malcolm Turnbull to answer, which he does, by saying the right authorities will investigate the allegations. The police, the gambling regulators in Victoria and Austrac are the appropriate people to investigate and examine these allegations. Those agencies have the necessary powers, extensive powers and, indeed, powers far greater than a parliamentary committee. Now, the Victorian Commission for Gambling and Liquor Regulation, I’m advised, is investigating the allegations and Austrac is also examining the specific nature of allegations of money laundering. If any members or senators are aware of allegations of unlawfulness, I strongly encourage them to report those directly to our law enforcement and regulatory agencies. Our law enforcement agencies do an outstanding job in keeping us safe and enforcing and upholding the rule of law upon which our democracy depends. Wilkie jumps up to say that the man in question “is in fear of his life and lost faith in the regulator”. Turnbull says the “idea that those investigations would be assisted by a simultaneous parliamentary inquiry almost beggars belief. I say to the honourable member that if he is really concerned with ensuring that these allegations are investigated, that due process is applied and justice is done, then he would confine his revelations and his communications, his information on this matter, to the police and the regulators. That is his duty as a member of this parliament, as someone committed to upholding the law.” Back to Bill Shorten who repeats his question from earlier, with an additional detail: “I repeat: is the prime minister aware of any policies or decisions taken by him or his government that have diminished the operational capacity of the Australian federal police and specifically to investigate major drug importations including the importation of cocaine?” But a short question does not bring about a short answer from the prime minister. “The chutzpah of the leader of the opposition. He stands up here and asks us about national security. This is the leader of a party that outsourced our border’s sovereignty to people smugglers. This is the leader of a party that, despite all of the warnings and all of the knowledge, chose to abandon the integrity of our own borders, abandoned all of that, outsourced ...” The manager of opposition business, Tony Burke, interrupts with a point of order on relevance – it’s a direct question, he says, and deserves a direct answer. Tony Smith allows the prime minister to continue. “50,000 illegal arrivals and over 1,000 deaths at sea was not enough on border protection, that was Labor’s track record, that is your glorious record, that’s your record of failing Australians and security. What about the ADF? How many naval ships did the Labor party commission in six years? None. Nothing. Nothing at all. “... As far as the Australian federal police is concerned, I can say this to honourable members: every decision we’ve taken, every policy we have set out, every measure relating to the AFP is focused on ensuring they have the capacity to keep us safe and the skills and the technology to do so in these dangerous times.” Dixer to Scott Morrison, who manages to combine the productivity commission report with energy policy. I’ll leave you with his big finish: The shadow treasurer is like Grandpa Simpson shouting at the clouds, shaking his fist at the clouds. There he is, angry and empty, Mr Speaker, is the shadow treasurer and the members of the Labor frontbench because their policy is to put prices up by $192, not to put prices down by $115. What a bunch of muppets. Bill Shorten takes the next question as well, which is again on the AFP: “Is prime minister aware of any policies or decisions, taken by him or his government, that are diminishing the operational capacity of the Australian federal police? The prime minister takes this one: As the minister for justice very eloquently and comprehensively replied, the support that we have given to the Australian federal police is at an unprecedented level. $321m in the last budget. The largest single funding boost for the AFP’s domestic policing capabilities in a decade. Mr Speaker, what we have provided the AFP ... to fill new specialist positions so vital to keep Australians safe in the threat of terrorism, 100 intelligence experts, over 100 tactical response and covert surveillance operators and just under 100 new forensic specialists. I don’t know whether honourable members opposite have had the opportunity to visit the federal police headquarters there ... to see the extraordinary work that’s undertaken by the tactical response team, by the forensic specialists ... We are dealing with ... The police there are at the absolute cutting edge of science and technology. That’s what we need to keep Australians safe and we are providing them with the financial resources to enable them to do that. But in addition, Mr Speaker, what we’re also doing is providing them with the legislation, with the laws, that they need to keep us safe. Again one tranche of national security legislation after another has been passed through this parliament at the instigation of my government and, indeed, the government headed by the member for Warringah. We have done that. We have done everything to make Australians safe and give our agencies, our national security agencies, our intelligence services and, indeed, the ADF all of the tools they need to keep Australians safe in dangerous times. First dixer is on energy. There is nothing new in Malcolm Turnbull’s answer. Mark that off your cards. We have had our first removal under 94a–who had Brian Mitchell? Might have had something to do with the member for Lyons bringing in two cans tied with a piece of string, Mike Bowers tells me. We’ll bring you that image very soon. The Guardian Essential poll was pretty damn close on this The MPs are taking their seats and Bill Shorten is taking a moment of indulgence to announce the changes to the shadow cabinet. This has the government side of the chamber VERY excited. Speaker Tony Smith calls for calm and we begin with a question on... The $184m cut to the AFP, with “117 officers cut this year”. “Is the commissioner correct when he says these cuts will ‘mostly apply to our discretionary funding. That is areas that fund a large portion of our anti-narcotics, our organised crime work, our general operation work, our fraud and anti-corruption’?” Malcolm Turnbull sends the question to Michael Keenan, who Turnbull says is “very knowledgable” as he takes his spot at the despatch box (or at least that is what it sounded like). Keenan has a lot of information, but doesn’t really answer the question, other than to say that “budgets work over a four-year-cycle”. “If we make an announcement about extra funding to the national anti-gang squad, that exists in the budget for four years and terminates at the end of those four years. The logic that the ALP that, the opposition, are bringing to this argument is if I were to stand up tomorrow and say, ‘We are adding an extra $100m worth of funding to the AFP’, the opposition will say, ‘We are cutting the funding to the AFP in four years’ time.’ The facts are very clear. We have made record investments in the capacity of the Australian federal police.” The very knowledgable Keenan says the Australian federal police have “never been better supported”. But Sarah Henderson has managed her own uncomfortable situation by trying to argue the national energy guarantee will mean lower prices, which, as Kristina Keneally points out, can’t be guaranteed, given there is no modelling and nothing to really back it up. Tim Watts, debating Sarah Henderson, live on Sky, just told Henderson to “shut up”. It didn’t go over well, and judging by the look on Watts’ face as he continued, he knew it. While we wait on question time (and from what I can see, the estimates hearings are in a bit of a lull) here is portrait from Mike Bowers on the “man in the mirror” Wal Merriman. Coming up to question time, so let me know what is on your QT bingo card today. I’ve got NBN, energy, with some productivity commission-related issues and maybe a nice high court reminder. Peter Garrett is using his NPC speech as a rallying call against Adani’s plans to open up the Carmichael mine in Queensland Stopping Adani is emerging as the battle of our times, just as the Franklin dam and Jabiluka were to earlier people. The Stop Adani campaign is a defining moment that must be won if we are to have any hope of preserving a safe climate and the reef itself … The medical journal Lancet recently published research that claimed 9 million premature deaths already occurring over 2015-16 [were due] to pollution. Fifteen times the losses from war and violence. The burning of Adani’s low-grade Carmichael coal will only lead to more deaths, making a mockery of Josh Frydenberg’s so-called moral case for coal. Added to this, if Adani’s mine and rail link ever get off the line, the entire Galilee basin coal reserve could be opened up as well. The Galilee is the largest untapped coal basin in the world, containing 29bn tonnes of low-grade coal. That would be a nightmare scenario for the world’s coral reefs and oceans, which absorb 93% of global carbon pollution. A quarter of all marine life use coral reefs for their life cycle, so losing coral reefs would have a devastating knock-on effect. Such a gargantuan expansion of coalmining would completely undermined the world trying desperately to reduce greenhouse emissions with action is large and small. Yet the federal and Queensland governments still remain in thrall to Adani, and despite significant reservations concerning the corporation’s business practices, and both the economics and operations of the proposed mine and existing port, that situation remains. Malcolm Turnbull discussed the national energy guarantee in the Coalition party room, noting that even the government’s “usual critics” have said it is a “very elegant” solution to the need to achieve affordable, reliable energy that meets greenhouse gas reduction commitments. He predicted Labor would argue for a higher mix of renewable energy but would do so within the same framework, and households and manufacturers would be on the Coalition’s side. Barnaby Joyce claimed Labor was divided between those backing blue collar workers and those backing “basket-weavers”. There was a bit of a kerfuffle about codeine, which is due to change classification so that people need a doctor’s script to buy it at the pharmacy. Guardian Australia understands that six or seven people raised codeine in the party room, citing the inconvenience and cost of needing a script to access it. The health minister, Greg Hunt, said the reclassification had occurred on the basis of advice from the chief medical and pharmaceutical officers of the states and territories, and since it was a state and territory responsibility they had the power not to follow the recommendation and continue to allow codeine without a script. Sound the klaxon: the high court decision on the citizenship issue will be handed down at 2.15pm Friday. Which means – no stranger in the house. The Australia Post chief executive, Christine Corbett, has told Senate estimates that it refused to distribute one piece of unaddressed mail during the marriage law survey period because it was offensive. Guardian Australia has established the mail was not about same-sex marriage, though, it was a promotion which the Courier Mail has ably reported on: Burger Urge’s flyers for its Kim Jong Yum burger featuring “ballistic” pork belly and “oppressive” sweet potato crisps. Former Labor minister and Midnight Oil frontman Peter Garrett is speaking to the National Press Club this afternoon. Here is a taste: I believe this is the most critical address I’ve given here. After many years both outside and inside the system, in inverted commas, I’m convinced more than ever that we face an existential threat greater than any other as humans literally upend the world’s climate and natural ecosystems. To do nothing in the face of this threat, of which we are well aware, is to acquiesce to a world diminishing in front of us. We will deservedly reap the scorn and anger of our children if we fail to act now. There’s a fundamental divide in our response but it’s not between insiders and outsiders, it’s between those who are willing to [change] and those clinging desperately to an corrupted ideology. I’m willing to open their eyes or their hearts to what’s happening around them. Regardless of our day jobs and status in the political environment, it still boils down to one basic proposition: are we part of the problem or part of the solution? Our world is astonishing in its diversity and beauty, but one thing is crystal clear. The oceans, the continents, the atmospheres, they are finite. The “man-in-the-mirror” scandal which has engulfed the Australian Wool Innovation boss has been the object of much fascination in estimates (and the press gallery). That has a lot to do with both the case (the AWI secretly monitored woolgrowers who had been invited to take part in a focus group) and the fact that Wal Merriman later told a ABC journalist who asked about it to “fuck off”. He apologised for both. AAP have covered the hearing here. Key point: Merriman, who is facing calls to resign said: “Never before have meetings been held in a room with a one-way mirror ... this was all very strange to me when I went to observe the process.” As for his use of profanity, that was because he was “from the bush” and “occasionally come across in a way that causes offence”. I’ll let one of the experts in this field have the last word here: Given the opportunity from Penny Wong to explain what she saw as the commission’s role, Rosalind Croucher talks about the educational outreach programs and conciliation programs, which she describes as “quiet achievements” and “quiet service”. She adds to the list of “quiets” with “quiet assistance”, which she says occurs when the commission acts as an invited intervenor. Asked why she used the adjective “quiet”, Croucher said: “I chose the word quiet because I think it is the aspects of the commission’s work that I think are often not observed or not out in the observance.” Australia Post chief executive, Christine Corbett, has told Senate estimates that 100% of the marriage law postal survey forms were delivered. Of course, that only means that the letters went where the Australian Electoral Commission and Australian Bureau of Statistics sent them, not that they always had the right address. Asked about reports of postal survey forms being dumped around letter boxes, Corbett said Australia Post was aware of two instances of that, one in Brunswick, Melbourne and one in Canberra. Corbett: “In both those two instances, the items were delivered correctly and it appears there was theft from mailboxes after delivery had occurred. “After the postal survey forms were dumped, Australia Post was contacted by the media and worked with the ABS to communicate to affected residents to get replacement forms.” Further to Gareth’s post on the recommendation from the Productivity Commission to put a price on carbon, you may be interested in this exchange from estimates overnight. (I’m slowly working my way through what happened after I clocked off yesterday.) Penny Wong (who was very busy yesterday) had some questions for Rob Heferen, the deputy secretary of energy, about the government’s energy policy: Wong: “So have you assessed what the implicit carbon price might be under a pro rata abatement scenario as we were discussing before, for this mechanism?” Heferen: “So there’s ... when you talk about an implicit carbon price.” Wong: “No, I am because I think there is one and so do many others but ...” Heferen: “I am, I obviously hear what you’re saying but I can’t...” Wong: “What do you call the value?” Heferen: “There will be a price paid.” Wong: “Thank you.” Heferen: “And that price paid will reflect the emissions level, the reliability and, of course, the retailers capacity to be able to influence what their customers use.” Emeritus Professor Rosalind Croucher, the president of the Human Rights Commission is fronting her first estimates hearing. She said she appreciates the opportunity to “reset” the government’s relationship with the commission. Simon Birmingham also had some things to say about the Productivity Commission report while talking to Sky this morning: Now, this Productivity Commission report really is a call to arms to the Labor party, to the Senate crossbench – particularly the Nick Xenophon Team – to reconsider their position around higher education reforms, because the government is already one step ahead of the Productivity Commission. We’ve already put a focus on how we can get better bang for our buck in education, drive efficiencies and drive the public dollar, the taxpayer dollars further. We’ve already put a focus on how we actually put in place a performance metric for universities that will hold some of their funding contingent upon a range of things including, ultimately, graduate outcomes. We’re taking action here and the only roadblocks are those who seem to want to call for another reform or review. The ACCC have tabled their annual report. You’ll find it here The treasurer, Scott Morrison, has been trumpeting the new five-year productivity review from the Productivity Commission, which was released this morning. He’s been curiously quiet about one recommendation. Now that we’ve got a copy of the review, here’s what the PC says the Turnbull government should do to improve Australia’s productivity (remember the PC is the government’s market-obsessed thinktank). Recommendation 5.1: “Stop the piecemeal and stop-start approach to emission reduction, and adopt a proper vehicle for reducing carbon emissions that puts a single effective price on carbon.” Not sure if everyone picked up on this yesterday (it was a loooong day with a lot going on), but I think it may be mentioned in question time, so I thought I would revisit it. The Bruce Billson investigation (after it was revealed he was being paid by a lobby firm while still sitting in parliament. He was cleared) was discussed yesterday and during that discussion, Penny Wong and George Brandis had this exchange: Wong: “I would like to know whether Mr Turnbull thinks it is appropriate for a member of the Liberal party, representing the people of Dunkley, to take a salary from a third party whilst sitting in this parliament?” Brandis: “I will take that on notice, but might I point out to you senator, it is very appropriate for backbench members of parliament to receive remuneration from third-party sources not inconsistent with their responsibility as members of parliament.” Wong: “Wow. That’s hilarious.” Brandis: “It’s both consistent and commonplace.” Mike Bowers has been in and out of the committee rooms this morning: Labor’s caucus has decided to oppose both bills that implement the government’s media deal with One Nation, including the imposition of a “fair and balanced” test on the ABC. Bill Shorten told caucus the only thing that is fast about Malcolm Turnbull’s national broadband network is “the speed with which he finds someone else is to blame”. The climate change spokesman, Mark Butler, said the government’s national energy guarantee is “nothing more than a plan to strangle renewable energy, investment and jobs”. He said achieving a mix of 28% renewable energy by 2030 would mean “a two-third cut to rooftop solar installation and no large-scale projects built over the next decade”. Also worth noting that after the shadow cabinet reshuffle, there are now 31 people in the shadow ministry and Andrew Leigh who had to take a $40,000 pay cut last reshuffle will now get a pay rise. Marise Payne has made quite a few announcements while visiting the Philippines. Here is a bit of her brief conference: The ADF will provide mobile training teams that will begin providing urban warfare counter-terrorism training in the Philippines in the coming days. It is very practical training by the ADF which will support the Philippines defence force to be able to counter what are very brutal tactics by terrorists. Through our significant involvement in the last couple of years in the counter-Daesh campaign in Iraq and Syria, Australia has acquired skills and knowledge that we are able to share with the Philippines armed forces. As part of our increased cooperation, we have also agreed to work together to enhance intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance in the southern Philippines, to strengthen our ... information sharing and enhance our maritime patrols. Together, Australia and the Philippines will cohost a multiagency civil military and ... law enforcement seminar on post-conflict rehabilitation of its later this year. This seminar will draw lessons from past operations and international and local civil military police expertise. These measures together will strengthen our ability and the ability of the government in the region, but here specifically in the Philippines, to combat this terrorist threat over the long-term. This inherent strength support will include a number of elements. The Australian army will provide training to the Philippines army and the Philippines marine corps. This training will be conducted on Philippines military bases. It will include a range of skills related to combat on urban environments. It will involve information sharing and experience sharing to ensure that we are best able to use the skills that we have two hand. The Royal Australian Navy will conduct ship visits to the Philippines that involve a range of cooperative activities to support the development of capacity in the Philippines navy. This cooperation will begin with an Australian patrol boat visit in the next month. Our P-3 Orion maritime patrol aircraft have been operating in support of the fight in Marawi for some months now. The secretary and I have discussed their activities in the last couple of days. Now that the secretary of national defence has declared the end of combat operations in Marawi, we have been reviewing with the Philippines the need for that continuing engagement is and the reconnaissance support. We will work with the Philippines to address that in the coming days. Australian experts from military and civilian agencies will conduct a seminar in the Philippines, which is focused on the efforts of a whole of government response and approach to reconstruction, recovery and rehabilitation. We are also going to increase our intelligence cooperation including expert advice on countering Daesh-inspired social media. We know the battle against terrorism does not just occur in a physical combat zone, it occurs in the internet zone, it occurs in the cyber worlds to a degree that it is difficult to appreciate unless you are very focused on that and this is something we have been very conscious of in Iraq and Syria.” We have the Productivity Commission report and are going through it now. We’ll have an update on it as soon as we finish reading it (it’s 253 pages). Scott Morrison gave a speech at a Ceda event this morning, where he praised the government’s policies. Following the speech, he held a press conference where he talked more about the Productivity Commission report, (and, because it’s Morrison, let us all know his latest thoughts on Labor): The goal is clear. More and better paid jobs, lifting living standards. The report from the Productivity Commission I think provides good direction. The goals are for governments to work through. I commend Peter [Harris] and his team for what they have delivered. It is not just about issues in that report, as I said in my presentation it is also about getting on with the reforms we have on the table. Changes like taxes, tax changes that lead to higher wages, improved investment. Some 6.3 million Australians in 120,000 businesses, as a result of Chris Bowen’s press conference this morning, are living in limbo. 120,000 businesses, 6.3 million Australians at work for businesses that have a turnover between $2m-$50m a year. They don’t want you to sit on the couch and contemplate these things, they want to know what you are going to do, and they want to know if you are going to put up their taxes. You have had plenty of time to work it out, we have this debate at the last election, and the Coalition won the election. Key to that was decreasing taxes to increase better-paid jobs. Bill Shorten has announced a minor reshuffle in his shadow cabinet, in the wake of Kate Ellis’ announcement earlier this year she will not stand at the next election. Today I announce minor changes to Labor’s shadow ministerial team following Kate Ellis’ decision to step down and not contest the next election. Following this morning’s Labor caucus meeting, I have asked deputy opposition leader Tanya Plibersek to add training to her existing responsibilities as shadow minister for education and shadow minister for women. Working closely with Tanya will be Senator Doug Cameron, who will add Tafe to his current responsibilities as shadow minister for skills and apprenticeships. Amanda Rishworth will join the shadow cabinet as the shadow minister for early childhood education and development, in addition to her current role as shadow minister for veterans’ affairs. Matt Thistlethwaite will become the shadow assistant minister for an Australian head of state, in addition to his current role as shadow assistant minister for Treasury. On behalf of the entire Labor movement, I want to once again record my thanks to Kate for her 13 years of outstanding parliamentary service. I know she will approach the next chapter of her life with the same hard work, honest charm and genuine concern for the lives of her fellow Australians. In the mean time, we hope Kate, David and their growing family enjoy some well-earned time together at home. Labor senator Deborah O’Neil has been grilling communications minister, Mitchell Fifield about why the government’s media deal with the Nick Xenophon Team excluded Guardian Australia. Nick Xenophon has said that it was a “non-negotiable” element of the package that none of the $60m go to Guardian Australia. O’Neil asks in several ways: what is it you hate about Guardian Australia? Fifield: “The government makes no apology for the fact that one of the tests is it can’t be controlled by an entity that is not Australian.” Fifield said that none of the criteria relate to an organisation’s philosophy. “We don’t have a test for ideology.” Back in the legal affairs committee hearing and Derryn Hinch has picked up on the ACL van fire, seemingly to allow the police to clarify their comments about why they came to the conclusion it was not politically motivated. ACT police’s Justine Saunders: Our understanding is he spent one to two months preparing for this event and during that time, he explored a lot of information through social media, both relating to the course of action he took, options available to him ... He certainly made statements to us that he felt religion had failed, and he had explored on social media a whole range of religious issues. As the commissioner said, the key here is context, so yes he did make a comment in regards to ACL, but it was in direct response to a leading question by a police officer about why he was there. So he certainly said other things in that statement at the hospital immediately after which gave greater context to this and he made it very clear that his intention was ‘to blow himself up’ quote. And that is why he had travelled there. And certainly the evidence we obtained from other medical staff and others he had interacted with is that he went to other locations on the evening with a view to committing suicide and then because of other people around at that time, he didn’t believe it was appropriate to undertake that act there, he drove to where the incident occurred and our understanding was that was in fact spontaneous on the night, that was not preplanned. Hinch said his opinion was ACL head Lyle Shelton was “desperate to make the ACL martyrs in all of this. I think the ACL was quite keen to be seen as a target”. Is this why the AFP within hours of it happening, were telling journalists, were telling other people this was a suicide, this had nothing to do with the same-sex marriage debate, it had nothing to do with anything? AFP commissioner Andrew Colvin said he did not want to comment on what Shelton’s motivations may have been. I accept that he is concerned for his employees and that is a very legitimate concern that he has. We needed to make a statement to the public in the morning to make sure there was an appropriate level of information so the public could understand the events of the evening. ... We didn’t back brief journalists, we did a press conference to everybody who was available and stated what we believed the facts to be at the time. And as I said before I am still confident that subsequent investigations, subsequent facts that have come out have only reinforced the view that we had on that day.” In Australia, the crisis support service Lifeline is on 13 11 14. In the US, the National Suicide Prevention Hotline is 1-800-273-8255. In the UK, the Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123. Hotlines in other countries can be found here In the communications estimates hearing, the media reforms are under the spotlight. Sarah Hanson-Young is pressing quite hard about the journalism cadetship program at the moment. We’ll have more on that for you soon. A few moments before, Sam Dastyari was pressing Mitch Fifield on what he believed his role was when it came to the public broadcasters and competition. Dastyari: “Is there a role for the minister in reducing competition faced by commercial broadcasters ... be it from the ABC, SBS or Facebook or Google? You said before minister at the start, you wanted to see thriving commercial broadcasters, and I don’t think anyone doesn’t want to see commercial broadcasting, but to what extent is there a role for government to create, or to protect them.” Fifield: “I think there is a role for government to help create an environment that is conducive to having a healthy and viable commercial media sector, alongside having a healthy public media sector.” Dastyari moves on to SBS, and the role of the broadcaster when it comes to advertising. Dastyari: “Do you see SBS in a different boat in this competitive neutrality enquiry than the ABC in that they do have an advertising component, so they are clearly going to be competing for commercial audiences. Is that correct?” Fifield: “You are right, SBS is an organisation unlike the ABC that can take advertising, and that could well see SBS making different programming decisions and other decisions compared to the ABC.” Some deeply uncomfortable scenes in the legal and constitutional affairs estimates hearing. Eric Abetz and Ian Macdonald made a point of questioning the Australian federal police over their arson investigation involving a mentally ill man who attempted suicide by driving into the Australian Christian Lobby office late last year. Jaden Duong, 36, who struggled with mental illness for much of his life, died by suicide in September. He was awaiting trial on arson charges for the December incident. Head of the ACL, Lyle Shelton, has refused to concede the incident was not politically motivated, despite the AFP repeatedly stating Duong was motivated by a desire to end his own life. On Tuesday morning, Macdonald and Abetz took up the ACL’s case during estimates with the AFP’s Andrew Colvin and the ACT police’s Justine Saunders. Saunders said Duong looked at other locations, but decided against them because were too crowded. He decided on the ACL carpark, she said, because it was empty. Macdonald and Abetz do not look convinced and Penny Wong and Louise Pratt attempted to stop some of the questioning, which went into methodology on the grounds it was damaging and breached guidelines on how to talk about suicide. It’s for those reasons we won’t go into the transcript here. Colvin eventually puts a stop to it when he says he is uncomfortable discussing something which is before the coroner. In Australia, the crisis support service Lifeline is on 13 11 14. In the US, the National Suicide Prevention Hotline is 1-800-273-8255. In the UK, the Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123. Hotlines in other countries can be found here We are still waiting on word from the high court. There is no mention of the judgment on the court schedule for today. Labor’s shadow treasury spokesperson, Chris Bowen, said he is yet to see the Productivity Commission report Scott Morrison has been talking about this morning, but he said from what he saw, he welcomed its findings. If the reporting is correct, and there is no reason to doubt it, it is humiliating for Scott Morrison. All he has got is a corporate tax cut. He wants to reduce the taxes on Australia’s businesses by $65bn and increase [the burden on] workers by $44bn over the next decade with the Medicare levy rise. On workers who earn as little as $21,000. If he talks about inclusive growth today, if he talks about putting people first, let him explain this: why is he standing by and watching penalty rates be cut? Why is he watching wages growth at record lows and then cutting wages through the penalty rate cut? Why is it acting [against Australians who earn as] little as $21,000 per year, while giving a $65bn tax cut to big business? That is not inclusive growth. That is the opposite of inclusive growth. Caucus and party room meetings are scheduled for today – we’ll bring you an update on what went on as soon as they get out. The department of energy fronted the environment committee in estimates overnight. It looks like quite a few questions about the national energy guarantee were taken on notice. Penny Wong had a go confirming the price savings the government has been touting ($110/$115 as an average some time between 2020 and 2030) but those were taken on notice as well. But the department did say that it did not have any modelling on the Neg. Which has given Mark Butler a fun morning, talking about what he is now calling the “national energy gimmick”. Here he was in his press conference this morning, talking about estimates last night. There is no paperwork about how this and analysis or modelling sections of the department with responsibility for carbon emissions and energy provision said they had no analysis about whether this policy was workable and how it would operate. We’ve also had confirmed from a range of agencies over the last day, statutory responsibilities, but the first they knew about the prime minister’s announcement was on TV. The Climate Change Authority has parliamentary statutory responsibility for policy in this area for climate change and energy and they were not consulted. And Arena, the renewable energy agency, again, wasn’t consulted at all about this policy. We’ve also had evidence confirmed from the Department of Energy about what everyone understands from this policy, that Malcolm Turnbull seeks to hide from his own Coalition party room and that if this policy goes through, it will inevitably set a price on carbon. It will inevitably lead to the market pricing the emissions reduction obligations that are set out in this policy which is a price on carbon. He also had a little bit to say about today’s the Australian’s front page story (which is an analysis of modelling). Can I also respond to the tired old beat-up on the front page of the Australian. The Australian presents this story as somehow new. If the reporter had done his research he would have discovered that News Ltd tried to kick this story along back in February to another one of its newspapers in Queensland. The problem with the story is that it reflects modelling of a policy that no one has ever supported. There have been lots of different electricity policies over the last year and Malcolm Turnbull is up to his third in one year. The policy on the front page of the Australian as far as I am aware does not reflect a policy that anyone has been advocating in this energy debate. The big difference between Labor’s policies and the government’s for that matter in the modelling on the front page of the Australian is the modelling assumes that the policy would be internationally linked and would start with a carbon price of $69 per tonne of carbon in 2020 ... Malcolm Turnbull is proposing a similar price but I can tell you the Labor party isn’t. If the Australian was interested in modelling about the emissions-intensity scheme idea the government was advocating until December, the energy markets commission, the CSI our row and others have model that scheme, the sort of scheme that Labor and the government was advocating in 2016 and shown that an emissions-intensity scheme which operates in a closed market, not internationally linked, without that sort of carbon price that the Australian is talking about, that would lead to power prices being up to $15bn lower over the course of the next decade. The rumours George Brandis will be moving on to an overseas post sometime towards the end of the year, (when Malcolm Turnbull is expected to reshuffle his cabinet, with Christian Porter moving to AG and Mathias Cormann as Senate leader the strongest of the reshuffle rumours) will not go away. New Zealand is one of the more recent suggestions. For the record, Brandis has repeatedly denied he is going anywhere. But why is this relevant? Well, because he is fronting estimates this morning. And it may be one of the last opportunities we have to witness one of the best sideshows parliament has to offer Penny Wong v George Brandis. If you get a chance, I recommend you tune in. I’ll try to keep you as updated as I can. As we come to the end of this horrible marriage equality survey process, Q&amp;A took a look at the debate. Magda Szubanski was the only LGBTI representative on a panel examining LGBTI rights. After sitting through a program (and not only holding her own, demolishing the no arguments and eloquently pointing out the hypocrisies contained within them) hearing people making judgement about herself, her loved ones and the LGBTI community, Szubanski returned with this: I’m not a religious authority. I’m less of an atheist than people would think. 74.9% of people in Australia get married outside the church. I accept that the church will never marry me. That grieves me in ways you will never know. I’m the one in my family when I buried my parents I organised every detail of the masses, I wrote the orders of service, I put the pall over my mother’s coffin. Now I accept the Catholic church will never marry me but you won’t even let me marry outside the church. Why is it your right to determine – fair enough, in your domain, you do what you like. We live in a live and let live society. I don’t want to tell anyone else what to do. Why should you have the right to tell me or any other person, straight or gay, what they do in the civil domain? That’s not your domain.” Mitch Fifield was on Today explaining why the NBN back and forth was not a blame game, because it was Labor’s fault. “It’s not a matter of playing the blame game, what we inherited from Labor was essentially a failed project. “...It was a failed project. They’d spend about six and a half billion dollars over four years and connected a grand total of 51,000 people. We’ve turned it around. We’ve got it on track. NBN is now available to more than half the nation. It’ll be 75 per cent by the middle of next year. And it will be all done and dusted by 2020. And the good news is, that’s a good six to eight years sooner than would have been the case under our predecessors. “But our job is not to look in the rear view mirror. Our job is to focus on getting this thing rolled out. Which we’re doing. Getting it completed by 2020. Which we’ll achieve. And, as I say, that’s six to eight years sooner than would have been the case under our predecessors. And the good news is because of the approach we’re taking, Australians will have internet bills of $500 a year less than would have been the case under Labor’s approach.” Kevin Rudd returned to the Sunrise couch this morning. Other than giving brief descriptions of former colleagues and rivals (Mark Latham: slightly mad, Julia Gillard: doing well, Joe Hockey: good bloke) he also spoke about how he thought he handled the pressure of politics: It honestly depends on the day. The thing I would say to bear in mind is that within six months of taking over we have the avalanche of the GFC, the global financial crisis. To put it in these terms we did two jobs at once. We got elected six months also before with a mandate for change in 40 or 50 different areas, chugging our way through that, I took my word to the Australian people seriously and then the tidal wave GFC comes. It was like you had that job, 12 hours a day, then the rest of it. The honest answer is many of us did not sleep much. Tough time.” And as for reports he was hard to work with, the former PM had this to say: What I would say to that is, who do you work most closely with? Your own staff. When I came back as prime minister, my own staff came back with me, people who worked for me for years. When people knife you in the back, which is what happened, they will invent their own narratives and say he was a nasty person to me, he didn’t smile at me in the lift one morning. Well, grow up.” Scott Morrison has also been out selling his new plan to boost the nation’s productivity. Katharine Murphy had this report: The treasurer, Scott Morrison, will flag ongoing reforms in health, education and energy to boost national productivity in response to an inquiry by the Productivity Commission to be released on Tuesday. Morrison will use a speech to the Committee for Economic Development Australia to outline the main findings of the new work on productivity – which includes recommendations to adopt patient-centred healthcare, transform teaching capacity in the education system to help workers manage the profound transitions in the labour market, and the creation of more functional cities, which could boost gross domestic product by $29bn. The report is the first instalment in a series of five-yearly reviews by the Productivity Commission examining contemporary methods to boost productivity – advice that will sit alongside the intergenerational report produced by the treasury every five years. Speaking to ABC radio this morning, Morrison said the reason he initiated the report was “I wanted … a sister publication to the intergenerational report”. And that looks at the big pressures on the budget over, you know, the next 50 years, and the things that drive living standards, boost more and better-paid jobs, really falls to productivity and I believed it was time that we had a close look at the things that would drive that. Now, as I said in my previous answer, the traditional areas where we’ve seen productivity growth lift in the past, they remain relevant and they – tax cuts remain vital to boosting wages because we know that the more capital there is invested per worker, then we know the better wages that are paid. I mean that’s the clear analysis from Treasury and the data that is available to us. It’s all of the above. Look,the Coalition has always been supporting health and education. It has always been part of our budgets and what we’ve always said is it’s not just about how much money you spend. The commission has said it’s how you spend it. As we said, it’s the prime minister’s birthday (63rd we believed). I predict there will be some FM radio interviews on the horizon. It’s one way to guarantee a softer landing. He started the day with a walk. It’s day two of estimates and the House of Representatives’ second sitting week. It’s also the prime minister’s birthday. And what a day it is shaping up to be. Mike Bowers was up and about early and snapped the birthday boy on his morning walk. But that may be the only bit of peace he’ll get all day. The NBN blame game continues after the Four Corners report last night. Yesterday Turnbull pointed the finger at Labor for the “train wreck”. Kevin Rudd, spruiking his new book, pointed it right back at Turnbull for the decision to “change horses midway” and switch fibre-to-the-premise to fibre-to-the-node. Scott Morrrison has been sent out to sell the government’s side on that this morning and it is going as well as you could expect. Josh Frydenberg has also been out and about early talking energy, as the government desperately tries to take back the agenda. It’s still after bipartisan support, while at the same time attacking the opposition over its policy. Yesterday, it tried to talk energy by making almost every dixer about it during question time, while Labor had moved on to the NBN. Will it have any better luck today? Estimates continues and the attorney general, George Brandis, is back in the hot seat, this time representing his own department (yesterday he stood in for the prime minister). The Senate committees sat until late last night, so there are going to be a few cranky members on both sides of the table, which should make for fun viewing. The Guardian Essential poll is out. Katharine Murphy reports: More than half of people who have returned their ballot in the same-sex marriage postal survey say they have voted in favour of marriage equality, according to the latest Guardian Essential poll. The new survey of 1,859 voters records 60% saying they have voted yes, which is down 4% from the last time the question was asked three weeks ago, and 34% saying they have voted no, which is up 4% in the same timeframe. Before new postal survey participation estimates from the Australian Bureau of Statistics expected on Tuesday, 75% of the Guardian Essential sample reports that they have already voted in the ballot, and 8% say they will definitely vote. So stay tuned for all of the fun and games. Let me know how your question time bingo card is shaping up as we head into the afternoon. The Guardian Australia brains trust are on board, as always and Mike Bowers will be creating his magic throughout the day. You can reach the man with the lens at @mpbowers and @mikepbowers and you’ll find me stalking the comments, or more frequently at @amyremeikis.

The backbencher, who is the son of the former Labour leader Neil Kinnock, called on his party to challenge the government directly in the House of Commons, saying that time was running out to stop a hard Brexit. He said the motion should read: “That this house has no confidence in the ability of her majesty’s government to negotiate the terms of the UK’s withdrawal from the EU in such a way as to protect and promote the jobs, livelihoods and long-term interests of the British people.” The prime minister does not have enough of her own Conservative MPs to win a vote, but her government is being supported by the Democratic Unionist party, giving her a working majority of about 13. It would be unlikely that any Conservative or DUP MPs would back a Labour motion of no confidence in the government. However, Kinnock argued that such a motion was necessary even if it ended up unifying the other side because the Commons should have the chance to object to May’s Brexit plan. “The answer to that is simply that the government is making such a hideous mess of this supremely important task that parliament must be given the opportunity to decide whether they should be allowed to continue,” he wrote in an article for the Guardian. “The government’s approach to the Brexit negotiations is heading for the rocks. It is Labour’s patriotic duty to demonstrate that we are ready, willing and able to take the helm, and to steer our country into safer waters.” He said the motion should be tabled, debated and voted upon as soon as possible as “time is running out and with every day that passes the government stumbles closer to the disastrous no-deal scenario”. The last government to be defeated in a no-confidence motion was James Callaghan’s minority Labour administration in 1979. Callaghan lost the vote by 311 to 310, which led to the election of Margaret Thatcher as Conservative prime minister."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/oct/23/sweating-blood-hematohidrosis-canada","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-23T20:04:15Z","webTitle":"'Sweating' blood: mysterious case leaves Canadian experts searching for answers","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/23/sweating-blood-hematohidrosis-canada","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/oct/23/sweating-blood-hematohidrosis-canada","fields":{"headline":"'Sweating' blood: mysterious case leaves Canadian experts searching for answers","bodyText":"The case left doctors perplexed: a 21-year-old Italian woman with no gashes or skin lesions arrived at a medical ward, where she described years of sweating blood from her face and the palms of her hands. The bleeding would often start while she was sleeping or during physical activity and could last anywhere from one to five minutes. While the intensity of the bleeding seemed to increase with stress, she couldn’t single out any obvious trigger. Her condition has been documented by two physicians from the University of Florence in Italy in the latest issue of the Canadian Medical Association Journal. The condition – which had begun about three years before she sought medical help – had taken a toll on her mental health, wrote doctors Roberto Maglie and Marzia Caproni. “Our patient had become socially isolated owing to embarrassment over the bleeding and she reported symptoms consistent with major depressive disorder and panic disorder.” They prescribed her anti-anxiety medications, but the bleeding continued. After a round of tests and observations ruled out the possibility that she was faking the condition, she was diagnosed with hematohidrosis, a rarely reported condition in which patients spontaneously sweat blood through unbroken skin. Doctors treated her with propranolol, a heart and blood pressure medication, which reduced the bleeding but failed to eliminate it completely. Jacalyn Duffin, the Canadian medical historian and haematologist who wrote a commentary that accompanies the report, said she was initially sceptical. “My first thought was, is this real? Could it be fake?” The mystery deepened after she canvassed her senior haematology colleagues and found that not one of them had ever come across such a case. Duffin then delved into the medical literature, managing to turn up more than two dozen similar cases reported around the world in the past 15 years or so. In many of these, researchers had carefully documented the tests they had carried out to eliminate the possibility of other bleeding disorders and the evidence they had found to suggest the presence of blood in the sweat ducts. “I came to the conclusion that it’s plausible and that it’s possible,” said Duffin. The majority of these cases involved young women or children. Many of the reports documented that the bleeding was preceded by emotional trauma, such as witnessing violence at home or at school. In all of the patients, the condition was transient, lasting anywhere from a month to four years. Little else – from its causes to how to halt the bleeding – is known, said Duffin. Some have hypothesised the condition could be caused by blood coagulation disorders or a rupture of the smaller blood vessels within tissues. While Duffin found references of the condition stretching back to the writings of Aristotle, the condition – described in one report as a “kind of modern-day stigmata” – is often referenced alongside Christianity and the crucifixion, an association that may make it more difficult to accept, she noted. “Blood is so pervasive – in not only religious mythology, but all mythology – that it makes people sort of think twice,” she said. “I began to wonder if one of the reasons journals don’t publish it, or are a little bit leery of it, is because it has kind of been owned by religious sources.” This could be slowly changing. Of the 42 reports Duffin came across, almost half had appeared in the last five years, raising questions as to whether the incidence of the condition is increasing or whether it’s simply becoming more recognised by doctors. This latest report might also help to shine a spotlight the condition, noted Duffin. She said she had already heard from one man who believed his relative – a returning war veteran with PTSD – might also be afflicted. “The reason that I think it’s possible that there might be more out there than we know is that it seems that, although it’s spectacular, it’s benign,” she said. “In all of these cases I dug out – the 42 case reports – the patients all survived. They’re terrified because it’s really frightening to have this happen, but it seems to be quite innocuous as a symptom.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2017/oct/23/uk-likely-to-end-up-with-canadian-style-deal-warns-michel-barnier","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-24T08:30:10Z","webTitle":"Brexit: UK likely to end up with Canadian-style deal, warns Barnier","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/oct/23/uk-likely-to-end-up-with-canadian-style-deal-warns-michel-barnier","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/oct/23/uk-likely-to-end-up-with-canadian-style-deal-warns-michel-barnier","fields":{"headline":"Brexit: UK likely to end up with Canadian-style deal, warns Barnier","bodyText":"The EU’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, has warned that Britain can expect a trade deal little better than the one the EU struck with Canada – and even that would take years to negotiate, despite Theresa May’s claims to the contrary over Britain’s future after Brexit. Barnier said he could envision a short transition period being agreed between the EU and the UK before March 2019 to ease the UK’s exit from the bloc, but it would require the British government accepting the continuation of EU law and the jurisdiction of the European court of justice. A future trade deal, however, would have to be negotiated over “several years” and “will be very different” from the status quo, Barnier told a group of European newspapers. “If we reach an agreement on the orderly withdrawal of the United Kingdom, such a [transition] period, both short and framed, is possible,” he said. “To my mind, it makes sense that it covers the financial period, so until 2020. It would leave us more time to prepare for the future relationship. “But I insist on one point: such a period would be possible only if it is framed by the maintenance of all of the regulatory architecture and European supervision, including jurisdictional. It would maintain the economic status quo and all obligations of the UK.” “From the moment the UK told us that it wants out of the single market and the customs union, we will have to work on a model that is closer to the agreement signed with Canada. “The single market is a set of rules and standards and is a shared jurisdiction. Its integrity is non-negotiable, as is the autonomy of decisions of the 27. Either you’re in or you’re out.” The deal struck between the EU and Canada, known as the the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA), lifts 98% of tariffs on imports between the two parties, and was a significant move towards freer trade. It does not, however, significantly reduce non-tariff barriers for trade and traditional rules-of-origin regulations would apply for the UK’s exports to the EU, under such a deal. If the non-EU import content of a UK export was too high, for example, there would be a loss of duty-free access for particular sensitive industrial goods, notably cars. A lack of regulatory harmonisation for medicines, automobiles and aircraft equipment would also require products being checked at the border. A deal similar to CETA would furthermore offer little to the UK’s vital financial services sector post-Brexit, when businesses located in the City will lose their automatic right to offer their services across the EU. Barnier said of the negotiations over the future that they would be highly complex and would take many years before they could be put to the national parliaments for ratification. He said: “The two phases are difficult. The second will be very different and will last several years. It is truly unique because instead of promoting regulatory convergence, it will aim to frame a difference. It will involve risks, including about its political ratification, making all the more necessary transparency around these topics.” Barnier’s comments appeared to contradict the prime minister’s claims in the House of Commons on Monday that the details of a future trade deal would be settled before the UK left the bloc. May has insisted this will be necessary to allow the implementation in changes to customs controls, for example, in the two years directly after March 2019. The prime minister had suggested in her Florence speech in September that a deal between the UK and the EU would be far more advanced than that struck with Canada, claiming that such a deal “compared with what exists between Britain and the EU today would represent such a restriction on our mutual market access that it would benefit neither of our economies”. May added in her speech in Italy: “Not only that, it would start from the false premise that there is no pre-existing regulatory relationship between us. And precedent suggests that it could take years to negotiate. We can do so much better than this.” However, Barnier appeared to offer the British government little hope of such an advance on the Canadian deal being possible, although he acknowledged his team was working on the details of an exit treaty. He said: “The strategic interest of our continent is to partner with this very large country with a permanent seat on the United Nations security council. But this is not a reason to undermine the single market.” Of a no-deal scenario, Barnier said: “We do not want it at all, but we do not exclude any option. Such a scenario would cause us problems, and much larger [ones] in the UK.“I will give you some examples. In London, to leave the Euratom treaty without an agreement would mean immediate problems for the import of nuclear material, whether for nuclear power plants or hospitals. “That would mean leaving the single European sky agreement, and no longer being able to mutually recognise pilot qualifications or get take off or landing clearance. And what would happen to the food products imported into the United Kingdom? There would immediately be customs controls, perhaps taxes. That’s why I want a deal.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2017/oct/23/gabriel-jesus-manchester-city-wolverhampton-wanderers","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-23T21:34:00Z","webTitle":"Manchester City’s Gabriel Jesus closes on unbeaten year as Wolves approach","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/oct/23/gabriel-jesus-manchester-city-wolverhampton-wanderers","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/oct/23/gabriel-jesus-manchester-city-wolverhampton-wanderers","fields":{"headline":"Manchester City’s Gabriel Jesus closes on unbeaten year as Wolves approach","bodyText":"Gabriel Jesus is nearly there – a whole 12 months without tasting defeat in a competitive match, for club or country. The Manchester City striker is just two fixtures shy of achieving the feat and given City’s form, as well as his own, he should get there with relative ease. The countdown begins on Tuesday evening as the Premier League leaders switch attention to the Carabao Cup and a fourth‑round home tie against Wolverhampton Wanderers. The Midlands side arrive at the Etihad Stadium in fine form, leading the Championship after winning nine of their opening 13 fixtures, but they are likely to be overpowered by a City side in scintillating, free-scoring form. After that there is a league visit to West Bromwich Albion on Saturday. Not the easiest of assignments but, again, one City should navigate with relative ease. And should they do so, with Jesus involved on both occasions, it will be a case of mission accomplished for the 20-year-old and a remarkable run stretching back to 29 October 2016 when his Palmeiras side lost 1-0 against Santos in Brazil’s Serie A. “I’m very happy to have been all this time without losing a game,” Jesus said. “But it’s not only me, it’s thanks to the teams I have played in, such as Palmeiras, the Brazilian national team and now Manchester City. I’m very happy for achieving that milestone of a whole year without a defeat. But I must keep working hard and keep performing well in the games.” Jesus has been an unqualified success since signing for City, from Palmeiras, for an initial £27m in August 2016. The Brazil international has scored 15 goals in 23 appearances for Pep Guardiola’s side and who knows how many more he could have secured had he not sustained a fractured metatarsal at Bournemouth in February which kept him out of action for more than two months. “The worst moment of my career so far was the injury,” Jesus said. “But it didn’t knock me down. I had everybody’s support. That helped me a lot to overcome the injury.” Jesus is almost certain to feature against Wolves but may not start in what is expected to be a much changed lineup. Sergio Agüero is expected to appear from the off and could become City’s all-time record goalscorer. The Argentinian shares the accolade with Eric Brook having struck his 177th goal for City in the 3-0 victory against Burnley on Saturday. Meanwhile, the Football Association has announced that Bernardo Silva will not be retrospectively punished for diving after winning the penalty against Burnley that led to Agüero opening the scoring on 30 minutes. The 23-year-old appeared to go down easily under a challenge from the visitors’ goalkeeper Nick Pope, but in tweet published by the FA on Monday, a spokesperson said: “Manchester City’s Bernardo Silva faces no further action for alleged simulation against Burnley FC on 21/10/17 after an FA panel review.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2017/oct/23/children-needing-asylum-in-uk-not-being-helped-by-dubs-scheme","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-23T19:42:04Z","webTitle":"Children needing asylum in UK not being helped by Dubs scheme","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/23/children-needing-asylum-in-uk-not-being-helped-by-dubs-scheme","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/oct/23/children-needing-asylum-in-uk-not-being-helped-by-dubs-scheme","fields":{"headline":"Children needing asylum in UK not being helped by Dubs scheme","bodyText":"Not a single child refugee from Greece or Italy has arrived in the UK under a scheme to help settle lone children since the dismantling of the Calais migrant camp a year ago, with 280 empty places offered by councils going unfilled. On the anniversary of the closure of the camp on the French coast, the chair of the home affairs select committee, Yvette Cooper, called for the overhaul of the so-called Dubs scheme, saying it was “truly shocking” that councils were still waiting for child refugees to fill the places. The scheme was created by an amendment from the Labour peer Lord Dubs, which was passed in April 2016 and intended to bring 3,000 lone refugee children stuck in camps in Europe to Britain. After around 200 unaccompanied children were brought over from France, the government said in January it would limit the total number arriving under the scheme to 350, but then backtracked several months later and offered an additional 130 places. However, the home secretary, Amber Rudd, admitted during questions from Cooper at a select committee hearing last week that 280 places offered by local authorities had still not been filled but said the government was committed to doing so. “I believe it is right we help the most vulnerable children,” she said. “We have sent ministers over, we have sent officials over, we are committed to filling them.” Not a single child or teenager has ever arrived in the UK under the Dubs scheme from either Greece or Italy, where more than 8,000 unaccompanied asylum-seeking children have registered over the past year. The refugee charity Safe Passage is to seek a judicial review next week on behalf of a 16-year-old Syrian boy seeking a transfer to the UK, who has been assessed as severely traumatised and vulnerable. The charity said the boy had registered his application to be considered for the Dubs scheme and transfer to the UK eight months ago but was still waiting for a date, despite receiving confirmation from a London council that they would support him. Safe Passage said the boy had been moved to protective police custody because of his severe vulnerability and the lack of places in official shelter. Safe Passage’s Beth Gardiner-Smith said: “This highly vulnerable boy’s life has been on hold for a year and a half because of the delays to implementing the Dubs scheme. “There is a local authority place in Britain already waiting to provide him with the care he needs to begin rebuilding his life. He should now be transferred immediately rather than left waiting whilst his condition deteriorates.” Cooper said she wanted to see the government commit to major reform of the scheme on the anniversary of the demolition of the Calais “Jungle” camp. Currently children and teenagers are only eligible for the Dubs scheme if they can show they arrived in Europe before 20 March 2016, but Cooper said the date needed to be brought forward because it was preventing Greece and Italy from effectively managing the relocation process effectively. She said the design of the scheme was “too bureaucratic and complicated” for overwhelmed Greek and Italian authorities to operate. “They need to reform it urgently. The government’s failure to help these children and teenagers is shameful. It should not be beyond the wit of the Home Office to urgently sort this out.” Cooper said the government also needed to revisit the number of places available, with some councils potentially able to offer more places than were currently listed, as well as guaranteeing the scheme would remain open, rather than close once the total of 480 spots are filled. “Parliament passed the Dubs amendment so Britain could do its but just as we did with the Kindertransport that brought Alf Dubs to sanctuary in Britain many years ago,” she said. “Yet one year on from the clearance of the Calais camp the Home Office has failed to take any Dubs children or teenagers from Greece or Italy, even though they have thousands without proper support.” A Home Office spokesperson said the UK was transferring child refugees to the UK using a number of schemes, including the Dublin framework where children have the right to be reunited with family members. “The UK has a proud history of hosting, supporting and protecting those in need, including some of the most vulnerable children affected by the migration crisis,” the spokesperson said. “In the year to June 2017, the UK granted asylum or another form of leave to over 9,000 children and more than 42,000 children since 2010. At the request of the French Government, the UK put in place an expedited process, which resulted in over 750 unaccompanied children being transferred to the UK in the autumn of 2016. We continue to work to transfer eligible children here quickly and safely under the Dublin Regulation and the Dubs Amendment.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2017/oct/29/megan-henwood-river-review-worldly-mature-work","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-29T08:00:22Z","webTitle":"Megan Henwood: River review – a worldly, mature work","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/oct/29/megan-henwood-river-review-worldly-mature-work","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2017/oct/29/megan-henwood-river-review-worldly-mature-work","fields":{"headline":"Megan Henwood: River review – a worldly, mature work","bodyText":"Megan Henwood is “folk” in the same way as Laura Marling, meaning she’s a singer-songwriter with an acoustic guitar.

In 2014, the Financial Conduct Authority commissioned a review of Royal Bank of Scotland’s alleged mistreatment of small business customers in the period 2008-2013. That inquiry was disgracefully late in arriving and only happened because an independent adviser to Sir Vince Cable, then the business secretary, made a series of explosive allegations about RBS’s behaviour. Now, with three more years having passed, it is still not possible to say when the final chapter will be written. The regulator, under political pressure, has published what it calls an “interim summary” of the independent review. The FCA will now go away and examine if there is “any basis for further action within our powers.” By the time it has finished pondering, it is a safe bet that some of the events will be a decade old. No wonder everybody, from the mistreated customers to RBS chief executive Ross McEwan, seems weary. The only (not very) satisfactory part of Monday’s summary is that the findings do not differ materially from what the FCA said a year ago. RBS was still found not guilty of the most serious charge of deliberately tipping companies into default to profit from their demise. But the so-called “skilled person’s” report found “widespread inappropriate treatment” of small businesses. Actually, calling the misbehaviour widespread is putting it mildly. Some 92% of viable firms handled by RBS’ Global Restructuring Group suffered “inappropriate action”, such as unnecessary fees being added or a simple failure to consider alternative turnaround options. Yet the doubly frustrating aspect is that the clean-up, like the investigation, also seems to be advancing at snail’s pace. RBS has made refund offers totalling £115m but the actual complaints process – the other undertaking given a year ago – is merely described as “underway.” Some 939 complaints have been received. Nobody would pretend this ground is easy to cover – the FCA notes that a typical case in its sample filled 10 A4 binders. But when this process eventually ends, the regulator’s first job is to find a faster and simpler system of redress. This saga has gone on too long. The deceleration of the UK car market We already knew the UK car market was weak: September’s figures for new registrations, showing a 9.3% decline, made it odds-on that sales of new cars will fall in the UK for the first time this year since 2011. Now, after the heavy profits warning from big dealer Pendragon, we can see that the demand is even weaker than the official statistics suggest. The mini-revelation in the Pendragon numbers is that overall registration numbers have been distorted by the practice of dealers “pre-registering” cars before a sale to a customer has been made. From the dealers’ point of view, this technique is entirely logical: they need to hit manufacturers’ incentive targets. But the effect is to overstate the true level of demand for new cars. Registrations are weak, but real sales to real customers are even weaker. A drop in demand at the top has a cascade effect, which is why Pendragon’s profits warning was so severe. Those “pre-registered” cars might need a price reduction of £500 beause they no longer count as brand new. Then the demonstration vehicles need an accompanying cut. So do three-month old cars coming from rental firms, and so on. At the beginning of August, Pendragon, which operates the Evans Halshaw and Stratstone brands, was confident of making £75m of profit this year; now it is expecting £60m. That change in direction has been sudden. The only good news – from its point of view – is that it is easy to see how the position could reverse. The car manufacturers just need to produce fewer vehicles. They have every incentive to do so, of course, since falling prices don’t suit their purposes. The open question, however, is how quickly they will react. Long supply chains do not make the process simple. Pendragon expects its own profits to start growing again next year. Perhaps they will, but you understand why its shares fell 18%. The car industry has enjoyed five years of acceleration, and got used to turbo-charging growth with leasing contracts. Expect the change of gears to be clunky. Mediclinic’s bid for Spire is below fair value Here’s one definition of an opportunistic bid: make your move one month after your target issued a profits warning and two weeks before its new chief executive arrives. The bidder is Mediclinic, a FTSE 100 operator of private hospitals in South Africa, the United Arab Emirates and Switzerland. It wants to pay 300p-ish in cash and shares for Spire Healthcare, which works the same field in the UK. Since Mediclinic already owns 29.9% of Spire it presumably thinks it can intimidate other shareholders with its lowball offer. Those investors should stand their ground. The bid looks about 15% below fair value and Mediclinic’s own shares are hardly a picture of health. A fund managed by the ubiquitous Neil Woodford owns 15% of Spire. For all his current troubles, one assumes Woodford will demand more – a lot more."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/oct/28/metoo-hashtag-sexual-harassment-violence-challenge-campaign-women-men","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-28T05:45:50Z","webTitle":"#MeToo is here to stay.

We must challenge all men about sexual harassment","bodyText":"The hashtag #MeToo might draw attention to sexual violence, but will it make men stop? #MeToo, of course. But more like; #metooandeveryoneIknowonadailybasis. Last week, #MeToo posts blew up all over Twitter as actor Alyssa Milano encouraged women to share their personal stories of sexual harassment and more women accused US producer Harvey Weinstein of sexual assault and harassment. To witness a global community of female solidarity take place online was empowering and goosepimple-inducing, but it is important to continue this conversation in real life, with each and every man we know, in order to initiate the kind of change all women have been hoping for. Women, after all, have been making a fuss about sexual assault for years. Activist Tarana Burke coined the “me too” phrase more than a decade ago to support women of colour surviving sexual abuse, and, in the UK, Reclaim the Night marches were started in 1977 by the Leeds Revolutionary Feminist Group, four years after Rape Crisis organisations were set up in England and Wales. But if we had all been listened to and if there was no work left to do, the 2017 campaign would have fizzled out after a few celebrity-led tweets. Instead, Twitter reported that the hashtag was shared nearly a million times in 48 hours. On Facebook, the comments and reactions totalled more than 12m in 24 hours. The campaign took off because it is real. It draws attention to sexual harassment at every level. It is not just glamorous women and Hollywood stars, it is your sister’s teenage mate, your co-worker, your best friend. It is happening every day and now. And no, we are not always referring to incidents so horrendous that women are rendered incapable of ever leaving the house again (although sexual harassment is often dangerously perceived as existing within a hierarchy of seriousness), but we are pinpointing a culture in which to verbally or physically sexualise a woman – as she is going about her daily business, when she is with children or friends, or when she is alone – is entirely normal. Because of this online campaign I will be asking my younger brother and my male friends and colleagues how they really behave on nights out, what they would do if they saw something inappropriate, and what they think constitutes sexual harassment. You should, too. Because women know that this kind of stuff has been going on for years, and it is time that the men closest to us understood the extent of it, so our collective anger can be used to force a shift in the gender paradigm. I don’t have the space to rattle off the countless instances of sexual harassment that have involved me and the women I know, so I will limit myself to some of the most terrifying ones, in which I remember being fully terrified of the uneven power dynamics at play when we have been backed into a (literal or metaphorical) corner. The time in a bar in which I was shoved in the chest by a guy who was incensed I hadn’t told him my name after he’d come over to talk to me “in front of his friends” (he grew so aggressive I had to ask the manager to help me and my friend escape out the back exit). The friend who was recently touched up by a manager at work and is still too terrified to report it. Another, who was asked out repeatedly by a married colleague while she was training him at work. The food delivery man who, each time he comes to my house, manages to elevate his once tolerably sleazy compliments to those that are now just creepy. And no, it is not “all men” – not the ones we know, who are kind and empathetic, and who listen to us. But the ones who frown and flinch with anger when we recount what has happened. Those who try to silence or shush us with comments about our overactive imaginations or so-called provocative behaviour. Sexual harassment percolates like a poison into my life and into the lives of all the women I know; it is an insidious encroachment into our existence. It is the white noise we cannot drown out. And it won’t stop until men pledge to change a global culture of sexual entitlement, alongside us. @GeorginaLawton"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"business/2017/oct/23/former-city-regulator-chief-to-give-evidence-in-private-in-lloyds-case","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-23T17:36:42Z","webTitle":"Former City regulator chief to give evidence in private in Lloyds case","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/oct/23/former-city-regulator-chief-to-give-evidence-in-private-in-lloyds-case","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2017/oct/23/former-city-regulator-chief-to-give-evidence-in-private-in-lloyds-case","fields":{"headline":"Former City regulator chief to give evidence in private in Lloyds case","bodyText":"Sir Hector Sants, a former chief City regulator, is due to give evidence to the high court in private in relation to a case brought by Lloyds Banking Group shareholders over the information they were provided at the time of the HBOS takeover in 2008. The former chief executive of the Financial Services Authority made an application in July to allow him to give evidence in private. This can now be reported after an application to the high court made by five media organisations, including the Guardian, to establish what the judge had described as the “special arrangements” that have been put in place for him to give evidence. Mr Justice Norris made his judgment after hearing the application by the Guardian, the Financial Times, Daily Mail publisher Associated Newspapers, the Times and Bloomberg. He made his judgment as the fourth day of the case brought by the shareholders began. About 6,000 Lloyds investors are claiming £600m in compensation on the basis that they were not told about loans being made to HBOS when they voted through the takeover in November 2008. The claim is against Lloyds and five of its former directors, including the former chairman Sir Victor Blank and former chief executive Eric Daniels, who are all contesting the claim. Lloyds announced the HBOS deal in September 2008 just days after Lehman Brothers collapsed, marking the beginning of the financial crash. The government eventually took a 43% stake in the enlarged Lloyds Banking Group, but it no longer owns any shares after selling its final tranche in May. Norris told the court that he was “not conducting a public inquiry” into the events that took place in 2008. The case is scheduled to run for 14 weeks and Sants is expected to give evidence in December. The FSA has now been replaced with the Financial Conduct Authority. Blank and Daniels are scheduled to give evidence in the coming weeks along with three other former directors named in the case: former finance director Tim Tookey, ex-head of retail Helen Weir and former head of wholesale banking Truett Tate."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/oct/23/israel-president-accuses-netanyahu-and-allies-of-democracy-revolution","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-23T17:56:06Z","webTitle":"Israeli president accuses Netanyahu and allies of endangering democracy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/23/israel-president-accuses-netanyahu-and-allies-of-democracy-revolution","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/oct/23/israel-president-accuses-netanyahu-and-allies-of-democracy-revolution","fields":{"headline":"Israeli president accuses Netanyahu and allies of endangering democracy","bodyText":"Israel’s president, Reuven Rivlin, has launched a stark denunciation of the policies of the rightwing government of the prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, warning that Israeli democracy is in danger. In a speech at the opening of the winter session of the Knesset, the Israeli parliament, Rivlin bluntly accused government ministers of promoting efforts to weaken Israel’s supreme court and “silence the free media”. Changes to the supreme court have become a toxic political issue in a country where the the separation between the judiciary and legislature is hotly contested, and where the political right has seen the court as an obstruction to its agenda. Rivlin, whose position is largely ceremonial, described proposed moves against the court by Israel’s most rightwing government ever, in particular by the far-right education minister, Naftali Bennett, and his allies, as part of “a continuous attempt to weaken the gatekeepers of the Israeli democracy”. Seated at the dais opposite Netanyahu, he said: “In this climate of delegitimisation, the atmosphere of ‘everything is political’ trickles down to the public, who receive the message that there is no more statesmanship, that there is only ruling and democracy. And in this climate, democracy means that the strong decides.” He added: “Leadership in a democratic country is the art of creating agreements, not vanquishing opponents. A democratic society is based on building processes, not revolutions.” The Israeli president continued by criticising the politicisation of Israel’s state institutions, which critics claim have gradually been placed in the hands of people regarded as loyal to Netanyahu and ministers in his coalition. “In this revolution, the ruler is also the victim. ‘We’ll show them’ is the soundtrack of the revolution. The stateliness has gone from our country. After us the deluge.” Returning to the subject of rightwing moves to remove the ability of Israel’s top court to strike down laws passed by MPs, he added: “How can a threatened, conformist and toothless court be in the interest of the state of Israel? Of Israeli democracy?” The comments by Rivlin, who comes from the same rightwing Likud party as Netanyahu, will have particular resonance in Israel. While warnings that democracy is in danger of being undermined are commonplace on Israel’s marginalised left, Rivlin’s remarks will be harder to ignore. And while he was not explicit, the two most prominent targets of the speech appeared to be Netanyahu, who has spent months attacking the Israeli media for its revelations on a series of police corruption investigations into his conduct, and Bennett, the leader of the far-right Jewish Home party, who, with the justice minister, Ayelet Shaked, has taken aim at the supreme court. “The supreme court is not supposed to intervene and tell us if it likes or doesn’t like a specific law. That is the job of the Knesset,” Bennett told journalists earlier in the day. Rivlin’s comments come at the beginning of what looks likely to be an unusually bitter and controversial session of the Knesset, in which Netanyahu allies have already proposed a new law which critics argue could indemnify the prime minister from facing charges. Netanyahu, who has responded to various corruption investigations by attacking Israel’s media, law enforcement, judiciary and other so-called “elites” he believes are bent on his removal, began his address to parliament by listing his accomplishments, before once again ripping into critics. “This is the golden age of Israel. Israel is in the midst of an unprecedented diplomatic and economic momentum,” he said. “The industry of despondency is still here and has respectable representatives in this house and in the media.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2017/oct/27/alice-roberts-tamed-10-species-that-changed-our-world-interview","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-27T11:00:28Z","webTitle":"Alice Roberts: ‘Science needs more visible women’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/oct/27/alice-roberts-tamed-10-species-that-changed-our-world-interview","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2017/oct/27/alice-roberts-tamed-10-species-that-changed-our-world-interview","fields":{"headline":"Alice Roberts: ‘Science needs more visible women’","bodyText":"Physical anthropologist, author, broadcaster and professor of public engagement in science, Alice Roberts is a 21st-century Renaissance woman. Her face might be most familiar from Channel 4’s Time Team, or BBC2’s Coast, or one of several Horizon programmes she has presented; but she is also a qualified medical doctor, an anatomist and the author of seven popular science books, including the Wellcome prize-nominated The Incredible Unlikeliness of Being. Like its author, her new book Tamed: 10 Species That Changed Our World weaves together many forms and disciplines: genetics, archaeology, anthropology and history combine with personal anecdote, travelogue and little pieces of fiction to create a book that is both chatty and academic, rigorously scientific and full of empathy. It describes how humans have domesticated nine species of animals and plants – from dogs, cattle and horses to rice, apples and wheat – changing the species and, in doing so, transforming our environment and ourselves. The 10th species she writes about is us. It brings evidence from ancient pottery sherds and new genetic techniques to explain, for example, how the Inca invented instant mash; how 70% of modern Europeans possess a Neanderthal gene associated with freckles; and to offer a conclusive answer to the chicken and egg debate. (Spoiler alert: the egg came first.) It spans the ancient – imagining how it felt to be the first human to ride a wild horse – and the modern, presenting the anthropology and science behind controversial topics such as climate change and GM foods. She wants to “arm people with information so that they can make their own decisions”. “I think that’s pretty crucial in public engagement generally.” It was teaching that informed her presenting and writing, she explains. Having studied medicine at Cardiff University, she began teaching anatomy at Bristol and found it “so satisfying and fulfilling when you explain something to somebody and the penny drops”. But science and history were clearly in her bones. She has always felt at home in museums, particularly the department of Egyptology at the Bristol Museum near where she grew up, and as a little girl was delighted to discover that a pioneering Victorian Egyptologist, Amelia Edwards, was buried in her local churchyard in Henbury. She studied Latin and Greek at school, and talks excitedly now about “the poetry of technical terminology … you know, like levator labii superioris – a lovely, lovely phrase!” (It’s the name of the muscle that lifts the upper lip, of course.) She admits that she struggled with Charles Darwin when she first tackled On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, aged just 14: “It’s Victorian and it’s quite dense compared to what we would consider to be good writing, and he just goes on and on about pigeons. But there are aspects of his writing that I absolutely love, where you can see him working things out and playing with ideas.” But what’s really interesting about Darwin and science writing, she says, is how he used it to capture the public’s imagination. Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace presented their paper on the theory of evolution to the Linnean Society in 1858, but in the society’s annual summing-up, it announced that nothing very interesting had happened that year. It was only when the book was published a year later that the theory really caught on. “So it wasn’t the academic paper that made the big splash; it was the popular science book that he wrote to go with it. In terms of engaging with a wider audience, he was quite ahead of his time.” Engaging a wider audience with scientific ideas is now part of Roberts’ raison d’être. Having worked at Bristol for 11 years – and in TV since 2001, when she made her debut as a human bone specialist on Time Team – she was made Birmingham University’s professor of public engagement in science in 2012. It seemed like a job that could “make a difference”, she thought, and nearly six years on it still gives her a glow. Part of her work is helping other academics to involve the public in their work, and she’s pleased that “we’re now getting to the point in universities where public engagement isn’t just seen as something that you do at the weekend or in the evenings, and isn’t a distraction, but is actually built in and is an expected part of your job.” Part of it is organising events, such as the Cheltenham science festival, to provide forums for interaction and dialogue between scientists and the public, and part of it is simply about being a visible science communicator in public. A real live female one, at that. To this end, she has also just embarked on a UK-wide, 23-date tour. “Of course!” she yells when I ask if it is important to be visibly working in science as a woman. “And it’s not just women; we need diversity. Not just from a moral perspective; there’s an economic perspective as well. You’re not tapping into the widest possible pool of talent if you’re shutting some people out of particular careers.” That shutting out starts as early as school, she says. “We have plenty of young women coming into biology and medicine, but we don’t have enough coming into physics and engineering. It’s a really weird thing because, of course, all these subjects are completely neutral. So we’ve done it. It’s our culture or society which has somehow gone: ‘this is a boy’s subject’ or ‘that’s not really for me’. That’s just silly, if we put people off in that way.” As the parent of a girl and a boy, and a scrupulous practitioner of the scientific method, Roberts is well placed to observe stereotypes in childhood and their effects. One of the Horizon programmes she presented, with Dr Michael Mosley in 2014, was called Is Your Brain Male or Female? To which the answer, she laughs, “is obviously no!” In it, she replicated larger scale experiments, some of which showed that “parents are pushing boys more, or encouraging them to take more risks, while saying to girls, ‘No, you might not be able to do this’”. She remembers, on another occasion, being “angry on Twitter”, alongside the physicist Helen Czerski, about “some weird article where somebody had suggested that girls might be more interested in maths if you used more examples of shopping and cooking. She was frustrated when some comments she made about the segregation along gender lines of children’s toys were misrepresented as her blaming Lego for the lack of women in science. As a scientist she would never state a position with such a lack of nuance, and she often stops and asks herself if what she’s just said is scientifically accurate. But yes, she says, she does find it “frustrating” when toys and clothes aimed at children are limiting their ambitions. In person and in her writing, Roberts does not shy away from tackling controversial topics. Her Twitter profile says: “All views my own &amp; I assert my right to share them”, but in her book she tries hard to stick to evidence, not views. She investigates GM food, intensive farming and climate change, for instance, explaining the history of the scientific techniques involved and investigating the public’s suspicion of them. Difficult decisions have to be made, she writes – not by scientists in labs and politicians in chambers, but in conjunction with farmers and consumers all over the world. “What I’ve tried to say in the book is: ‘I don’t think I’ve got all the answers to this and I think it’s something that needs to be worked out in dialogue.’ It can’t be one person saying: ‘I know the way to do this.’ It’s about communication and people understanding enough so they can be involved in that decision-making process. So, what I’ve tried to do is present the evidence.” If that makes the book sound dry or didactic, it is not. Each chapter explains the evolution of a particular species, using evidence from the fossil record and neat summaries of mind-boggling cutting-edge technology. Roberts is clearly thrilled by the revelations that new techniques can offer. (At one point in our interview, she switches mid-sentence from talking about mitochondrial DNA in apples to telling me how early humans “interbred with all these other species in a completely randy way – wherever we’ve gone we’ve just basically shagged everything that was shaggable, it’s amazing”.) But she also thinks empathetically as well. Humans ate rice because it was high in energy and drought-resistant, the evidence shows. But people ate rice because they were cold, it was tasty and they’d had a long, hard day chasing wild boar around ancient China. Scientists believe that wolves were domesticated to help with the hunt and protect the camp, but Roberts suspects that the age-old love affair between children and puppies had something to do with it, too. She scoffs at the idea that humans set out to forge our own destiny as part of some grand strategy, and speculates that thrill-seeking teenagers were the first to dare each other to jump on a wild horse and ride it. “Not the head of the tribe going: ‘Right everybody, what I’ve decided to do is, those big creatures over there, we’re going to get them.’” Roberts has just finished filming another series of Digging for Britain (which will be broadcast by BBC4 in December), and credits archaeology – “being able to actually touch objects that people interacted with hundreds of thousands of years ago” – with helping her to imagine what those other lives were like. She also thinks that her medical training enabled her to eliminate the imaginary disconnect between science and emotion. Anatomy training has to teach doctors to objectify the human body to the point where they can stick a knife in it, she points out. “But then you have to come full circle, so that you’re not thinking you’re interacting with a gall bladder. You’re not, you’re interacting with an entire person, with all their emotions and concerns and worries.” Her books seem to achieve a similar process. “I don’t know if in science we try to avoid that: we think if we get emotive, we become less objective. But I think you can strip the emotion and the subjectivity away while you focus on doing the science – and that’s really important. The scientific method is about trying to remove our own bias and subjectivity, and be as objective as possible. But then you can put it back into context and you’re allowed to be emotional and human about the way you engage with it.” The result is a book that is passionate about the subject while being critically dispassionate about the research. In global politics recently, the losers have begun to realise that while they may have had the facts, the winning side was the one that told the most convincing stories. Perhaps scientists ought to do the same if the public is to understand complicated subjects such as GM crops, vaccination and climate change. The role of the talented science communicator is more important than ever, and Professor Roberts seems just the woman for the job."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2017/oct/23/syria-shocking-images-of-starving-baby-reveal-impact-of-food-crisis","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-23T17:12:36Z","webTitle":"Syria: shocking images of starving baby reveal impact of food crisis","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/23/syria-shocking-images-of-starving-baby-reveal-impact-of-food-crisis","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/oct/23/syria-shocking-images-of-starving-baby-reveal-impact-of-food-crisis","fields":{"headline":"Syria: shocking images of starving baby reveal impact of food crisis","bodyText":"The continuing suffering of civilians living under siege in Syria has been brought into sharp focus by new images of a malnourished baby who later died of starvation in a suburb of Damascus controlled by the opposition. The images, released on Monday by the news agency AFP, show Sahar Dofdaa, a one-month-old baby weighing less than 2kg, with sunken eyes and her ribs protruding through translucent skin. The child was being treated for malnutrition by a doctor in the town of Hamouria, in the eastern Ghouta region. She died on Sunday. “The supplies are very low, and if it continues more kids will die,” said one aid official, who requested anonymity. Tens of thousands of civilians in Ghouta are living under a blockade imposed by forces loyal to the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad. About 3.5 million people in Syria live in besieged or hard-to-reach areas, and the majority of those are in places militarily encircled by the Assad regime. Infighting by local rebel forces and the hoarding of food supplies by merchants have worsened an already dire crisis. Doctors and activists say food shortages are so severe that dozens of cases of malnutrition are being seen in local clinics and field hospitals. New mothers are unable to breastfeed their children because they themselves are undernourished, and products such as baby milk are almost non-existent. Mohamad Katoub, a doctor and official at the Syrian American Medical Society, which helps to run several hospitals in Ghouta, said there were currently 68 cases of severe malnutrition in hospitals in the region. The actual number was probably higher owing to difficulties in gathering data from all medical facilities in the war-torn area. He said deaths among these patients were usually a result of malnutrition weakening their immune systems, which then failed to ward off infections. Yahya Abu Yahya, a doctor in the region, told AFP that out of 9,700 children examined in recent months, 80 were suffering from the most severe form of malnutrition, 200 had moderate acute malnutrition and 4,000 had nutritional deficiencies. Sahar, the baby in the photographs, was unable to breastfeed because her mother did not have enough food to produce milk, AFP said. “Today eastern Ghouta is suffering from the worst kind of criminality,” said the activist Raed Srewel. “Thousands of children are in danger, and if there is no international movement or a UN initiative to resolve this, the consequences will be extremely dangerous and Ghouta will become a humanitarian catastrophe.” Eastern Ghouta is one of several “de-escalation” zones created under a deal brokered by Russia and Turkey to reduce the violence in Syria. But the government has continued to impose a siege on the area, giving rise to mounting concerns over the suffering of civilians. Aid officials say families have been forced to sell food supplements to buy more essential staples like sugar or bread, leading to cases of acute malnutrition. A kilogram of sugar now costs the equivalent of $15 (£11), one official said – a price far beyond the reach of civilians who have been living for years under brutal conditions. The government has limited the aid provided to those areas by international organisations and the UN, and recent bouts of infighting between rebels have made it more difficult to send aid. The shortage has given rise to a local black market controlled by unscrupulous merchants, which has worsened civilian suffering and made basic staples prohibitively expensive. Most families subsist on bread made of barley, olives and boiled plants. The siege of eastern Ghouta had long been porous, with smugglers evading or bribing the local fighters manning checkpoints. But an offensive this year that broke the rebels in many towns in rural Damascus allowed the government to tighten the blockade significantly. Violence continues in other parts of Syria, with Islamic State militants reportedly killing more than 80 people in the past two days over accusations that they collaborated with the Syrian government to undermine the terror group. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a war monitoring organisation, said 83 people were killed by Isis in the town of Qaryatain in Homs province. The town fell to Isis in 2015 when militants conquered the nearby historic city of Palmyra; Isis reportedly destroyed a monastery and imprisoned many of Qaryatain’s Christian inhabitants. The town was later reclaimed by the government with the backing of Russian forces, but Isis recently launched a counter-offensive. The group is in retreat across Syria after losing its de facto capital, Raqqa, last week in a campaign by Kurdish forces backed by a US-led international coalition."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/oct/24/qa-marriage-debate-no-campaigner-struggles-to-explain-concern-for-children","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-23T20:15:26Z","webTitle":"Q&A marriage debate: no campaigner struggles to explain concern for children","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/oct/24/qa-marriage-debate-no-campaigner-struggles-to-explain-concern-for-children","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/oct/24/qa-marriage-debate-no-campaigner-struggles-to-explain-concern-for-children","fields":{"headline":"Q&A marriage debate: no campaigner struggles to explain concern for children","bodyText":"A leading no campaigner has struggled to articulate her concerns about the impact of same-sex marriage on children, repeatedly saying on Q&amp;A that she had no problems with parenting by gay and lesbian couples. Karina Okotel, a legal aid lawyer and federal vice-president of the Liberal party, told a questioner in the ABC talk show audience she readily accepted his point that “what matters is the love and support” families gave their children “not the form that comes in”. But Okotel met with quizzical responses from host Tony Jones and co-panelist Magda Szubanski as she tried to draw a distinction between the outcomes of same-sex parenting and issues with children “not knowing their biological parents” if marriage equality is legalised. Szubanski, the comedian and marriage equality supporter, eventually pressed Okotel on why the rights of children of same-sex couples would be different from those of heterosexual parents who also used “artificial reproductive technology”. Okotel deflected by saying that was a separate debate for “another night altogether”. Okotel’s audience questioner said he was raised in “two families” after his parents separated in his youth, one with “two mums” and another with a mother and father. “Both my families are loving ones,” he said. “From my position experiencing both types of families I can see that what matters is the love and support I receive from both of them, not the form that comes in. Why can’t you accept that?” Okotel said that he had “misunderstood me perhaps” and that “I really applaud that your families are working well and you’re in a loving family”. “So we’re not in disagreement there. Where we are, I suppose, in disagreement is the question of marriage, and that’s a different issue altogether.” Jones interrupted to ask if Okotel was “perfectly happy for children to be brought up with same-sex parents”. “I don’t see why not,” she said. Szubanski prodded Okotel on concerns she had previously raised about the consequences for “vulnerable children” from same-sex marriage. Okotel said this issue was “very different to parenting and being raised by same-sex parents, absolutely”. “I don’t understand it,” Szubanski said. Okotel said there were good and bad parents among both heterosexual and same-sex couples. “But if we are introducing a new institution where same-sex people can get married, marriage is for founding a family, having a family,” she said. “What that means is therefore there would be rights for same-sex people to have children and the only way to do that is through the use of assisted reproductive technology. “That raises issues in terms of not knowing your biological parent.” Okotel later said the idea that “gay people might harm children [as parents] has never entered into my consciousness”. She then faltered momentarily as Jones probed for her precise objection to same sex marriage where it concerned children. Okotel: “I don’t have any issue with gay people parenting.” Jones: “Only if they’re married?” Okotel: “No. I don’t think that homosexual people should be married because when you …” Jones: “Is the problem with them bringing up children only when they’re married?” Okotel: “I don’t understand.” Jones: “Is it a problem of them bringing up children when they’re married?” Okotel: “Sorry, I don’t understand your question.” Jones: “There’s no problem with people getting married if they’re gay and bringing up children as far as you’re concerned?” Okotel: “I suppose why I don’t understand your question is people bring up children all the time who are not married, whether they be straight or married. “I don’t have an issue with people parenting in a relationship or unmarried relationship, straight or whatever, as long as they’re good parents.” Szubanski returned to the issue, saying she was “a bit perplexed” by Okotel’s “concern about children not knowing their biological parents”. She asked if this applied to “straight people or just gay people”. Okotel said it applied “to everyone”. “Article seven and eight of the UN convention of the rights of the child does say that children do have a right to know their biological parents and to be raised by them and to know their genetic identity,” she said. Szubanski said all children “do have that right” regardless. “Would you be pushing for legislation to stop both gay and straight people from [denying this], is that what you would be doing?” she said. Okotel said this was not “what we’re debating” and that she had not “turned my mind to changing the legislation to do with artificial reproductive technology”. “[That’s for] another night altogether.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"}]}}
