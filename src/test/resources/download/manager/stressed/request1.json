I’ve never been a Harry Potter fan myself – I was already out of kids’ books when they first came out, and those clever grown-up covers weren’t enough to tempt me back – but I’d always admired JK Rowling from afar. Who wouldn’t? A writer whose imagination transfixed the world, whose riches now exceed those of the Queen, but who has founded a children’s charity, pays her taxes in full, and remains both poised and politically engaged: as role models go, it is hard to think of a better one. So I was pleased when my seven-year-old son went Harry Potter crazy. Having never read to himself before, he was suddenly racing through book after book, his bedside light on late into the night. His brother and several of his friends caught the bug – just as the Suez canal flowed through Clarissa Eden’s drawing room, Hogwarts overshadowed our house, as children constantly dashed about on broomsticks, casting spells and looking for snitches. It was impressive to see the “Harry Potter effect” in action: the magical power that, in the two decades since its first publication, has revitalised the children’s publishing industry, encouraged millions of children to read, sold more than 400m copies across the world, and generated a cultural empire worth £20bn. Less pleasant, however, was the realisation that there was a marketing juggernaut poised to capitalise on my son’s enthusiasm. Unlike those first readers 20 years ago, the children discovering Harry Potter now are immediately faced with a multibillion-pound industry trading in Potter-themed “experiences” and paraphernalia. The prices of this stuff are hardly child-sized: £35 for a plastic wand – and £10.50 for a three-pack of Bertie Bott’s Every-Flavour Beans; £4.50 for a chocolate frog. In the gift shop at the British Library’s excellent exhibition, Harry Potter: A History of Magic, I watched my son deliberate anxiously about whether to spend nine weeks’ pocket money on a small piece of chocolate, and couldn’t avoid feeling that he was being fleeced by the Harry Potter industry. Rowling’s approach to commerce appears to have shifted in recent years. In the early days, the marketing around Harry Potter relied upon scarcity. Total secrecy surrounded the books before publication, and Rowling insisted that Warner Bros, which bought the merchandising rights in 1998, issued relatively few licences to manufacturers, especially compared with other franchises. She refused profitable partnerships such as tie-ins with fast-food chains. The idea, according to the Economist, was to play the long game, and avoid over-saturating the market. More recently, however, it has become clear that the thirst for Potter-related products is nigh on unquenchable. A professor at the London School of Economics has estimated that when you include the income generated by tourism to Harry Potter-related attractions, the boy wizard is worth £4bn to the UK economy – no small deal in a country with an increasingly uncertain economic future. It was recently reported that 10 wands are sold on eBay every minute, and three Harry Potter costumes every hour. There are now four Wizarding World of Harry Potter theme parks (two in Florida, one in Hollywood and one in Osaka, Japan). The Warner Bros studio tour The Making of Harry Potter has attracted more than 8 million visitors since it opened outside London in March 2012, and official themed shops have opened in King’s Cross railway station and Heathrow airport (“Harry Potter is a quintessentially British brand”), with smaller independent tribute shops around the country. When a Harry Potter-themed wand shop opened in Brighton recently there were queues around the block; there have been similar scenes in Edinburgh and elsewhere. “My feeling is that Rowling, who once vowed to resist the commercialisation of her creation, has decided to ‘give the customers what they want’,” says Stephen Brown, a marketing expert at the University of Ulster who has studied the Harry Potter phenomenon. “You can hardly blame her. If she didn’t, all sorts of fakes and counterfeits and so on would crawl out of the woodwork.” This may be true, but I still can’t help feeling sorry for the young readers whose experience of Harry will be forever shaped by these commercial forces. One can only hope that they pay close attention to the books themselves, in which Rowling satirises marketing mumbo-jumbo (even as she creates brands such as Bertie Bott’s and the Nimbus broomsticks). The books are careful to show us that what we want may not be, in fact, what we need. In The Philosopher’s Stone, the Mirror of Erised reflects each viewer’s deepest desires, but as Dumbledore observes, “This mirror will give us neither knowledge nor truth. Men have wasted away before it, entranced by what they have seen, or been driven mad, not knowing if what it shows is real or even possible.” • Alice O’Keeffe is a freelance literary critic and journalist and former deputy editor of the Guardian’s Saturday Review section"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/dec/13/oumuamua-interstellar-body-sent-by-aliens-notes-queries","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-13T11:30:01Z","webTitle":"What if the interstellar body Oumuamua really was sent by aliens? | Notes and queries","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/dec/13/oumuamua-interstellar-body-sent-by-aliens-notes-queries","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/dec/13/oumuamua-interstellar-body-sent-by-aliens-notes-queries","fields":{"headline":"What if the interstellar body Oumuamua really was sent by aliens?","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"OK, so a mysterious, cigar-shaped, 400m-long object is speeding through the solar system and astronomers are checking it for evidence of alien technology.

Wage-earning women are also entitled to a maternity leave of 16 weeks, with compensation ranging from €9,29 ($10.94) to €84,90 ($100) per day (according to how much they made before taking leave). As for pregnancy and the weeks around childbirth, finances are no more a problem than outside this period: precarious households are still struggling, but not more than before, and well-off households remain well off. If we look at how supported a mother is, however – well, nothing is planned to help the young mother. Paternity leave lasts only 11 days, which is not even enough for mothers to recover from childbirth. Young mothers must therefore manage the daily, non-stop demands of their new life while they try and heal. They must also seek childcare, knowing that programs proposed by the state are not sufficient, especially in the Paris region. The cost of child care varies greatly. In daycare centers, the less well-off households can get by for €1,000 ($1,177.59) per year – but there is only one place for every eight children. Households therefore use private services such as childminders or home care. For couples in the most precarious positions, childcare is so expensive compared with income that in 90% of cases a parent (usually the mother) stops working. In the US, meanwhile, things are even worse. The average out-of-pocket cost of giving birth in a hospital was an eye-watering $3,400, according to a New York Times piece from 2013, which reported that the United States is the most expensive country in the world in which to give birth. Costs vary widely in the US based on insurance type, state, and hospital. For those who do not qualify for Medicaid but cannot afford insurance, the average cost of pre-natal care can be in the thousands. The US is the only developed country in the world without a federally mandated paid medical leave. As of 2017, there are just three states in the union that have programs requiring companies to provide paid maternity leave: California, New Jersey, and Rhode Island. As for childcare – forget about it if you’re not well off. The average cost of full-time care in childcare centers for all children ages 0-4 in the United States is $9,589 a year, higher than the average cost of in-state college tuition ($9,410), according to a recent study from New America. Nationally, the cost of full-time care in childcare centers is 85% of the monthly US median cost of rent."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"artanddesign/2018/jan/02/best-architecture-design-of-2018-windermere-vanda","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-02T15:00:19Z","webTitle":"Wet docks, giant ducks and the zero-waste city: the best architecture and design of 2018","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/jan/02/best-architecture-design-of-2018-windermere-vanda","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2018/jan/02/best-architecture-design-of-2018-windermere-vanda","fields":{"headline":"Wet docks, giant ducks and the zero-waste city: the best architecture and design of 2018","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"New Kettle’s Yard, Cambridge, by Jamie Fobert Not an art gallery, but a home for “stray objects, stones, glass, pictures, sculpture, in light and in space,” is how former Tate curator Jim Ede described Kettle’s Yard, the Cambridge house where he arranged his stunning collection of 20th-century art alongside found objects, later donated to the university.

The medical student was attempting, for the very first time, the rudiments of performing an abortion. As she inexpertly brought the pincers together on the soft flesh, you might have expected a little yelp of pain from the patient. There was silence. Not because the “patient” was brave, but because it was a papaya. Mangold was at a special workshop organized by a not-for-profit group whose mission is to make up for the lack of instruction on contraception and abortion at many US medical programs. But it doubled as a lesson in using a no-frills kit of basic instruments that, in the event of the practice becoming illegal in the US, could be stashed and carried discreetly, to perform covert abortions safely. And it so happens that the papaya, with its little fruity neck and a central cavity full of seeds and pulp, is a serviceable approximation of a woman’s cervix and womb for the purposes of basic initiation for a medic in training. Mangold was in a roomful of 60 rookies from across the country. They juggled fruit and tools as they began their journey, come what may, to become the next generation of abortion providers – an increasingly scarce species in some parts of the US. They paired up. One held a papaya, the other fumbled with a plastic speculum and small manual vacuum pump, all fingers and thumbs. Mangold had traveled to Philadelphia from Lubbock, where she’s a third year student at Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center and aspires to become an obstetrician/gynecologist (OB-GYN). “It’s already a five-hour drive to the nearest abortion clinic from Lubbock,” she said. “The community is very anti-choice. When it comes to abortion, there’s no education at my school. You have to seek it out and that’s a travesty,” she said. Mangold belongs to Medical Students For Choice (MSFC), a US not-for-profit organization with members at medical schools in several countries who aren’t getting family planning and abortion education because of conservative mores or laws. Medical students don’t specialize until later in their careers and could learn about it then, but the MSFC executive director, Lois Backus, said many schools left abortion out of the curriculum entirely “but erectile dysfunction medication is in there every time”. Oyebola Oyewole’s brow furrowed in concentration as she tried to insert a vacuum aspirator into the papaya. The 24-year-old, a student at Morehouse School of Medicine, in Atlanta, said it felt strangely intuitive in relation to female reproductive organs. “I can visualize it even though it’s just a fruit,” she said. “I’m hoping to become a pediatrician but I want to be able to provide this service if a teen needed it and can’t get it anywhere else.” How would she feel about performing an illegal abortion? “If necessary I would risk going to prison or losing my license. No one should have to do a self-induced abortion,” she said. Marta Rowh had flown in from Bend, Oregon, to help teach two “papaya workshops” as part of an MSFC conference that had drawn 450 med students from the US and Canada. She’s the only abortion provider for two-thirds of her state. Before demonstrating the standard manual technique used in the first 10 weeks of pregnancy, she arrayed some mostly disposable tools. “These are designed to be used in a hut in rural Zambia with no electricity if necessary,” she said. There was a plastic speculum to hold open the vagina, a metal tenaculum, or pincers, to grip the cervix, steadying the opening to the uterus, a plastic rod for dilation, and a large, plastic syringe-type device used for the common practice of manual vacuum aspiration (MVA). She squeezed two buttons on the device to seal it, then pulled back the plunger, making a vacuum in the cylinder, then attached a tube from a sterile packet. The students were transfixed. Apart from an encounter with a cadaver, their medical training had been all lecture halls so far. Rowh put the tube inside the papaya and moved it carefully around to simulate dislodging fetal tissue and the related products of pregnancy from the walls of the womb. When she released the buttons on the plastic syringe, it unsealed the vacuum and bright orange fruit flesh and dark seeds automatically shot out of the papaya and were sucked into the cylinder. It was so fast and effective, the onlookers gasped. The whole procedure had taken about three minutes; the time and the consistency of matter collected in the syringe were not dissimilar to what would take place during an actual abortion, Rowh said. In a power cut or need for extreme secrecy, it could be done by the light on a cellphone. “In a post-Roe v Wade world, some of these tools would be harder to get hold of. They would be something you could have in your closet in a small bag that you could pull out and go,” said Rowh. MSFC members in some African countries where abortion is illegal call them “stealth kits” and mainly use them in clinics that fly under the government’s radar. Mariel Cohn, a Philadelphia nursing student, had never used a speculum before and declared the sensation of operating on a papaya “freaky” but added: “I’ve already started a little kit of various medical supplies I might need in the future.” Shariq Khan, 24, one of a handful of men in the room, is a first-year medical student at Washington University in St Louis, Missouri. “Ooh, it’s tricky, doing something different with each hand and trying to look inside the papaya, and feeling for the depth,” he said. Instructor Emily Young, an abortion provider from Charlottesville, Virginia, warned the students not to poke too harshly and risk perforating the uterus. Khan wants to offer family planning “especially in underserved areas”. But he added: “I don’t know if I would still provide abortion if it was illegal, which is maybe in our very near future.” Marley Rashad, a third year at Morehouse, said the practical training had been enjoyable. “It’s a very safe procedure,” she said. Would she risk performing a “back alley” abortion? “I like to think I would. I want to provide a full spectrum of reproductive health for my future patients. But how would I screen people so the right ones get to me? I’d be worried about ‘plants’,” she said. Hours earlier, the US Senate had passed a tax bill with a provision allowing fetuses to get tax breaks on college savings accounts, seen as a further undermining of abortion rights. Backus fears the supreme court could overturn the Roe v Wade decision, which legalized abortion in the US in 1973. Even without that move, hardline conservatives in many states have been so effectively using legislation to restrict abortion in the last decade that “it’s very likely they’ll weaken Roe until it’s close to meaningless anyway”, she said. But actually overturning Roe could result in the closure of clinics and an end to legal channels for obtaining pills used for early-stage “medical” abortions. Young reckons there are “too many smart lawyers defending reproductive justice” for Roe to go. Rowh fears individual states may get the power to decide. Audrey Jaeger, a student attending the workshop from Rocky Vista University of Colorado, said: “You’re not going to get rid of abortion, it’s been around for ever. Things just go backwards to times when everyone knew someone who almost died because they had a dangerous abortion.” Priya Suri is outraged that Republican lawmakers in Wisconsin, where she’s a medical student, are debating legislation prohibiting university faculty from teaching abortion to trainee doctors, despite a shortage of OB-GYNs. “I’m so upset. I chose the program because I would learn about abortion; now that’s in jeopardy. In a post-Roe world, I’d be more on the advocacy side – but I could provide the care myself,” she said. Another instructor, Andrea Chiavarini, said that Barack Obama was the most “pro-life” president in US history. “He did more to prevent abortion than anyone, by making long-term birth control available to so many via the Affordable Care Act,” she said. Chiavarini flies regularly from home in Portland, Oregon, to perform abortions in Oklahoma and at the Kansas clinic where George Tiller worked before his 2009 murder. Far from a somber tone at the workshop, there was levity and laughter amid the earnest learning. Chiavarini said: “When I do abortions there are patients who need hand-holding and they’re crying. Other patients, we’re blasting Aretha Franklin and joking around; that’s something people are afraid to talk about. Sometimes people feel like they are ending their baby’s life, and that’s what I’m doing because that’s what they need to do, and I’m going to call it their baby. I use the term the patient uses. Sometimes I refer to what I’m removing from a woman’s uterus as the pregnancy, the embryo or the fetus – I never just say tissue.” The students chattered away as exhausted papayas piled up in the garbage. “There’s no point in adopting fake reverence,” said Chiavarini. “In medicine there’s a tendency to dark humor. It’s intense, so you have to joke about it sometimes.” What she’s serious about is the continued need for tools and training. She waved a hand at the tubes and vacuum devices scattered about, and the students scooting out for coffee. “These are life savers,” she said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/blog/2017/dec/11/atletico-get-back-to-what-they-know-and-make-la-liga-a-four-horse-race","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-11T15:59:13Z","webTitle":"Atlético get back to what they know and make La Liga a four-horse race | Sid Lowe","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2017/dec/11/atletico-get-back-to-what-they-know-and-make-la-liga-a-four-horse-race","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/blog/2017/dec/11/atletico-get-back-to-what-they-know-and-make-la-liga-a-four-horse-race","fields":{"headline":"Atlético get back to what they know and make La Liga a four-horse race","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Quique Setién says he has told Atlético Madrid’s manager Diego Simeone exactly what he thinks of him but Simeone hasn’t told him back. He can guess, though: it doesn’t take a genius. “He might not like what I do, but he has the decency not to say so,” admits the chess-playing, beach football international, former manager of Equatorial Guinea (for one night only) and defender of an aesthetic footballing faith who briefly made Las Palmas the best thing in the league and is now at Real Betis, if maybe not for much longer. “He might go: ‘Bloody hell, this bring-the-ball-out thing, I shit on its mother!’ He’s good enough not to say that, but I’m sure he thinks it.” So is everyone else, and more than before. Because if Simeone never told Setién, on Sunday afternoon he showed him. Really, really showed him. It was easy to imagine him barely suppressing a smirk, winking his way back to the dressing room at the Benito Villamarín and breaking into a giggle as soon as he got through the door, points won and point made. At the same time as he arrived, midfielder Koke stood pitchside. Talking to the telly, Koke’s opening line couldn’t have been clearer: “Betis were spectacular,” he said. “They played very well, they play very nice football.” Antonio Adán, Betis’s goalkeeper, agreed: “The football we played was incredible,” he insisted, “our opponents were truly dominated.” The problem was, a ‘but’ hung in the air and it was a big one. Dominated? Perhaps, but still not defeated. Betis had more shots, more chances, and more of the ball. Much, much more; 74%, in fact. Atlético, who had never had less possession, completed just over 150 passes, Betis over 600. “Atletico were a mere spectator,” said AS. But Atlético were also the victor, Saúl Níguez scoring the only goal. “Betis bring the football, Atlético take the result,” AS added. “Setién’s team plays well, Simeone’s wins,” agreed Marca. And far from feel offended, Atlético felt a tingle of pride. They’d done it again and the way they did it posed the question: could they do it again? As for Betis, much as Setién said the performance “strengthened” them, much as he insisted he’ll “never change”, and much as they’re still six points and seven places above the relegation zone, they’ve been knocked out of the cup, this was their sixth consecutive game without a win, and he’s under pressure, his philosophy now held against him. Simeone’s philosophy meanwhile, questioned at times, now reinforces him. That all seemed to crystallise on Sunday. Betis versus Atlético, Setién versus Simeone, was always set up to be a clash of styles. Few clubs, few managers, are as clear in how they play; few are as far apart, either. Which was why ultimately perhaps there was something predictable about the way it played out. At the end of the match, the Betis defender Aissa Mandi insisted: “It sounds strange to say this but this might have been our best game this season.” He was wrong: maybe not about it being their best performance – although they won at the Bernabéu, beat Levante 4-0 and drew 4-4 at Real Sociedad – but about it sounding strange. It actually sounded pretty standard … only more so. This match was almost like a caricature and, like any caricature, it was exaggerated but there was also something in it. “Betis were as pretty as they are ineffective,” El País insisted. “Atletico were a rock,” Zouhair Feddal said, and although they are more than that, not just the defensive team they’re sometimes accused of being, he was right. Simeone admitted Betis were “far superior”, but he was only talking about the opening 20 minutes and he was probably also right to limit it to that. To begin with, Atlético struggled a little and again they needed a sharp save from Jan Oblak, but by the end they had won again and as the game went on they were rarely exposed. Simeone has faced Setién four times now and beaten him in each of them, never conceding. This time was, as Marca put it, “particularly bitter medicine” for Setién to take and AS was saying much the same: “You don’t like Simeone? Here, take two spoons of Simeone,” it wrote. You could imagine ‘El Cholo’ feeling especially satisfied, vindication served through victory. Atlético started with four central midfielders and finished with six defenders; they also finished with a win. “Setién couldn’t have knocked down that wall with a nuclear bomb,” ran one report. None of which would matter that much if it wasn’t for the fact that this felt like something of a threshold. It was as if, much as this has been coming for weeks, there was suddenly some sort of recognition, an awareness of where Atlético are and who they are. Maybe it’s the exaggeratedly Atlético way it happened, their identity enhanced, or the fact victory meant they’re still the only unbeaten team in La Liga apart from Barcelona. More likely, it’s because this was the 19th league game in a row that they had avoided defeat – a new club record. The last team to defeat them were Villarreal, in April, and the last team to beat them away were also Villarreal, four months before. In other words, Atlético have not been beaten on the road in an entire season’s worth of trips. Atlético’s season so far has been conditioned by two matches in which they could not fight their way past Qarabag. It is not just those games in which they have failed to get good results and struggled to score – they were beaten by Chelsea and the 0-0 draw in Rome hurt, while in the league they have drawn almost half of their games, while four of their eight wins have been 1-0 – but those two startlingly bad results knocked them out of the Champions League by someone other than Real Madrid for the first time in five years and coloured the way their campaign has been judged. The derby against Real Madrid highlighted the lack of creativity, as well as Antoine Griezmann’s isolation, seemingly to underline why they might cede too many points to truly challenge for the title. With Europe slipping from their fingers too, the frustration was shown by the flat response to the final whistle when once upon a time holding Madrid – better still, damaging them – might have drawn a huge roar. Afterwards, Simeone hinted at his irritation and a suspicion that all was not well when he came into the press room and shouted – literally shouted – that work had to come first, talent second. He also ostensibly defended Griezmann but had actually hung him out to dry. Meanwhile, one Atlético player privately admitted they needed someone to deliver a few home truths, that they’d been given too easy a ride. Upsetting the odds meant continuing to fight, not accepting they’re stacked against you. That night, it felt over. A new home that didn’t yet feel like a home probably contributed too. And yet … and yet Atlético were still unbeaten and they were still Atlético. Not winning, sure, but not losing either. Their identity remained clear, even if it is not as clear-cut as is often assumed: for each of the last two seasons a tentative evolution had given way to a moment in which they sought to get back to what they know, like a tacit recognition it was not really them; this season, even as they began a transition, a generational shift, it didn’t change much. The new Atletico looked like the old one, for good and bad. For a moment there, some would say: for bad. There are certainly limitations, some which they may pay for and, you might argue, have paid for in the past. But just three weeks and three wins on things feel different now. Barcelona dropped points twice in a row, which helps. Griezmann has been accompanied, not just left up front alone, which also helps. And then there are the games, all offering differing ingredients: a 5-0 win at Levante; a late, dramatic victory against Real Sociedad, the first big night at the Wanda; and now this, taken by some as the purest expression of “Cholismo”, that philosophy of football and life according to Simeone. Almost as if it was that good precisely because it wasn’t that good. Few have made a virtue of suffering like them, as if they’re not suffering at all. “This is our line and we have to walk it,” Simeone said. On the weekend in which Sevilla got torn apart by Real Madrid, the runners appeared defined. Madrid, the team for whom Zidane said the ball just doesn’t want to go in, scored five, one for each of Cristiano Ronaldo’s Golden Balls; Valencia recovered from defeat in Getafe to beat Celta Vigo, but only just; and Barcelona struggled but eventually claimed a 2-0 win at Villarreal that El Mundo Deportivo said was the kind that decides a title. This was the week in which, while Barcelona still have a lead, everyone else won too and it felt like all of them will compete for the title. And in which it felt like, Atlético are among them. There is no Champions League distraction now – although the demands made by the Europa League, while different, may be as significant – and here they are. Barcelona have a six-point lead but the sensations don’t always match the stats; Valencia stand a point above them; Madrid are two behind. “If it’s an 85-point league, Atlético can win it,” insisted former striker Kiko Narvaez. After all, coming up to Christmas, they’re still there. And coming out of it, Diego Costa will be there too. New Atlético, same old Atlético. Successful old Atlético? Competitors, anyway. “What Simeone has achieved is the ‘milk’, the business. I wouldn’t even dream of being able to reach the level he has reached six years in a row,” Setién said before his side were beaten by Atlético, leaving Betis still seeking a win and him under pressure, proud of his approach if not the results. “I said I don’t like his football but you can’t imagine how much I admire him. If he played like I do, he wouldn’t compete with Madrid and Barcelona.” Talking points • At each end of the Coliseum there was a huge Japan flag. Written on it was the slogan “Hello Japan”, which was periodically flashed up on the advertising board too, visible on prime-time TV out east. Before the game, there was an honorary kick-off, performed by skater Javier Fernández. He was flanked by Eibar’s Inui and Getafe’s Gaku, La Liga’s two Japanese players. Gaku wasn’t actually starting the game, so he had his Getafe shirt pulled over his tracksuit, before taking his place on the bench. For the first time, two Japanese players were set to face each other, and the league had decided to go big. Posters were done, Japanese animation-style, the two players turned all Oliver and Benji, and the match was moved to one o’clock in Getafe; the perfect time in Tokyo. It was an opportunity to get them on board, breaking into a market dominated by the Premier League, but it wasn’t exactly a rip-roaring success. “You’d have to ask my president; it’s nothing to do with me,” José Bordalás said afterwards. “I saw that there was some stuff before the game, that’s all.” As it turned out there wasn’t much stuff during the game. Gaku and Inui didn’t meet on the pitch – by the time the former came on, the latter had gone off – and Bordalás admitted it “wasn’t a brilliant game”, while José Luis Mendilibar said: “For the viewers, it wasn’t a nice game to watch.” Which was one way of putting it. The advertising boards also carried a slogan saying: “It’s not football … it’s La Liga.” As it turned out, they were right. There was a superb save at the start, a superb save at the end, and a dreadful penalty, booted over. And that was about it. “If I’d been watching at home, I would have turned off,” said Eibar captain Dani García. • “Unstoppable” cheered Sport. For much of their trip to the Madrigal, Barcelona had struggled but then two things happened: Raba went through Sergio Busquets and was sent off and Paco Alcácer came on, and it was a different game. Suddenly there was space, dynamism, and chances. Messi and Alba – 14 passes one way, 15 the other – played and played, the pitch tilted left. A moment’s acceleration made the opener, and it was brilliant: Messi, Suárez, Alcacer, ping-ping-ping, and Suárez stepped superbly round Sergio Asenjo (welcome back!) to score. Then Messi, gifted the ball from a goal-kick, burst through two defenders to get the second. Villarreal were furious about the red card – if it had been the other way around it would have been yellow Javier Calleja said, although he almost admitted that he hadn’t yet seen the replay – while Barcelona were delighted. “After two draws we needed to win,” said Ernesto Valverde. • “Next time we’ll ask of we can play in our third kit so that he doesn’t know it’s Celta,” Iago Aspas said after his side were defeated 2-1 at Mestalla by Valencia. “I don’t like to say so, but something always happens with this referee: he seems to have something against us.” Aspas was furious, head still spinning, sweating on the touchline immediately post-game as he talked. Considering all that, he actually controlled himself reasonably well. Celta manager Juan Carlos Unzué admitted the players had “feared the worst” before the game and Munuera Montero was the referee who they had previously accused of lying in a match report. “Every time he is in charge they take points off us,” Hugo Mallo said later, the message calmer now but still the same. • No Ramos, no Bale, no Casemiro, no Carvajal, no Isco, no problem. Madrid went to 4-4-2, sped up and raced through the Sevilla “defence”, over and over again. It was 1-0 after two minutes and 5-0 by half-time, Asensio leading and Nacho, Ronaldo (two), Kroos and Achraf scoring. “I didn’t really know what to do,” the Moroccan admitted. He was talking about the celebration – he knew perfectly well what to do with the finish, taking his chance very nicely, just as Ronaldo and Kroos would do. • Still, that was rubbish compared to Dioni Villalba. The Fuenlabrada striker scored five all of his own as they defeated Coruxo 7-0 the following morning. • Pitu Abelardo turned up in Vitoria, saw the snow and took his players off to Catalonia. It worked, too. They won in Girona on Monday and beat Las Palmas on Friday. Five days into his spell as Alavés manager they already have two wins – as many as in the previous 13 weeks. Not that it was as decisive as they would have liked: Deportivo and Málaga also both won. “Depor come up for air,” ran the headline in Marca. And AS, in fact. As for Málaga, this was their first away win since April. They hadn’t even picked up a point since they went to Granada in May. The good news is that Levante, beaten by Athletic and pretty bad too, look increasingly likely to be dragged into trouble. • At Anoeta, there were banners in honour of Aitor Zabaleta, the Real Sociedad fan murdered by Atlético supporters. It happened 19 years ago and, like the murder of Jimmy Romero, the Depor fan in three years ago, near the Calderón, there is still no sign of justice. Results: Alavés 2–0 Las Palmas, Getafe 0–0 Eibar, Madrid 5–0 Sevilla, Deportivo 1–0 Leganés, Valencia 2–1 Celta, Real Sociedad 0–2 Málaga, Betis 0–1 Atlético, Levante 1–2 Athletic, Villarreal 0–2 Barcelona.

Roughly the length of War and Peace, The House of Government aims to capture the rise and fall of Bolshevism through a building and its residents, via a study in eschatology – the creation of an apocalyptic cult, its unexpected success, and its equally unexpected failure. It is a dizzying book, a hall of mirrors, panoramic and bizarre, as puzzlingly esoteric and thrillingly fervent as the doctrines it describes. Whether it succeeds in what it tries to do – essentially, to write a totally new history of the Russian revolution, cast in the mould of a teeming historical novel – is questionable. That there is nothing else like it is indisputable. We should begin where the author does not, with the building. Slezkine is best known to non-specialists for The Jewish Century, a lively revisionist history that placed the Soviet Union at the heart of 20th-century Jewish experience, but in the academy he might be better known for his essay The USSR as a Communal Apartment, a pivotal study of Soviet multinationalism through the spatial/architectural metaphor of a crowded, thinly subdivided “kommunalka” flat. The House of Government was another, larger block of flats, completed in 1931, “a place where revolutionaries came home and the revolution came to die”. It was designed in the late 1920s by the architect Boris Iofan for the Soviet elite. Its tenants were decimated in the Great Purge, leading to the later nickname “the House of Preliminary Detention”. That’s as simple as The House of Government gets. Perhaps more important is Slezkine’s central view of Bolshevism as a millenarian cult, a notion that was a mainstay of the cold war. His idea of what Marxism is or was is comically inadequate, based on Marx’s early work on Hegel and the “Jewish question”, although the book his tenant inhabitants are always reading, or rather failing to read, is Das Kapital. The Bolsheviks here are not contemporaries of, say, Rosa Luxemburg or James Maxton, but successors to the Anabaptists of the 16th century, who “banned all books except the Bible, destroyed altars and sculptures, renamed streets and days of the week (and named their city the New Jerusalem), banned monogamy and private property, rationed food and clothing, enforced communal dining”. What makes Slezkine’s version of this hoary idea interesting is a lack of moralism, and a mindboggling sweeping perspective that aligns Bolshevism with Christianity, Islam and “the Commonwealth of Massachusetts”. The House’s site is equally crucial – a low-rise, unplanned area of central Moscow known as “the Swamp”. By 1905, the Swamp had a power station and factories alongside its street markets and muddy, frequently flooded, streets. In that year, “the empire was crawling with prophets, soothsayers and itinerant preachers. Everyone seemed to believe that the world was sick and would not last much longer.” In 1917, the Swamp’s workers were, Slezkine notes, solidly pro-Bolshevik; yet the need to fight against the petit bourgeoisie continued. Their New Jerusalem would be clean, rational, machine-made. Slezkine treats this as pathological, though it seems a fairly uncontroversial response to the realities of Russia in the early 20th century – trying to stop men beating their wives and shitting in the street does not an apocalyptic cult make. But when the central argument becomes tiresome, there are digressions into, to take a random sample, revolutionary nudism, monumental and modernist architecture, Don Quixote and the Spanish civil war, the socialist realist novel, abuse scandals of early 1990s America, Ibsen ... The building itself was a result of Bolshevism’s shift from eager expectation of global revolution into “Augustinian” state-building. As Slezkine rightly notes, in design it was (and is) closer to the Dakota in New York (or Dolphin Square in London) than to the utopian communes of constructivism, with family apartments connected to abundant communal facilities – cinema, club, pool, theatre, restaurant. With the turn of the 1930s, the elite tenants attempted to drain further swamps, with de-kulakisation, collectivisation and the creation of the Gulag. With the Moscow Metro, under the direction of tenant Nikita Khrushchev, they even brought the opulence and glory of the New Jerusalem right down into the bog and clay itself. During the horrific famines they brought to Ukraine and Kazakhstan, the tenants were publicly resolute in persecuting “saboteurs”. In private, however, they desperately tried to convince the real first rank of power – the likes of Stalin, Molotov and Kaganovich, resident in the Kremlin opposite – to send relief. This gap between deed and thought would be remembered, when the Great Purge came in 1937. Here, The House of Government becomes almost unbearably harrowing. one , in starved Kazakhstan, administered by House resident Filipp Goloshchekin, where we glimpse an empty village, out of which runs “some sort of small creature … its long hair had frozen into bloody icicles which stuck out at all angles … its teeth were bared, and its mouth dripped with red foam”. It then disappeared, just as quickly as it emerged. The other is told through the self-abasing letters of the Old Bolshevik Tatiana Miagkova. Thrown into an isolator for oppositionist sympathies, when her husband is arrested too, she writes to her daughter that a concentration camp is not all bad, as “it means working and therefore participating in the life of our country. There is no place for hopelessness in our – very tough – system.” Does Slezkine’s own construction atop the swamp of Soviet history hold steady? Not entirely. One crucial problem is in isolating the House and its tenants from events around them. When Slezkine finds Lenin, in 1918, quoting the then-decades old prediction by Engels that capitalism would produce “a world war of an extent and violence hitherto undreamed of”, he sees a raving cult leader proclaiming a confirmed prophecy, rather than a politician citing a remarkably accurate prediction of the state of Europe in that year. The postwar revolutionary wave of 1918-19, or the rise of fascism and the Great Depression, are treated essentially as figments of the Bolsheviks’ apocalyptic imaginations. The many non-Soviet communists who passed through the House are ignored, as is the Comintern – or communism outside Russia at all. That omission is not accidental. In a throwaway concluding note, Slezkine argues that Bolshevism only endured where it became a national liberation movement, as in China, Cuba and Vietnam – something the cosmopolitan, Latvian, Jewish, Georgian, Ukrainian and Polish inhabitants of the House of Government could never entirely countenance, although the surviving tenants would toy with Russian nationalism in Stalin’s late years. Finally, Slezkine ascribes the USSR’s failure to endure to a refusal to break up the family. “The problem with Bolshevism is that it was not totalitarian enough.” It is a maddening conclusion, perverse and infuriatingly partial, but in the context of The House of Government it makes perfect sense – after being trapped in this labyrinthine, terrifying, fascinating structure for 1,096 pages, the paradoxical becomes logical. • To order The House of Government for £25.46 (RRP £29.95) go to bookshop.theguardian.com or call 0330 333 6846.

The prime minister set out her commitment to dealing with climate change in an article for the Guardian, echoing David Cameron’s 2005 efforts to show the Tories cared about global warming. Ahead of this week’s climate change summit in Paris, May said: “There is a clear moral imperative for developed economies like the UK to help those around the world who stand to lose most from the consequences of manmade climate change.” She described coal as “one of the dirtiest and most destructive ways of generating power” and hailed the “enormous commercial opportunity which the shift to cleaner forms of energy represents”. May’s commitment to the issue of climate change was questioned when she abolished the Department for Energy and Climate Change shortly after taking office last year. Later, her appointee as environment secretary, Andrea Leadsom, had to ask officials whether climate change was real. However, the prime minister insists “tackling climate change and mitigating its effects for the world’s poorest are amongst the most critical challenges the world faces”. At the summit she will announce a £140m boost to funding for poorer communities affected by climate change through deforestation or vulnerability to natural disasters and extreme weather, plus £15m of additional support for reconstruction on Dominica in the Caribbean, which was devastated by Hurricane Maria in September. It comes at a time when Conservative MPs are being asked by party officials to show off their green credentials after internal polling showed the level of concern among younger voters about environmental issues. The party has been alarmed by the backlash against May’s support for a free vote on foxhunting, the omission of a ban on the ivory trade from the manifesto and its lack of support for an amendment that would have recognised in UK law that animals feel pain. They have since backtracked on all three issues. The environment secretary, Michael Gove, will publish a draft bill on Tuesday that explicitly enshrines animal sentience in domestic law. It will also increase the maximum prison sentence in England and Wales for animal cruelty from six months to five years. “Animals are sentient beings who feel pain and suffering, so we are writing that principle into law and ensuring that we protect their welfare,” Gove said. “We are a nation of animal lovers so we will make Brexit work not just for citizens but for the animals we love and cherish too.” Gove is also said to be pressing for more of the UK’s overseas aid budget to be spent on cutting plastic pollution after it emerged that 90% of the waste in the ocean came from 10 rivers in Africa and Asia, according to a report in the Times. The Guardian revealed this month that Conservative MPs had been hauled in by No 10 to be briefed on seven new policy principles underpinned by a focus on the environment in an attempt to turn the situation around. As the final episode of the BBC’s Blue Planet II finished on Sunday evening, many Tory MPs published messages on Twitter to push the government’s environmental policies, accompanied by Conservative-branded graphics. The change in strategy comes a decade after Cameron tried to make the party focus on green issues, changing the Conservative logo to a tree, installing a wind turbine on his roof and visiting the Arctic to learn about global warming – where he was mocked for metaphorically trying to “hug a husky”. However, he moved away from this agenda over the course of his premiership and reportedly ordered officials to “cut the green crap” from energy bills and ban the expansion of onshore windfarms as he came under pressure from rightwingers in the party. May still has a number of senior MPs in the Conservative ranks who have expressed scepticism about green policies, including the Brexit secretary, David Davis, who once argued against the “ferocious determination to impose hairshirt policies on the public – taxes on holiday flights, or covering our beautiful countryside with wind turbines that look like props from War of the Worlds”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/dec/11/vladimir-putin-visit-to-syria-airbase-bashir-al-assad","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-11T16:45:08Z","webTitle":"Vladimir Putin makes triumphant visit to Syria airbase","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/dec/11/vladimir-putin-visit-to-syria-airbase-bashir-al-assad","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/dec/11/vladimir-putin-visit-to-syria-airbase-bashir-al-assad","fields":{"headline":"Vladimir Putin makes triumphant visit to Syria airbase","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Vladimir Putin has declared mission accomplished for Russian forces in the fight against Islamic State in Syria, as he made a surprise visit to the Russian airbase in the country. “Friends, the motherland is waiting for you,” Putin told the Russian air force detachment based at the Khmeimim airbase during his visit on Monday morning. “You are coming back home with victory.” Earlier this month, the head of the Russian army said Syria had been entirely liberated from Isis forces. Putin said a significant part of Russian forces would be withdrawn from Syria, though scepticism was warranted given that two previous announcements have been met with little noticeable scaling down. This time, however, could be different. Talk of the total defeat of Isis may be premature, but there is no doubt that Russian air power, combined with Syrian forces and Iran-backed Shia militias on the ground, has decisively shifted the balance of power in the long Syrian civil war. President Bashar al-Assad was on the brink of defeat when Russia entered the conflict in 2015. With sustained airstrikes on both moderate rebel groups and extremists, Moscow has helped Assad win back control of much of the country. The Russian and Syrian air forces were accused of brutal bombing tactics, including deliberately targeting civilian infrastructure, which the Russian military has always denied. Assad’s departure from office, long demanded by western powers, is no longer on the immediate agenda. Russia hopes to convene a peace conference that would cement its status as a new power broker in the Middle East, bypassing the US. “Syria has been saved as a sovereign, independent state, refugees are coming home and conditions have been created for a political settlement under the United Nations’ auspices,” Putin said on Monday. Assad, who met Putin at the airbase, thanked the Russian president for his country’s effective contribution to the fighting and said the Syrian people would never forget Russia’s help, according to Syrian television. The timing of the visit may also be linked to events in Russia. With a presidential election coming up in March, Putin is keen to portray the Syria mission as a success and reassure Russians that its forces will not get bogged down in the conflict. Casualties have been hushed up by Russian news outlets, as has the presence of private military contractors closely linked to the Russian state, often operating much closer to the front lines than Russia’s official advisory role would suggest. Putin said Russia would retain a contingent of forces at the Khmeimim airbase, located alongside a civilian airport in the coastal city of Latakia. “As you can see, we’re here for a long time,” the Russian army’s spokesman, Maj Gen Igor Konashenkov, said during a trip for journalists to the base in September. The facility features barracks, a modern canteen and even a makeshift Russian Orthodox church. Putin later flew from Syria to Egypt, where he met president Abdel Fatah al-Sisi in Cairo. The two leaders discussed the political situation in the Middle East and bilateral nuclear cooperation. Russia’s state nuclear company said it would build a plant at Dabaa that will cost up to $21bn (£16bn) and take a decade to complete. There was no immediate announcement, however, about the resumption of direct flights between the two countries, which were suspended after Isis claimed responsibility for downing a passenger jet carrying Russian tourists after takeoff from Sharm el-Sheikh two years ago. The suspension of flights has been disastrous for Egypt’s tourism industry."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/dec/30/seasonal-gardening-advice-winter-flowering-clematis-dead-hedge-book-of-seeds","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-30T11:00:10Z","webTitle":"Gardens: what to do this week","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/dec/30/seasonal-gardening-advice-winter-flowering-clematis-dead-hedge-book-of-seeds","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/dec/30/seasonal-gardening-advice-winter-flowering-clematis-dead-hedge-book-of-seeds","fields":{"headline":"Gardens: what to do this week","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Make this Rather than burning or shredding prunings from winter work in the garden, repurpose them into a dead hedge instead.

It started well: 1 January was a great success. On 2 January, though, I hit snooze and went back to sleep. I tried to get it going again, I really did – I even wore my gym clothes to bed – but nothing worked. This year, I’ve resolved to wean myself off scrolling mindlessly through social media on my phone, but when it comes to making resolutions – or, rather, breaking them – it feels as though there are forces at work far stronger than my willpower. I know I’m not alone in that; if I were, there wouldn’t be nearly 6,000 books on Amazon under the category “self help – habits”, nor so many psychologists researching the subject. So, could they help me keep my resolution this year? Charles Duhigg, the author of The Power of Habit, certainly thinks so. He tells me there is “a ton of research” to show that New Year resolutions are an effective way to make changes: they create a sense of expectation and ceremony, while the link to a particular day helps to fit our experiences into a narrative of before and after, which makes change more likely. “There are people who will decide on 1 January to lose two stone and who will keep it off for the rest of their lives, others who have been smoking two packs a day for over a decade who will decide to quit and who will still not smoke this time next year,” he says. “Anyone can change any habit; it doesn’t matter how old you are or how deeply ingrained that behaviour is. But that doesn’t mean – as everyone knows – that New Year resolutions are consistently successful. When our New Year resolutions fail, we berate ourselves for our weak self-discipline; we tell ourselves our willpower wasn’t strong enough, as though we are a marathon runner who couldn’t make it to the finish line. The image of a self-control muscle that gets tired over time, first proposed by the social psychologist Roy Baumeister in the late 90s, has shaped our collective consciousness. But a new generation of psychologists, unable to replicate the studies that proved his theory of “ego depletion”, are questioning this model. They are exploring other factors that might determine whether individuals can stick to their goals, including their motivation and environment, explains Katharina Bernecker, a postdoctoral researcher at Leibniz-Institut in Tübingen, south-west Germany. “The idea of a limited resource is about a capacity or an ability – you can or you can’t – whereas motivation is something that fluctuates. We’re searching for a new theory that tells us more about this process,” she says. Putting all our New Year resolution eggs in a willpower basket is exactly where we are going wrong, suggests Wendy Wood, provost professor of psychology and business at the University of Southern California. Although studies show that people who have a lot of self-control tend to be good at meeting their goals – if they are motivated to do well at work, they get promoted; if they want to live a healthy lifestyle, they exercise more – it isn’t because they use their willpower to control their behaviour, she explains. In fact, it is because they find a way around it. These individuals score highly on scales that measure their ability to control their actions and resist temptation, but “the interesting thing is that it doesn’t work that way”, Wood says. “What we’ve learned is that people with high self-control are not going through these white-knuckle struggles to eat better, exercise more or work harder. Instead, what they do is form habits. They automate their behaviours that get them to their goals, so they perform them without even thinking about it. That’s what makes them so successful.” It isn’t about willpower; it is about habits. This epiphany is what turned Gretchen Rubin, the author of the bestselling blockbuster Better Than Before, into the US’s happiness queen. “Habits are freeing and energising and really powerful. If there’s something you want to do consistently in your life – like New Year resolutions – habits can make the wear and tear on following through so much easier. They get us out of the tiresome business of making decisions and using our self-control.” Rubin speaks with the authority of a woman who has honed her lifestyle by knowing her weaknesses and how to overcome them: “I don’t have to decide to get up at 6am – that’s a habit for me, on autopilot,” she says. So, what makes a habit? First, says Bas Verplanken, professor of psychology at the University of Bath, they are automatic, occurring as part of our daily flow. “If going to the gym is a conscious decision, we’re vulnerable, because we have a fantastic capacity to rationalise why we should not go – we’re very, very good at that. Habits protect you against thinking,” he says. Second, they are triggered by cues in the environment, such as time or place. Third, every habit has a reward: when our brain starts to anticipate and crave the reward, it makes the behaviour automatic. Thanks to the boom in research in the field in the past decade, Duhigg tells me, “we’ve seen a golden age in understanding the neurology and psychology of habit formation”. In the first half of the 19th century, psychology research focused solely on observable behaviour – as opposed to what Verplanken calls “what is going on under the hood” – a period known as the behaviourist revolution, led by the psychologist BF Skinner. This was followed by the cognitive revolution, which investigated how we think, as opposed to how habits work, which entails investigating how we can avoid thinking. “It’s only since the turn of this century that we’ve started to realise that the brain is actually made up of multiple systems that are connected, but somewhat separate as well,” says Wood. “One of these is a neural system that learns in a habit way and this is represented in our behaviour in terms of automaticity. All of a sudden, habits started to gain credibility.” It was neuroscientists who brought habits on to psychology’s radar, since brain scans cast light on mechanisms unfolding in the deepest, darkest recesses of the brain, identifying which parts are activated as a behaviour becomes habitual. “As we repeat actions, we engage different aspects of our neural system and you can actually see habit formation taking place in the brain,” says Wood. “When you have people in scanners, activation starts in the decision-making areas of the brain – the prefrontal cortex and the hippocampus. Over time, as you repeat a behaviour and keep getting that reward, activation shifts more to the basal ganglial areas, particularly the putanem, because we’re no longer thinking actively; instead, we’re responding based on habit.” Wood’s research shows that 43% of what we do every day is performed out of habit. “It’s a shortcut – if you do what you did before, in this context, you’ll get the reward that you got before,” she says. These insights have significant implications for our New Year resolutions, says Duhigg. “Every habit has three components: the cue, the routine itself and the reward. A huge part of understanding how to change or control your habits is diagnosing the cues and, most importantly, the reward that routine delivers to you,” he says. I cast him in the role of my personal resolution consultant and ask what I need to do to break my phone habit. “The first thing is the terminology,” he says. “Breaking a habit is almost impossible. Once the neural pathways are set with cue, routine and reward, they are there to stay.” Rather than thinking in terms of breaking a bad habit, he says, I need to change my habit by finding a new routine that corresponds to the old cue, one that will deliver whatever reward I am getting from it currently. I figure out that my cue is flopping on to the sofa after a long day, but I can’t pinpoint what reward it gives me. I suppose there is a voyeuristic pleasure in looking at my friends’ photos on Facebook and I’m interested by articles linked to on Twitter. This is a good start, says Duhigg. “You can easily change this habit; you just need to spend some time experimenting with other routines to see what can deliver something similar to that old reward,” he says. For Rubin, the answer is more complex. “There is no magic, one-size-fits-all solution. Otherwise, we would have figured it out,” she says. In her book The Four Tendencies, she divides people into categories based on how we respond to inner and outer expectations (there is a quiz on her website, if you are intrigued). She says we need to tap into our own tendency to learn how to best stick to our habits. She diagnoses me as an Obliger – someone who meets outer expectations, but resists inner expectations; sounds about right – and suggests that the reason I failed so miserably (not her words) at keeping my running resolution last year could be that I had no outer accountability. Had I arranged to meet a friend for runs, turning inner expectations into outer, I might have been more successful. She also questions why I decided to run early in the morning when I usually exercise in the evening and why I chose running when I prefer exercise classes. Now, I realise why it went wrong: I didn’t know myself. I wonder if this is the root of most failed New Year resolutions. The difficulty making or changing habits then becomes a more profound question of why we can’t make ourselves do the things we want or stop ourselves from doing the things we don’t. According to David Bell, a psychoanalyst and consultant psychiatrist at the Tavistock and Portman NHS Foundation Trust, the answer is resistance. “One thing Freud put on the map is that we’re all much more resistant to change than we like to believe,” he says. Resistance is what happens when our unconscious holds us back from making the changes we consciously desire. Resolving to behave differently won’t help, he says; what can help is trying to figure out why we are the way we are. “Sometimes people are very fearful of others for reasons they don’t understand,” he says. “That tendency in their character is not going to be dealt with by deciding not to be frightened of other people – they need to understand the roots of that and that takes more time.” This is why thinking of personal growth as a neurological habit loop to be hacked doesn’t sit well with Bell. “It might be helpful for some people, but I think human beings have a rich subjective life, some of it conscious, a lot more less conscious,” he says. “To me, this sounds like treating your own mind as if it’s a machine that needs correction. I think that mechanical way of thinking about the self is alienating to individuals.” He sees a darker side to this kind of self-improvement strategy, describing a cultural shift that has intensified over the past 20 years, in which there is an increasing pressure, he says, “to think of individuals just as individuals, not as people in a network of social, cultural, historical relationships that are determining and affecting them. That goes hand in hand with a wish to transfer all responsibility to change on to the individuals themselves – and with undermining systems of social and medical welfare that form the basis of our way of thinking about our responsibilities for each other.” Am I any more likely, I ask Verplanken, to be able to stick to my New Year resolution today than I would have been 100 years ago, given all these advances in psychology? His answer surprises me. “Human nature is, in essence, not very different from 100 years ago – we are wired in the same way,” he says. “We like to think that we are progressing – and we are in all kinds of ways – but human nature doesn’t change.” Yet I have felt something shift after speaking to these experts. Why do I reach for my phone every evening? Because I need to escape my stressful day and it is an easy way out – it brings relief. So, I am following Duhigg’s advice and experimenting with different behaviours that could give me the same reward – watching TV, reading a novel, listening to a podcast – and I am also, as Bell suggests, trying to explore more deeply why I get so anxious in the first place. I hope that, eventually, this will enable me to connect better with myself and with my loved ones, instead of choosing to disconnect from the world. It is ambitious, as New Year resolutions go, but I am feeling optimistic."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"politics/2017/dec/11/theresa-may-forced-accept-brexit-scrutiny-committee-revolt-henry-viii-powers","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-11T20:07:30Z","webTitle":"Theresa May forced to accept new Brexit scrutiny committee","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/dec/11/theresa-may-forced-accept-brexit-scrutiny-committee-revolt-henry-viii-powers","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/dec/11/theresa-may-forced-accept-brexit-scrutiny-committee-revolt-henry-viii-powers","fields":{"headline":"Theresa May forced to accept new Brexit scrutiny committee","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Theresa May has been forced to accept more scrutiny of Brexit lawmaking to head off a Tory revolt but is still heading for a showdown over how MPs get to vote on the final deal and whether the date for leaving should be fixed in law. The prime minister made a concession on Monday by agreeing to set up a new committee of MPs to monitor any proposed legal changes as EU legislation is converted into the British statute book. She had been facing a parliamentary defeat over the issue during the debate on the EU withdrawal bill on Tuesday, after a widespread backbench revolt among remain- and leave-supporting MPs. However, the government has not backed down on its intention to fix the day of Brexit as 29 March 2019 or acceded to the demands of soft Brexit Tory MPs who wanted a meaningful vote on the terms of the final deal before that date. One Conservative rebel said May was in trouble over these two issues because there were enough dissatisfied Conservatives combined with Labour, SNP, Liberal Democrat and other opposition MPs to defeat the government. The MP said the government and the rebels were currently in a standoff with neither side prepared to back down. However, government sources were confident May had managed to convince enough of her backbenchers not to defy the whip by indicating that a vote was likely to happen well before the date of leaving and promising a second vote on legislation implementing the EU withdrawal agreement hammered out in Brussels on Friday. The appetite for rebellion among Conservative MPs will become clearer during the two days of debate and voting on the EU withdrawal bill on Tuesday and Wednesday. Up to 25 had threatened to revolt unless May promised more scrutiny over Brexit lawmaking, but No 10’s concessions appear to have allayed concerns among the would-be troublemakers. The government will agree to establish a new committee of MPs to help weed out the overuse of “Henry VIII powers”, which allow ministers to make changes to secondary legislation as it is transposed. The government argued that ministers would only make use of the powers to make minor tweaks, such as changing the names of regulatory bodies to refer to British rather than EU institutions. However, senior MPs across the Commons expressed worries that the powers could be misused. Dominic Grieve, a Conservative former attorney general, told the procedure committee that the bill represented the “most extraordinary arrogation of powers” by the executive that he had seen during 20 years in parliament. To deal with the problem, Downing Street said it would accept amendments proposed by the House of Commons procedure committee, which create a new process to ensure statutory instruments cannot be waved through the Commons without scrutiny under the “negative procedure”, whereby legislation is accepted if there is no objection after a certain period of time. The job of the new “sifting committee” will be to look at each of these instruments and recommend which ones require the “affirmative procedure” instead, whereby there is a Commons debate and vote before they become law. The committee would have10 sitting days to make this recommendation. May’s official spokesman said No 10 would be accepting the proposals in full. “We recognise the role of parliament in scrutinising the bill, and we have been clear throughout that we’re taking a pragmatic approach to what we’ve always said is a vital piece of legislation. Where MPs and peers can improve the bill, we will work with them,” he said. The spokesman said the cabinet had discussed Brexit on Monday, with May thanking David Davis, the Brexit secretary, and government officials for helping to clinch last week’s “significant milestone” agreement with the European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker. He said May relayed to cabinet ministers that voters had told her at events in her Maidenhead constituency over the weekend that they believed “we’re on our way”. This was the headline on the Daily Mail’s front-page Brexit story on Saturday. May’s tricky week will end with her attendance at the EU summit where leaders will decide whether enough progress has been made on Brexit to progress to talks on trade and transition. After that, she faces the headache of discussing with her deeply divided cabinet how the UK government would like the “end state” of Brexit to look. The prime minister’s spokesman confirmed this would happen at their final weekly meeting before Christmas next Tuesday. Meanwhile, a report from the Rand Corporation, an authoritative US thinktank, has said a Brexit without a deal could take 4.7% out of UK economy over 10 years, costing each taxpayer $2,144 (£1,607) and a total of $140bn. The study, one of the largest of the various forms of Brexit on the European, British and American economies, found that in no scenario, including even the softest Brexit of remaining in the single market like Norway, would the UK be better off. The report says it may take as long as 12 years from Brexit for any effects from regulatory divergence from the EU to have any beneficial impact. It says the most advantageous Brexit will be a tripartite free trade deal between the US, the UK and the EU, but it says this outcome is politically highly unlikely. There have been many previous studies trying to model the impact of various forms of Brexit. The Rand Europe study takes into account those studies, covers more scenarios and analyses the impact on the US economy. It says the benefit to the US of a trade deal with the UK will be trivial and warns that if the UK opts for the no-deal exit then pressure on UK public finances will be large enough to threaten existing British defence spending commitments, potentially undermining Nato. It says an EU without the UK “may be more willing to create barriers for non-EU companies, to the detriment of US companies and the American economy”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/dec/30/fit-in-my-40s-zuu-exercise-regime-animal-zoe-williams","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-30T07:00:05Z","webTitle":"Fit in my 40s: welcome to Zuu, the animal-themed exercise regime that makes everybody look ridiculous | Zoe Williams","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/dec/30/fit-in-my-40s-zuu-exercise-regime-animal-zoe-williams","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/dec/30/fit-in-my-40s-zuu-exercise-regime-animal-zoe-williams","fields":{"headline":"Fit in my 40s: welcome to Zuu, the animal-themed exercise regime that makes everybody look ridiculous","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"When you try ballet (surely, on mysemi-recommendation a few months back, you tried ballet?) it is tremendously difficult at first. You look around at all the people who are better than you, and get a vivid snapshot of the intense, technical precision, the practice and the perfectionism involved, which is what makes it work for them and not for you. Well, a Zuu class is the opposite of that. You move like an animal, it’s incredibly hard and everybody else covers way more ground, whether as a sideways gorilla or a crawling bear. But no matter how fast they are, how fit, how unruffled or how well-dressed, everybody looks ridiculous. It’s quite elaborate, the Virgin Active I visit: vast and futuristic, a bit like the spaceship in Wall-E, except there is nobody fat there. The instructors are the capital’s finest, sleek, slick, focused: and also, at least while doing a frog squat, ridiculous. The exercise is exactly what it sounds like: very short bursts of traversing a gym floor on your hands and knees. The frog squat starts much like a regular deep squat – think sitting on an imaginary step a few inches off the floor – except you press your elbows against your knees. The frog jump. Well, just imagine a frog jumping and approximate it. Physical spontaneity is part of the point. Realistically, you’ll never move that much like a bear; your aim here is only to seek the sensation of bear movement so ardently that you forget how much easier it is to stand on two feet. Zuu fitness was invented in Australia by Nathan Helberg. He was very fit, but only “in set planes”: when he wasn’t doing specific exercises – bench presses and weightlifting and such – Helberg felt “quite weak, even vulnerable to joint instability”. I think it’s an elite athlete thing, this listening to your body. I hear nothing from mine, except appetite, pain and the odd neurotic rash. In getting you to move differently, more elementally, if you will, Zuu aims to explore the full range of your body’s capabilities. The formless, toddler element of it is supposed to be motivating: when you liberate yourself from your learned habits, you can leap as freely as a rabbit (actually, no rabbits are mentioned in any of the Zuu manuals; I just feel that I’ve talked enough about frogs). This exhilaration will push you through what would otherwise be quite a significant pain barrier, because, much like anything that uses your own bodyweight against you, Zuu is extremely high intensity. I got scant pleasure from the galumphing, to be honest. And when did you last see a gorilla worrying about its quads? It is a wickedly tough 20 minutes, though; like any 20-minute workout, it gives your day a fillip – and is at least better than a full 40.

After all, better-off care home residents who pay their own way are each quietly subsidising to the tune of £12,000 a year those with fewer assets who are funded by councils that negotiate lower fees. What could be more socialist? The truth is that this is an unofficial, unregulated and profoundly unfair tax levied not by the state but, with the state’s connivance, by private care businesses that declare it the only way to make a broken system work. It is also a tax – and a system – unknown to alarming numbers: as a survey published today shows, one in four middle-aged people still think that care and support is free, rising to more than one in three when you include those who aren’t sure. The state of social care shames us all. When the minister responsible, Jackie Doyle-Price, slipped into the Commons one morning last week to administer the last rites to the latest attempt at reform, she was marking 20 years of failure. It was in 1997 that the then Labour health secretary, Frank Dobson, launched a royal commission on the issue with a warning that things “cannot be allowed to continue for much longer”. Since then we have had a dozen white and green papers and plenty of warm words from all sides, but no action – at least none in England, the rest of the UK having gone separate ways. And we shouldn’t expect action any time soon: another green paper setting out proposals is now promised next summer and, as Doyle-Price said, “it is right that we take the time needed to debate the many complex issues and listen to the perspectives of experts and care users”. But is it right? Do we not know what must be done? We could, for sure, profitably spend the next six months exploring the future of care and support for all who need it. But this will be a green paper on older people alone – a “parallel programme of work” is planned on younger adults with support needs – and we are knee-deep in consultation findings, analysis and blueprints for a way forward on funding care in old age. It is obvious that any settlement will rest on three pillars. First, shared responsibility between the individual and the state. Today’s survey findings for the thinktank Demos, based on the views of more than 2,000 people aged 40-69, show that 57% think the individual has the greater responsibility to finance their care and only 36% believe the state should foot the bill. Demos says opinion has been moving steadily away from state responsibility. Only one in 20 of us is making sufficient savings provision for potential care costs. However, Demos is calling for a public awareness campaign and development of insurance models that the finance sector has so far failed to make available on any scale. The report is independent but sponsored by insurer Legal &amp; General. Second, a cap on individual responsibility. It was a £72,000 cap on lifetime liability for care costs, first announced in 2013 and due to take effect in 2020, that Doyle-Price formally killed off last week. In reality it had been dead in the water since the June general election, when Theresa May got into such a mess trying to reopen the policy. Doyle-Price said the green paper proposals would include “a limit on the care costs that indivduals face”. One recent suggestion, which would certainly improve public understanding, would be to set a cap – perhaps at £100,000 – to cover all payments, including board and lodging as well as care costs. Third, the settlement requires more government funding for social care. While the state will not pick up the entire tab, applying a cap will carry costs – estimated at £1.7bn a year when first proposed in 2011 – and councils have had to cut £6bn from social care budgets over the past seven years. After last month’s budget failed to mention it, local government’s 2018-19 finance settlement is due any day.

One of my earliest memories is of being on my own in a tent surrounded by steaming kettles. I was discharged after three months, just in time for my third birthday. As I’d missed Christmas, I had my Christmas and birthday all in one – in March. Mum even found a Christmas tree. Perhaps this explains why Mum was overly protective. For a long time after I started school I wasn’t allowed to play in the street or visit friends. She wasn’t as strict with my brother, Roger, who was three years older, but fortunately I didn’t mind my own company or feel the lack of friends. Mum worked for a London dressmaker before she married. When she was forced to give up work after her marriage, she carried on dressmaking for people at home. She was the one with the get-up-and-go. Dad, who worked as a plumber, was a quiet and undemanding man who liked to laugh – and he was a very good dancer. Perhaps it is no surprise I became an entertainer because many of my relatives were natural performers. Dad, who had a fine pair of lungs, was master of ceremonies at East Ham working men’s club in east London. I felt so proud when I saw him in his white gloves calling out the names of the dances. His brother, Uncle George, was a bit of a showman. I started singing and dancing at the age of seven, at working men’s clubs. I spent hours rehearsing new songs while Mum doggedly accompanied me on the piano. The fear of forgetting the words in public often made me cry, but Mum was determined to put me on the stage and I never complained. I wasn’t allowed to spend any of the money I earned. Nowadays, a child performer’s earnings are put aside for their future, but my parents were only too glad of the money to pay the household expenses. There were weekends when I earned almost as much as Dad did in a week. I met my husband and manager, Harry Lewis, in 1939 while singing with the Bert Ambrose Orchestra. He was a very good clarinettist and tenor saxophonist and I thought him terribly good looking, with a fine head of hair, even if he was rather short. His tough, Jewish, East End background had taught him how to stick up for himself – and for those he cared about. When the male singer in the band accused me of singing flat, Harry rounded on him and said, “Vera’s not singing flat; you’re singing sharp!” Dad took to Harry right away, but Mum had been hoping for something “better” than a poor, scruffy, unshaven musician. Nevertheless, Harry courted me assiduously and we didn’t get hitched until August 1941 to give Mum time to get used to the idea. Our daughter, Virginia, was born in March 1946. I went back to work 11 months later, but brought her up myself as much as possible. If I had to work in the evenings, I’d tell her so – I thought that was kinder – but always stressed that I’d see her in the morning. Virginia is in her 70s now, but she still calls me Mamma. We have always got on, but when Harry died in 1998 we became even closer. We tell each other off now, too. I turned 100 this year, but although I still live in my own home, Virginia is just next door. I didn’t have any more children because I couldn’t have continued working – and I was the main breadwinner. But although we are small in number, family life has always been hugely important to me. • Keep Smiling Through by Dame Vera Lynn with her daughter, Virginia Lewis-Jones (Century, £16.99).

It is a big one, and we can’t wait – it is now or never. We can’t ask you what you want. We can only hope it is the right choice. Right now, you don’t know that you are different, that we inhabit different worlds. I always knew you were special, but I expect all parents feel that way about their children. We didn’t find out you were deaf until you were one, and for that I am grateful. I know early intervention is essential, but if I had found out you were deaf at birth, I would have been terrified. When we found out, there was no sadness, shock, anger or grief. Just a feeling of: “Oh, that makes sense.” Every time someone says to me, “I’m sorry to hear that” in response to the news that you are deaf, I want to say: “Why? Haven’t you seen my perfect child and everything she can do? Don’t be sorry. We’re not.” We immediately started signing to you, and you flourished. You talk to us with your hands and you have so much to say. Seeing how happy it makes you to sign fills my heart with joy. We are learning British Sign Language so we can all sign together as a family, but soon your need for more language will overtake the speed with which we can learn. It is difficult to reconcile the certainty I feel that I wouldn’t change you for the world, with the knowledge that I will. You will always be deaf, but I want to give you a tool, an opportunity, so that one day you can choose how you want to communicate. It is not an easy decision, a cochlear implant, and I hope you will forgive us for our decision. Giving a cochlear implant to a child who has never heard sound is a controversial and sensitive subject. The surgeons advise against implanting them after the age of four, as the likelihood of being able to interpret and make use of the sound is greatly diminished. We can’t wait until you are older to ask what you want, we have to choose for you. Making a decision for someone else, especially when it will change their life, is almost impossible. We have gone backwards and forwards, thought long and hard. No parent would make this choice lightly. What if it doesn’t work, and we have put you through surgery for nothing? What if, as an adult, you feel you don’t fit into the deaf community as an implant user? What if the pressure to fit into the hearing world is too much for you? On the other side of the coin, what if we don’t consent to the implant, and then at school, after the “window of opportunity” for spoken language has closed, you wish you had one? We won’t stop signing with you, and I refuse to believe I have to choose between raising you as a speaking or signing child. We have an incredible team who support our aims. I have done my research. I have spoken to deaf adults and met deaf children, some of whom use implants and some who do not. We have made up our minds. It is difficult to sign when you insist on being carried everywhere, but one day you won’t need me to pick you up, so for now, my precious girl, I will carry you wherever you want. And whether you decide to speak or to sign, I’ll never stop talking your language.

The US president refused in October to continue to certify the 2015 multilateral agreement under which Tehran accepted strict curbs on its activities in return for sanctions relief. Trump said that either Congress or US allies should fix the “serious flaws” in the deal, or he would “terminate it. The Senate has since opted out of dealing with the matter, and Washington’s allies have insisted that the 2015 agreement cannot be renegotiated. If Trump refuses to sign a six-monthly presidential waiver due on 15 January, nuclear-related sanctions against Iran will no longer be suspended and the US will be in violation of agreement. The other signatories, including the UK, France, Germany, Russia and China, would then have to decide whether to try to carry on without the US or allow the agreement to collapse. Either way, the Trump administration would have taken a very significant step toward open confrontation. Winter Olympics, 9 February The Winter Olympics in South Korea will be both a festival of sport and a test of the increasingly fragile peace in the region. If the war of words between Trump and the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, is defused, the Olympics could offer the opportunity for a thaw. Seoul has suggested a lull in joint manoeuvres with the US during the Games, potentially opening the way for dialogue. If the two leaders are still playing nuclear chicken, there is a risk Kim might seek to spoil South Korea’s long-planned Games with nuclear or missile test, or another form of provocation. It could make for a very tense fortnight. Ticket sales are low, but Britain’s 60-strong squad are feeling “bullish” about 10 to 12 realistic medal prospects, having won four in Sochi 2014. UK competitors include the snowboarders Katie Ormerod and Billy Morgan, the speed skating world champion Elise Christie, and Katie Summerhayes and James Woods in the ski slopestyle. Watch out too for three women who could be the stars of the Games. Nigeria’s bobsleigh team of Seun Adigun, Ngozi Onwumere and Akuoma Omeoga are close to securing a historic qualification. “It’s surreal,” says Adigun. “Nigeria have never had anyone in the Winter Olympics. The country’s excited to see that happen.” Middle East peace process, February President Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, is expected to produce a plan for Middle East peace. It is a goal that has eluded many would-be statesmen, so it is a daunting task for the 36-year-old real estate heir. He does have something going for him. The Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu feels beholden to Trump and could be willing to grant concessions that he would never have dreamed of offering to the previous US administration. The powerful if erratic Saudi crown prince, Mohamed bin Salman, is also happy to shatter precedents and tradition, and seemingly keen to make common cause with the US and Israel against Iran. One possible outcome is a plan that falls far short of dreams of statehood and independence of most Palestinians, who will be under pressure to accept whatever is offered, while Israel and its partners prepare for a conflict with Tehran and its allies. Iran’s Revolutionary Guard is likely to strengthen its grip on Syria, rebuilding Bashar al-Assad’s army and fielding proxy forces across the country as Russia withdraws. Russian elections, 18 March Russia will hold a presidential election on a date chosen to mark the anniversary of the annexation of Crimea. The winner has not been in doubt since Vladimir Putin confirmed he would be standing for another six year term. By 2024, he will have been running Russia for 24 years. There are no serious challengers to Putin extending his reign, but the election campaign will still provide a barometer of the level of discontent in the absence of any significant improvements in Russian living standards and the dwindling appeal of foreign wars. South Sudan, 9 July The mandate of the South Sudan’s president, Salva Kiir, and the country’s parliament expire under the transitional constitution, leaving a potentially dangerous vacuum. There is no sign that South Sudan is ready for a vote, the opposition is in exile and little has been done to implement the 2015 peace agreement that froze its civil war. Conflict threatens to reignite in a country where 7.6 million people are dependent on aid as a result of decades of conflict and misrule. Brazilian elections, 28 October Brazil will seek to find its way out of a mire of political scandals and corruption when the second round of its presidential election take place. It will be the first popular vote since Michel Temer took over as president in the wake of the impeachment and removal of Dilma Rousseff. Temer has just survived serious corruption allegations himself, but his popularity rating is in low single figures. The current favourite to win is the former president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, but only if he takes part. That is in doubt because he faces a suspended sentence for money laundering and receiving bribes. If the sentence is upheld, he would be out of the race, which would be left wide open. US mid-term elections, 6 November The extraordinary Senate vote in Alabama gives a foretaste of the nationwide battle to come in the US mid-term elections, in which all 435 members of the House of Representatives and a third of the Senate face the electorate. Mid-terms tend to be seen as a popular verdict on the presidency, Trump has record low approval ratings and Democrats feel that if they can win in Alabama they could win anywhere. It is possible the Democrats could conquer the House if the anti-Trump wave is strong enough, but they face arithmetic problems in the Senate. Of the 33 seats up for election, Democrats and their allies are defending 25. To win the Senate they would have to fend off challenges there and capture two Republican seats in Arizona, Mississippi, Nebraska, Nevada, Tennessee, Texas, Utah or Wyoming. Julian Borger UK Brexit talks, January If you thought the Brexit talks dragged on this year, just wait for the sequel in 2018. Phase two of the divorce negotiations starts in earnest in January once the European commission receives its mandate from other member states for discussing Britain’s future relationship with the EU. First on the agenda will be agreeing a transition phase to give everyone some more breathing room - and even longer to keep talking. Working out how long the country will need to spend in this purgatory could be harder. Theresa May has suggested two years, but the EU would prefer 21 months because it aligns with the budget calendar. Almost everyone else thinks it could take much longer. The EU wants Downing Street to choose between a stripped-down free-trade agreement that covers trade in goods, like the bloc has with Canada, or an associate membership of the single market that includes cooperation on services, like it has with Norway. The UK would like the best of both, seeking bespoke tailoring rather than anything as grubby as an off-the-shelf suit. Expect to hear lots more about Canada-plus and Norway-minus in the coming months, even if neither model ends up becoming a reality until long after the nation’s eyes have glazed over. Dan Roberts Local elections, 3 May Local elections on will see more than 150 boroughs, councils and authorities put some or all of their seats up for grabs. Much of the focus will invariably fall on the four metropolitan boroughs where all seats are being contested – Birmingham, Leeds, Manchester and Newcastle – and the 32 London boroughs. The good news for May is that all the metropolitan areas and the bulk of the London ones are Labour-held anyway, so the Conservatives have little to lose. She might even hope for some advances, especially in Birmingham, centre of the West Midlands mayoralty, a prize narrowly and surprisingly won in 2017 by the Tory candidate Andy Street. On the flipside, the general election saw Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour dominate many big city areas, particularly London, where it took four seats from the Conservatives and 54% of the vote, up 10% on 2015. The elections will also include the first trial in England of asking voters to show ID, a scheme being piloted in five towns. This has prompted some controversy, and if there are complaints about voters being turned away, especially older or more vulnerable ones, expect a storm. Royal wedding, 19 May Spring will be busy for royal watchers, with Prince Harry set to marry Meghan Markle. The royal wedding will take place in St George’s Chapel at Windsor Castle and broadcasters from around the world set to record the moment that Hollywood meets the Windsors. Harry is set to acquire a new title, and the smart money is on the couple becoming the Duke and Duchess of Sussex. Tradition dictates that male members of the royal family receive a title from the monarch on their wedding day, and Sussex happens to be vacant. The last duke was the sixth son of George III back in 1801. Other options include Albany, Clarence, Connaught, Cumberland, Teviotdale and Windsor. The prince is also set to relinquish his position as fifth-in-line to the throne with the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge’s third child, due in April. Caroline Davies Social care green paper, June/July Damian Green – remember him? – announced the timing of the social care green paper in November in his then-cross departmental role as first secretary. Social care is the issue no one wants to grasp, for two simple reasons. The first is that the problem is always getting worse. An ageing population is living longer, but often with long-term health issues connected to sedentary lives and poor diets that require ever more outside assistance. The second is that people are going to have to pay more for their care, which is not a popular notion. May’s sudden election U-turn happened because of negative reaction to the Tories’ initial proposal, which placed no cap on the amount people might have to provide themselves. A cap was soon added. It is into this political and demographic morass the ministers will need to delve again over the summer. It could be tricky. Sport Tennis: Australian Open, Melbourne Park, 15-28 January Serena Williams, who gave birth in September, is on the entry list, making Melbourne Park the first chance in 2018 for a Williams clash with Maria Sharapova, two years after the Russian’s failed doping test. Sharapova’s 2017 memoir references her rival more than 100 times, including her “thick arms and thick legs”. Williams responded: “I just work hard, I was born with this badass body and I’m proud of it.” The men’s event also looks promising. Andy Murray, Novak Djokovic, Stan Wawrinka, Kei Nishikori and Milos Raonic all aim to come back strong from the injuries that blighted their 2017. In their path lies Roger Federer, who at 36 is chasing a 20th grand slam title. Football: Uefa Nations League draw, 24 January Good news, fans of complex formats. Football’s inaugural Nations League starts in 2018. The new Uefa tournament, designed to replace most friendlies, features all 55 Uefa nations in four leagues: 12 in Leagues A and B, 15 in C and 16 in D, based on coefficient rankings. England are in A, Wales, the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland in B and Scotland in C. Here’s where it gets more involved. At the draw, each league will be split into four mini-groups of three or four nations, who will play each other home and away from September. The sides finishing top of the four League A groups in June 2019 then compete to be overall winner via semis and a final, and there’s also promotion and relegation: four up, four down. The biggest incentive to take it seriously, however, is the backdoor offered into Euro 2020. Four places at the finals are reserved for the winners of playoffs between the winners of the 16 Nations League groups. Uefa’s promise? It will be “the rejuvenation of national team football”. Boxing: George Groves v Chris Eubank Jr, Manchester Arena, 17 February Until schedules are firmed up for Anthony Joshua and Tyson Fury, expect the early-year hype to focus on Groves v Eubank Jr. The semi-final of the World Boxing Super Series, a new eight-man elimination competition, sold out in seven minutes without the need for a set-piece trash-talk press conference. They had one anyway. Groves, defending his WBA super-middleweight title, told Eubank Jr he was deluded and said: “No one who leaves himself wide open by throwing punches from his ankles can beat me.” Eubank, channelling his father, responded: “George, you cannot survive the fire I will bring down upon you. I’m a mountain and you’re not going to climb it. I am Mount Everest.” The Commonwealth Games, Gold Coast, Australia, 4-15 April Judo is out, basketball is back, women’s rugby sevens and beach volleyball are in for the first time and there are 38 para-sport medal events. England are throwing immense resources at defending their position on top of the table, with a team of 400 athletes and 250 support staff. Greg Rutherford, Katarina Johnson-Thompson and Dina Asher-Smith are among the big names in a 75-strong athletics squad.Watch out, too, for Usain Bolt, not back on the track but in talks over a possible “ambassadorial role”. Football: World Cup, Russia, 14 June - 15 July Germany and Brazil are the favourites, and England face the pressure of an easy draw - Group G games against Tunisia on 18 June, debutants Panama on 24 June and main threat Belgium on 28 June. It looks manageable, so it surely won’t be. “We’ve just come from two tournaments where Costa Rica knocked us out, and then Iceland,” says Gareth Southgate. “So it’d be folly for us not to be serious about it.” Watch out too for the official logo, mocked online for looking like an electric shaver or Nemo from Finding Nemo standing on his tail, and the mascot Zakivaka, meaning “the one who scores”. Fifa says: “This is a wolf who radiates fun, charm and confidence, but who also plays fair.” Hockey: Women’s World Cup, London, 21 July-5 August Another chance to feel that 2012 spirit, with mid-summer action from the Lee Valley Hockey and Tennis Centre in Stratford, the venue converted from the Paralympic Eton Manor site in 2014. Sixteen nations are taking part, and England, the world No2 team, are drawn in Pool B with the Asian champions India, the US and Ireland. England lost 1-0 to South Korea in the bronze-medal match of the Women’s Hockey World League final in November, but aim to channel the spirit of Team GB’s Rio 2016 gold medal-winning run. Golf: the Ryder Cup, Paris, 28-30 September It’s seven years since France won the right to host the Ryder Cup, a controversial call at the time. There was pressure on the committee to pick Spain’s bid as a tribute to Seve Ballesteros, who died days before the announcement, but the Albatros Course in the Paris suburb of Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines made more financial sense. The US team head to Paris as defending champions and favourites, and captain Jim Furyk’s options looking formidable. Europe’s 12-man lineup will feature the top four on the European points list, the top four outside that quartet in the world rankings and four picks from the captain, Thomas Bjorn. Several rookies are in contention, including England’s Tommy Fleetwood and Tyrrell Hatton, Spain’s Jon Rahm and France’s Alexander Levy. Bjorn says: “I am trying to balance the captaincy with my friendships.” David Hills Culture Fast and Furious Live, January Fans of the ludicrously over-the-top action movie franchise will be able to see the first live version, with 18 stunts being recreated for a high-octane arena tour featuring cars, lorries and a submarine. Its producers claim it will be one of the biggest and most ambitious arena shows ever created, up there with Cirque du Soleil’s reinvention of the circus.. Macbeth, National Theatre, Feburary 2018 will mark both 25 years since Macbeth was staged at the National Theatre and since its boss Rufus Norris directed a Shakespeare play. The 1993 Macbeth was poorly received. It became known as the “gas ring Macbeth” because of the blue flame ground lighting, and its director Richard Eyre said he was left feeling tarred and feathered by the reaction. Critics also deemed Peter Hall’s 1978 production a flop and symptomatic of the company’s lost direction. No pressure then on Norris, who has cast Rory Kinnear and Anne-Marie Duff. Monet &amp; Architecture, National Gallery, 9 April-29 July There have been countless Monet shows over the decades, some would say too many. The National Gallery, however, says there has never been one devoted to his relationship with architecture, and boldly claims its exhibition will allow visitors to see Monet in an entirely new way. It promises to be genuinely exciting and will feature loans from public and private collections all over the world, many paintings coming to the UK for the first time. Patrick Heron, Tate St Ives, 19 May-9 September It may not look much from the outside, but for many Tate St Ives underground extension is a wonder to behold and a game changer for the museum. It gives more space and time on display for the gallery’s wonderful permanent collection and allows important temporary shows, not least a retrospective for one of the greatest British abstract artists, known for his joyful, life-enhancing vibrancy. Royal Academy Summer Exhibition, 12 June-19 August It is a British summer staple, as traditional as Wimbledon and disappointing weather. It’s fair to say it features artworks of varying quality, but 2018 marks the RA’s 250th anniversary and curators are promising a show like no other. There will also be an accompanying show looking back at the history of the largest open submission art exhibition in the world. It is part of a huge year for the RA as it opens its redevelopment, linking its two buildings, on 19 May. Great North Exhibition, Newcastle-Gateshead, 22 June-9 September Newcastle-Gateshead beat Blackpool, Bradford and Sheffield for the right to stage what is being billed as the “largest event in England in 2018”. The government is giving £5m, and £15m to a legacy fund. Full details have yet to be announced, but the best of northern art, design and innovation are promised over three hub venues - the Baltic, the Sage and the Great North Museum. Mark Brown Fashion The Met Ball, 7 May Never an event to shy away from a provocative theme, the 2018 Met Ball and the accompanying exhibition at New York’s Metropolitan Museum of Art curated by Andrew Bolton, has already raised eyebrows with its title, Heavenly Bodies: Fashion and the Catholic Imagination. As the most famous and prestigious fancy-dress party on the fashion calendar, the night - which was profiled in the 2016 documentary The First Monday in May - will see the most influential figures in the industry come out to play. Bets are on to see who will, and who won’t, nail the dress code appropriately, and how effectively Bolton tackles the subject. Frida Kahlo’s Wardrobe, V&amp;A, 6 June-4 November This vibrant personal collection has never been exhibited outside Mexico before and is slated to include not only clothes, accessories and jewellery, but also prosthetics, photographs and letters. Given that Kahlo is one of the most frequently referenced cultural and style influencers from the 20th century, the retrospective should make for a sweet summer afternoon. Reebok x Victoria Beckham Victoria Beckham is taking a leaf out of her old pal Sporty Spice’s book with her forthcoming collaboration with Reebok. Set to launch in late 2018, Beckham promises it will “challenge the traditional notions of fitness wear within a fashion context” and says has gone into partnership with the sports giant because of their shared mission to instil confidence in women. Girl power lives on.

You literally can't get a table","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"There is a raw kind of beauty to the Tripadvisor review. Let your eye flow down the page and poetry emerges. “Like a plate of blood / I wanted to scream / The worst / The worst / The worst pasty in London.” My boyfriend runs a deli – they had their favourite bad Tripadvisor review printed on tea towels: “When I’m lying on my deathbed, I’ll regret the hour I spent here.” People email him with threats – if you don’t give me and my wife a free meal on Saturday, I’ll post a bad review. Tripadvisor holds plenty of such secrets in its one star reviews, while hiding up at the other end, in the lush grass of its five star hits, are writers paid to push restaurants up the charts. It was an earlier job doing just this, at £10 a go, that gave Vice writer Oobah Butler the idea of going a step further, from creating fake restaurant reviews to creating a fake restaurant. The Shed, reads its website, is “an appointment-only restaurant located in south London”. It’s not. There are vivid photographs of burrata and scallops, and miniature chocolate soufflés and something clever with an egg. Except they’re shaving foam, toilet bleach blocks and a sponge covered in instant coffee. As his friends began posting five star reviews and the Shed climbed Tripadvisor’s ranks, the phone started ringing. Do they have a table tomorrow night? Could a family book a table in four months’ time? Nope. By the end of August, they were at #156. By the autumn they were #30. On 1 November, six months after creating The Shed at Dulwich website and propping a fried egg jauntily against a bare foot, they were, according to Tripadvisor, the best restaurant in London. I don’t know if you’ve ever been to London, but here we have a lot of restaurants. A LOT of restaurants. Chicken ones, fish ones, ones where, as seen in this week’s papers, a waitress will bite out her exes’ testicle when he refuses her a threesome with his new girlfriend, ones where the food is horrific but you don’t want to hurt the manager’s feelings because of her extremely sad eyes, ones that are so fancy they literally rotate, ones that give a menu without prices to the woman for fear of breaking her hymen. So this is some accolade, this, the “best restaurant in London”, and its arrival at the top of the list is eye-opening, not just because it exposes the truth about online reviews, but because it exposes the truth about how we live. Does that sound a bit grand? A quenelle of shaving foam fools the internet and suddenly I’m Jean Paul Fartre? But look at us: we are a people so cautious, so risk-averse that a call from an unknown number causes us to throw our phones into the fire. We are the Tripadvisor generation, our time so precious that before going out for lunch we must memorise the menu like a meaty acrostic, our lives so expensive that before investing in an attraction we must educate ourselves with every possible iteration of events. “Don’t waste your time hearing about sad things,” says Sergio B on Tripadvisor about the Anne Frank house, “but it’s up to you.” “Nothing shocked me, other than the pile of human hair,” said user Ricky Thompson, after visiting Auschwitz. “I had seen much worse on TV and the internet.” Despite Thompson’s poor review, it is still rated the number one attraction in Oświęcim. The big draw of the Shed, of course, was the combination of excellent reviews and overt impossibility. You literally couldn’t get a table. Which made it the perfect restaurant – the chase to be first to share an iPhone photo of their moody Dulwich tea, to swagger into the office with interesting comments on the plating choices of an ungettable feast. We are grabbers. We are scratchers. Once something has been waved in front of us with the promise of exclusivity and proof of a five-star rating we will clamber through the internet, we will crawl through dirt to own it. We are all tourists online, in the thrall of Sergio B lighting a cigarette outside an Amsterdam coffee shop before crafting his Anne Frank review, and we’re all potential Ricky Thompsons, wanting to be first to say Auschwitz was crap. Could this ghost restaurant, that served pretend food to nobody, be the straw that breaks Tripadvisor’s back? And with it our gullible prudence, and our scrabble for only the best?

Football fanatics need not panic: polls show it’s still far ahead of both baseball and basketball in popularity. The 2017 NBA finals averaged 20.4m viewers (a 20-year record), which is roughly the same as the NFL’s regular Sunday night audience of 20.3m, and nowhere near the 2016 Super Bowl über-audience of 111m. Based on just those numbers, football is still kicking professional basketball, baseball and hockey through the goal posts. But America can be fickle. And the Magic 8-Ball of our cultural zeitgeist says, “All signs point to the NBA replacing the NFL as the league of America’s future.” This prediction has nothing to do with the athletes themselves, their level of skill, their heart, or their commitment to their sport. Professional athletes are generally the highest expression of what the human body is capable of doing and therefore inspiring to the fans to reach higher and strive harder. In that way, no sport is superior to any other sport. But when it comes to professional sports, some are more inspirational, more exciting and more entertaining to the general public than others and those sports take on a symbolic meaning for Americans. They come to represent our core values. They represent not just who we are, but who we want be. Baseball once ruled all other sports as America’s pastime because it reflected the laid-back, less confrontational mood of America in the 1920s and 1930s. It was highly strategic, required precision teamwork, but moved at a pace reflective of hot summers in rural towns across the country. Football’s popularity rose with the increasing aggression of the America at home and abroad. Football embodied an America who faced all challenges head on, forcing its will on opponents through skill, guile and brute force. We were a country taking bold risks in order to succeed and football was the riskiest of team sports. But America has changed and with that change we are seeing a shifting away from hoisting football on our collective shoulders. Although football remains our most popular professional sport, that popularity has been declining over the past five years, from 67% saying they were fans in 2012, to 57% in 2017. Professional baseball has also fallen 2% during that time. However, professional basketball has risen 3%. Before anyone starts blaming Colin Kaepernick, let’s remember that he first took a knee in 2016 and that the fan base erosion had already been strong several years before that. One major reason Americans are stepping back from football is the danger. Physical risk has always been one of the attractions of the sport – a rite of manhood. But recent studies showing just how severe the brain damage is to the players shocked us. A 2017 study published in the Journal of American Medical Association discovered chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) in 110 out of 111 brains of former NFL players. A broken arm or cracked rib is one thing, the scars that prompt bragging rights, but widespread permanent brain damage that affects players for the rest of their lives is beyond entertainment. There is nothing sexy about depression and dementia. What makes it worse is that studies are finding the same problems with high school and college players. The same study found CTE in the brains of three of 14 high school players (21%) and 48 of 53 college players (91%). Dr Bennet Omalu, who is credited with discovering CTE (and who Will Smith portrayed in the 2015 movie Concussion), said that allowing kids to play football was equal to child abuse: “It is the definition of child abuse. If you play football, and if your child plays football, there is a 100% risk exposure.” This harsh reality prompted several former NFL players – including Brett Favre, Terry Bradshaw and Troy Aikman – to admit that they would not want their sons to play football. LeBron James and then-President Obama agreed. Knowing all that, Americans can’t help but feel a little complicit in cheering for a sport that is so destructive to its players, especially kids. According to a Washington Post-University of Massachusetts Lowell poll, 90% of sports fans agree that head injuries represent a problem in the sport. Another loose thread being pulled to unravel football’s dominant status is the fact that it’s less popular among children, who are the future fan base. According to ESPN, basketball is the most popular sport among American youth, both boys and girls, while football has dropped to third place. Yet, football is responsible for more injuries than any of the other sports. Football accounts for 28% of injuries among athletes 5 to 14, while basketball is responsible for only 15%. Those are just numbers and we know that numbers can fluctuate based on a lot of factors. More important to the future of football than the injuries and declining popularity among youth is the symbolic nature of the sport as it relates to representing America. America’s sport isn’t about who we were in the past but about who we want to be going forward. We no longer see ourselves as Friday Night Lights warriors who send our best and brightest into combat on the field, needlessly risking their brains and futures for the sake of 11 minutes of actual play (out of the average three hours and 12 minutes of an NFL game), which is the same as baseball. In contrast, basketball is a perpetual motion machine in which players face muscular opposition, yet don’t conquer with brute force but rather with graceful maneuvers and intense teamwork. Each game is an example of athletic alchemy, producing astounding physical displays of leaping, spinning, passing and shooting. And it does this every few minutes. America’s sport also has to represent America’s spirit, and right now that spirit is not one of complacency or complicity. Many athletes are no longer satisfied with taking the money and running home to hide out in their mansions. They want to fully embrace their responsibility as role models to children and representatives of their communities to speak out whenever America veers off the road paved by the US Constitution. With the Trump Administration’s overt racism, misogyny, xenophobia and anti-LGBTQ policies, we haven’t just veered off the road, we’re hanging over the cliff. NFL players have been pioneers in expressing their patriotism through silent protest at a time when there is so much to protest. Colin Kaepernick has been a leader in this movement and he has paid a personal and professional price for not caving into pressure. Dozens of other players, coaches and even owners have joined the protest, though most of them have since backed off once there was fear that the NFL’s slipping ticket sales and TV ratings might be related to such demonstrations. Sadly, there is a racial component to this policy. It is the players of color who are being denied their freedom to protest because they are the ones who are part of the oppressed social group. White owners and white fans don’t experience this same oppression, so speaking out about racial disparity in the US is not a priority to them. However, when owners honor military groups at games, or even play the national anthem, they are expressing their political opinions. This means that they aren’t against expressing political opinions, just dissenting ones, even though the country was founded on celebrating dissent. It’s disheartening to see some owners cowering in fear rather than further embracing this just expression. In the long run, pandering to their conservative fan base rather than acting out of conscience does more harm than good—to the sport and to the country. The NBA has been more tolerant of its players’ freedom of speech. Players and coaches from many teams have silently protested and spoken out to the press. LeBron James, Kyrie Irving, Jarrett Jack, Alan Anderson, Deron Williams, Kevin Garnett and others wore “I Can’t Breathe” T-shirts during warm-ups in 2014 to protest the death of unarmed Eric Garner by police. Steph Curry and Kevin Durant continue to speak out. Detroit Pistons coach Stan Van Gundy has said that protesting athletes are “models of American patriotism”. Spurs coach Gregg Popovich echoed that sentiment when he said that his players have “the organization’s full support to speak their minds”. Has speaking out affected ratings? This year the NBA, despite its protests, has increased its TV ratings by 32%, while the NFL’s viewership dropped from 16.5m viewers last year to 15m this year. Things aren’t perfect. There is still pressure to silence players. But the NBA has a chance to seize this moment and boldly lead by promoting the values and freedoms of the US Constitution. To be not just sports heroes, but also social heroes who reflect the kind of engaged Americans who won’t tolerate anyone stepping on our values, just for the price of a ticket, a hot dog and a beer. • Sign up to our weekly email, The Recap, here, showcasing a selection of our sport features from the past seven days."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"media/2017/dec/12/keith-chegwin-a-born-entertainer-with-natural-likability","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-12T07:00:27Z","webTitle":"Keith Chegwin: a born entertainer with natural likability","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/dec/12/keith-chegwin-a-born-entertainer-with-natural-likability","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2017/dec/12/keith-chegwin-a-born-entertainer-with-natural-likability","fields":{"headline":"Keith Chegwin: a born entertainer with natural likability","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The career of Keith Chegwin, who has died aged 60, is characterised by having presented both one of the most popular children’s TV shows in history and a contender for the medium’s most notorious adult entertainment. Viewers saw the best of him in Multi-Coloured Swap Shop (BBC1, 1976-82) and its successor, Saturday Superstore (1982-87), on which Chegwin became an honorary big brother to several generations of goggle-eyed British children, through his cheeky grin and giggle, high-pitched Liverpudlian-accented enthusiasm, and psychedelic knitwear. His presentational worst occurred when Chegwin threw off the novelty sweaters – and, indeed, all clothing except a hat – to front the naturist show Naked (Channel 5, 2000), described by a parliamentarian at the time as the “most disgusting programme ever shown” on British TV. But, while he should be remembered for the work he did with his jolly jumpers on, it was hard not to feel some sympathy for Chegwin, even in his most desperate televisual enterprises. This was due to a natural likability. Only the most sympathetic TV presenters earn nicknames from viewers, and, just as Bruce Forsyth transmuted into “Brucie”, Chegwin rapidly and indelibly became “Cheggers”. That identity was cemented by the title of the third huge success of his children’s career: the music-based gameshow, Cheggers Plays Pop (BBC1, 1978-86), which extended his presenting empire to weekdays. In less prosperous times, though, audiences also admired the impressive and affecting determination with which Cheggers, in the three decades after his Saturday morning career ended, tried to reinvent himself, often against considerable odds. In addition to a common problem for children’s presenters – becoming too old to maintain the required fantasy-sibling dynamic – Chegwin suffered health problems, including alcoholism. Apart from the established presenter-rehab route of reality TV – appearing on Dancing on Ice, Celebrity Big Brother and Celebrity MasterChef – Chegwin also offered ironic spins on his showbiz rise and fall in 10 projects, including Ricky Gervais’s Extras and Life’s Too Short, and Kill Keith (2011), an improbable comedy-horror Brit film spoof of Tarantino’s Kill Bill. The performer even turned into work periods when he lacked reasons to leave the house: through the online ventures Cheggers’ Bingo and Cheggers’ Bedroom. Such post-modern projects only worked, though, for viewers who had grown up watching him. He had first entertained the young, while a child himself, in movies made by the Children’s Film Foundation, an outfit, funded by a tax levy, that made short U-certificate movies for the once-common Saturday morning cinema bills that Chegwin’s main TV career later swept away. When his wide, smiley face was spotted by TV casting directors, his prepubescent years included walk-on roles in two famous sit coms, The Liver Birds and Open All Hours, playing in the latter “boy with lolly” in the shop of Ronnie Barker’s stammering vendor. Those clips did repeated service on shows of the Before They Were Famous type, after Chegwin became a Saturday morning superstar. Multi-Coloured Swap Shop had started as a solution to a BBC budget problem. The cost of sending an outside broadcast unit to cover a single Saturday afternoon sporting event was considered prohibitive. To spread expenditure, someone came up with the idea of a live children’s broadcast earlier in the day from the city hosting the football or rugby. This became the “Swaporama”, in which thousands of local schoolchildren exchanged unwanted possessions for wanted ones. From wherever he was based each week, Cheggers bantered back and forth with main studio presenter, Noel Edmonds, and the co-hosts John Craven and Maggie Philbin. Chegwin and Philbin married in 1982. Coming a year after the Prince of Wales had wed Lady Diana Spencer, the nuptials could be seen as a juvenile equivalent of the royal “wedding of the century”. Whereas the earlier couple had to find space in the schedules for coverage of their wedding, this one conveniently already had their own show, which devoted the morning of the Saturday ceremony to the build-up. Edmonds and Craven wore morning dress on screen in preparation. Sadly, both televised unions lasted for for only just over a decade, with Keith and Maggie announcing their separation in 1993, a year after Charles and Diana did the same. The previous year Chegwin had admitted to being an alcoholic. For a man who had got married on BBC1, it perhaps felt entirely natural to make this confession live on television, sitting on the guest sofa opposite Richard Madeley and Judy Finnegan on ITV’s This Morning. Only 35 at the time, Chegwin seemed to have come to a stop at an age horribly young in most professions except professional sport. But he gradually rebuilt his CV, through hard work and a willingness to risk being laughed at, with Naked perhaps the only grievous miscalculation. That he was still well-remembered at the time of his death – and with such fondness – was a mark of the extent to which a well-loved children’s presenter becomes almost a family member to viewers."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2017/dec/12/nobody-cares-about-us-britons-living-in-rest-of-eu-british-brexit-future","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-12T08:00:28Z","webTitle":"'Nobody cares about us': Britons living in rest of EU voice their dismay","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/dec/12/nobody-cares-about-us-britons-living-in-rest-of-eu-british-brexit-future","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/dec/12/nobody-cares-about-us-britons-living-in-rest-of-eu-british-brexit-future","fields":{"headline":"'Nobody cares about us': Britons living in rest of EU voice their dismay","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"‘I am still not sure if myself and my children will be landlocked’ Kate, 49, project manager, has lived in the Netherlands for 17 years. I am still not sure whether myself and my children will be landlocked or will be able to live our lives as we did before the vote. I only hope we can continue to plan and have the same aspirations as any other EU citizen in the EU. My children will probably get Dutch citizenship: I think that is a good thing as they would have so many rights and benefits as EU citizens. I have worked so much abroad, and always in a very international environment, though I’m not fluent in Dutch yet. We were thinking of moving near Maastricht in a few years and it was definitely on our radar to move to Germany as I have to cross borders to Germany, Poland and France all the time for my work. Now we don’t know if we can do that. Will I need to get visas? The latest agreement means nothing has changed; we British citizens feel the least cared for group in the negotiations as nobody cares about us – not like the EU cares for EU nationals. ‘We are being ignored’ Ken Wood, 68, retired, has lived in France for four years. I feel, like many, that we are being ignored. Agreements made regarding continuation of pension and health arrangements were only achieved because of EU pressure regarding their own citizens resident in the UK. Had that not happened I suspect we would have been given far worse status, possibly as bad as those who receive no pension uprating and no health cover. There is still no clarity as to our overall status, from both a UK and EU perspective. Within the EU, it almost seems that different member states will decide their own attitude towards us. My primary concern is to our long-term status, particularly if my wife and I (she’s a Chinese citizen with a UK passport) wish to return to the UK in the future. The present government’s treatment of EU citizens in the UK leads one to suspect that immigration policy supersedes any other consideration. ‘We both wished to remain EU citizens so the only step left was to vote with our feet’ Rebecca, 27, photographic agent, has lived in Germany for 14 months. We’ve been in a state of high alert since the Brexit process started, and while this agreement promises us a right to stay, it provides little to no detail and our rights are still going to be removed. My partner (also British) and I moved to Berlin as soon as we could after the Brexit vote: we both wished to remain EU citizens so the only step left was to vote with our feet. Having studied in Berlin on an Erasmus year and being fluent in German, it was the speeding up of an inevitable move anyway. The latest agreement promises our right to stay now that we are here, but gives no detail as to how we will travel the EU, how we might work across borders and what our visa status will specifically be. As it stands, I’m still planning on applying for German citizenship as soon as I’m eligible in seven years’ time and will hope to regain my EU citizenship. We have different work situations (my boyfriend works freelance) and we are now looking into marrying to guarantee that, worst comes to worst, we stay together: not quite the romantic dream we’d always planned. ‘Our situation is different to those losing a right they’re not currently using’ Lloyd Stiles, 39, teacher, has lived in Austria for about 10 years. I won’t trust anything until a final deal is made, but my biggest hope is that the freedom of movement I’ve used all my adult life is not taken away from me and my daughter. Those of us already using it and want to keep it should be allowed to do so: I’d love it if they created a special EU passport for Brits like me so I can keep access to both the UK and the EU because, like it or not, our situation is much different to those losing a right they’re not currently using. My biggest fear is that Austria decides that my wife (who is a US citizen) won’t have her visa renewed in a few years’ time because she would no longer be married to an EU citizen, meaning I either have to become an Austrian (and possibly have issues going back to the UK) or worse, be forced to move to either the UK or US, which we deliberately chose to leave in the first place. ‘I may be forced to apply for Greek citizenship’ Valerie, 53, teacher, has lived in Greece for 20 years. We’re a British family with two kids who have grown up here – initially having moved to Greece because of my husband’s job in aquaculture. We currently feel in limbo. I’m not sure why I should be penalised for making a contribution to British influence abroad (I teach in a British curriculum school where 99% of pupils head to the UK for further education!). I don’t want to apply for Greek citizenship as none of us in the family are Greek, but I may be forced to in order to keep on working here without work permits etc. My two children will not now be able to live and work in Europe as I have been able to do, despite being born and raised as Europeans and learning the language. Many British teachers in Europe are probably long-term residents of their host country: Brexit is not a great advert for British education abroad and I’m generally not very optimistic about the future. ‘I don’t trust what the media or politicians are claiming’ Daniel Yeo, 27, freelancer; former civil servant, has lived in France for two years. I was a second generation immigrant to the UK (I have Malaysian-Chinese parents) and we (myself my wife and our child) are now first generation immigrants to France, having moved for a better quality of life. We should be reassured, but I don’t think lots of the news coming from the negotiations means anything until it’s all agreed. It’s really hard to know what’s actually going to happen – I don’t trust what the media or politicians are claiming. The reality of the negotiations is so much more complex."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2017/dec/17/hayley-squires-i-used-to-argue-with-everyone","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-17T08:00:25Z","webTitle":"Hayley Squires: ‘I used to argue with everyone’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/dec/17/hayley-squires-i-used-to-argue-with-everyone","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2017/dec/17/hayley-squires-i-used-to-argue-with-everyone","fields":{"headline":"Hayley Squires: ‘I used to argue with everyone’","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"A couple of years ago, Hayley Squires decided to get a new tattoo. “I’d been romantically involved with somebody for a little while, and it had driven me a bit nuts,” she explains. “Then he was out of my life, and it was coming up to my birthday.” She kept thinking up various symbols and signs that might mean something, but nothing rang true. Then she remembered this line. It’s a quote from A Midsummer Night’s Dream, and it’s tucked nearly underneath the crook of her left arm. It reads: “And though she be but little, she is fierce.” Squires, 29, is both of those things. She’s also direct, talks a lot, and quickly, and is a genuine laugh, despite her talent for plumbing the depths of despair in the Ken Loach film, I, Daniel Blake. When we meet, she’s wearing a Tupac T-shirt – one of four Tupac T-shirts she owns – and a pilot’s jacket, which she bought because it looked a bit like the one Tom Hardy wears in the film Dunkirk. “Because I’ve got a bit of an obsession with him, I walked into Topshop and saw it and thought: ‘Ahhh!’” she says, smiling. She’s about to star in The Miniaturist, a gorgeous three-part BBC adaptation of Jessie Burton’s bestselling novel, though she almost decided not to go for it at all. “My agent told me: ‘It’s for the part of Cornelia, and she’s the maid.’ And I went: ‘No. I don’t want to.’ She said: ‘Just read the script.’ I read all three scripts in one night, and rung her and said: ‘I really want to go in for this.’ Because, you know, she’s the servant and she’s the lady-in-waiting and all of that, but it was so much more.” Why was she reluctant to play the maid? “It’s the age old…” she begins, stops, then sighs. Squires grew up on a council estate, and that, combined with I, Daniel Blake, has propelled her into a role as a sort of spokesperson on class, and particularly on being a working-class actor. She’s both happy to take that on, and weary of the necessity for it. “It’s to do with class, again – like everything in this country is to do with class, one way or the other,” she explains. “And so I did sort of go, is it going to be underwritten? Is it going to be clichéd? Is it going to be a stereotype? I hadn’t read the book, and I called my friend who had, and she said: ‘It’s an amazing part.’ It also taught me a lesson: not to have such a chip on my shoulder.” Still, you can see why her instinctive reaction might be to say no. In I, Daniel Blake, she played Katie, a single mother of two kids who is moved to Newcastle and driven to starvation by the punitive bureaucracy of the benefits system. In one of the film’s most memorable scenes Katie goes to a food bank and is so hungry she opens a tin of beans on the spot and starts to eat them, cold, before breaking down, embarrassed and distraught at what she’s been driven to. While promoting the film, Squires found herself on the sofa at This Morning to talk about austerity Britain. “That was such a car crash,” she whispers, her eyes widening. The interview is on YouTube. It’s fine and friendly but, towards the end, the presenter Phillip Schofield expresses mild astonishment that politicians are being told to watch I, Daniel Blake in order to learn about the real world. “The Tories certainly don’t [need to], they’re more than aware of the system they put in place,” Squires declares. “Well, all parties,” Schofield interrupts, hastily talking over her. “We can’t be biased on that one.” “Nobody had said to me, don’t mention the Tories,” she says, half-amused, half-cringing at the memory. “But I’d had a great honest conversation with the producer and I thought, brilliant, they’re doing something about food banks. Why are you talking about food banks existing, if you don’t talk about why they exist? It’s like pouring water into a boat that’s leaking. There’s no point in me giving the information about what we need to do to help, when you’re not talking about the root cause of it.” Squires grew up in Forest Hill, southeast London, with her mum, dad and brother. When she was 14, they relocated to Sittingbourne in Kent. It was a difficult age to move. “It was trouble,” she says. Her brother is 18 months older, so he looked after her a bit at school, but it sounds like a difficult time. “People don’t believe it, but I was very, very shy.” Eventually, she was moved up an academic band and, in Year 10, started to do drama. “Then it became very sociable, because you do plays after school and all the rest of it, so I came out of myself much more and had found my group and had found my people.” She set about applying to drama schools, got into Rose Bruford College when she was 18, but took a gap year to work and save money, though she spent most of it on clubbing. “It was at that time when Sean Paul first came out, the early 2000s, a good, decent wave of R&amp;B and hip-hop.” She loved drama school, for the most part. “There were a lot of frustrations in the third year and I grew a little bit tired and a little bit jaded,” she says. “But I also wanted to argue with everyone when I was in my third year of drama school.” About what? “Life! Anything I could argue about! Absolutely anything. You know when you get to that point in your 20s where you feel like everything’s a battle? I didn’t have any patience with anything. Everyone used to say to me, just calm down.” What was it that finally made that stick? “It was probably relationships that taught me that, to be honest. It was relationships that had an impact, that gave me a bit of calm.” Romantic ones? “Bit of both, romantic and friendships. Romantic relationships, mainly – I look back now and go: ‘If you’d been a little bit calmer, that wouldn’t have played out like that.’ Also it’s a little bit in my nature. It’s not aggression, it’s a care. It’s a care for things.” That’s why she doesn’t mind being asked about class all the time, really. “It’s an important conversation to have,” she says, carefully. “But I get to the point of such frustration with it. I mean, I get frustrated with it, and my God, I’m not a black actor trying to work in this industry. One of my very good friends, Daniel Kaluuya, was working from the age of 18, and went through so many struggles just to be cast as not ‘the black man’, but the leading man. And then he made a film about race and now people are putting him in Marvel films which is bloody brilliant and is right. But it gets to the point where you just go: ‘Why can’t it be down to how good we are at our jobs?’ It shouldn’t just be about the way I sound when I open my mouth.” Before she got the part of Katie in I, Daniel Blake, she was acting, but inconsistently. She’d been in Call the Midwife, and in the drama Southcliffe in 2013, but was mostly working in an office in London to get by, and writing plays. “Any time I went for an audition or to do a job, there was a ‘major family crisis’. And I had to have time off work. So bad!” she laughs. “They thought I came from a very difficult family where everybody kept dying.” Eventually, she gave herself a cut-off point for the office job; it coincided, roughly, with Ken Loach getting in touch. I, Daniel Blake won the Palme D’Or and Squires got to take her mother to Cannes. For the first time in seven years, she’s been working without a break. When we speak, her “brain is fried” from a 12-week run in the West End, where she had a scene-stealing turn as the glitzy, ditsy and vicious Mae in Cat on a Hot Tin Roof, alongside Sienna Miller and Jack O’Connell. She’s finished with The Miniaturist, which looks set to be one of the BBC’s big festive showpieces, and she’s about to star in the new film by Peter Strickland. “On paper it’s about a haunted dress that gets passed to different people, and their life then goes into a spiral, but it’s actually about longing and desire and relationships and how you feel in your own body. It’s bloody brilliant.” Squires is also getting back to writing, working on a film about three generations of working-class women in Kent. “It’s about feminism in the women I grew up with, and the idea that feminism is lacking in their world, because they haven’t got the education for it, but actually it manifests itself in different ways. The middle woman, who is my age, makes money through bare-knuckle fighting,” she explains, excitedly. Little, and fierce, indeed.

As a reader, you might subconsciously pick up on rhythms. Sometimes you will notice a sharp phrase or two, a rhetorical flourish, perhaps the odd bit of alliteration and assonance. If you let him, Will Self might bash you over the head with his dictionary. But, on the whole, it’s what the words do that matters, rather than what they are. You focus on the broader picture, not the pigment and paint, even if you can also appreciate the colours. Attrib. is different. Right from the start, Williams isolates and focuses on single words. Here’s the opening: “The plot of this is not and will not be obvious. I’m pretending that this is not important. It is quite likely that I have lost it anyway. The plot.” She lasers in on individual words. Highlights them. Spins them around and serves them up again: “And - You should never start sentences like that, I know, but what’s a sentence really if not time spent alone –” Here, I want to pause to emphasise how much fun her use of language provides.. How it works on so many levels, as well as feeling profound. Sometimes Williams also presents a familiar word in a pleasingly unexpected context, like: “There’s a bird in the tree outside your window and it was shouting at your house.” Shouting! I can’t think of many books that’s made me think about language in quite the same way. There is the famous Fry and Laurie sketch about the “flexibility of language and linguistic elasticity, if you like.” The hilarity of their attack on the obsessively wordy shows the risks in Williams’s approach - and how well she has done to avoid absurdity. Williams gets away with it. Her writing rarely feels too mannered. She can pause on a word and make it feel like an addition, rather than an interruption. The continuous wordplay in Attrib. is more than just a linguistic game: it’s also a way of thinking about the world. This is a book that looks harder and deeper at everything around us, and Williams has an eye for details that we tend to take for granted: “Staring down into it, you can see that the grille of a microphone contains endless darkness.” So it does! When Williams does deliberately and self-consciously interrupt herself, the results can feel important and even tender. In a story called Alight at the Next she stops a long flowing thought about standing close to a significant “you” riding on the London tube, thinking about another passenger’s horrible tie, comparing herself and you to Bonnie and Clyde and also having a “whisky” slid down across a bar in the tube carriage (long story). The interruption is separated off by a dash, a line break and parentheses, so there’s no doubting that it’s a significant pause. But it’s one that also provides new momentum: “(this thought breaks down when I remember I don’t like whiskey spelt with an e or without) (this Bonnie and Clyde metaphor breaks down too when I remember that the real life Clyde, in jail, in order to get out of breaking rocks, took a spade and cut off some of his own toes) (I would not want you to have a toeless lover) (I want you to have a lover who can stop this man in his suit and tie) (I want you to have a lover who is not embarrassed to say the word lover in a carriage filled with tired, final-round West Londoners)” In the story, the narrator is desperate to invite the you of the story home with her, but unable to articulate it fast enough before her stop approaches. She can’t overcome the other distractions in the carriage, can’t pluck up courage. And so Williams’s way of revolving around things, turning the words over, veering in and out of introspection, adds to the anxiety and longing in the story. These apparent digressions reveal the soul of the story. They carry emotional and dramatic power. It’s all very clever – but it’s also more than that.

Hearing this, you wondered: why now? The fronting-up, the ballsiness, the stick-it–to-them bravado. Where was all this an hour and a half ago when the score was 0-0 and there was still a match to be won? At which point, with the day still wide open and the spoils there to be claimed, Mourinho’s men didn’t go banging on anyone’s door. Instead the players of Manchester United coiled back in their own half like a red-shirted draught excluder, abasing themselves in this grand old stadium before the perceived – and conceded – superiority of their opponents Given his tactics a more consistent approach from Mourinho, hearing the music through the wall, would have been to go in and offer to turn the volume up, to sway along like a wallflower at the edge of the dance-floor, to add a whoop or two of his own. Taking the fight to City then just seemed a little sad, like stumbling back in though the door shouting and-another-thing half an hour after losing the argument. Not that Mourinho will spend a second of his time feeling any regrets about this. United’s manager is nothing if not furiously resilient and bulletproof in his self-regard. Alex Ferguson was the same. This is how successful people keep on winning. No doubt in Mourinho’s mind the fracas was a matter of necessary resistance, evidence of enduring life, a sign that the war is still on, no matter how grave the loss on the battlefield. As for the fracas itself, no doubt more details will emerge in the next few days. The worst of it so far is the facial injury suffered by Mikel Arteta. If it was indeed Romelu Lukaku who struck Arteta with a bottle, as some reports suggest, Arteta can at least console himself with the certainty Lukaku was probably aiming for Pep Guardiola at the time. Otherwise a little milk has been thrown. Some pushing and shoving has taken place, an argument in Portuguese been pursued. There will be a temptation for some to raise a perfumed handkerchief to the nose, to make shrill noises about someone, somewhere, thinking of the children; and to frame this as yet another story about footballers setting a terrible example by acting like average, flawed human beings in a moment of extreme stress and tension. In reality none of this adds up to much more than a small hill of beans. Football is a painful, passionate thing, just as all team sports bring out a fairly basic range of emotions. After two hours in the public lens it is unsurprising even elite level footballers might lose control now and then. Acts of aggression must be discouraged. But there is still, whisper it, something secretly heartening about the fact these actors in our drama feel the moment so strongly, that there is something real at the bottom of all the froth. This is, at least, the exact opposite of swapping shirts at half-time. When it comes to matters of fault and protocol there are two things worth saying. First, Mourinho does have a point. There is a code of behaviour. Teams know exactly what they’re doing when they whoop and shout and gloat. Back in the more savage 1980s Wimbledon would shout and yell and play music through the walls as a deliberate provocation pre- and post-match. City knew who was listening. That they didn’t particularly care speaks volumes of relations between the teams. As for Arteta, he has form in this regard. The otherwise placid Lionel Messi told City’s assistant coach where to stick it as Arteta celebrated wildly on the touchline after City’s defeat of Barcelona at the Etihad last year. Presumably Messi, who has been playing this game for a while now, will feel on some level Arteta got what was coming to him. But then this kind of aggressive public celebration is a relatively new thing. Jürgen Klopp has annoyed managers and players with his relentless cheerleading, the kind of yowling and yelping that would look unseemly – and end very badly – in the average Sunday league match. Mourinho was moved to grasp Antonio Conte by the elbow at the end of Chelsea’s 4-0 defeat of Manchester United last season and whisper about decorum and respect. All of which makes Mourinho’s actions on Sunday more interesting, if only because his entire career is based on a lack of respect, its best moments a monument to triumphant iconoclasm. No other manager has ever “played the occasion” with such relish, has disregarded all normal rules of basic human courtesy and etiquette with such relish in pursuit of his own toxic theatre. This is the same Mourinho who announced himself with that thrillingly look-at-me sprint down the Old Trafford touchline when he was Porto manager. The same Mourinho who ran across the Camp Nou turf waggling his arms around after Inter beat Barcelona in 2010, prompting Víctor Valdés to stop him and demand exactly this – more respect, more restraint. The same Mourinho who celebrated ending Liverpool’s title challenge at Anfield in 2014 by leaping about on the touchline and gesturing violently toward the away end. This is not a criticism. This version of Mourinho is the best version, the most successful version, the version that has been so captivating (and so captivatingly awful at times). Plus of course there is the football element. Too much respect on the pitch, too much courtesy, too little in the way of whooping and dancing and turning up the volume: this has been Mourinho’s problem in key matches so far at Manchester United. This is a question of degree. There is also something thrilling about throttling an opponent, or counterpunching your way to victory. It is true that United did start to attack at Old Trafford once they had gone behind. But by then the initiative had been conceded. Mourinho had picked a team full of attacking talent, raising hopes United might counterattack with the same high-pressing energy that had so confused Arsenal at the Emirates. Instead Anthony Martial spent the opening 20 minutes as an auxiliary right-back. The weak points in Manchester City’s team – a defence containing two jobbing central midfielders, the physical travails of Vincent Kompany – went untested until United were chasing the game. Chelsea’s pairing with Barcelona in the Champions League last 16 on Monday morning was a reminder of perhaps the most thrilling Mourinho game in England, the 4-2 defeat of the same opponents at Stamford Bridge that saw Chelsea launch a blitz attack at the start, scoring three times in the opening 19 minutes. Mourinho seems to have either lost interest in showing such adventure against the stronger teams, or to lack any real trust in his current squad. Unfairly perhaps. Kevin De Bruyne and David Silva are not Messi and Xavi. Man for man United’s players must feel they have the ability to engage this Manchester City team in an actual game of football at Old Trafford. It is hard not to see the tunnel fracas and the slightly jarring demands for more and greater respect as something more, a case of the great iconoclast feeling the sting of his own methods. Not to mention a desperately overdue response from a manager who had spent the last two hours offering too much of that same commodity – respect – to United’s arch city rivals on the pitch. • Sign up to our weekly email, The Recap, here, showcasing a selection of our sport features from the past seven days."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"science/live/2018/feb/06/spacex-falcon-heavy-launch-elon-musk-live-updates","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-06T22:33:18Z","webTitle":"Falcon Heavy, world's most powerful rocket, launches – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/live/2018/feb/06/spacex-falcon-heavy-launch-elon-musk-live-updates","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/live/2018/feb/06/spacex-falcon-heavy-launch-elon-musk-live-updates","fields":{"headline":"Falcon Heavy, world's most powerful rocket, launches – as it happened","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"We’re going to close our live coverage of the historic Falcon Heavy launch with a summary of the afternoon’s events. Through a waterfall of cascading fire and smoke, SpaceX successfully launched its first Falcon Heavy, the most powerful rocket in operation anywhere in the world, and second only in strength to the Apollo-era leviathans that took crews to the moon. The company then successfully separated its three rocket boosters, and landed two in a ballet of controlled burns. They landed onto parallel launchpads near where they took off in Cape Canaveral, Florida. The third booster was unaccounted for by the company. It was meant to land on a droneship in the Atlantic ocean, but the company did not explain its fate after a camera feed cut out from the vibrations of the rocket. Billionaire founder Elon Musk successfully launched one of his Tesla Roadsters on a course toward Mars. He revealed surreal live video feeds of the car cruising around the planet, complete with a “Don’t Panic” dashboard message, a dummy astronaut in the driver’s seat, and David Bowie on the radio. The success is a major step toward cheaper, more frequent spaceflight, making it easier for governments and businesses to lift massive projects into space or set off on deep space missions. SpaceX’s Falcon Heavy is estimated to cost $90m per launch; Nasa’s planned SLS rocket, a comparable system, is expected to cost about $1bn per flight. The car continues its surreal path around the planet, somewhere distant above an entire continent. Still no word from Musk or SpaceX about what happened to the core rocket booster, however. Their long silence suggests it did not land as planned on a ship in the Atlantic, but likely crashed into the sea. Two former astronauts (one a sitting senator) and Nasa’s acting administrator tweet their congratulations to SpaceX. Senator Bill Nelson spoke with reporters shortly after the launch, too, saying, “we’re going to Mars!” There is a car with a dummy in it circling the Earth. This is real. You can watch the car on its journey on the live stream below. SpaceX has started a live stream of its “starman” – the dummy in the Tesla Roadster cruising toward Mars. If you rewind to about the five-minute mark, you can catch a spectacular view of Earth. Musk tweets the highlight clip. Elon Musk has tweeted out an update on the upper stage – his Tesla Roadster is cruising through high-energy radiation belts circling the Earth, toward deep space. The projected path of the car would bring it close to Mars, but Musk has said there is only an “extremely tiny” chance that it might crash into the planet. If it stays on course, it would instead drift through space, potentially for millions of years. Reporting from Cape Canaveral, Richard Luscombe has spoken with fellow spectators – most in some stage of frazzled awe at the launch they just witnessed. Sean Clark and his six-year-old daughter Maia watched the Falcon Heavy power into Florida’s clear blue skies, listened to the double sonic boom as the rocket’s boosters returned to Earth, and declared themselves stunned. “It’s just wow,” said Mr Clark, who got Maia up before dawn to drive across Florida from Newport Richey to watch the launch at the space centre. “It’s a whole new generation of kids getting excited about space. This is her third launch, she’s into space and science and I wanted to keep that interest going for the future. I came here for her future. It’s just amazing what Elon Musk has done and is doing.” Cindy and Patrick Salkeld came from California to watch their first rocket launch. “It was was overwhelming, better than expected, unbelievable. We couldn’t just see it, we could hear it and feel it vibrating the ground. It was emotional,” said Mrs Salkeld. Elon Musk, her husband said, was “brilliant”. “It’s incredible that not only did he get that rocket up there, but then he lands those two pieces right back on the ground upright, right on the circle. How on earth do you do that, it was spectacular.” Nearby were other reporters, including Miriam Kramer for Mashable. She filmed the launch, capturing the liftoff’s roar. It’s palpable. There’s still a mystery about the core rocket booster: it was supposed to land on SpaceX’s drone ship in the Atlantic, but smoke obscured the camera and then the feed cut out from vibrations on the deck. Space Twitter is concerned. Some photos to tide us over. It’s difficult to overstate what SpaceX has just accomplished: it’s successfully introduced a new heavy rocket to the world, the most powerful in operation and second only to the Apollo era, all through a private company and at a fraction of a cost of other systems currently in construction. Nasa is working on its own heavy launch system, called the SLS, but it is estimated to cost about a billion dollars per flight. SpaceX estimates that Falcon Heavy launches will cost about $90m per flight. What’s more, just a few years ago the notion of re-landing reusable rockets seemed like a pipe dream, and yet SpaceX has made it routine, with regular landings on land and on a drone ship floating in the Atlantic Ocean. Today it managed to land two Falcon 9 rockets simultaneously, each dropping gracefully from the sky with a controlled burn. Meanwhile, sitting in a tin can far above the earth, nothing he can do, a dummy driver in a Tesla Roadster. An earlier photograph from inside the rocket revealed that the words “DON’T PANIC” on the dashboard computer. In a surreal, beautiful image straight out of science fiction, the twin Falcon 9 boosters landing at Cape Canaveral in Florida, after a flawless test launch of the most powerful rocket in operation. The drone ship is obscured in smoke and the camera cuts out thanks to vibrations from the landing burn. But SpaceX is suggesting that this doesn’t mean anything’s amiss. Pending confirmation of landing. Here’s another couple shots of that synchronized landing form the other two boosters: Landing burn is on track for the two landing pads at Cape Canaveral – perfect landings. The two Falcon 9s have landed. One more is due for a barge ship in the Atlantic. The side boosters are now re-entering the atmosphere as they plummet back toward the Earth – a landing process that engineers have compared to trying to balance a building-sized broom on a table in wind. Another angle on the Roadster. A billionaire has sent a car into space on a route toward Mars on the most second-most powerful rocket humans have ever designed. In the last moments before launch Musk revealed interior cameras on the payload, and it pays off now: his car is in outer space. Life on Mars is now playing at the SpaceX launch center. The Tesla Roadster is on course in outer space for an orbit near the planet. Side boosters separate successfully! Each of them is a modified Falcon 9 rocket – the smaller reusable kind – and they’re now going to attempt to land at three different sites back on Earth. Engine performance is nominal, and a cascade of fire is pouring out of the rockets boosters. The photographs are spectacular. The Falcon 9 is away and clear, supersonic and casting upwards through the atmosphere. A successful launch! Billowing smoke, a blast of fire, and the rocket is up! The rocket is shrouded in steam and mist, T-minus 30 seconds, a huge cheer. The rocket is on internal power. T-minus one. T-minus two minutes. Occasionally you can hear spectators, reporters, and engineers clap or make a nervous whoop. Stage-two lock is complete. The rocket is almost ready to launch. T-minus five. Musk tweets out images from inside the payload. (On Instagram, so screengrabs via Twitter below.) T-minus 10 minutes to launch. SpaceX has kicked off its live webcast (linked above), and warned that if any problems come up in the final few minutes, they’ll scrub the launch and try again tomorrow. But with only a few minutes to go, the sky is clearing and the weather balloon is not reporting problematic winds. Stage 2 Kerosene loading just finished on the rocket. The 3.45pm launch target is still on course. Elon Musk has clicked the “holy mouse click”. But looming at this launch is a question: What if the rocket explodes? If the Falcon Heavy flies high enough above the Cape Canaveral so that an explosion doesn’t damage the launchpad – and then it explodes – Elon Musk has said he would call the day a success. He estimated the chances of a fully successful launch, from takeoff through separations and landing, at somewhere around 50.50. Not only is SpaceX testing its new rocket, but also a system to separate side boosters in flight, and to simultaneously land the three main boosters after separation. The rocket will have to reach a high altitude to spare the base: its fuel has the explosive equivalent of four million pounds of TNT, Musk told reporters on Monday. An explosion on the pad would cause massive damage. In September 2016, a smaller Falcon 9 exploded on a separate launch zone at Cape Canaveral, forcing it closed for repairs for over a year afterward. A Falcon Heavy explosion at the 39A launchpad could require closure and repairs for nine months to a year, Musk said. Less than an hour to go, the crowds are ready, Richard Luscombe reports. With less than 40 minutes to go until the scheduled lift-off, spectators at the Kennedy Space Centre have already taken their seats, with a warning from Jeff Lucas, a Nasa communications staffer and compere of the viewing party at the Saturn V Centre. “If it goes, don’t clap,” he said. “I’m not a Debbie Downer, but on a couple of occasions before we would have 3,000 of you doing the countdown, then when we’re all screaming the numbers we can’t hear the launch director going ‘Hold, Hold, Hold!’ “So don’t clap until you see those orange flames clearing the tower.” The boosters are fueled, less than an hour till they’re scheduled to fire, the explosive culmination of a billionaire’s ambitions years in the making. Elon Musk’s has wanted to revolutionize spaceflight for over a decade, and the Falcon Heavy is central to realizing his dreams. If SpaceX can manage a successful launch, the Heavy will be the most powerful rocket currently in operation anywhere in the world. Its boosters – modified reusable rockets, bolted together – can provide five million pounds of thrust and move 140,000lb of cargo into low earth orbit. The rocket could help build a new space station above the moon, carry new telecom or spy satellites, and shuttle people to deep space destinations. Last February SpaceX said it intends to send two private citizens on a trip around the moon, possibly as soon as this year. Most importantly for SpaceX, the rocket would be vastly cheaper than government alternatives. Nasa is working on its own heavy rocket, called the Space Launch System, which remains untested and is projected to cost around $1bn per flight. The Falcon Heavy would cost less than a tenth of that, at $90m per flight. SpaceX has already turned its Falcon 9 reusable rockets into a reliable business for the government and private flights. Only three years ago, no company or space agency had ever landed a spaceflight rocket before. Then another private company owned by another billionaire, Jeff Bezos, landed a smaller rocket on land, and not long afterward SpaceX succeeded in landing a Falcon 9 on a barge in the Atlantic Ocean. Richard Luscombe is in Cape Canaveral to watch the launch – the rocket is being fueled on schedule for a targeted 3.45pm launch, after hours of delay. Hundreds of thousands of eager spectators have packed the beaches and other decent vantage points around Florida’s space coast in anticipation of what promises to be the most spectacular rocket launch since Nasa’s space shuttle fleet was retired in 2011. At the Kennedy Space Centre, there is a party atmosphere at the Saturn V visitor centre just 3.9 miles from the Falcon Heavy launchpad, where visitors paid $195 per ticket for a prime viewing site. Spectators sheltered in the bleachers from the Florida sun under sunhats and umbrellas, drinking beer and champagne and eating sandwiches and fried chicken as they await the launch. There are also long lines at the souvenir stand for T-shirts and mission patches, while cheers greet any announcement from launch control over the loudspeakers, even news of delays, all prolonging the party. Nobody seemed to mind that SpaceX put back the originally scheduled launch time of 1.30pm until 3.45pm because of strong winds in the upper atmosphere. Children whose parents allowed them to miss school for the day are passing the time by building rockets from sets of Lego laid out for them on the lawn. “Watching a rocket launch is almost a bucket-list thing for a lot of people, and the causeways are always packed for any kind of launch. But this one’s going to be big,” said Dale Ketcham, a senior manager at Space Florida, the state agency that promotes the aerospace industry. Hello and welcome to our live coverage of the first ever launch of the Falcon Heavy rocket, a gigantic new rocket from the private spaceflight company SpaceX, which hopes to use it for missions to the moon, Mars and other deep space ventures. SpaceX has set a launch time for 3.45pm eastern – a slim 15-minute window to 4pm, at which point the company will cancel launch and try again Wednesday. The company already delayed for over three hours today, citing high winds. The rocket’s payload is a Tesla Roadster owned by Elon Musk, the billionaire founder of both the automaker and SpaceX. The rocket will launch the car on a course to approach Mars, playing David Bowie’s Space Oddity on a loop. Musk’s aspirations for the Falcon Heavy are less whimsical, if still ambitious. The next generation rocket, should it succeed, will be the second-most powerful ever after the Nasa’s Saturn V, which the space agency used in the Apollo moon missions. Along with the company’s Falcon 9 rocket, which has become a reliable, reusable rocket that lands after launch, the Falcon Heavy is central to Musk’s hope of making spaceflight cheaper and easier for governments, businesses, scientists and, someday, citizens. But the rocket has to get off the pad first. SpaceX rockets have exploded before, most destructively in September 2016, forcing extensive launchpad repairs. And it took many failed landings before SpaceX managed to stand one of its reusable rockets upright after flight. If the launch succeeds, SpaceX will then attempt to land its three first-stage rocket boosters, which are essentially modified Falcon 9s. Two will return to landing zones at Cape Canaveral, and one would fly to a barge in the Atlantic that the company uses as an additional landing pad. Musk has downplayed expectations for Tuesday’s launch. “There is so much that can go wrong,” he told reporters on Monday. “We don’t want to set expectations of perfection.” “The weather’s looking good, the rocket’s looking good. It’s going to be exciting one way or the other, it’s either going to be an exciting test or an exciting failure – one big boom.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2017/dec/17/sundays-best-tv-sports-personality-of-the-year-2017-the-apprentice-final-the-alternativity","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-17T06:00:23Z","webTitle":"Sunday's best TV: Sports Personality of the Year 2017; The Apprentice final; The Alternativity","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/dec/17/sundays-best-tv-sports-personality-of-the-year-2017-the-apprentice-final-the-alternativity","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2017/dec/17/sundays-best-tv-sports-personality-of-the-year-2017-the-apprentice-final-the-alternativity","fields":{"headline":"Sunday's best TV: Sports Personality of the Year 2017; The Apprentice final; The Alternativity","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Sports Personality of the Year 2017 6.45pm, BBC One SPOTY used to be an annual TV highlight, back when it was a recap of actual footage rather than the meddlesome mess of graphics, spoken-word doggerel and laboured comedy bits it is today.

Four fire engines were called to a street in Walkden, Greater Manchester, after the fire broke out at the house at about 5am on Monday. A 14-year-old girl was declared dead at the scene and an eight-year-old boy and seven-year-old girl died in hospital. A three-year-old girl was said to be in a critical condition on Monday afternoon, while a woman, 35, who is understood to be the children’s mother, was in a serious condition. Police are yet to formally identify the victims, but the mother and her 14-year-old daughter have been named locally as Michelle Pearson, 35, and Demi Pearson. Drew Povey, the headteacher at Harrop Fold school in Little Hulton, where Demi was a pupil, said: “We are devastated at the tragic loss of life today in our community. Our thoughts and prayers are with the family involved.” Greater Manchester police said they had arrested three men, aged 23, 20 and 18, and a 20-year-old woman on Monday on suspicion of murder. A 24-year-old man is also being questioned in custody on suspicion of assisting an offender. Police had previously urged a murder suspect to hand himself in, saying there was “an active manhunt” to find an individual who they did not name. “All I would say is he knows who he is and he should give himself up immediately,” said Ch Supt Wayne Miller. “I would ask that person to do the right thing.” Authorities confirmed there were seven people in the house when the fire broke out and that two 16-year-old boys escaped as walking wounded. One of the boys is understood to be a family member and the second a friend. “In what is such a heartbreaking set of circumstances, we have been doing our very best to support the family in every way that we can and carry out our inquiries quickly and sensitively,” said Miller. On Monday afternoon, the Manchester Evening News reported that police were investigating the possibility that a flammable liquid had been poured through the letterbox of the mid-terrace house. It was also reported that police had been called to a separate incident at the property at about 2am, three hours before the fire. Greater Manchester police confirmed that it had referred itself to the Independent Police Complaints Commission, as is standard practice after someone dies after contact with the police. The scene of the fire on Jackson Street was cordoned off on Monday, with a metal police barrier at one end of the street. The red brick mid-terrace house could be seen with burned-out windows, and forensics officers were working inside for most of the day. Neighbours reported having been woken by sirens in the small hours of the morning. Speaking to reporters earlier on Monday, Miller said: “I want to describe what this incident is. It’s the murder, using fire, of three children and we have a three-year-old girl fighting for her life who is seriously ill. This will devastate this family forever and words cannot describe what they are going through. We need the public’s help to find the answers the family deserve.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2017/dec/12/jeremy-hunt-launches-opt-out-organ-donation-plans-in-england-and-wales","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-12T06:01:25Z","webTitle":"Jeremy Hunt launches opt-out organ donation plans in England","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/dec/12/jeremy-hunt-launches-opt-out-organ-donation-plans-in-england-and-wales","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2017/dec/12/jeremy-hunt-launches-opt-out-organ-donation-plans-in-england-and-wales","fields":{"headline":"Jeremy Hunt launches opt-out organ donation plans in England","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The health secretary, Jeremy Hunt, is to launch plans for an opt-out system of organ donation, asking people to overcome their “fatal reluctance” to discuss the issue with family and friends. Under the plans, everybody in England would be presumed to be happy to donate their organs on their death, unless they have signed up to a register stating that they do not want that to happen. In practice, however, it is unlikely that organs would be taken against the wishes of the family. The government’s ambition to change the NHS organ donation programme was announced by Theresa May in her Conservative party conference speech in October. Last year, she said, “500 people died because a suitable organ was not available. And there are 6,500 on the transplant list today.” NHS Blood and Transplant’s figures show that 1,100 families in the UK decided not to allow organ donation because they were unsure, or did not know whether their relatives would have wanted to donate an organ or not. “Every day, three people die for want of a transplant, which is why our historic plans to transform the way organ donation works are so important. We want as many people as possible to have their say as we shape the new opt-out process,” said Hunt. “As well as changing the law, we also need to change the conversation – it can be a difficult subject to broach, but overcoming this fatal reluctance to talk openly about our wishes is key to saving many more lives in the future.” The consultation will ask three questions: how much say should families have in their deceased relative’s decision to donate their organs? When would exemptions to “opt-out” be needed, and what safeguards will be necessary? How might a new system affect certain groups depending on age, disability, race or faith? There are particular shortages of organs for people from ethnic minority backgrounds. Only about 6% of donors are black or Asian, although those groups make up about 10% of the population. Orin Lewis, chief executive of the Afro-Caribbean Leukaemia Trust and co-chair of the National BAME Transplant Alliance, said: “As a parent of a young man who sadly passed away from multiple organ failure, I gladly welcome the prime minister’s decision to instigate a much-needed public consultation on the relative positive and negative merits of England having an opt-out donation policy.” There is still debate over how well an opt-out system works. Spain is often hailed as a success story and has a good supply of organs. However, the opt-out was introduced at the same time as big investments in the transplant programme, and in particular the appointment of transplant coordinators who instigate conversations with the family of a dying patient. If families refuse, their wishes are always respected. Wales launched an opt-out system in December 2015 and the following June it was announced that it had already been a success. Half the 60 organs transplanted in the six months came from people whose consent had been presumed. But a recent year-on-year comparison showed little difference, with 101 donors under the old system and 104 under presumed consent. In Wales, 6% of the population have signed the opt-out register. The policy requires that the consent of next-of-kin must always be sought. Hugh Whittall, director of the Nuffield Council on Bioethics, said there were concerns that the government was asking how an opt-out system should be introduced, rather than whether it should. “The government should not be making this change until there is evidence that it works, and until we are confident that it won’t undermine people’s trust in the system in the long-term,” he said. “That evidence is simply not there yet, though we do know some things that do work. Key amongst those is raising public awareness, encouraging family discussion, and better support and communication between specialist nurses and bereaved families. “Even in systems where an opt-out approach has been adopted (such as Spain), it is generally recognised that these are the elements that have made a difference, rather than the legal basis of the donation.” Keith Rigg, consultant transplant surgeon, said too many people were waiting and he welcomed the opportunity for discussion. “Encouraging people to talk openly with their families about their organ donation wishes is really important. There are strong feelings for and against opting out and there is no convincing evidence from Wales yet that this had made a difference. It is important that any proposed changes are based on evidence, encourage the wishes of individuals to be known and acted on, and support families to make the right decision about their loved ones at the time of their death,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/shortcuts/2017/dec/11/bee-movie-social-media-netflix-10-years-old","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-11T14:12:26Z","webTitle":"What's the deal with Bee Movie?

Do you mean Antz? No. Antz is about ants. This one’s about bees. What about A Bug’s Life? That’s another insect-based animation, but it’s not this one. I don’t think I’ve ever seen Bee Movie. You’re not alone. Greeted with mixed reviews, Bee Movie has the distinction of being Dreamworks Animation’s third lowest grossing computer-animated film. What’s it about? It’s about a bee called Barry B Benson – voiced by Jerry Seinfeld – who rebels against the beehive mentality of, um, the beehive. So it’s no good. Well, some people like it. The Guardian awarded it four stars when it was released. And one obsessive UK Netflix subscriber watched it 357 times last year. Who? Netflix didn’t release the name, just the figure. Why? For publicity. Netflix wants you to know how popular the service is, but it doesn’t want to give away any actual ratings for particular films or series. So instead it is warning us about an unstable individual in our midst? To be fair, Bee Movie does have a kind of cult status. One troubled loner watching the same cartoon every day for a year does not constitute a cult. There’s another person in Spain who has seen it 281 times. Two still isn’t enough, even if they write to each other. Even before this, Bee Movie was an established internet meme. I’ll have you know I barely understand what a meme is. Until last month I was still pronouncing it me-me. Let’s just say the film has garnered a measure of ironic affection over the years. People have posted versions where the movie gets faster every time someone says “bee”, or slower, or more pixelated. Why would they do that? Who knows? The entire screenplay of Bee Movie is also regularly used for shitposting. Sorry, shitposting? The posting of awkwardly large amounts of mediocre or ironically appropriated content to a social media site for the purposes of annoying everyone. People do seem to have a lot of free time these days, don’t they? They do indeed. Do say: “Honestly, I’ve never even seen the whole thing.

The Tories have given us a recovery that is worse than the one in the 1930s that followed the Great Depression. And families won’t see any improvement in living standards until 2022. That’s why we should set a new ambition for Britain: to become the world’s leading digital economy. Today there are just 1.5 million jobs in the digital economy. That’s about 4% of the workforce. But here’s the key point: digital jobs pay 40% more than the average wage. That’s more than £190 a week. So transforming the number of digital jobs in our economy is one of the fastest ways we can give Britain a pay rise. Britain was one of the great homes of the scientific revolution. In fact, we’ve been honouring our scientists like sovereigns since we buried Isaac Newton in Westminster Abbey. It was the application of science that sparked the industrial revolution, which made us the superpower of the steam age. Our challenge now is to become the great power of the digital age. The Tories simply cannot deliver this. Their stewardship of the education and skills system has left us with 12.6 million adults who have no basic digital skills – that’s a quarter of all adults. This costs us £63bn in lost output every year. In the 19th century we led the railway revolution. But today our digital infrastructure lags behind our competitors. In 2016 “fibre-to-the-premises” broadband was available only to 3% of UK premises – compared with 60% in South Korea and 70% in Japan. Moreover, the government has not got a grip on creating the sort of safe online space that is critical for the adoption of digital technologies to accelerate. Cyber-crime cost UK businesses £29bn in 2016, yet the police are hopelessly ill-equipped to tackle it. In fact, the UK has the second largest cyber-skills gap of 10 major countries. Back in 1964, Harold Wilson labelled the Edwardian establishment of the Macmillan government as hopelessly ill-suited to govern the jet age. Well, today’s Teletext-era Tories, with their little-England mindset and free-market fetishes, simply lack the scale of ambition we need to help Brexit Britain thrive in the global digital economy. Here’s a case in point. Those parts of Britain that will be hit hardest by Brexit are among the least well equipped to make a success of the digital economy. Research by the House of Commons library shows that the 95 council areas expected to suffer most from Brexit have average download speeds that are 65% worse than the areas that will be hurt least. Labour will steer a different course. We will future-proof our digital infrastructure, with a new universal service obligation of 30 megabits per second, followed by rollout of ultra-fast broadband across the UK. We’ll transform the digital skills base, creating an innovation nation with the greatest proportion of high-skilled jobs in the OECD, where working people are able to re-skill with free, life-long education in further education colleges. But, crucially, we’ll draw on the best ideas in the world to help get digital policy right – and that means driving forward our digital democracy. Back in 2015, the Speaker’s commission on digital democracy declared that parliament “should be fully interactive and digital by 2020”. Since then, little has happened. Until today. As a humble member of parliament, today I’m launching a deliberative democracy website to help get digital policy right. Drawing on the approach pioneered by new parties such as Podemos in Spain and city governments such as that of Reykjavik, the People’s Plan for Digital aims to open up the debates we need to have in parliament to help us get the right plans in place. The great Nye Bevan once famously said: “We have never suffered from too much vitality; we have suffered from too little.” When it comes to the digital economy taking shape around us, that is no longer a mistake we can afford to make. • Liam Byrne MP is shadow digital minister"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"fashion/2017/dec/11/linguine-emily-ratajkowski-feminist-model-fashion-video-criticism","type":"article","sectionId":"fashion","sectionName":"Fashion","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-11T15:50:02Z","webTitle":"Writhing in linguine is fine, Emily Ratajkowski, if that’s your thing – but it’s not feminist","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2017/dec/11/linguine-emily-ratajkowski-feminist-model-fashion-video-criticism","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/fashion/2017/dec/11/linguine-emily-ratajkowski-feminist-model-fashion-video-criticism","fields":{"headline":"Writhing in linguine is fine, Emily Ratajkowski, if that’s your thing – but it’s not feminist","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"I see there’s been controversy about Emily Ratajkowski. What is this about? Samantha, by email Here’s what I think about Emily Ratajkowski: I think we should all think a lot less about Emily Ratajkowski. For those who think so little about her to the point they don’t even know who she is, allow me to catch you up. Ratajkowski is, well, I guess one would call her a model, but it’s a little more complicated than that. She is best known for appearing in the video for Robin Thicke’s once ubiquitous and now totally forgotten 2013 song, Blurred Lines, and since then she has done some acting but primarily made a career out of looking sexy. And sure, why not? You live your life, Emily. Ratajkowski has always made a lot of hay about saying that she’s a feminist, and good for her! Always nice to see a young woman in the public eye embrace the label as opposed to spewing out some moronic brain porridge, such as, “I’m not a feminist – I love men” (side eyes, Shailene Woodley). Ratajkowski has done commendable work promoting Planned Parenthood, which she has described as her primary charity because of its work for women’s health, which is one thing, and possibly the only thing, Ratajkowski and I think alike on. Anyway, Ratajkowski recently released – for reasons I really don’t have the strength to investigate too closely – a video, in which she is having sex with some linguine. Look, she is writhing orgasmically on a table in her underwear (and woollen gloves, confusingly) while rubbing pasta all over her oiled body – how the hell would you describe it? Ratajkowski posted said video on Instagram and declared that “female sexuality and sexiness, no matter how conditioned it may be by a patriarchal ideal, can be incredibly empowering for a woman if she feels it is empowering to her”. Which is quite a 2017 statement, so congrats, Emily, for tapping into the zeitgeist: if she believes it is empowering, it is empowering. No comment from the linguine, mind. Anyway, this video then became “controversial”, which I guess was the point of it, when some random man on TV took it upon himself to declare Ratajkowski a “global bimbo”, which is just obnoxious, and added, “What Emily is doing is using this in the name of feminism. Don’t use the excuse it’s feminism because it’s not”, which has a little more merit. Now, as a feminist, a woman and just a person with a functioning brain, I feel the temptation to side with Ratajkowski here, because, frankly, why should she put up with some stupid TV man saying to her, as he once did on Twitter, “Do you want me to buy you some clothes? You look freezing.” I mean, seriously. If this guy is feminism’s saviour then we’re in a lot worse shape than I thought, ladies. But just because some guy is being a jerk to a woman it does not mean the woman is in the right. Or, to put it another way, just because she is doing something that is not feminist it does not mean that criticising her is in itself a feminist act. In other words, there does not always need to be a feminist in the room: both the TV guy and Ratajkowski can be in the wrong here. Yes, Ratajkowski is right that exercising her freedom of choice is a feminist act, but it does not then follow that the choice she makes is inherently feminist. After all, I could make the choice to be a surrendered wife – does that then mean being a surrendered wife is feminist? (Spoiler: no it doesn’t.) Ratajkowski has since said, “Lol never said my video was a feminist statement”, so perhaps she found having sex with linguine less empowering than she expected? Well, at least it’s a step up from her take on the Blurred Lines video, in which she and other models danced topless alongside a fully-clothed Thicke, Pharrell Williams and T.I. Ratajkowski insisted the video was “feminist” when, in fact, it was a literal dictionary definition of the opposite of feminism. Look, feminism doesn’t need gatekeepers, but if a video featuring naked women being told, “I know you want it” by clothed men is “feminist”, then I think we can all agree that the word “feminism” has now become about as meaningless as “ironic” is in the oeuvre of Alanis Morissette. I’ll be honest, I’m not sure why anyone would expect feminist statements from anyone who appeared in that Blurred Lines video, and I am fully including Thicke and Pharrell in that. It’s cool that Ratajkowski does work for Planned Parenthood but I think we dealt with the idea that stripping could be a feminist act back in the 90s and we really don’t need to rehash all that nonsense again. It’s OK, Emily! Not everything you do has to be feminist – it’s fine. But justifying everything you do as a feminist act is nonsense. Is shopping feminist? How about getting a massage? No and no. Feminism is about fighting for collective equality between the sexes, it is not about personal and individual “empowerment”. That is just making yourself feel good.

How Christmas lights became a nerdy obsession","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"I love Christmas lights. I am writing this in my living room, with no overhead lights on. All the illumination is coming from seven strands of lights – one on the tree, six more around the walls; several hundred bulbs. I love them so much that the ones that aren’t on the tree stay up all year. Every year I buy a few more sets, for no good reason – I just find it hard to walk past a shelf of lights without buying a set. I’m not alone in my passion. Although John Lewis won’t give out exact figures, its spokeswoman tells me the chain sells hundreds of thousands of sets of lights each year, its bestseller being an 11m string of 480 white lights in a vine style, yours for 50 quid. People obsess over lights. Search online and you’ll find forums full of people debating bulb types, strand length, how to build their own strands without having to sully themselves with inferior shop lights. My friend Steve Selvidge is that kind of person. He is a rock guitarist from Memphis, and Christmas lights fit into the same part of his mind that is very particular about guitars. “I’m an analogue guy,” he says. “I like vinyl. I like Les Pauls and Telecasters. I’m the same with Christmas. So I use incandescent bulbs.” Most of us now use LED bulbs – safer (because they don’t get hot) and cheaper (because they use less electricity). But light purists such as Selvidge stick with incandescents because of their softer, warmer light. He uses C7 screw-in bulbs – significantly larger than the bulbs you would likely have had on your last string of incandescent lights, which were likely the tiny candle bulbs. “Some people are happy with the little guys,” he says. “But I’m a tree-light gearhead.” So when the big supermarkets around Memphis stopped selling C7s, he found an online warehouse and bought 175 bulbs. More than he needed, but enough to futureproof his lights. “C7s won’t burn your tree down,” he says approvingly, as if that is a selling point rather than a basic minimum requirement. “If C9s” – a larger bulb – “weren’t so hot, I’d still use those. But time has moved on. It’s like the way you don’t smoke in the room with your baby any more.” Lights on Christmas trees are a Germanic innovation, and prosperous Germans first started illuminating their trees with candles in the 18th century: “Coleridge describes seeing it in northern Germany in 1798,” says Judith Flanders, author of Christmas: A Biography. “The problem with that is that it was dangerous: candles on a tree drying out indoors ended up with something highly flammable.” The first electrically illuminated tree was unveiled on 22 December 1882, in the New York home of Edward H Johnson, a friend of Thomas Edison and vice president of the Edison Electric Light Company. He draped his tree with 80-handwired bulbs in red, white and blue. Thirteen years later, President Grover Cleveland oversaw the first electrically lit tree in the White House and, over the following half-century, electric Christmas lights followed the democratisation of electricity. “It wasn’t until the 1930s or later that a lot of houses got electricity,” Flanders says. “We forget how late electricity actually came to a lot of houses. The manufacturing of strings of lights was there, so what happened in the early days was that you could buy battery-powered lights so houses without electricity could have some lighting, and those were manufactured as early as 1903. But they were very expensive. It’s around the 1910s and 1920s that they start to become affordable for the middle classes.” In fact, Flanders says, one of the key drivers of electric Christmas lights in the home was the insurance industry. “Because candles were so dangerous, many insurance companies refused to insure houses with candles, rather than electric lights. Not only do you have to affix candles to trees but, as they burn down they tilt, because the weight on the candles changes. They were lethal.” Nowadays, of course, Christmas lights aren’t limited to the home. For years, every town centre worth its salt has a Christmas lights display, often turned on by a minor celebrity – or, in the case of Piers Morgan and Stockbridge in Hampshire this year, not turned on, when the plunger didn’t work. The big displays in the central London shopping streets are largely the work of two companies, Field and Lawn – a marquee hire company that moved into Christmas lighting seven years ago – and James Glancy Design. Between them, they are responsible for the lights on Oxford Street, Bond Street, Regent Street, Carnaby Street, Jermyn Street, St Christopher’s Place, Seven Dials, as well as shopping centres and town centres across the UK. “On Oxford Street, we used around three quarters of a million lights,” says Nick McLaren of Field and Lawn, who got the company into the lighting business after joining from another Christmas lighting firm. “On Bond Street, it’s about half that number.” Field and Lawn, he says, spends about £1m each year on brand new lights for its designs. This is big business. And presumably it costs a fortune to power the Oxford Street display? “Oh, no,” McLaren says. “It could almost run off a dozen 13-amp plugs. That’s an exaggeration, but the electricity usage is nominal. When lights weren’t LED, the electricity bills would run to tens of thousands of pounds. Now it’s less than £1,000.” Obviously, providing a bespoke lighting display to a huge shopping street isn’t simply a case of finding some spare plug sockets and stringing up some lights you got from Homebase. James Glancy, who co-founded the firm that bears his name with Paul Dart, who does the design work, lists the things that have to be taken into consideration: the ability of your design to withstand snow and wind, the likelihood of your street acting as a wind tunnel, its length and width, the height of the buildings, the ownership of the buildings (the more that are owned by one landlord, the easier it is to get permission to erect design-specific infrastructure). You have to take into account whether your design is going to make it hard for office workers to get on with their jobs, and if it will annoy people who live within its glare. From bidding for the job, through assessing the site, drawing up the design, testing a full-scale prototype and getting it approved, to then hanging the lights can take up to 11 months. And, at the end, you must have something memorable, or you can be sure people will let you know their dissatisfaction. “In terms of a particular style, I would say we historically come from more of a theatre background,” Glancy says, “but I think more and more of our designs are modernist and less theatrical. If you look at this year’s designs, they’re quite flamboyant, perhaps more fun.” Hence the Carnaby Street lights feature no angels, but a multicoloured carnival theme that is almost tropical in its brightness (“Every company would say: ‘We could do that,’” McLaren says of the Glancy designs, “but they’re the ones with a client base that allows them to do more crazy, unique displays”). One thing that irritates people about the displays in central London is how early they are put up. There is a reason for that, McLaren says. “In order to get them up, the roads have to be shut at night, and you can only do that one road at a time. That’s why they have to go up in October. We often get a flurry of social media and news coverage about lights going up early.” In fact, for all that you would be hard pressed to find anyone who says they don’t like Christmas lights, people spend an awful lot of time complaining about them. That might be at the level of domestic irritation (my wife likes blinking lights; I think they’re vulgar and can’t stand them). Or it might be neighbourly – usually when one householder’s tastes tend to exterior decorations that are a little more garish than their neighbours might like. A mile or so up the road from me is a house so spectacularly decorated that we always take a trip to look at the lights – which festoon the whole frontage, front garden and front wall. Last year, however, the homeowner received an anonymous note: “I must say I was appalled … by the eyesore of your Christmas display. This has really taken the biscuit. I am currently looking to relocate myself elsewhere as a result. God only knows what you must have in store for St Valentine’s Day. Season’s greetings from a Disgruntled Neighbour.” That story is replicated wherever there is a brightly decorated house and a neighbour who cares about the tone of the street. “I don’t think it’s anything to do with lights,” Flanders says. “It’s that British people need to have other people to despise. I was talking to a very posh American who lives here yesterday and she said to me, in some confusion: ‘We put our Christmas lights up yesterday, and none of our neighbours seem to do that.’ I didn’t know what to say. First of all, outside lights in Britain are much less of a thing than in North America. The less polite response is that middle-class people think it’s trashy.” Come January, the lights will come down. Field and Lawn and James Glancy Design will carefully repair and pack away the lights they need to reuse. You and I will shove ours in cupboards under the stairs, and perhaps take broken strings to the recycling. And what of them then? Chances are they will end up in Shijao in China, where about 9,100 tonnes of discarded Christmas lights from the West are recycled every year. Next Christmas, you might encounter your old lights again: one of the things they end up being recycled into is slipper soles. Christmas: truly the gift that keeps on giving."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"books/2017/dec/16/why-i-love-joan-didion-writer-bim-adewunmi","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-16T06:00:54Z","webTitle":"Why I love Joan Didion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/dec/16/why-i-love-joan-didion-writer-bim-adewunmi","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2017/dec/16/why-i-love-joan-didion-writer-bim-adewunmi","fields":{"headline":"Why I love Joan Didion","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The glamour of Joan Didion, 83, lies not in the many incredible photographs of her during her long life. Nor is it in that horrible quasi-sheen that we associate with surviving terrible loss. It’s not in the lifestyle choices she made – living in New York one year, relocating to a home right on a California beach another – and it’s not in the interactions she had with Hollywood royalty, from Warren Beatty (who had a crush on her) to Harrison Ford (who worked as her carpenter for a time). It does not lie in the era-defining work she published in the 1960s and 70s, solo or co-written with husband John Gregory Dunne. No, the glamour of Joan Didion is merely in her willingness to try things. Truly, there is nothing more luxe than that: the decision to dip your toe, your foot, your leg and eventually your enitre body into a new endeavour, and just do it. In Joan Didion: The Centre Will Not Hold, a Netflix documentary produced and directed by Didion’s nephew, the actor Griffin Dunne – the writer is endlessly watchable. She is still a sure speaker, and her hands dance in front of her when she’s being emphatic. But it’s all the stories she pursued, the diversifying of her skill set, from magazines to screenplays, as well as the journey into motherhood: all those opportunities grabbed at, with both hands, that really seize you. It’s nice, and useful, when people believe in you, of course. But it helps if you’re already packed and waiting at the door when chances come knocking.

But for those of us who don’t have the luxury of taking a gap year, tour operator Tui has just launched the first direct flights from the UK this winter, bringing this remote island within an 11.5 hour flight on the 787 Dreamliner. Expect powdery white palm-fringed sands, clear warm waters and excellent diving. Spend a week at the Vinpearl Phu Quoc Resort, perched on the edge of Bai Dai Beach, with idyllic views of the Gulf of Thailand from almost every angle. • £859pp all-inclusive at Vinpearl Phu Quoc Resort, including return flights, with Tui Best for peace and quiet: Cyprus The island of Cyprus has one of the mildest winters in the Med and – if you stay away from the big resorts which seem a bit forlorn in low season – there is much to offer independent travellers, from Byzantine churches to ancient mountain villages. In the hamlet of Psematismenos, Modus Vivendi’s one-bed apartments make a good low-key base: a collection of six stone cottages set around a small pool and flower-filled terrace. Interiors are rustic with stone-flagged floors and beamed ceilings. The coast is 3km away and the bright lights of Larnaca, Limassol and Nicosia within a 30-minute drive. • From £80 a night at Modus Vivendi though i-escape. Flights to Larnaca cost from £69 return with easyJet Best for value: Sri Lanka If the slick five-star resorts of the Seychelles and Maldives are beyond your budget, consider Sri Lanka – same white-sand beaches and clear Indian Ocean waters, but for a fraction of the price. At Thalpe Bungalows, a short tuk-tuk ride from the historic fortress city of Galle, you can stay in one of three immaculate and spacious one-bedroom cottages set around a swimming pool. The friendly owners are on hand to give recommendations and Dalawella beach is a short walk away. Delicious home-cooked breakfasts and evening meals are available on request and the nearby beach resort of Unawatuna has wonderful, cheap places to eat. • From £71 a night at Thalpe Bungalows. Flights to Colombo from £748 return with Sri Lankan Airlines Best for culture: Valletta, Malta Europe’s hottest winter sun destination is Valletta – and not just because it gets more sunshine hours than any other city on the continent. The city will take up the mantle of European Capital of Culture next year, giving it a chance to showcase its beautiful Baroque architecture in a year-long programme of events, the highlight of which will be the opening of a new national art gallery, Muza. For a stylish pied-a-terre kitted out with midcentury flair, check out the apartments offered by Valletta Vintage. There are five self-catering flats each sleeping two. • From £58 a night at Valletta Vintage through i-escape. Flights to Malta cost from £82 return with BA Best for food lovers: Paternoster, South Africa Cape Town is the undisputed culinary capital of South Africa, but for something a little less frenetic and altogether more charming, head two hours up the coast to Paternoster. This little seaside village of whitewashed fisherman’s cottages has been making waves in gastronomic circles for its selection of first-class restaurants. Don’t let the sleepy ambience fool you – you’ll have to book weeks in advance to bag a table at Wolfgat for the celebrated seven-course tasting menu, and Capetonians think nothing of making a 200-mile round-trip for the Asian-influenced seafood dishes and ocean views at Gaaitjie. • A nine-night self-drive trip combining Cape Town, Paternoster and the wineries of Franschhoek costs from £2,125pp, including BA flights, with Rainbow Tours Best for families: Lanzarote With a flying time of just 4.5 hours and temperatures averaging a balmy 20C, Lanzarote is a great winter sun destination for families – and nobody caters for them better than Lanzarote Retreats , which has an ever-expanding portfolio of quirky accommodation, ranging from yurts to fisherman’s cottages, in the island’s less touristy corners. The latest addition is the Eco Cabin, a traditional Canarian stone building which has been converted into cosy accommodation for up to five. Guests can enjoy a private gated garden, a solar-heated pool, trampoline and play area at the Finca de Arrieta, and even the option of “off-grid” living. There’s also a raft of baby and toddler kit available on request. The helpful owners can arrange babysitting and recently introduced a meal delivery service in partnership with a local deli. • From £1,100 for four nights at Lanzarote Retreats for up to five people. Flights to Lanzarote from £44 with Ryanair Best for off the beaten track: Jericoacoara, Brazil In 2004, Lonely Planet voted Jericoacoara the best beach in the world, but until now only the most dedicated travellers got to find out if this was true since the village had no road access. Paradise hunters had to endure a lengthy five-hour transfer from the nearest city, Fortaleza, by car, then 4x4 or boat. But that’s all set to change this winter with the launch of direct scheduled flights from São Paulo into Jericoacoara’s newly built airport. Many locals and “Jeri” devotees will despair that this could threaten the laid-back character of this fishing village-turned-windsurfing hangout, so if the white powder beaches, vivid blue lagoons and towering sand dunes of northern Brazil have been on your travel wish-list for a while, it’s advisable to go sooner rather than later. Stay at Pousada Carcará, a friendly guest house which has hammocks, a small pool and bar. • From £97 a night at Pousada Carcará. Flights to São Paulo with BA cost from £743 and from São Paulo to Jericoacoara cost from £232 with Gol; or TAP Air Portugal flies from London to Fortaleza, via Lisbon, from around £700 return Best for activities: Taghazout, Morocco The fishing village of Taghazout on Morocco’s Atlantic coast is something of a well-kept secret among surfers, but the opening of two boutique hotels in the past 12 months looks certain to broaden its appeal. Laid-back Amouage on the ocean front offers inclusive surf and yoga packages (from £714pp per week). Enjoy an early-morning vinyasa flow on their rooftop yoga garden and relax in their infinity pool. There’s also the hippy-chic Munga Guesthouse with driftwood furniture, hammocks and a rooftop sushi restaurant. Surf lessons, horse and camel riding, fishing and golf can all be booked locally. • From £336pp a week at Amouage with Surf Maroc and from £32 a night at Munga Guesthouse. Flights to Agadir from £52 return with easyJet Best for recharging the batteries: the Algarve, Portugal It might be better known for its pile ’em high package resorts and sprawling golf courses, but the Algarve is making in-roads into the “wellness” sector, with a handful of high-end resorts offering off-season retreats to revitalise mind, body and soul. You’ll pay more for your treatments and accommodation than you would in the Far East, but this is offset by cheaper flights and no jetlag. Epic Sana, a five-star beach-front hotel, with top-notch spa and fitness facilities, runs regular retreat weeks in the winter. • A five-night mindfulness retreat at Epic Sana costs from £1,675pp, including flight with Health and Fitness Travel, which offers other, more affordable wellbeing breaks to Portugal Best for nightlife and shopping: Jaffa, Israel The historic port district of Jaffa has evolved into one of Tel Aviv’s most exciting neighbourhoods with cool bars and cafés springing up in the narrow streets around the Shuk Hapishpeshim flea market. Next year two swanky hotels are opening: the Setai, with a rooftop pool, and the W Tel Aviv-Jaffa, in a restored Ottoman-era convent.

Yet Bruni surprised her detractors, showing herself to be a talented songwriter and a careful, nuanced singer whose jazzy chansons soon topped the French charts. She has continued to do so, even after the inevitable hiatus to her musical career caused by marrying Nicolas Sarkozy, and spending 2008-12 in the Élysée as France’s first lady. She has spoken of suffering from crippling stage fright, but this still-gamine figure, fronting a four-piece, light-jazz band, exudes preternatural poise. Bruni moves with beatific grace, recalling Karl Lagerfeld’s praise of her as “this beautiful creature who can wear anything”; her husky whisper could be a parody of a breathy Gallic siren. Her latest album is a set of cover versions sung in English, French Touch, which is a decidedly mixed bag. It largely works because Bruni pours herself into the songs as if in thrall to them: her pitch-perfect, sparse croon through Depeche Mode’s Enjoy the Silence identifies and amplifies the bleak yearning at the song’s core. The quirky arrangements can be eccentric. Bruni’s cod-jazz take on Willie Nelson’s Crazy veers near to lift muzak, while the jaunty noodling her band introduce to Lou Reed’s Perfect Day sounds at odds with the song’s dark soul. The Clash’s Jimmy Jazz is transformed into a previously unknown genre that can only be described as ethereal boogie-woogie. Yet Bruni, all catwalk swagger and insouciant finger clicks, is a winning figure at the heart of these lateral interpretations. Her contralto on Moon River, inspired by Audrey Hepburn’s rendition in Breakfast at Tiffany’s, is rich and intimate; a mid-set section of self-penned material, in French, confirms her music is no vanity project. The highlight is a majestic, still reading of the glacial misery of Abba’s The Winner Takes It All; the chic devil’s horns she flashes before trilling AC/DC’s Highway to Hell are arguably less essential. Bruni ends the evening in the chapel’s pulpit for a correctly understated velvet sigh through Hallelujah. It is beyond question the most stylish sermon London will hear this Christmas."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/dec/12/christmas-gift-guide-the-best-subscriptions","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-12T10:53:26Z","webTitle":"Christmas gift guide: the best subscriptions","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/dec/12/christmas-gift-guide-the-best-subscriptions","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/dec/12/christmas-gift-guide-the-best-subscriptions","fields":{"headline":"Christmas gift guide: the best subscriptions","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"For grownups Lucky Dip Club, from £6, luckydipclub.com Various different subscription options available Bringing much-needed colour, fun and positivity through the letterbox each month, Lucky Dip Club finds quirky ideas from independent artists and designers.

Ten-year-old Emily told them a boy at school had slapped her, hard, across the face: “I want to die. Nobody believes me. He’s hitting me and nobody believes me.” “We didn’t know what to do,” Rob tells me, his voice echoing the helplessness and frustration he felt. “Hearing her say those words – what parent wants to hear that from their 10-year-old daughter?” When Claire tried to speak to the school about the incident, they quickly dismissed it as “a misunderstanding”, telling her: “Everyone’s happy now.” But Emily was far from happy. Over the subsequent two weeks, she gradually opened up to her parents with the help of her GP. Slowly, she described how the boy in question had sexually harassed and assaulted her over the past 10 months. It emerged that another child had made a detailed report to the school after witnessing the boy intimidating and assaulting Emily. The classmate had told staff it happened in a corner of the playground known as the “sex corner”, where the boy had forced Emily against a wall, pinning her hands on either side of her as he gyrated and rubbed his body against hers. Emily closed her eyes and started crying. But school staff hadn’t considered the incident serious enough to contact Emily’s parents. In the intervening months, the Johnsons watched as Emily became angry and withdrawn, and started self-harming. They couldn’t understand what was wrong. Then, everything began to fall into place. Over the previous months, the boy had asked Emily for oral sex and demanded to see her vagina, details that emerged only when her sister decided to break her silence, telling Rob and Claire: “He asked her for a blowie.” Claire’s voice is full of emotion as she continues: “She didn’t know what it meant. She said: ‘I think it means hard sex.’” When sexual harassment and assault starts at such a young age, it can be hugely confusing for children. When Emily’s distraught parents asked why she hadn’t told them what was happening, she admitted that she had been terrified they would be angry with her, adding: “Because I thought I might be pregnant.” That Emily faced such a terrifying ordeal alone is an indictment of an education system that sees children experiencing sexual harassment and abuse in school, but does not provide them with the tools to understand what it is or reach out for support. Emily is far from alone. According to BBC research, 5,500 sexual offences were reported to police as having taken place in UK schools over a three-year period to July 2015, including 600 rapes. And a recent women and equalities select committee (WESC) report highlighted widespread sexual harassment and abuse of girls at school. Faced with the horrifying realisation of what their daughter had experienced, the Johnsons set out to get to the bottom of the problem, but encountered serious resistance. When they wrote a letter about the abuse, Rob says, the school was keen to: “Reduce this to something it wasn’t … It seemed very much that the main focus was to safeguard the school’s reputation rather than safeguard the children.” Rob was devastated, both by the impact this could have on his own daughter, and on other potential victims. “For me personally, the hardest thing has been that they haven’t wanted to acknowledge there’s even been an allegation of sexual abuse or sexual assault. The terminology is really important in these things ... you’ve already told a 10-year-old girl: ‘If you’re assaulted don’t bother coming forward because we don’t believe you.’” Over the next five weeks, the Johnsons reached out to everybody they could think of for help. First they tried the school’s board of governors, but were shocked when the safeguarding deputy suggested “restorative justice” (where the victim and abuser would discuss the assault face to face), which they felt was totally inappropriate. Next, they contacted multiple GPs, who rang the school independently after examining Emily to verify that they felt she had been a victim of sexual abuse. Then the Johnsons contacted the local council and police, neither of whom were able to offer much support, in part due to the fact that the perpetrator had been aged nine (and therefore below the age of criminal responsibility) at the time of the abuse. Eventually, they turned to their local MP and to charities such as the NSPCC and ChildLine, taking an advocate to school with them for support. It was only after over a month of determined effort that they forced the school to acknowledge what had really happened. Despite Emily’s ordeal, Rob doesn’t solely blame the school for what happened: “It’s very easy to blame the school, and say this is all their fault [but] I think they were just unequipped to deal with this. If there aren’t any guidelines you’re completely stumped … There need to be concrete guidelines about how we safeguard children, boys and girls, about sexual assault, exactly what procedures we need to follow and they need to be uniform and sent out to every school. And that can only come from the government.” Earlier this year, lawyers wrote to the education secretary, Justine Greening, to warn her that the lack of clear guidance telling schools what they should do when rapes and sexual assaults are reported could leave her open to legal action. At the time, the Department for Education said the Keeping Children Safe in Education guidance was last updated in 2015, but was kept under regular review. “Schools should be safe places and they have a duty to protect all pupils and listen to any concerns. We issue regularly updated safeguarding guidance – which includes advice on peer-on-peer abuse – to protect pupils’ welfare.” Under questioning by the WESC this year, the schools minister, Nick Gibb, said official guidelines needed to be clear that abusers could not return to classes alongside people they attacked, and pledged that the government would shortly launch a consultation to make the required changes. Sarah Green, co-director of the End Violence Against Women Coalition, says the promised new guidelines “frankly can’t come soon enough”. “We know that many schools currently fail terribly when girls and their families report sexual assaults – because heads, teachers and governors do not have adequate training or guidance in this area. Girls have been told to just put up with this behaviour for too long.” The Johnsons are relieved that the school has finally admitted, and recorded, the reality of the sexually abusive behaviour Emily experienced, and have put measures in place that will keep the boy away from her at all times. But the solution isn’t perfect. Claire is unhappy that it is her daughter who is removed from certain lessons and activities. “Why [is she] suffering consequences when [she has] done nothing wrong?” she asks. Both parents believe it should not have taken such a gargantuan effort on their part to achieve this outcome. Other parents, they fear, may not be so tenacious in similar circumstances. Rob says: “We know of other parents who are moving their kids and I can only imagine … I dread to think if you didn’t know where to go it must be awful.” Claire wishes the school would do more to take the problem seriously: “There could be other girls in the same situation. They know that … But it’s all about the reputation of the school. Everything’s covered up. Nothing’s transparent.” Emily’s story is just one among many of sexual violence in schools, with confusion and inconsistency abounding in the treatment of victims and survivors. Claire says: “You hear about young girls being raped and sexually abused in other countries, but no, it’s happening in our schools. It’s happening to children here and nothing’s being done.” Names have been changed."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"film/2017/dec/11/golden-globes-nominations-2018-the-shape-of-water-the-post-three-billboards-outside-ebbing-missouri","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-11T14:32:28Z","webTitle":"Golden Globes 2018: Shape of Water, The Post and Three Billboards lead nominations","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/dec/11/golden-globes-nominations-2018-the-shape-of-water-the-post-three-billboards-outside-ebbing-missouri","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2017/dec/11/golden-globes-nominations-2018-the-shape-of-water-the-post-three-billboards-outside-ebbing-missouri","fields":{"headline":"Golden Globes 2018: Shape of Water, The Post and Three Billboards lead nominations","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Guillermo del Toro’s cold war fantasy The Shape of Water emerged as the frontrunner for the Oscars after picking up a total of seven nominations for the 75th Golden Globes. However, the film looks set to face strong opposition from Steven Spielberg’s Pentagon Papers drama The Post and Martin McDonagh’s Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri, at a Globes ceremony that will provide the entertainment industry with its first major opportunity to respond to the sexual abuse scandal plaguing Hollywood. Two months after the emergence of allegations against producer Harvey Weinstein that would prompt a further torrent of claims against men in the film industry, the nominations exhibited an already changed landscape in Hollywood. As expected none of the Weinstein-produced films eligible for inclusion received nominations, however there were multiple nominations for Ridley Scott’s All the Money in the World, which was forced to replace star Kevin Spacey at short notice, after he was accused of multiple counts of sexual assault and harassment. At the same time, the widely predicted shift towards a more female-focused list of nominees in the wake of the Weinstein scandal did not materialise. Though there were nods for a number of films with female protagonists, including The Shape of Water, Three Billboards, I, Tonya, a biopic of disgraced ice skater Tonya Harding and coming-of-age comedy-drama Lady Bird, there was no room in the nominees for any female directors, while Patty Jenkins’s feminist superhero movie Wonder Woman was snubbed entirely. Leading the way with seven nominations is the Shape of Water, which stars British actor Sally Hawkins as a mute cleaner at a governmental research facility who falls in love with a captured sea creature. Both Del Toro and Hawkins have been nominated in the drama category, for best director and best actress respectively, while Richard Jenkins and Octavia Spencer have received supporting actor and actress nominations. The film has also received best screenplay and score nominations, as well as best picture in the drama category. It is joined in that latter category by 70s-set drama The Post, which stars Tom Hanks and Meryl Streep as Washington Post higher-ups who clash over whether to publish classified documents about the war in Vietnam. Both leads have received nods for best actor and actress, while Spielberg is nominated for best director. Revenge drama Three Billboards, which stars Frances McDormand as a mother who tries to track down the person who raped and murdered her daughter, also performed strongly. As well as a best picture (drama) nod, the film also picked up five other nominations, including a best actress (drama) inclusion for McDormand, and a best director nomination for McDonagh. There will be a solid representation of British talent at the Globes. Allied evacuation epic Dunkirk picked up three nominations, including best picture (drama) and a best director nod for Christopher Nolan, while Gary Oldman received a best actor (drama) nod for his performance as Winston Churchill in another second-world-war-themed drama, Darkest Hour. Daniel Day Lewis also was the recipient of a best actor (drama) nomination for his turn in Phantom Thread, said to be his final appearance before retirement from acting, and there were best actress (musical or comedy) nods for Judi Dench (Victoria &amp; Abdul) and Helen Mirren (The Leisure Seeker). Appearing in the same category is Irish actor Saoirse Ronan, who received a nomination for her performance in Lady Bird. Daniel Kaluuya received a best actor (musical or comedy) nod for his appearance in Get Out. Perhaps the surprise success of this year’s nominations is All the Money in the World. A dramatised account of the real-life kidnapping of the grandson of millionaire John Paul Getty, the film had to be recast and shot at the last minute after the allegations against Spacey came to light in October. Christopher Plummer, who replaced Spacey in the role of Getty, has received a best actor nod (drama) for his performance, while Scott and star Michelle Williams have also received nominations. Voted on by the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, a group of 90 international journalists based in LA, the awards tend to deviate from those handed out at the Oscars, which are determined by around 7,000 academy members. Unlike the Oscars, which does not offer separate categories for genres, the Globes chooses to split its categories into separate drama and comedy/musical categories, giving more prominence to the sort of lighter fare that tends to be overlooked by the Academy. However, the decision to split categories has caused controversy in the past. In 2016, the Globes was forced to change its rules after a widely criticised decision to award sci-fi epic The Martian best comedy or musical, while last month Get Out director Jordan Peele had to defend the decision by studios Blumhouse and Universal to submit the satirical horror film in the same category. Get Out received a lower-than-expected two nominations at this year’s awards. Other films to be snubbed included acclaimed cross-cultural rom-com The Big Sick and Kathryn Bigelow’s race-riots drama Detroit, neither of which received any nominations. In the TV section of the awards, HBO’s murder mystery Big Little Lies leads the way with six nominations, including nods for stars Nicole Kidman and Reese Witherspoon, who face off in the best actress in a limited series category. There were also multiple nominations for Feud: Bette and Joan, about the rivalry between Bette Davis and Joan Crawford, Aziz Ansari’s comedy Master of None, dystopian drama The Handmaid’s Tale and Jessica Biel-starring thriller The Sinner. The winners of this year’s Golden Globes will be announced on Sunday 7 January in a ceremony hosted by late-night talk show host Seth Meyers. A former SNL comic, Meyers is perhaps best known for an appearance at the 2011 White House Correspondents’ Dinner in which he repeatedly mocked then-US Apprentice host Donald Trump, and has been a frequent critic of Trump during his presidency."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/dec/17/creation-history-brilliant-ideas-build-on-the-past","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-17T06:00:23Z","webTitle":"Creation history: brilliant ideas build on the past | David Eagleman and Anthony Brandt","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/dec/17/creation-history-brilliant-ideas-build-on-the-past","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/dec/17/creation-history-brilliant-ideas-build-on-the-past","fields":{"headline":"Creation history: brilliant ideas build on the past","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"To understand one of the secrets of creativity, just peek into an art classroom in Denver, Colorado. The teacher asks her pupils to imitate the style of Vassily Kandinsky. The students mimic Kandinsky’s geometric abstractions, mastering brushwork and learning colour theory. If that was all there were to the lesson, it would be a hands-on class in art history. But the art teacher asks the students to cut up their paintings and build 3D sculptures out of the pieces. They have all started with the same source, but their works all end up looking extremely different: some rise straight up in a column, while others are a jigsaw of different forms and angles. The students learn to treat the past not as a landing point, but as a launching pad. Creativity does not emerge out of thin air. Instead, it is a process of derivation and extrapolation. No idea is ever wholly original; there is always a link from the known to the new. We rely on culture to provide us with a storehouse of raw materials which we then transform. Each generation adds another layer to the cliffside of history. One of the keys to fostering inventiveness is not to treat the past as sacred. Artists and musicians sometimes earn reputations as provocateurs for their irreverent treatment of history – but they are actually doing what is necessary: putting culture on to the workbench and remodelling it. Beethoven didn’t write symphonies because he thought there was anything wrong with Mozart’s. Picasso didn’t paint variations on canvases by Velásquez and Manet because he rejected the old masters, but rather because he revered them. While we sometimes tinker with the imperfect, we also remake what we love, showing our admiration for the past by passing down its DNA. Sometimes inventors attempt to cover their tracks. Stravinsky denied that The Rite of Spring, his revolutionary ballet about pagan Russia, included any actual folk tunes, but scholars found a volume of them in his library after his death. It took Apple seven years to acknowledge that the iPod was based on schematics created by inventor Kane Kramer two decades earlier. But whether it’s obvious or obscured, new ideas always have a family tree. Creative minds always start from a precedent and move from there, but how far should they go? The challenge is that staying too close to the familiar can dissatisfy, while wandering too far can fail to find followers. As a result, inventive people cover the spectrum from the incremental to the disruptive. Thomas Edison made small changes to the telephone, dramatically improved the lightbulb – and at the far end imagined underwater cities powered by solar energy. The designer Norman Bel Geddes designed a host of practical products, such as cocktail shakers and furniture – but he also ranged much further, sketching flying cars and houses in which the walls rose up into the ceiling like garage doors. Beethoven’s Diabelli Variations illustrate the same principle of covering the spectrum from familiar to novel: the first few variations stay recognisably close to what’s come before, and then Beethoven gradually drifts further away until we barely recognise the theme any more. The DNA of the original is still there, but by the end it has evolved to something new. Each of us is creating our own variations on themes passed down to us. We’re at our most inventive when we summon history not to limit our imaginations, but to launch them. That’s a lesson that can start young – and that never ages.

A full house at the Allianz Stadium and the atmosphere crackling as Juventus fans put on their usual pre-game choreography: a sea of black and white placards broken only by a green, white and red tricolore to remind everyone this is where the reigning champions reside. Well, no, actually, that wouldn’t quite do it. Ultras also prepared their own banner, in which 1970s cartoon detective Nick Carter was seen, together with sidekicks Patsy and Ten, examining a map of Europe. Italy had been blocked out in black and white stripes. Above the picture was a message aimed at Inter’s owners: “The wise man says, ‘China is close, Italy is a mirage’.” Inevitable jibes aside, there was nervousness among the home fans as well. They might not like to admit it in Turin but, for the first time in a long time, Inter are a genuine threat. Only four games shy of the season’s midway stage, indeed, the Nerazzurri were top. They arrived unbeaten, and with fresh legs, too, on account of not playing in European competition. Mauro Icardi, a man who has enjoyed success against Juventus in the past, was top of the scoring charts. The newspapers sought to bill this occasion as a duel between him and Gonzalo Higuaín. Icardi has moved ahead of his compatriot in the running to represent Argentina at the World Cup. Gazzetta dello Sport surveyed 100 strikers, past and present, and found a slender majority favoured the Inter striker. What the pink paper forgot to ask was: ‘Will either of them actually see the ball?’ As it turned out, they basically wouldn’t. The 232nd Derby d’Italia proved to be a tense game, compelling for its tension and fine margins, but not exactly packed with goalmouth action. The real duel was not between strikers but managers. Luciano Spalletti has elevated Inter far beyond expectations, pushing the likes of Ivan Perisic, Antonio Candreva and Danilo D’Ambrosio to a higher standard of individual performance while also implementing a tactical system that works. His 4-2-3-1 privileges those wide players but leaves room for Borja Valero or Marcelo Brozovic to pull strings behind the attack without losing a defensive shield. Massimiliano Allegri, by contrast, has always been adapatable: a pragmatist. He was chided by Arrigo Sacchi last week, the former Milan manager contending the Bianconeri’s defensive approach in their 1-0 win at Napoli would not have been celebrated in Spain. Allegri is not a man who concedes easily to the opinions of others. He can point to last season’s team, when he combined Higuaín, Paulo Dybala, Mario Mandzukic, Juan Cuadrado and Miralem Pjanic (not to mention Dani Alves as a rampaging full-back) into a ‘five-star Juve’ as evidence of his willingness to play an attacking game. In the end, he is most interested in winning. And that is why he approached the Inter game just as he had the one against Napoli: with a firm intention not to concede. Dybala, whose performances have dipped following a brilliant start, began on the bench – as did an out-of-form, and reportedly unsettled, Alex Sandro. Just as they had at the Stadio San Paolo, Juventus began sitting back and allowing their opponents the ball. They were inviting Inter to commit men forward and leave spaces open for a counterattack in behind. But there was nuance, too. Allegri had packed the middle of the park against Napoli, betting their diminutive forward line would struggle if they were reduced to pumping crosses into the box. Against Inter, the team who cross the ball the most in all of Serie A (25 times per game), he made sure Perisic and Candreva were denied space out wide. The plan worked perfectly. Inter barely had a sniff of goal in 90 minutes, where Juventus should have scored several. Cuadrado’s crosses repeatedly found Mandzukic but the Croatian could not force the ball in. Samir Handanovic denied him with a fine save, then he rattled a header off the crossbar. Mandzukic then miscontrolled another opportunity with the goal at his mercy. By full-time, he had taken as many shots as Inter’s team. But the game still ended 0-0, a result for the visitors to celebrate. Inter are the only team in Europe’s top competitions yet to taste defeat this season – if you factor in Manchester City’s loss to Shakhtar Donetsk and Barcelona’s slip in the Spanish Super Cup. Inter would even get to stay in first, after Napoli drew with Fiorentina a day later. Officially, players continue to insist they are not thinking about the Scudetto and that qualifying for the Champions League is the real target. But Inter have survived away trips to Juventus, Napoli and Roma. Those teams must all come to San Siro in the second half of this campaign. The suggestion this was a disastrous result for Juventus, though, ought to be quickly dismissed. This was the conclusion of a daunting week, beginning with the visit to Naples and proceeding through a trip to Greece, where they had to beat Olympiakos (and did) to be sure of qualifying for the Champions League last 16 (where Spurs await). To win all of those games would have been ideal but to portray two dropped points as a calamity might be wishful thinking. “You all want us to start losing so you can see a new team on top after six years,” Pjanic said. “That’s normal. But we’re going to carry on battling.” And while people such as Sacchi can criticise a lack of attacking ambition, we ought not ignore the fact this was Juventus’s fifth consecutive clean sheet. In that stretch they have not only faced Napoli and Inter but Barcelona as well. Yes, Allegri still needs to work out how to get Dybala going again. After a late cameo at the weekend, the Argentinian has gone from scoring 12 in his first eight games to only two in his last 15. It is the team with the stingiest defence, however, who have won Serie A in every one of the past 10 seasons. And that might be the biggest reason why this Inter team – with four fewer goals conceded than Juventus – are starting to cause a little anxiety in Turin. Talking points • It was a weekend for 0-0 draws at the top of Serie A, but you can leave aside your tired clichés about Italian football. This is, according to Opta, the first time in more than 50 years that Juventus, Inter, Napoli and Roma have played out goalless matches in the same round. • Roma, to be fair, were also very unlucky to run into Stefano Sorrentino on a day when the Chievo goalkeeper was not going to be beaten. His double save from Patrik Schick and Gerson was brilliant, but the body control required to keep out a deflected shot with his boot in the second-half was even better. There were plenty more besides those. Not bad for a man who turns 38 next month. • And what of Napoli? Maurizio Sarri insisted his team was not fatigued after they drew at home to Fiorentina, missing their chance to vault back into first. Certainly it is true they came on stronger in the second half, when Dries Mertens fluffed a one-on-one and Marco Sportiello did well to push Piotr Zielinski’s shot on to the post. It is undeniable, and unsurprising, that Napoli were missing their usual verve down the left with Faouzi Ghoulam and Lorenzo Insigne absent, but the contrast between their early-season form and recent results is stark. Napoli scored 32 in their first 11 games, and have done so just three times in the last five. • Milan won their first home game since September, and celebrated as enthusiastically as Benevento had done after drawing with the Rossoneri last week. The jury is still out on whether Rino Gattuso is cut out to lead, but if nothing else you do get the sense his enthusiasm is getting into his players and staff, whom he made a point of hugging one-by-one before bringing together an on-pitch huddle. There was a similar energy from Milan during the game, as they rained in 21 shots on Bologna’s goal. • That said, another former Milan man has been making an even better impression in the dugout. Massimo Oddo took over at Udinese in mid-November, and lost his first game against Napoli. Since then he has led the team to three wins by a combined margin of 13-3 (the biggest of those, admittedly, coming against Serie B side Perugia in the Coppa Italia). Results: Cagliari 2-2 Sampdoria, Juventus 0-0 Internazionale, Chievo 0-0 Roma, Napoli 0-0 Fiorentina, Spal 2-2 Verona, Udinese 2-0 Benevento, Sassuolo 2-1 Crotone, Milan 2-1 Bologna."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"books/2017/dec/13/stories-by-susan-sontag-review","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-13T09:00:15Z","webTitle":"Stories by Susan Sontag review – the great essayist’s experiments in short fiction","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/dec/13/stories-by-susan-sontag-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2017/dec/13/stories-by-susan-sontag-review","fields":{"headline":"Stories by Susan Sontag review – the great essayist’s experiments in short fiction","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"In her essays, Susan Sontag spoke with one of the great, sure voices of the last century. From her salon at the centre of the cosmopolis, marvellously at one with her books and her learning, she considered, renamed and renewed our relationship with camp, with photography, with illness: a living legend of braininess and cool. Sontag, was not, though, as her editor Benjamin Taylor admits in the introduction to this gathering of stories from across her career, a committed short-story writer. She turned to the form in order to evade what Chekhov called “autobiographophobia”, which Taylor uses to mean the fear of writing and reflecting directly about one’s life. Evading this fear, Sontag clearly found the name “stories” very helpful: half of them are pure autobiography. “Pilgrimage”, for example, which opens the volume, is a memoir of Sontag’s youth in southern California, and an account of her visit with a boyfriend to the home of an ageing Thomas Mann. The only reason why this did not become an essay, it seems, is that the encounter was dull and disappointing, and so difficult to reflect on: Mann had “only sententious formulas to deliver. And I uttered nothing but tongue-tied simplicities, though I was full of complex feeling. We were neither of us at our best.” The next piece, “Project for a Trip to China”, is also memoir: we learn more about Sontag’s childhood (she was a voracious reader and dug deep holes in the garden to sit in); about her habit of ordering ambitiously in restaurants (hundred-year-old eggs); and a little about her father, who worked in China. The piece is more experimental, using lists and tables, characters identified by initials only, and lots of negatives (she does not, predictably, go to China). But it ends, like “Pilgrimage”, by sounding like an essay: she considers herself as a writer and employs heftier language and aphorisms. “Literature, then. Literature before and after, if need be … the only solution, to know and not know. Literature and not literature, using the same verbal gesture.” Other stories adopt more conventionally fictional strategies. “Baby” is a lengthy satire in which parents in a psychotherapist’s office anxiously chew over the ruinous mistakes they are making with their prodigious child. “Dummy” and “American Spirits” are intricate allegories; both capture entire lives, exploring fulfilment and the ideology of marriage. “Old Complaints Revisited” is a dystopia with a rebellious central character, and “Dr Jekyll” an elaborate play on Robert Louis Stevenson’s original featuring the gender politics of an American college. “A Letter Scene”, meanwhile, is somewhere between essay and story, illustrating ideas about correspondence with fictive vignettes of letter writers. None of these pieces, though, is a short story in the Chekhovian sense – a narrative built on images and speech; a glimpse into a deeply imagined, apparently authentic world – because Sontag frees none of her characters. Rather, they are bent to her purposes, illustrations of a wider point. To Chekhov, “autobiographophobia” meant something very different; it refers to his embarrassment about writing merely about the self, but more to his deep-set inability to focus on himself. Chekhov’s stories are journeys of empathy and imagination into other people; typically, they erase their narrator in order to let the characters talk. The more you read of Sontag’s stories, the more striking becomes her inability to do either of these two things. Another piece of memoir, “Debriefing”, for example, is about her friend Julia’s suicide. The story is a series of answers to questions the hapless Julia has failed to ask. She is barely there, while Sontag, on the other hand, is everywhere. In considering herself, the author considers her city – “I often leave the city. But I always come back” – and the fate of three black women to whom she obnoxiously gives the same name, on the grounds that they all work as cleaners. She adds a few observations about her friend, then the story resolves itself, again with a series of aphorisms in balanced sentences. “I want to save my soul, that timid wind”, “How I groaned under the burden of your friendship. But your death is heavier.” And: “You’re the tears in things. I’m not.” But we still don’t know why Julia is the “tears”: Sontag has not enough of the fiction writer’s craft to show us. Chekhov’s journeys into “the other” were so complete that his lady with the lapdog and sleepy girl still breathe from his pages: they are clothed in their time, but speak out of it. Sontag’s stories, in contrast, speak loudly and lengthily in her own grand voice, which sounds bombastic and antique. We can’t talk like that any more, from that central place full of books, from prodigious childhoods and fonts of knowledge that belong to elite individuals and self-confident cultural centres. This is not, contrary to one of her story titles, “the way we live now”. Now, knowledge is diffused; statements about the self flicker everywhere on screens and are everywhere conditional, commented upon, interrupted; and it is unacceptable, thankfully, to call all black women Doris. • Kate Clanchy’s The Not-Dead and the Saved is published by Picador.

There are few holidays more dedicated to tearing up the five-a-day-guidelines than this one, so if you take away not only the meat but the cream, then what’s left? Actually, this year there’s a lot left, as supermarkets are increasingly wise to the idea that plenty of vegans want to stuff their faces, too. With estimates that between 2 and 12% of British people now follow a vegetarian diet, it’s unsurprising that a vegetarian Christmas is well catered for by shops, but the rise of the “flexitarian” means that even non-vegans may buy and try vegan now, if it’s an option. It takes a bit of supermarket-hopping and a familiarity with an online checkout to do it, but with a little effort, there’s now a gluttonous array of choice. Christmas dinner is a roast with bits added on, and the majority of a roast is vegan anyway. There are a few tweaks that may need to be made – use oil to roast the potatoes instead of fat; swap butter for olive oil in the mash, and leave honey off the parsnips and carrots (you could swap in maple or agave syrup for sweetness). When it comes to the star of the show, the amount of effort you’re willing to put in will dictate your centrepiece. The ever-reliable Linda McCartney range’s new “roast beef” joint comes with a boozy-tasting red wine glaze and a remarkably beef-like flavour, which is great for vegans who like the taste of meat but not the methods, though it may be too meaty for some. Fry’s soy and quinoa Country Roast is a solid herby veggie roast, while Tofurky’s turkey and stuffing is a respectable substitute for the real thing. At the more artisan end of the faux butchers – there’s an emerging meat-substitute industry that reminds me of the craft brewery explosion – then Irish company Moodley Manor offers top-end luxury in its mammoth meat-free roast, with a sausage and breadcrumb stuffing inside that tastes like the real deal, while Scotland’s Sgaia Meats is serving up a new and limited version of their signature “mheat” vegan roast wrapped in maple-glazed rashers and filled with orange, hazelnut and pancetta stuffing. If you’re a no-meat-substitutes kind of vegan, the hardy nut roast is a perennial stand-in and most major supermarkets have a vegetable-based centrepiece, if you don’t fancy making your own. Ocado has a stuffed butternut squash made by Irish company Dee’s, while Tesco is pushing the boat out with cauliflower wellington. But the real joy of Christmas is in the trimmings, otherwise it would just be an ordinary Sunday. You can make bread sauce with a non-dairy milk, though most are likely to be too sweet – unsweetened almond milk is a good bet. For pig-free pigs in blankets, pick a fakon (fake bacon) and a brand of vegan mini sausage, and make up your own (I’d go for Moodley Manor’s bacon on Linda McCartney’s cocktail sausages). Ocado stocks Dee’s vegan sausage stuffing; while on the sauce front, most cranberry sauces will be vegan, and for the fancier meat-avoider in your life, there’s also Tideford organic vegan gravy with red miso. It’s surprisingly easy to avoid a fruit platter at dessert time, too. Asda’s own-brand mince pies are vegan, as are Waitrose Essential mince pies, and today dairy-free ice creams are available in most supermarkets. Or, if you’re the kind of person who pours cold Bailey’s on a steaming mince pie, then there’s even a vegan version of that – slosh on the gluggable Baileys Almande, available in Whole Foods, while sipping M&amp;S’s Gold Crème Brûlée Liqueur. For the determined and brave, if not foolhardy, it’s even possible to cook up a vegan cheese platter. Violife and VBites offer a variety of “cheeses”, though for this particular customer they’re a substitute too far. If you’re really determined, I’d go for a simple homemade cashew cheese using online recipes, which makes a good soft cheese for crackers. You can whip up an easy mushroom pâté at home, or Ocado does a VBites duck pâté if you’re more effort-free. So whether you’re the sole vegan at a meat feast or serving up a meat-free dinner for non-subscribers, step away from the stuffed red pepper: at last, food producers, from independent businesses to big supermarket chains, have made it possible for everyone to pig out this Christmas. As long as those pigs are creative plant-based versions of the real thing, of course. This article contains affiliate links to products.

A distinguished academic whose many books include the bestselling Europe: A History, Davies’s itinerary “was not dictated by any principle other than keeping on the move in the general direction of the sunrise”. Twelve of the 16 chapters focus on a place – these range from Baku in Azerbaijan, where Asia and Europe overlap, to Cornwall. Four chapters are thematic. Davies’s goal, he said, was roughly akin to that of Goethe’s “school of seeing”: “To test my powers of observation, to spot the recurring themes and catch the fleeting details. And then to tell the story.” His themes include the history, and subsequent marginalisation, of indigenous peoples. The sections on the first inhabitants of Tasmania are particularly gripping. Linguistic revival and language in general fascinate this author, too. He uses Chinese characters and Japanese kanji to illuminate toponyms of those countries and includes a section on Tahitian nature words. There is even a glossary of “Strine”, or Australian English. Davies is a literary man and quotes everyone from Dante to Aphra Behn to Alexander Blok. Bunyan, that master of allegorical travel, provides a kind of leitmotif. The passages of straightforward history in Beneath Another Sky are excellent, as one might expect, and of course, given the subject matter, parts of the book are gruelling, whether viewed through a long lens (war) or in close-up (a nine-year-old destitute British boy is transported for stealing toys). The chapter on Mauritius relates the unedifying episodes of Chagossian forcible deportation and Britain’s secrecy over the leasing of Diego Garcia in return for aircraft discounts. On a jollier note, Mauritius issued the first stamps in the British empire outside Britain, and Sir Seewoosagur Ramgoolam, the son of an illiterate Indian immigrant, rose to become his country’s first prime minister. Davies casts a wide cultural net throughout. The author’s sensitivity to the sweep of history binds the disparate parts of this book. He has spent a lifetime thinking about his craft and applies what he calls the daily task of orientation, or “finding one’s way” to historians. “Whatever their subject or period of interest, they have to navigate through Time and Space, establishing what happened in particular moments and places, and create a chronological narrative.” Amusing cultural comparisons enliven proceedings. “By sending Abel Tasman in search of the ‘Southland’, the lords of the Dutch East India Company were investigating a category of knowledge that the great epistemologist Donald Rumsfeld would have classified as a ‘known unknown’.” In Tasmania the author visits a museum of old and new art, which turns out to be “a temple of nihilist brainwashing”. He has let his opinions seep into this book more than he did in previous works – after all, he has earned the right to a little subjectivity. He writes plainly, for example, about the “horrible racist nonsense that underlay Hitler’s policy of Lebensraum”. In a long chapter on the history of aviation, Davies deploys his meticulous research skills to set out the probabilities and possibilities of what happened to downed airliner MH370. After many pages, he concludes: “It must be a near certainty that someone in the world knows more about MH370 than they have chosen to reveal.” But who? He gives clues. Maritime disasters also heave into view. Know the worst sea disaster in European history? It was during the first punic war in the third century BC, when 90,000 Roman soldiers drowned when a transport fleet sank off Carthage. Davies has an eye for the arresting detail, that all-important specificity. In the polar regions, a schooner captain is found frozen solid to his desk, his crew mummified in ice in their hammocks. “No food for 71 days,” the captain’s last diary entry read. “I’m the only one left.” The prose is crisp and clear, notwithstanding the occasional infelicity – an interlocutor “bends my ear” – and truism: a chapter on Texas begins: “The United States of America is a big country…” On the whole the style is chatty, even playful, and Davies is an amiable companion on the road. He often tells us what he eats. Hesse’s Handkäse mit Musik (a sour cheese), for example, “is famed for its flatulent counterpoint”. Beneath Another Sky is a plum pudding of a book. Davies includes squibs, anecdotes and what he calls “items of interesting irrelevance”, sometimes for sheer fun. Anthony Burgess’s tutor at Manchester, AJP Taylor, Davies tells us, wrote on one of Burgess’s essays: “Full of bright ideas insufficient to conceal a lack of knowledge.” In Singapore we learn that the island’s last tiger was shot from the balcony of Raffles hotel in 1902. This kind of detail lightens the statistics and data – though Davies never deploys either without a purpose. Most books are too long, but even at 742 pages this is not. Approaching 80, with strokes and cancer behind him, Davies has allowed himself to spread his wings. The final chapter, Imperium, is based on a lecture he delivered at various institutes while he was on his journeys. In it, he challenges the arguments of, for example, Niall Ferguson and Jared Diamond, who “rely on a binary… view of the world” – by which he means European and non-European. Davies’s pages on this topic will become essential reading for students of imperialism. He gives the last word to Indian politician Dr Shashi Tharoor: “No wonder that the sun never set on the [British] empire. Even God would never trust the English in the dark.” • Beneath Another Sky by Norman Davies is published by Allen Lane (£30).

Mr Richards had been having a thin time of it but three hurdles wins in the past 10 days, from just a handful of runners, have sent him to the top of our table. By contrast, Harry Fry, who had been soaring, has dropped a long way, Overtown Express having been his only success in the past fortnight, admittedly from just 13 runners; he will surely be back among the winners soon. The Henderson, Tizzard and Skelton camps continue in fine form, while Donald McCain is having his best run for years. But the powerful yards of Hobbs and Mulholland seem disappointingly quiet. Venetia Williams has not yet hit her stride, despite a couple of false dawns, but January is often a fruitful time for her. Today’s tips have been provided by John O’Hara, whose nap has, alas, become a non-runner. In that one’s absence, Archie Stevens (3.30) could be the pick of the Southwell card at odds of 7-2. He carries a penalty for his course and distance success last week, which still leaves him a stone below the mark he had at the start of the year. Jump racing fans must make do with Fontwell, where Roksana (1.45) is backable at 7-4. Dan Skelton’s mare gives weight away to all rivals but was quite a taking winner at Plumpton last month and could have a fitness advantage over The Vocalist, making her hurdles debut for Nicky Henderson after landing a bumper for Stuart Crawford in April.

With the return to surplus built on income tax revenue, any income tax cuts are unlikely to come before the next decade without either increases in other taxes or big cuts to government services. Amid the usual “free markets are great” rah-rah that the prime minister doled out to the Business Council of Australia on Monday night, Malcolm Turnbull also slipped in a line on income tax cuts, noting that he was: “Actively working with the treasurer and all my cabinet colleagues to ease the burden on middle-income Australians, while also meeting our commitment to return the budget to surplus.” This was a bit of a surprise given the current state of the budget is such that the government is projecting that a return to surplus only in 2020-21and that net debt at that point will total $366bn, or 17.6% of GDP. Even in the best of times, promising income tax cuts as the budget is in deficit is a courageous position to take for a political party that likes to prides itself on “budget responsibility”.It is even more courageous when the path back to surplus is built on a foundation of income tax revenue. Individual’s income tax has always been the biggest tax in the budget. During the mining-boom years it declined slightly in importance as company tax exploded in value from 3.3% of GDP in 1998-99 to5.3% of GDP in 2005-06. But in the current financial year, individual income tax accounts for just over half of all tax revenue. Now that in itself is a bit of a problem (the IMF and OECD have made calls for Australia to lessen its reliance on income tax) but it is a bigger problem for Turnbull and his call for tax cuts while also “meeting our commitment to return the budget to surplus.” The issue it that of the extra $88.1bn in tax revenue the government hopes to gain between now and 2020-21, $48.5bn of it is to come from individual income tax. This means that income tax is actually bearing a greater burden of the increase in tax than would be expected. Income tax makes up 50.6% of total tax revenue, but accounts for 55% of the increase in tax revenue between now and 2020-21. By contrast, company tax currently makes up 19.2% of total tax revenue and accounts for a similar 19.5% of the expected growth in tax revenue. The GST is actually predicted to become less important over the next four years as we continue to move our spending to non-GST items and services. Now $8.5bn of that extra income tax is to come from the rise in the Medicare levy, but overall the budget predicts that the next four years will see individual income tax revenue grow by more each year than it has in all but one of the past five years. This is partly based on a hope for continuing solid employment growth and partly on increased revenue via wages growth. As I noted last week, the budget predicts that by June next year, wages will be growing annually by 2.5% – something they haven’t done since June 2014. By June 2020-21 the budget further predicts they will be growing at 3.75%, which hasn’t happened since June 2011. If this does not come to pass, then the income tax figures are in great danger of being below expectations. On Tuesday night the governor of the Reserve Bank, Philip Lowe, gave the audience at the Australian Business Economists Annual Dinner little reason to expect that wages growth would pick up to that extent. Rather he noted that the growth in average hourly earnings “is running at the lowest rate since at least the 1960s”. You can understand however why Turnbull is concerned about cutting income tax. The bogeyman of bracket creep is a major factor. Bracket creep occurs when purely though wage inflation (ie a pay rise for doing the same job) you are pushed into a higher tax bracket – and thus you end up paying a higher average tax rate. This was the reason behind the government’s decision last year to raise the second highest tax bracket threshold from $80,000 to $87,000. The Parliamentary Budget Office predicts that by 2020-21 those on median incomes will see the biggest rise in their average tax rate – up 3.8% points – and the main reason for it is inflation: But the decision to raise the tax threshold from $80,000 to $87,000 cost $4bn over four years and delivered a tax cut of $315 to the roughly two-and-quarter million taxpayers earning over $87,000. Was the government, for example, to raise the next lowest threshold from $37,000 to $40,000, it would mean a $405 tax cut to the around seven-and-half million people earning over $37,000. So these things get expensive very quickly. And in an environment where the government is already basing its return to surplus on very optimistic wage-growth predictions, being able to keep to that path while simultaneously reducing the amount of revenue it will raise via income tax is not maths that adds up. At the very least the government would need to either cut government services or payments, or raise the money elsewhere. So while it is a nice little sentence in a speech that gets the desired headlines, it is unlikely to become anything close to reality until at least after 2020-21. And it is worth remembering that the reality will also contain the other side of the equation. You can either cut taxes and increase the deficit, or you can cut taxes while also cutting spending or raising other taxes in order to keep the budget unaffected. You cannot do both."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/nov/22/olivia-meads-25m-inheritance-slashed-after-appeal-from-mining-billionaires-estate","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-22T04:56:35Z","webTitle":"Olivia Mead's $25m inheritance slashed after appeal from mining billionaire's estate","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/nov/22/olivia-meads-25m-inheritance-slashed-after-appeal-from-mining-billionaires-estate","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/nov/22/olivia-meads-25m-inheritance-slashed-after-appeal-from-mining-billionaires-estate","fields":{"headline":"Olivia Mead's $25m inheritance slashed after appeal from mining billionaire's estate","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Olivia Mead, a millionaire heiress whose list of expenses included a $1.2m crystal-encrusted grand piano and $2,000 annual upkeep of her pet axolotl, has had her inheritance cut from $25m to $6.14m following an appeal from her deceased father’s estate. The 22-year-old is the youngest daughter of the Perth mining billionaire Michael Wright, whose father, Peter Wright, was a business associate of the late Lang Hancock. He was worth $2.7bn upon his death in 2012. Mead was not publicly connected to the powerful Wright family or her half-siblings until she challenged her father’s will, arguing that it did not adequately provide for her needs. She had originally been bequeathed a $3m trust fund that she would be able to access once she turned 30, provided she did not become an alcoholic, be convicted of a crime, knowingly have “any involvement or association whatsoever” with illicit drugs, or convert to any faith other than “traditional” Christian options. The supreme court found in Mead’s favour in early 2015 and increased her inheritance eight-fold to $25m, an amount the court’s master, Craig Sanderson, said would “not fall outside of the reasonable expectation of most members of the community”. It was more than the $20m Mead had demanded, which her lawyers had revised down to $12m before the surprise decision. Wright’s estate, acting on behalf of Wright’s much older children from his second marriage, filed an appeal one month later. On Wednesday, the full bench of the Western Australian supreme court set aside Sanderson’s orders, ruling that while Sanderson was correct to say that Mead had been inadequately provided for in the original will: “The exercise of his discretion to order that provision be made for the respondent in the sum of $25m was flawed.” In a lengthy written judgment, the court found that Sanderson made a number of “material errors” in calculating the size of Mead’s inheritance, saying the focus should have been on what constituted “proper maintenance” and that the initial finding that Mead was “honest” and “not a gold-digger” were not relevant. “The capital sum should be sufficient to enable the respondent to purchase a reasonably substantial house with part of the capital sum and to invest the balance so that she will receive a reasonably substantial annuity for the remainder of her life,” the appeal court’s president, Michael Buss, said. Buss said a sum of $6.14m would allow Mead to buy a $1.5m house in Perth within four years and deliver an annuity of $100,000 per year for the rest of her life, indexed against wage growth. Mead’s original list of life expenses budgeted for a $2.5m house, a $250,000 diamond-encrusted bass guitar to match the crystal-encrusted piano, an annual shoe budget of $6,000 and life maintenance costs, including pilates classes, to the age of 96."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/nov/22/chinese-censor-feted-by-mark-zuckerberg-is-accused-of-corruption","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-22T03:17:54Z","webTitle":"Chinese censor feted by Mark Zuckerberg is accused of corruption","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/nov/22/chinese-censor-feted-by-mark-zuckerberg-is-accused-of-corruption","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/nov/22/chinese-censor-feted-by-mark-zuckerberg-is-accused-of-corruption","fields":{"headline":"Chinese censor feted by Mark Zuckerberg is accused of corruption","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The former top official for internet censorship in China, who travelled to the heart of Silicon Valley to promote China’s vision for the web, is under investigation for corruption, the Communist party’s anti-corruption agency has said. Lu Wei was the powerful and flamboyant head of the Cyberspace Administration of China from 2014 until June 2016 and he came to personify China’s model for internet control. He travelled to the United States, meeting with the CEOs of Facebook, Amazon and Apple, and held court when tech titans visited China. Lu was being investigated for “serious disciplinary violations”, a euphemism for graft, the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection said on its website. He stepped down from running the Cyberspace Administration in 2016, leading to rumours he had fallen out of favour. President Xi Jinping has led a far reaching anti-corruption drive since coming to power five years ago and has said graft is the paramount threat to the ruling Communist party. The campaign has seen nearly 1.4m party members punished and Xi vowed to continue rooting out graft during his second five-year term which began last month. Critics say elements of the anti-graft campaign have been used to eliminate Xi’s enemies and root out political factions that oppose him. Lu is the most prominent official to fall since Xi’s second term began and the anti-corruption agency pointed to Lu’s case as a sign the drive will continue. “Lu Wei being investigated by the organisation is the best proof of this determination and resolve,” the agency said in a commentary. Lu was unique among Chinese officials who usually endeavour to project themselves as dull technocrats. Xu Lin, the official who replaced Lu, has kept a low profile and is seen as an ally of Xi. But Lu publicly rebuked internet personalities and his visits with Tim Cook of Apple and Jeff Bezos of Amazon were widely covered by Chinese media. In a sign of his power, Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s CEO, famously pandered to Lu during a tour of the social network’s office, prominently displaying a book of Xi’s speeches on his desk. Facebook is currently blocked in China and Zuckerberg has been on a charm offensive to reverse the ban. Lu rejected claims that China censors the internet, despite thousand of websites being inaccessible from within the country. “It is a misuse of words if you say ‘content censorship’,” Lu said. “But no censorship does not mean there is no management.” China was ranked last in internet freedom, below Syria and Iran, in an annual report by Freedom House, a US pro-democracy thinktank."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/nov/22/labor-and-lnp-scramble-to-bed-down-seats-before-queensland-election","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-22T03:05:51Z","webTitle":"Labor and LNP scramble to bed down seats before Queensland election","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/nov/22/labor-and-lnp-scramble-to-bed-down-seats-before-queensland-election","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/nov/22/labor-and-lnp-scramble-to-bed-down-seats-before-queensland-election","fields":{"headline":"Labor and LNP scramble to bed down seats before Queensland election","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"As the Queensland election campaign heads into its final stretch, Labor’s main message of “chaos” under a Liberal National party-One Nation government has been damaged by one of its own, while Adani continues to cause headaches for both major parties. With Queenslanders preparing to head to the polls on Saturday, no clear victor has emerged, leaving both the LNP and Labor scrambling to bed down seats. Labor has consolidated its message to one line – “a clear choice” – as it seeks to highlight what it says will be the “cuts and chaos” under a Tim Nicholls-led government. The LNP leader has said he is willing to work with One Nation in the event of a hung parliament. But the Labor campaign is reeling from the damage done by one of its own MPs, the former police minister Jo-Ann Miller, who sought out the One Nation leader, Pauline Hanson, in front of the media on Tuesday, embracing her and presenting her with a gift for her new grandson. Media at the event have reported that One Nation was aware of Miller’s intentions. Miller and Labor have maintained it was a coincidence of the campaign and a “common decency” to present a gift for a new baby. But the friendly meeting may have damaged Labor’s attempts to paint itself as standing apart from Hanson’s party, which is predicted to take seats across north and central Queensland, as well as some outer-urban electorates in the south-east. “The real issue here is what is going to happen in three days’ time, on Saturday,” Annastacia Palaszczuk said from Bundaberg on Wednesday, moments before her team attempted to keep her away from signs declaring: “It’ll be grim under Tim.” The placement of “grim” seemed a little too close for comfort for those focused on optics. “That is the real fundamental issue and it is about a choice, it is fundamentally about a clear choice,” she said. Labor is headed through the Wide Bay region, which suffers from some of the highest youth unemployment rates in the state, in an attempt to win back voters vulnerable to One Nation’s message. In this region the decision to veto the $1bn Adani train line loan is not as popular as it is in the south-east, with Wide Bay, like central Queensland, one of the main regions that supplies labour to the mines. At a Townsville leaders’ debate – which Palaszczuk did not attend, having said she had a prior commitment – the loan veto also proved controversial, with the audience in support of Adani receiving the northern Australia infrastructure facility funds, while protesters launched from under a stage to speak out against it. Balancing south-eastern priorities with those of the rest of Queensland has proved particularly difficult for the two main parties in this campaign, with One Nation and the Greens taking advantage of the contradictory views. The Greens leader, Richard Di Natale, was in the electorate of South Brisbane, considered the strongest chance of a Greens victory, on Wednesday morning and said he felt “the same sort of energy” as in the Victorian seat of Northcote, which Labor lost to the Greens in a byelection last week. “Increasingly people are saying we need a genuine alternative to politics as usual,” he said. “There is no question that Adani is shaping up as one of the central issues of this election campaign.” One Nation is spreading the same message, with Hanson expected to head to Bundaberg and its surrounds as she continues her own tour of vulnerable seats. The LNP is about to begin an electorate blitz of its own, heading from north Queensland to the Gold Coast in the final days, while Labor’s “cuts express” featuring senior ministers continues its own journey through 50 electorates. Palaszczuk’s campaign will continue to head south, with both major parties expected to release their costings on Thursday."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2017/nov/22/australian-bird-of-the-year-survey-new-poll-ruffles-feathers-in-canberra","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-22T05:17:34Z","webTitle":"Australian bird of the year survey: new poll ruffles feathers in Canberra","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/nov/22/australian-bird-of-the-year-survey-new-poll-ruffles-feathers-in-canberra","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/nov/22/australian-bird-of-the-year-survey-new-poll-ruffles-feathers-in-canberra","fields":{"headline":"Australian bird of the year survey: new poll ruffles feathers in Canberra","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Forget Bennelong or New England, the battle for Australia’s favourite bird is on. As the inaugural bird of the year poll launched on Monday, the nation’s celebrities, political leaders and media outlets immediately began their campaigns. The divisive Australian white ibis leapt to a commanding lead and the powerful owl, with the aid of Russian hackers, rose up the ranks. But in a crowded field of diverse native birds, endorsements rang out for nearly all contenders. The federal opposition leader, Bill Shorten, cut his ties to the magpie, currently coming second, and set his sights on the emu (whose image sits above Parliament House), in what must surely be an early election pitch. The Greens leader, Richard Di Natale, chose the Gang-gang cockatoo, another Canberra icon (“Incredible plumage but it sounds like a rusty door”), while fellow senator Nick McKim picked the wedge-tailed eagle, and Janet Rice, the hooded plover. Scott Ludlam, 2017’s first dual citizen, again displayed divided loyalties. The former senator endorsed the Carnaby’s black cockatoo at 3.45pm on Monday, but by 8.30pm, he suddenly declared himself “Team Bin Chicken”. Malcolm Turnbull, the prime minister, was asked but did not respond, opening himself up to a string of less-than-flattering replies. But the government’s leader of the house, Christopher Pyne, did tell ABC Radio’s Patricia Karvelas he liked the black-faced spoonbill. Sally McManus, the secretary of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, picked the azure kingfisher, while Kristina Keneally, Labor’s star recruit for the snap Bennelong byelection, stayed on message and went for the alliterative kookaburra. The CSIRO, while not advocating a vote, did describe the ibis as “majestic” and seemed to celebrate its lead with a large love heart. Youth radio station Triple J was far bolder and formally endorsed the magpie (“beautiful, glorious, sublime”). Australian electronic music duo, Peking Duk, somehow did not back the Australian wood duck (left off the poll but subject to a brewing write-in campaign), and went with lyrebird. With debate raging, and families, political parties and workplaces divided, voting is open until 9 December."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/nov/22/wednesday-briefing-chancellor-has-chequered-budget-prospects","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-22T06:32:42Z","webTitle":"Wednesday briefing: Chancellor has chequered budget prospects","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/nov/22/wednesday-briefing-chancellor-has-chequered-budget-prospects","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/nov/22/wednesday-briefing-chancellor-has-chequered-budget-prospects","fields":{"headline":"Wednesday briefing: Chancellor has chequered budget prospects","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Top story: ‘Hard job but he makes it harder for himself’ Hello – it’s Warren Murray with the news in a nutshell. Philip Hammond is in a “make or break” position as he delivers the autumn budget today, senior Tories have warned. The chancellor of the exchequer is under pressure from Brexiters to make leaving the EU sound like a good thing, while winning back voters by improving housing affordability, boosting education, increasing NHS funding and easing the public sector pay freeze. Rafael Behr sums up Hammond’s predicament: “He must build houses, but not in anyone’s backyard. He must raise revenue, but not from taxes.” Hammond’s March budget was overshadowed by a failed attempt to increase national insurance for the self-employed; and this time around, saying on national television that there are no unemployed people in Britain has not helped his cause. “He’s got a hard job but the way he deals with it makes it harder for himself,” said one Conservative source. Here are the five charts you need to see before the red briefcase creaks open a bit after midday. * * * The reluctant idol – David Cassidy, star of The Partridge Family, has died aged 67. Cassidy had been hospitalised in Florida for several days after kidney and liver failure. He became a teenage hearthrob after being cast as Keith Partridge in the 1970s sitcom about a fictitious band. The show was such a hit that Cassidy went on to sing on eight Partridge Family albums before launching a solo career. He was said to dislike his TV character’s clean-cut image and the adulation it brought. Cassidy struggled with alcoholism over the years. This February, still performing, he fell down during a concert, later revealing he had dementia – the disease that killed his mother and maternal grandfather. “David died surrounded by those he loved, with joy in his heart and free from the pain that had gripped him for so long,” said a statement from his family released early this morning. * * * New low for Uber – Uber has admitted it paid off hackers following a massive privacy breach and did not tell the 57 million people whose details were stolen. Names, email addresses and phone numbers were exposed, as well as the licence details of about 600,000 drivers in the United States. Uber’s chief security officer, Joe Sullivan, was one of two employees fired over the affair. “None of this should have happened and I will not make excuses for it,” said Uber’s chief executive, Dara Khosrowshahi. Robert Judge, an Uber driver in Pittsburgh, said he only found out through the media: “The hack and the cover-up is typical Uber only caring about themselves.” The ride-hailing company has been denied a new operating licence for London after being plagued by scandals – from its secret “greyball” software, to a toxic internal culture that led to the forced resignation of its founder, Travis Kalanick. * * * Hopes for ‘a better Zimbabwe’ – Robert Mugabe has resigned as Zimbabwe’s president, sparking jubilation across the country. The autocratic leader had refused to stand aside following a military coup, but bowed to the inevitable as MPs and senators met to impeach him. After opposition and government politicians received the news, jubilation quickly spread into the streets. Emmerson “Crocodile” Mnangagwa, the vice-president whose dismissal led to Mugabe’s downfall, is likely to be sworn in as president. Our editorial asks whether the country’s new leadership will be capable of undoing the damage wrought by 37 years of misrule by Mugabe and Zanu-PF. And Simon Tisdall points out this morning that other autocratic African leaders might have have reason to fear a similar fate. * * * ‘He is not going to die’ – Dramatic footage has emerged of a North Korean soldier being shot at by his compatriots as he desperately flees to the South. The video, released on Wednesday by the UN command in the South, shows the soldier, who defected last week, racing towards the border village of Panmunjom in a military vehicle, then escaping on foot across the demilitarised zone (DMZ). North Korean soldiers open fire and he lies collapsed on the ground before South Korean soldiers drag him to safety. The defector, who was shot five times, is recovering in a South Korean hospital after a string of life-saving operations. “The reason that he defected, risking death and facing a barrage of gunshots, was because he had positive hopes about South Korea,” lead surgeon Lee Cook-jong told the press. * * * Delicate genius at work – The Francis Crick Institute, London’s shiny new £700m cathedral to biomedical science, is proving too noisy for some of the bright minds trying to produce the next breakthrough. The open-plan layout was meant to foster collaboration. Nicholas Luscombe, leader of one of the Crick’s research groups: “Some people like the background noise as if they were working in a cafe. Some want absolute silence and it’s not great for that.” On the other hand, “you keep bumping into people and that has created new collaborations for me”. Ways of quietening things down without losing the creative foment are being examined. * * * Grip of the grape – Maybe gin really can make you depressed. An international survey has found that spirits are often associated with feelings of energy, confidence and sexiness – but on the flip side, anger and tearfulness. Red wine and beer are linked to relaxation, but wine is also blamed for tiredness. (It feels like we need more specifics for this to be of practical use. Cabernet or pinot noir? Scotch or vodka? etc) Drinking was found more likely to be linked to feelings of relaxation and tiredness when done at home; confidence, sexiness, energy – and feeling ill or aggressive – were more likely when out. On a side note, after she was criticised for failing to hold her glass by the stem, here is some wine-drinking advice for Theresa May. Lunchtime read: Striking back against the empire myth The English don’t know their history, Salman Rushdie once remarked, because so much of it happened overseas. That would change, Afua Hirsch argues, if Britain had a museum of empire to make sure colonial crimes are never forgotten. “Britain’s empire is cast as a great moral achievement, and its collapse as an act of casual generosity, without any hint at the irreconcilability of the two,” writes Hirsch. There are museums of the Holocaust, and of slavery. “That there is not a single museum dedicated to empire, the historical episode with the most profound consequences for modern British identity, is nothing short of remarkable.” Sport In the face of increased pre-series sledging, Joe Root has reminded Australia that it is England who have been the dominant force during recent Ashes encounters. Jürgen Klopp admits Liverpool stopped playing at half-time against Sevilla, after they surrendered a 3-0 lead, while Manchester City are grateful for Raheem Sterling’s late winner against Feyenoord in the Champions League. Sam Simmonds is poised for a first England start after Nathan Hughes was ruled out of England’s final autumn Test against Samoa on Saturday. Business Asian markets have performed well this morning on the back of strong corporate profit figures. Reuters reported Japan’s Nikkei was up 0.8% and South Korea’s Kospi climbed 0.4%. The pound was buying US$1.33 and €1.13 overnight. The papers The end of Robert Mugabe’s 37-year rule in Zimbabwe and the looming British budget dominate the papers today. The Guardian, the digital Independent and the Times all splash on jubilation on the streets of Harare after the president finally gave in to a military coup, political opposition and popular sentiment. The Telegraph goes with a story about Theresa May being at war with the chancellor over his “uninspiring” budget. The paper reports that No 10 was anxious that the financial statement would “fall flat” and at the last minute ordered the Treasury to rush out an announcement on schools. On the same subject, the Mirror has an exclusive claiming that May has cut $413m from police funding when she claimed it was safe. In other news, the Mail is outraged on behalf of savers, and echoes the deputy governor of the Bank of England by calling on them to “Boycott the greedy banks” for not passing on the rate rise.

At a gala dinner in Canberra on Tuesday, Rinehart gave the inaugural agricultural and related industries award to Joyce, describing him as a “champion of the industry”. Labor immediately took aim at the award, with the opposition leader, Bill Shorten, labelling it a “$40,000 cash present”. Joyce has said he will refuse the cash. The Nationals leader, a close personal friend of Rinehart and former agriculture and water minister, is currently battling for his political life in the New England byelection after the high court ruled him ineligible to sit in parliament because of dual New Zealand citizenship. Rinehart thanked Joyce for taking “time out of your campaigning schedule to come here – to be here for the industry you love and support”. “What a great voice for Australian agriculture,” she said. “The agricultural industry is fortunate to have had such a dedicated, understanding and enthusiastic minister – one with years of first-hand experience – a real Aussie country boy and boy, do we hope you return.” Footage of the event shows Joyce stood up to accept the award and giant cheque, before modestly exclaiming “hooley dooley – rightio”. In addition to being the chair of Hancock Prospecting, Rinehart has extensive agricultural holdings and is the part owner of the $386m S Kidman and Co cattle company which has leasehold over 80,000 sq km in Australia’s north. At a press conference on Wednesday, Shorten asked: “Why is a mining millionaire giving a Turnbull government minister a $40,000 cash present? “This is very unhealthy for our democracy,” he said. “It doesn’t look right, it doesn’t smell right. This is very, very unusual and concerning conduct.” A spokesman for Joyce told Guardian Australia he “literally had no idea” he would be receiving the award. He dismissed Shorten’s criticisms as “completely irrelevant” because Joyce will decline the $40,000 cash prize. Labor’s agriculture spokesman, Joel Fitzgibbon, said the award had turned the National Agriculture Day event into “the festival of Barnaby”. “Gina’s agriculture award could have gone to many people in agriculture – our innovative farmers, entrepreneurs, scientists, environmentalists and those who add value to our products,” he said. “But no, it went to Barnaby Joyce who is facing an expensive byelection in New England.” In her speech, Rinehart praised Australia’s 130,000 agribusinesses, which employ 1.6m people, noting their contribution through “the income tax they pay ... company taxes, payroll tax, stamp duty and licenses”. “If we didn’t have a sustainable agriculture industry, who would be paying the then missing taxes to support our defence, police, roads, airports, elderly, parks, public sporting facilities and much more.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/dec/30/cook-islands-vaimaanga-resort-murder-curse-hotels","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-30T15:00:04Z","webTitle":"Curse of the Cook Islands – and a chance to turn derelict hotel into a tourist hotspot","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/dec/30/cook-islands-vaimaanga-resort-murder-curse-hotels","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/dec/30/cook-islands-vaimaanga-resort-murder-curse-hotels","fields":{"headline":"Curse of the Cook Islands – and a chance to turn derelict hotel into a tourist hotspot","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Half-submerged by a jungle and populated by cows, chickens and goats, it is one of the more unusual tourist attractions on the South Pacific island of Rarotonga: the “cursed” Sheraton hotel complex, a long-abandoned luxury resort that has lain derelict for a quarter of a century. The crumbling, graffiti-covered buildings are overgrown with creepers. The only human visitors to the 70-acre site in Vaimaanga pay a small fee to explore what has become known as the biggest white elephant in the South Pacific. The Italian-backed hotel project, which began in the late 1980s, was designed to revolutionise tourism in the remote Cook Islands by providing the tiny nation with its first five-star resort. But the house of cards collapsed at the 11th hour, with the project 80% complete, amid allegations of mafia involvement and money laundering back in Italy. The Cook Islands government was left with a debt of $120m and was almost bankrupted. In the years since, repeated attempts to finish the project have foundered, but now a new effort to salvage the buildings is under way, and could have an even bigger impact on the tiny Pacific state than the original plans were expected to. Tim Tepaki, a Cook Islander who has been involved in property development in New Zealand, claims to have hundreds of millions of dollars in Chinese backing. He hopes to rebuild the complex and turn the Pacific backwater into a favourite destination for tourists from China. Until now tourism in the Cooks – a nation of 15 islands scattered across an area the size of India – has relied mainly on visitors from Australia and New Zealand, who tend to focus on the capital Rarotonga and the atoll of Aitutaki, a 50-minute flight north. But China’s influence in the strategically important Pacific region is growing – in the past 10 years it has signalled its interest in the Cook Islands by building a new court house, police station, sports arena and a school. Now the focus could be about to switch to tourism. However, Tepaki faces an uphill struggle, and not just because of misgivings about Chinese influence in the country. His previous attempt to salvage the hotel in the early 2000s stalled and was finally ended by the financial crash. He is not alone in having seen his efforts fail. Many locals believe the troubled history of the site has a significant role to play. In pre-colonial times, it was the scene of bloody battles between rival tribes, and ancient spirits are said to patrol the area. It is also the subject of a bitter ownership dispute that dates back more than a century and gave rise to the curse that is still said to hang over the area. In the early 20th century, the land was claimed by Rarotonga’s paramount chief, Pa Ariki. However, a rival clan also claimed ownership and things came to a head in 1911 when a European settler, William Wigmore, shot and killed the leader of that family, More Uriatua. The victim’s daughter, Metua, then placed the curse, which condemned any business on the land to fail unless it was returned to its rightful owners. Wigmore escaped prison for the killing but in the years that followed the family had business troubles. His plantation eventually failed and, decades later, attempts to use the land to cultivate fruit ended when a food factory closed. In the 1980s, Italian businessmen contacted the Cook Islands government with a plan to open a five-star resort on the site. A deal was agreed that would see a hotel built and then managed by the Sheraton group. But the jinx was reintroduced in dramatic fashion in 1990 at the sod-turning ceremony for the hotel, when Metua’s grandson, More Rua, entered the site in the traditional dress of a high priest and renewed the curse in front of hundreds of onlookers. Before police could remove him he planted his spear on the rock bearing the plaque commemorating the start of building work, which shattered. Three years later, with the project almost complete, the Italian financing was abruptly cut off and the building contractor went under. Meanwhile, the costs of the project had ballooned and the Cook Islands government, which had underwritten the plan, was left with a bill of $120m, enough to cripple the tiny nation of 15,000 people. It was one of a range of factors that forced the country into cost-cutting measures, which led to mass redundancies and a wave of depopulation as locals headed to New Zealand to find work. But the hotel remained 80% complete and still appeared an attractive proposition to investors willing to pick up the pieces. The first attempt to complete it was spearheaded by a group from Japan and Hawaii but their efforts came to naught when the lead investor was arrested for tax fraud. A later attempt to establish a Hilton-branded resort with a casino failed amid protests from locals opposed to gambling. Tepaki’s first effort to complete the resort included efforts to lift the curse. His plan was scuppered by the financial crash of 2008. Most recently another hotel chain, Mirage Group, tried and failed to get the project off the ground. Now the lease, still owned by Pa Ariki, is up for grabs again and Tepaki hopes his latest plan will finally see the project finished. But the curse remains in place and the current head of the More family, septuagenarian Amoa Amoa, is steadfast in refusing to lift it. He stresses that the curse applies only to businesses and was not set to harm individual people. “There is no reason for any business to fail apart from the curse,” he says. “We are not opposed to the plans, but they cannot happen until the land is back with the More family.” Local broadcaster and historian William Framhein also believes in the curse. The site, he says, is a “spiritual” place and not even the weight of Chinese backing will overcome the jinx. “It has a pretty good track record so far,” he says. “And here, Taunga More has more authority than Confucius.” But Tepaki has not been deterred. In the 25 years that developers have battled the spirits of Vaimaanga, the rest of Rarotonga has prospered, and 150,000 tourists now visit the country each year. Tepaki says backing from the Chinese-led Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank will ensure his plan’s success, and claims that China has offered the Cook Islands government hundreds of millions in support through the bank. In addition to completing the hotel, Tepaki intends to build sister resorts on some of the more remote islands, which currently have very few tourists. Tepaki and his company, Merchant of Paradise, have sought to pre-qualify to tender to obtain the lease. And with the site’s well-documented and difficult history expected to put many rivals off, Tepaki is confident of success and is adamant his plan is the only viable option for a tiny slice of Polynesia where the past and the future appear set on collision course. This might be good news for Rarotonga and Aitutaki, which are thriving tourist destinations, but for the remaining islands, where standards of living are far lower, the prospect is worrying as they could lose access to aid money, needed to fund infrastructure projects. Earlier this year Tepaeru Herrmann, the Cook Islands’ foreign affairs secretary, said that developed nation status was the “worst case scenario” for the country. Whether Tepaki succeeds or not remains to be seen, but his vision is clear. “We are following the lead of China,” he says. “They are now the main global power and we want to take their help and use their mentality here to help us.” • This article was amended on 21 March 2018 to clarify that: the late 1980s allegations related to activities in Italy, not the Cook islands; Tim Tepaki has both Cook Islands and NZ connections; failure of a Wigmore fruit cultivation business was caused by a food factory closure; and a range of factors, not just the failure of a government-underwritten plan for the hotel project, led the country into cost-cutting. On 23 March a reference to one discontinued proposal was omitted."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/nov/22/pauline-hanson-likens-palaszczuk-to-spoilt-brat-for-ruling-out-one-nation-deal","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-22T08:02:11Z","webTitle":"Pauline Hanson likens Palaszczuk to 'spoilt brat' for ruling out One Nation deal","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/nov/22/pauline-hanson-likens-palaszczuk-to-spoilt-brat-for-ruling-out-one-nation-deal","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/nov/22/pauline-hanson-likens-palaszczuk-to-spoilt-brat-for-ruling-out-one-nation-deal","fields":{"headline":"Pauline Hanson likens Palaszczuk to 'spoilt brat' for ruling out One Nation deal","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Pauline Hanson has likened the Queensland premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, to a “spoilt brat” for ruling out a deal with One Nation. Arriving in Bundaberg just as the Labor campaign left, Hanson, who remains the most visible One Nation asset in Queensland, despite not running in Saturday’s state election, lashed out at Palaszczuk’s continued criticism of the party. Palaszczuk’s insistence that Labor would rather go into opposition than form government with One Nation has become its strongest attack line against the Liberal National party, which is directly preferencing One Nation in 50 of the 61 seats it is running in, as well as admitting, indirectly, it would form government with One Nation, if necessary. The opposition leader, Tim Nicholls, who has previously said he would work with the parliament Queenslanders delivered, was unable to answer “yes or no” to the question of whether he would form government with One Nation on Tuesday during a radio quiz, instead opting for “pass”. Hanson has responded with the line that the major parties are choosing not to respect the will of the people, in the same way Donald Trump’s campaign used Hillary Clinton’s “basket of deplorables” comment against the Democrat campaign last year. “I don’t think the premier knows what she is doing actually, I think she is in such a turmoil over this and she is actually needs to get out of the sandpit and be the leader for this state,” Hanson said. “Because the way she is carrying on, it is not leadership, it is not quality. “To say you won’t work with One Nation, it is just ridiculous. It’s like a spoilt brat, she is carrying on like a spoilt kid, and if that is what leadership means then I think she is heading down the wrong path and Tim Nicholls, he needs to grow up and make a decision, because people want clear decision in this state. They want leaders who will make clear decisions. Neither one seems to be able to do it.” Palaszczuk, whose attack line was damaged when one of her former ministers sought Hanson out to embrace her in front of the cameras, despite Labor’s “no One Nation” policy, said she would not “respond to name calling” but disputed she did not respect Queenslanders who wanted to vote for Hanson’s candidates. “I respect everybody,” she said from Toowoomba, west of Brisbane, which has become a key battleground this election. “However, when it comes to the deal between Tim Nicholls and One Nation, I do not share their values. I do not share One Nation values and I will not support that deal and, if that means going into opposition, I will go into opposition rather than be confronted with the values of One Nation. “I don’t support their views when it comes to restricting gun ownership, I don’t support their views when it comes to vaccination. I wholeheartedly believe that children need to be immunised. “And I support the payment of penalty rates and what we have seen is Senator Pauline Hanson, and let’s not forget she is a senator, Senator Pauline Hanson has voted with Malcolm Turnbull 85% of the time.” With polls showing the path to 47 seats and an outright majority in the unicameral parliament remains elusive for both major parties, the question of what will happen in a hung parliament has become one of the hardest for Queensland politicians to answer. Labor has done its best to paint One Nation and the LNP with the same brush, while Nicholls accused Palaszczuk of lying about her no-deals-for-power promise."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2017/nov/22/womens-ashes-success-a-turning-point-in-public-interest","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-21T22:45:57Z","webTitle":"Women's Ashes success a turning point in public interest","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/nov/22/womens-ashes-success-a-turning-point-in-public-interest","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/nov/22/womens-ashes-success-a-turning-point-in-public-interest","fields":{"headline":"Women's Ashes success a turning point in public interest","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"In July this year, everyone said that the World Cup final felt like a turning point. You don’t get 27,000 people to a women’s cricket match and not think that something extraordinary is going on. But the truth of turning points is that you can’t in the moment judge whether they’re real or perceived. It has taken the Women’s Ashes in Australia this past month to show the extent of the turn. Australia originally lagged behind England in embracing the game. The 2015 Ashes was played at intimate cricket grounds, selling out some matches with crowds in excess of 5000. The 2013-14 version in Australia was nowhere near that. Attendances at the Perth Test were in the low hundreds, while the Twenty20s were sparsely attended curtain-raisers for a meaningless men’s series. Olympiads stack up like sedimentary layers, and the difference from four years ago to now is extraordinary. The day-night Test match drew over 12,600 across its duration, while the three T20 matches drew a bit over or a bit under 4000 spectators apiece. Most games were televised (although the most important match – the Test – was not, and games were first shown on 9Gem rather than Nine), with the peak was over half a million viewers in a population of 20 million. In the time since that WACA Test, women’s cricket has gone from being an incredibly niche interest to something with mainstream recognition. It’s no televised talent/cooking/renovation/dance show, but people treat it as something they’re at least vaguely aware of, which makes them far more welcoming to the concept. That was illustrated during the day-night Test, where a festive crowd involved plenty of people there for the event, then soaking up information about the cricket in the meantime. You have to build it for them to come, and Cricket Australia definitely got most parts right as far as schedule and location. Staging games in Coffs Harbour is a debatable choice in terms of capacity to draw a crowd, though the pitch for the two ODIs there was outstanding. That’s part of a broader debate on whether the team should make a habit of playing in smaller regional centres as a way of bringing elite cricket to those places, or whether cities like Melbourne and Adelaide can offer better audiences if included in future editions. Perhaps this is a pipe dream, but you couldn’t help thinking that perhaps the large numbers of boys watching female athletes and queuing for autographs over the last month might lead to some social betterment as their generation grows up. It was also significant that the marriage equality plebiscite passed so strongly midway through a series involving so many gay players. The big screens at two grounds broadcast Alex Blackwell discussing her identity as part of marking her 250th game for Australia, while Megan Schutt posted online about her plans for a wedding, and smacked down the few inevitable trolls with grace. Danni Wyatt, an all-rounder promoted to open, became the first woman to make a hundred in a T20 run chase. Australian opener Beth Mooney’s T20 series included unbeaten innings of 86 and 117. Schutt was an absolute gun in the white-ball formats, flying under the radar but finishing with 18 wickets. Perry took 10 and averaged 70 with the bat, while Heather Knight was named player of the series after four important half-centuries. It’s interesting to think how much the series result relied on the first game in Brisbane. The teams tied on eight points apiece, after Australia won the ODIs by a game, England did the same in the T20s, and the Test was drawn. But England really should have won that first ODI in Brisbane, only to fall apart towards the end of their batting innings, and again with the ball in defending it. Having arrived in Brisbane for two weeks of solid rain, a lack of decent practice before the series may have been decisive. In the second game, Rachael Haynes eased any questions about her position as temporary captain with a brilliant 89 not out from 56 balls. A few more such knocks may be needed if Haynes is to continue her career once Meg Lanning returns from shoulder surgery. But whatever the status, Haynes led Australia to retaining an Ashes trophy. That doesn’t go away. Knight similarly led from the front to win England the third ODI, with another big score on that fast Coffs deck, before a far inferior pitch guaranteed that the North Sydney Test would be a draw. The conditions and the lack of long-format cricket available to them made the Test a tough ask for most players. Perry was the star of the show, working the slow and tired pitch with reservoirs of patience for a famous double-hundred. Australia retained the trophy with an easy run chase in the first T20 despite dropping five catches. But England hit their stride, bowling well to derail a chase of 152 on Sunday, then two nights later racking up the biggest ever run chase in a women’s T20I by passing Australia’s 181. Wyatt and Mooney provided twin hundreds in that run-fest, as the series finished with honours even. “The word bittersweet was used and I think that’s a pretty good description,” said Australia coach Matthew Mott after the final loss. “To me it’s a just a series of missed opportunity. I think we’re the better cricket team but we can’t really say that because it ended up 8-all. But we retained the Ashes and at the end of the day we’re happier than them.” Knight was philosophical. “We’re still really disappointed about those Ashes, but to turn it around really quickly after that, after the disappointment in North Sydney, we knew we wanted to come away with some pride and to finish strongly. To finish 8-8 is a tour we can be proud of.” It’s a tour everyone can be proud of, as women’s cricket continues to build its standing with a public ever more receptive. On the southern side of the planet, this Ashes has done wonders for the visibility of the game and the players. The thing about turning points is they don’t do much good unless progress is made after the turn. By November, we know that it has."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"politics/live/2017/nov/22/autumn-budget-2017-philip-hammond-tax-spending-growth-deficit-politics-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-22T17:44:55Z","webTitle":"Autumn budget 2017: Hammond announces stamp duty changes and slower growth - as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2017/nov/22/autumn-budget-2017-philip-hammond-tax-spending-growth-deficit-politics-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/live/2017/nov/22/autumn-budget-2017-philip-hammond-tax-spending-growth-deficit-politics-live","fields":{"headline":"Autumn budget 2017: Hammond announces stamp duty changes and slower growth - as it happened","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"In the spring, around the time Philip Hammond was preparing his first budget, some of those close to him suggested that the March budget was never intended to be that special because he was saving his big, structural changes for the autumn. Since then, the world has moved on somewhat and he came to the Commons today having made little impact with pre-budget announcements and with the expectation bar at what seemed like a Treasury all-time low. It felt as if he would be doing well not mess up. And actually, by those criteria, he has succeeded. The budget was well received by his colleagues and, so far, nothing has fully unravelled. True, the Office for Budget Responsibility has exposed his main headline-grabbing measure, the abolition of stamp duty for first-time buyers for homes worth up to £300,000, as a £600m gimmick that will just push up prices. But, even though it would be nice to live in a world where bad policy always amounts to bad politics, sadly we don’t, and it is hard to see Hammond suffering any penalty for his home owner subsidy (apart from when he realises he has not got £600m to spend on something else). The Tory tribe (MPs and newspapers) will never complain about a tax cut, and it is not a measure that will be voted down in the Commons. (For example, we can’t even be sure Labour will vote against it.) Otherwise, it was a mildly expansionist budget, with Hammond turning the taps on to the value of £9bn just as the UK is leaving the EU. The Tory Brexiters who view Hammond with suspicion will like the extra money for hard Brexit contingency planning. Hammond did a bit to allay concerns about universal credit. And there was some more money for the NHS. Not enough, NHS England say, and Hammond’s failure to even mention social care shows that this was not a budget with long-term ambition. But it will probably see him through. For now. That’s all from us. Thanks for the comments. The reaction to today’s budget in the financial markets is quite muted. Although building firms have been hit by the threatened clampdown on land banks, the FTSE 100 actually ended the day up 0.1%. The pound also shrugged off the growth downgrades, it’s up half a cent against the US dollar and flat against the euro. Why? Because the OBR’s new downgraded growth forecasts basically tell the City what it already knew - the UK’s economy faces a challenging few years, and the productivity puzzle remains unsolved, despite the measures Hammond announced today. The OBR hasn’t thrown in the towel completely on productivity. Its new forecasts are mid-way between the good old days before the crisis, and the sloth-like progress since. But there’s still a lot of uncertainty about whether technology improvements will actually deliver productivity benefits in the years ahead. And without it, Britain will keep racking up debts... Richard Buxton, head of UK equities at investment manager Old Mutual, argues that little has changed economically today. Hammond may have used a little sleight of hand (the reclassification of housing associations being an obvious example) to give himself a little headroom at this juncture. In practice, however, he appears to have kept the vast majority of his powder dry, cognisant that there may well be a time, as Brexit approaches, when more radical action is merited. The history books may also record today as the moment that the government gave up making a profit on the bailout of Royal Bank of Scotland. Selling that stake will help cut the national debt by £15bn, but will also crystallise a lose of around £26bn (based on today’s share price). Liberal Democrat leader Vince Cable says it’s a “desperate” move. Lib Dem leader Vince Cable urged caution after the budget revealed plans put a deadline on when the government will start selling its £24bn stake in Royal Bank of Scotland, by March 2019. Cable said the share price meant it was the wrong time to sell the shares at their current price. He told reporters: Today’s share price I believe is far below the acquisition price and we always argued in the coalition. Osborne accepted it was utterly wrong to start selling shares before you can recoup the basic taxpayer outlay and then you have to allow for a bit of inflation. So that would be rather desperate I think. And we know there are these continuing legacy problems around RBS. This is not the time to sell the shares in RBS. The former business secretary said the chancellor had been severely restricted by the downgrading of the growth figures and the unexpected rise in borrowing, which he estimated would cost every person £700 per year compared to pre-election forecast. The chancellor talked about Britain being the sixth biggest economy in the world, as long as I can remember it was the fifth, but it is now the sixth. This is France overtaking the UK in the last year, India is fairly close behind. Cable, who said he backed much of what the government was doing on skills and industrial strategy, also expressed concern about the £3bn allocated to Brexit preparations. The fact they are having to pay that upfront on the possibility we will crash out is revealing and politically very damaging. The £3bn does not deal with the massive economic dislocation of Brexit, which is multiple many times that. This is the physical infrastructure costs associated with the change in the regulatory regime, it’s a tiny fraction of the costs associated with Brexit. Here are some more budget tweets worth reading. From Sky’s Ed Conway From the Resolution Foundation From Stephanie Flanders, head of Bloomberg Economics Philip Hammond’s threat to force property developers sitting on undeveloped land to use it or lose it may have sounded familiar. Not for the first time, it’s an idea previously pushed by Ed Miliband during his time as Labour leader. Back in 2013, Boris Johnson rubbished the idea, writing: We need to help people with the cost of housing; but that means building hundreds of thousands of homes – homes for sale, for affordable rent, for private rent. But you won’t get developers risking their cash to build, if they are told they are vulnerable to Mugabe-style expropriations and a new mansion tax. But Mugabe is now (finally) out of office, and the Conservatives have now decided that “Red Ed” was onto something after all (see also: energy price caps). Miliband himself is taking the u-turn in his stride. And this is from the Guardian’s Alan Travis. Here is a round-up of reaction to the budget from Tory MPs. These are from the Guardian’s Helen Pidd. NIESR, the think tank, has warned that today’s budget forecasts will be too optimistic if Britain crashes out of the EU without a deal. The uncertainty around Brexit presents the most important downside near term risk to the economy, particularly in the event of an exit involving a sudden stop, while the judgments on productivity and employment are likely to represent the most significant upside risk to productivity, as well as the prospects for a sustained world recovery. Angela Rafferty QC, chairman of the Criminal Bar Association, has criticised a planned £600m cut to the Ministry of Justice’s budget. She said: The poor and vulnerable in society are being denied access to justice. Whilst the official budget statement is silent about this vital pillar of state we can see from the spending forecast that there will be a £600m reduction in an already meagre and inadequate budget for the ministerial department, a reduction for the Ministry of Justice resource budget of 9% over two years to £6bn by 2019/20. The budget for justice is now forecast to fall an initial £400m next year from £6.6bn in 2017/18 to £6.2bn in 2018/19, then to £6bn for 2019/20. The system is desperate; it cannot endure any more cuts. NHS England is suggesting it may have to limit what it can provide to patients in the light of the funding crisis it is facing. It has released this statement from Sir Malcolm Grant, its chairman. What is says echoes Bruce Keogh, the NHS England medical director, was saying earlier. (See 3.35pm.) Today’s budget hasn’t delivered the wealth redistribution from Baby Boomers to Millennials that some campaigners had been pushing for. Our money editor Patrick Collinson says: We expected a budget that would take from the old and give to the young. What we got was one that gave a few well-signalled bungs to the middle-aged (higher tax thresholds), some giveaways to the youngish (stamp duty cuts, a new railcard) and left the elderly untouched. And as for the very rich? Well, they’re still living in paradise. Philip Hammond is no intergenerational Robin Hood. While he slashed stamp duty for almost every first-time buyer (outside London) he conspicuously avoided provoking older voters; pension tax reliefs remain sacrosanct, as does the winter fuel allowance and the “triple lock” on pension increases..... More here: This is how George Osborne’s Evening Standard is covering the budget. Here is Sadiq Khan, the Labour mayor of London, on the budget. My colleague Alan Travis points out that the section in the budget red book on what the government will do to attract “international talent” after Brexit suggests the new immigration rules will be less restrictive than the proposals leaked earlier this year implied. Today’s growth downgrades mean Britain will be sending less aid to the developing world, through the commitment to spend 0.7% of GDP on aid. The budget Red Book says that Official Development Assistance (ODA) budgets will be adjusted down by £375 million in 2018‑19 and £520 million in 2019‑20. As we pointed out earlier, the budget scorecard shows that Philip Hammond has planned a £9bn spending splurge in 2019-20. (See 2.18pm.) Rupert Harrison, who was chief of staff for George Osborne when Osborne was chancellor, thinks he knows why. Here are some tweets from Matt Whittaker, the Resolution Foundation’s chief economist, on the budget. The (widely expected) cut to Britain’s productivity growth is the biggest single change in the Office for Budget Responsibility’s report today. The OBR is painting a rather dire picture -- slashing an average of 0.7% percentage points off UK trend productivity growth each year. That means the economy will be 3% smaller in 2020 than previously expected, leading to the sharp growth downgrades flagged up earlier). It’s another sign that the UK economy is weaker than hoped, and not delivering the robust growth that policymakers have pinned their hopes on Paul Johnson of the IFS, and Stephanie Flanders of Bloomberg, both say it’s a significant problem... In his budget speech Philip Hammond announced a range of measures to help universal credit claimants. He said: First, we will remove the seven day waiting period applied at the beginning of a benefit claim so that entitlement to universal credit will start on the day of the claim. We have looked at reducing the delay at the end of the first month assessment period. But to do so would mean compromising the principle of payments being made on the same day of the month. A key feature of the system which is very important for claimants in managing their budgets. So to provide greater support during the waiting period we will change the advances system to ensure that any household that needs it can access a full month’s payment within five days of applying. We will make it possible to apply for an advance online. And we will extend the repayment period for advances from 6 months to 12 months. Any new universal credit claimant in receipt of housing benefit, will continue to receive it for two weeks. This is a £1.5bn package to address concerns about the delivery of the benefit. But he did not tell MPs that the rollout of universal credit was being slowed down. That is revealed in the red book, which says: To support these changes the government will roll out universal credit more gradually between February 2018 and April 2018, and roll-out to all jobcentres will be complete in December 2018. Here is the response to the budget from John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor. And here is an excerpt. This is a ‘nothing has changed’ budget from an out-of-touch Government with no idea of the reality of people’s lives and no plan to improve them. Philip Hammond has completely failed to recognise the scale of the emergency in our public services. Today’s budget has found no meaningful funding for our schools still facing their first real terms funding cuts since the mid-90s and nothing even approaching the scale needed to address the crisis in our NHS or local government. One campaign group has cast doubt on the government’s ability to enforce laws to make Amazon and eBay pay for VAT fraud, as promised in the budget. Richard Allen, the spokesperson for Retailers Against VAT Abuse Schemes, which first exposed the issue, said the government is yet to prove that it is capable of enforcing new laws on digital giants. He said: The government says it will make it easier for HMRC to prosecute Amazon and eBay for facilitating this activity. But we haven’t seen the wording yet of the legislation and so we can’t be sure as to how precise it will be or if it will leave a loophole which can be exploited by these giant companies’ lawyers. These firms have already admitted they knew about the VAT fraud, so why bother with the proposed legislation? Prof Rita de la Feria, professor of tax law at Leeds University, told the public accounts committee that new legislation was not necessary, it was an issue of enforcement. She was right. In rather morbid news, the Office for Budget Responsibility has revised up its expected mortality rate. It now expects 502,000 pensioners to die each year, up from 476,000 previously (which will mean less spending on pensions). It says: This is consistent with life expectancy increasing less than projected since mid-2014. By 2022, the population in this age group [adults aged above the state pension age] is 1.2% lower than previously assumed. The OBR has also trimmed its fertility rate forecast (meaning fewer children join the population) and cut its forecasts for inward migration (thanks to Brexit). The Scottish government says Scotland has been short-changed by the budget. Here is an extract from the statement from Derek Mackay, the Scottish government’s finance minister. Scotland’s resource block grant for day to day spending will fall by over £200m in real terms next year and while money for the NHS in England should see a proportionate share come to Scotland, cuts in other UK departments mean that instead of receiving over £30m this year the Scottish Government will receive only £8m - a fraction of that spending. The reality is that over £1.1bn of the money being promised to Scotland over the next four years are loans that the Scottish government cannot spend directly on frontline public services and that have to be paid back to the Treasury. Austerity has not ended and over ten years of this UK Government, between 2010-11 and 2019-20, we will continue to see Scotland’s discretionary budget fall in real terms by £2.6bn, that’s 8.1%. Bruce Keogh, medical director of NHS England, says he does not think the extra money for the NHS goes far enough. He says longer hospital waits are likely or unavoidable. Here are some extracts from Jeremy Corbyn’s speech in response to the budget. He said the government had a “record of failure” and said the budget amounted to “accounting tricks and empty promises”. On the budget generally It’s a record of failure with a forecast of more to come ... The test of a budget is how it affects the reality of people’s lives all around this country. I believe as the days go ahead and this budget unravels, the reality will be a lot of people will be no better off and the misery many are in will be continuing. On growth, productivity and wages being revised down What sort of strong economy is that? What sort of fit for the future is that? On the homelessness proposals Three new pilot schemes for rough sleepers simply doesn’t cut it. It is a disaster for those people sleeping on our streets, forced to beg for the money for a night shelter. They’re looking for action now from government to give them a roof over their heads. On universal credit The chancellor’s solution to a failing system causing more debt is to offer a loan, and the six-week wait, with 20% waiting even longer, simply becomes a five-week wait. This system has been run down by 3 billion of cuts to work allowances, the two-child limit and the perverse and appalling rape clause, and caused evictions because housing benefit isn’t paid direct to the landlord. On the public services We have had the rhetoric of a long term economic plan that never meets its targets when what all too many are experiencing is long term economic pain - and the hardest hit are disabled people, single parents and women. The chancellor has not been clear today - not for NHS workers, our police, firefighters, teachers, teaching assistants, bin collectors, tax collectors or armed forces personnel. Why does the government think its OK to under pay, over stress and under appreciate all those that work within our NHS? We’ll wait for the small print on today’s announcement, but even what he’s said falls well short of the £6bn Labour would have delivered from our June manifesto. On the house-building measures With this government delivering the worst rate of house building since the 1920s and 250,000 fewer council homes, any commitment would be welcome. But we’ve been here before. The government promised 200,000 starter homes three years ago. Not a single one has yet been built in those three years. We need a large scale publicly funded house building programme, not this government’s accounting tricks and empty promises. Corbyn’s peroration We were promised with lots of hype a revolutionary budget, the reality is nothing has changed. People were looking for help from this budget and they have been let down: let down by a Government that, like the economy they have presided over, is weak and unstable and in need of urgent change. They call this a budget fit for the future, the reality is this is a government no longer fit for office. Corbyn also got involved in an angry exchange with a Tory MP who made a joke while he was speaking about care for the elderly. Jason Lowes, planning partner at property consultancy Rapleys, says the budget is no ‘magic bullet’ for Britain’s housing problems. “While many in the property industry will be buoyed by the reforms to Stamp Duty Land Tax for first time buyers and Business Rates, the lack of progress on planning risks undermining what was, we were led to believe, intended to be a blockbuster housing Budget.” Jon Ostler, UK CEO of personal finance site Finder.com, also thinks the government fell short: “In order to truly help first-time buyers in the short term, the government would need to offer a far greater incentive. We can learn from our friends in Australia who offered significant grants to first-time buyers of between £4,000 and £10,000, this level of investment proved to make a real difference to the number of first homes bought. As it stands, first-time buyers in the UK are going to have to rely on the delivery of the Governments house building investment and initiatives to deliver affordable housing, but this could take some time. Campbell Robb, chief executive of the independent Joseph Rowntree Foundation, argues that Philip Hammond simply focused his help on the wrong people: “The Government’s big spending commitments for stamp duty giveaways and tax cuts prioritised higher earning households, with little support for people who need it most. “The Government could have demonstrated it was on the side of low income families by lifting the freeze and providing a clear plan to deliver 80,000 genuinely affordable homes a year in England, instead of more funding for people who can already afford to buy.” The Office for Budget Responsibility sound rather irked with the government over its failure to give more information about Brexit. The independent fiscal watchdog says it “once again” asked the government to provide detail on likely trade and migration policies after Britain has left the EU, and some clarity on what we might pay into the EU budget. But the government refused to pay ball, and merely pointed the OBR at Theresa May’s speech in Florence two months ago, and a white paper on trade policy from February (!). That, the OBR says, isn’t enough: Given the uncertainty regarding how the Government will respond to the choices and tradeoffs it faces during the negotiations, we still have no meaningful basis on which to form a judgement as to their final outcome and upon which we can then condition our forecast. So, today’s forecasts are based on Brexit occurring in March 2019, with two rather broad-brush assumptions: The negotiation of new trading arrangements with the EU and others slows the pace of import and export growth over the 10 years following the referendum. We calibrated this slowdown on the basis of a range of external studies of different possible trade regimes and assumed offsetting impacts from exports and imports on GDP growth. The UK adopts a tighter migration regime following departure from the EU than that currently in place, but not sufficiently tight to reduce net inward migration to the desired ‘tens of thousands’. This is what a Guardian Comment panel are saying about the budget. There are contributions from Matthew d’Ancona, Faiza Shaheen, Jonathan Freedland and Frances Ryan. Ouch! The OBR has also estimated that selling the government’s shares in RBS will realise a loss of £26.2bn. That’s based on today’s share price, compared to the cost of the bailout nine years ago. The budget ‘red book’ also shows that the government plans to sell the mortgages held by Bradford &amp; Bingley and Northern Rock (which were both rescued during the height of the crisis in 2008) over the next few years, to cut the national debt. This is from the Labour MP Stella Creasy. This is not entirely fair. If you look at the scorecard (see 2.18pm), you will see that the extra spending on Brexit contingency planning is worth £1.5bn a year for two years (item 20), but in those two years the combined extra NHS spending is £2.32bn and £1.91bn respectively (items 8 and 9). But, by referring to the headline figures Hammond cited, Creasy makes a strong political point nevertheless. The Office for Budget Responsibility is damning about Philip Hammond’s proposal to abolish stamp duty for first-time buyers for homes worth up to £300,000. This is what it is saying. The OBR says the stamp duty cut will push house prices up. It says it expects this policy to increase prices by 0.3%. Most of this effect will occur in 2018, it says. We expect this to increase house prices by 0.3 per cent, an estimate consistent with our published price elasticities for stamp duty changes. Most of this effect is expected to occur in 2018. It says that the main gainers will be people who already own property, not first-time buyers. We assume that a temporary relief would feed one-for-one into house prices, but a permanent one will have twice that effect. On this basis, post-SDLT [stamp duty land tax prices] prices paid by FTBs [first-time buyers] would actually be higher with the relief than without it. Thus the main gainers from the policy are people who already own property, not the FTBs themselves. It says a Treasury review of a temporary stamp-duty holiday for first-time buyers announced by the Labour chancellor Alistair Darling in his final budget concluded that it was effectively a failure. Darling announced the move as a response to the financial crash. But the OBR says: Eligibility criteria match those of the post-crisis ‘stamp duty holiday’, although then the relief stopped at £250,000. HMRC published an evaluation part way through that holiday. It concluded that the majority of the value of relief had fed through to higher house prices and that it ‘has not had a significant impact in terms of improving the affordability of residential property for FTBs. It is estimated that most of the buyers who benefited from the relief would have purchased property in its absence anyway (ie are deadweight).’ Confirmation that the relief would end was announced alongside the evaluation. It says the policy will produce a cliff-edge effect for homes worth just over £500,000. A rate of 5% will be charged on the value between £300,001 and £500,000. But FTBs buying a property for £500,001 or more will not benefit from the relief at all, so a purchase at that price would be liable to £5,000 more in SDLT than one at £500,000. Now this is interesting. The government’s deficit figures include £15bn from the sale of some of the taxpayers’ stake in Royal Bank of Scotland. That sales, over the next five years, allowed Philip Hammond to boast about cutting the national debt as a share of GDP from next year. That claim was also dependent on the recent decision to move local housing associations in England off the public books. That’s according to the OBR, which says: Despite the deterioration in our underlying forecast, the tax and spending giveaway, and extra lending through help to buy, the government has ensured that net debt still falls fractionally as a share of GDP in 2018-19 and by more beyond. It has achieved this largely by announcing fresh sales of RBS shares and by passing regulations that ease local and central government control over housing associations in England. These charts show the details: RBS’s shares are trading at 271p today, compared to the break-even price of 502p. So any sale could come at a hefty loss to the taxpayer, which rescued the bank from collapse in 2008. Bad news for workers - the OBR has slashed its forecasts for pay growth over the next few years. It now expects wages to rise by just 2.3% next year, down from 2.7% previously. Pay increases now aren’t expected to hit 3% (the current inflation rate) until 2021, a whole year later. This means the cost of living squeeze is going to last even longer. This chart shows the downgrades (the red box is the amount lopped off the average earnings figure): The Office for Budget Responsibility’s verdict is out! The independent watchdog confirms that it has cut its productivity and growth forecasts: We have revised down our productivity and GDP forecasts and, despite lower borrowing this year, revised up our forecast for the budget deficit. The chancellor has raised the deficit further with higher public spending and a net tax giveaway. This chart confirms that the deficit will be almost twice as big as previously forecast in 2021-22. But what about the “tax giveaway”? The OBR says Hammond is loosening the purse strings over the next two years, including the freeze on fuel duty and the abolition of stamp duty for first-time buyers on houses under £300k. This is table 2.1 from the budget red book, the budget scorecard. This is the most important and revealing chart in the whole book, because these are the numbers that show exactly how much the Treasury is spending and raising from all the 69 measures in the budget. Look at the figures at the bottom. These show that, overall, it’s a giveaway budget. In the next financial year Hammond will be spending an extra £6bn compared with what was planned (£4.4bn extra on spending, and £1.6bn extra on tax cuts) and by 2019-20 the giveaway is worth almost £10bn. Shares in Britain’s housebuilders have been hit by Hammond’s threat to compulsorily purchase land if they don’t build on it. Barratt, Persimmon, Taylor Wimpey and Berkeley are leading the FTSE 100 fallers, suggesting the City thinks the measure may have teeth. You can read all the Treasury documents on the Treasury website here. The most important is the 86-page budget red book (pdf). And here is the Office for Budget Responsibility’s 258-page report (pdf). Jeremy Corbyn is responding to the budget now. He is withering, and particularly critical of the lack of extra spending on social care and education. We will publish lengthy extracts from his speech a bit later when we have the quotes. Well, that wasn’t quite as boring as some people were expecting. Philip Hammond has a reputation for being rather humourless, but he injected far more jokes than is usual for a budget speech and he managed to conclude with a surprise stamp duty announcement likely to play well with the tabloid press. Whether or not abolishing stamp duty for first-time buyers will actually bring down prices is an entirely different matter; if anything, it seems just as likely that it will allow sellers to increase prices. And in cash terms, it is not a huge giveaway. The red book has just landed on my desk, and it shows that the measure will only cost the Exchequer around £600m a year over the course of this parliament. This was the headline-grabber at the top of a package of measures that otherwise sounded pragmatic but relatively unambitious. Will this be enough for the budget to be judged as a success (by the low expectations set in advance)? It is too early to know, but it does seem possible. The chancellor tried to distract us with some jokes, the stamp duty rabbit, and even a packet of cough lozenges from the PM. However the underlying message is that the UK economy is rather weaker than we thought back in March. Growth is going to slow steadily over the next three years – not what’s needed as the country faces the Brexit unknown. The new growth forecasts mean the economy is now expected to grow at below its long-term trend growth until well into the next decade. This chart shows the damage, which is caused by Britain’s weak productivity. Growth: 2017: 1.5%, down from 2% in March’s budget 2018: 1.4%, down from 1.6% 2019: 1.3%, down from 1.7% 2020: 1.3%, down from 1.9% 2021: 1.6%, down from 2.0% The good news is that Britain will borrow over £8bn less than expected this year, at £49.9bn, not the £58.3bn inked in before. The bad news is that the deficit will shrink more slowly towards the end of this decade. On today’s forecasts, the annual deficit will still be 1.3% of GDP at the end of the forecast horizon – twice as large as expected. Hammond did have a rabbit in the hat after all – the decision to abolish stamp duty for first-time buyers on properties up to £300,000 got a healthy roar from his own MPs. Tom Tugendhat, for example: But, it won’t help those who aren’t close to buying a house today (and might annoy anyone who just managed to scramble on to the housing ladder). Hammond says he wants to help people saving to buy a home. An extra £10bn has gone into the help-to-buy equity loan. He has considered a temporary stamp duty holiday. Hammond says he is abolishing stamp duty for first-time buyers for properties worth up to £300,000. And people buying a home worth up to £500,000 will not have to pay stamp duty on the first £300,000. He says this is to help people in markets like London. One million homes for the Cambridge-Milton Keynes-Oxford corridor … Hammond says the government is committing to building homes in the Oxford-Cambridge corridor. Infrastructure will be built to support new homes, he says. Hammond says planning reform is needed too. The government wants homes built in high-demand areas and around transport hubs. Sajid Javid, the communities secretary, will make a statement on the plans in due course. But there are too many unused planning permissions. In London alone there are 270,000, he says. Oliver Letwin will chair a review of how land is being used for housing. It will report by the spring of next year, in time for the financial statement. If necessary, the government will take powers to intervene to ensure land is used for housing, Hammond says. The chancellor has announced plans to legislate for councils to be allowed to impose a 100% premium on properties left vacant. Several councils, including a number in London, have called for the current 50% cap to be raised. Last month the Guardian reported how the owners of Kensington and Chelsea properties worth an estimated £500m were fined just £85,000 for leaving them empty for two years. Under Hammond’s new legislation, those owners would be fined £170,000. Hammond says young people feel concerned about their prospects in the housing market, with house prices increasingly out of reach for many. The number of young people owning their own home has dropped from 59% to 38%, he says. He says May pledged to fix this problem. They will take the next steps by choosing to build. He says the help-to-buy scheme has helped and the supply of homes has increased. This is a complex challenge and there is no single magic bullet. Without more land on the market, house prices will just go up. Without more SME’s building homes, the big companies will just benefit. Hammond says over the the next five years £44bn will be committed to help the housing market. By the mid-2020s there should be 300,000 homes being built a year - the highest level since the 1970s. Hammond turns to housing. He says councils will be able to charge a 100% premium on council tax on empty properties. He will establish a homelessness taskforce, with a view to eliminating rough sleeping by 2027. Hammond turns to taxes for digital companies. He says income tax will be applied to sales abroad. He says all online market places will be jointly liable with sellers for VAT. The Treasury has tweeted the details of the NHS funding changes (which seem to fall short of the £4bn emergency injection called for by the NHS England chief Simon Stevens). Hammond says he has listened to concerns about the costs of uprating business rates. He says he will bring forward the uplifting of this by the CPI inflation index not RPI. It will switch to CPI in April 2018, two years earlier than planned. That will save businesses £2.3bn, he says. Businesses to gain £2.3bn by change to rules for the uprating of business rates, Hammond says. On the VAT registration threshold, he says, at £85,000, it is by far the highest in the OECD. But that does keep most small businesses out of VAT, he says. So he is not minded to lower it. But he will look at reforming it. Hammond says threshold for VAT registration to stay at £85,000 for the next two years. There had been speculation he would bring it down. On alcohol duty, Hammond has outlined plans to increase duty on high-strength, low-quality alcohol from 2019, but duties on other ciders, wines, spirits and on beer will be frozen. The decision to freeze fuel duty again has been criticised by the Green party co-leader Jonathan Bartley. Hammond turns to health. NHS to get an extra £10bn capital investment over this parliament. And NHS to get an extra £3.75bn this year for its current budget. About £2.8bn will be for the NHS in England. Hammond also says he will provide extra funding for NHS pay. Hammond turns to duty. Duty on beer, wine, cider and spirits to be frozen. And he turns to travel. From April he will again freeze short-haul air passenger duty, and long-haul APD for economy passengers. This will be funded by an increase on taxes for private jets. And the age limit for a young person’s railcard will go up. The Treasury tweets: Liberal Democrat MP Layla Moran says Hammond has heeded the complaints about universal credit. Conservative MP Heidi Allen, who has also raised concerns about UC, has welcomed the move. Hammond turns to tax thresholds. Basic rate income tax threshold to rise to £11,850 in April next year. Higher rate threshold to rise to £46,350. Hammond turns to the “national living wage”. From April [the national living wage] will rise 4.4% from £7.50 an hour to £7.83. The government accepts the low pay commission’s recommendations. Income inequality today is at its lowest level for 30 years. The top 1% are paying more in income tax than at any time under Labour, he says. Hammond says many people are feeling pressure on their budgets. Because we are all in politics to make people’s lives better, he will make changes. The switch to universal credit is welcome, he says. It delivers a modern welfare system, but he recognises the concerns on both sides of the House on the delivery of this. Hammond says claimants will not have to wait seven days before they are entitled to money. The repayments period for advances will be extended from six months to 12 months. In total, £1.5bn is being spent on making the system more generous. David Gauke will give further details to MPs tomorrow. Hammond says they will open talks on a Belfast city deal, with a view to having similar deals across Northern Ireland. Hammond says his plans involve £2bn more for the Scottish government, £1.2bn more for Wales and £650m more for Northern Ireland. He is used to getting his “ear bent” by the 13 Scottish Tory MPs, he says. They have persuaded him to exempt Police Scotland and the Scottish fire service from VAT. Hammond says he is announcing £30m to improve digital connectivity on the trans-Pennine route. He is announcing a new city deal for the West Midlands. There will be an investment in Redcar. More than £1bn of lending will be available to councils to fund high-investment projects. Hammond says he and the education secretary will initiate a national retraining scheme. He has accepted TUC advice to continue funding Unionlearn, he says. He got an email from Len [McCluskey] asking him to do this, he jokes. Hammond turns to teaching, and maths. He announces measures to promote maths teaching. These plans were trailed overnight. More maths for everyone, he says. Don’t let anyone tell you I don’t know how to show the nation a good time. The chancellor’s Top Gear/Grand Tour joke has attracted plenty of groans: Hammond says he will explore new taxes on plastic waste. People have seen through the BBC’s Blue Planet 2 how much damage plastic does. Hammond turns to driverless vehicles. He knows that Jeremy Clarkson does not like them. But there are other good reasons to pursue them too, he says. I’m sorry, Jeremy, but I know it’s not the first time you’ve been snubbed by Hammond and May. The law will be clarified so that people who charge their vehicles at work will not be taxed as a benefit in kind. He says he announced previously that taxes on diesel cars would go up. This will go ahead. But new cars will be exempt will manufacturers introduce new technology. And this will only hit cars, he says. So white van man will not be affected. This will fund a £200m clean air fund. Hammond says the government will replace European investment fund money if necessary. Hammond says a new high-tech business is founded in the UK every hour. He wants that to be every half hour. He says he is investing more than £500m “in a range of initiatives from artificial intelligence, to 5G and full fibre broadband”. Hammond says the government is investing in infrastructure. He says raising productivity is the central mission of the Treasury. He is increasing the R&amp;D tax credit, he says. Hammond says the OBR says the government is on course to meet its fiscal targets. Borrowing is forecast to be £49.9bn this year - £8.4bn lower than forecast in the spring budget. It will fall to its lowest level in 20 years by 2022/23, he says. In percentage terms, it is forecast to be 2.4% in 2017-18. Then 1.9%. then 1.6%, then 1.5%, then 1.3% and finally 1.1% in 2022-23. Hammond says he intends to use the headroom he created in his first budget to reduce debt and provide help to families too. Hammond says the OBR expects debt to peak this year. But Labour wants higher debt. If they carry on like that, there will be plenty more joining Kezia Dugdale in saying: “I’m Labour, get me out of here.” Hammond says productivity has not improved. For the last 15 budget events, the OBR has forecast productivity growth at 2%. But that has been revised downwards. And so growth estimates have been revised down. They are now: 2017 - 1.5% 2018 - 1.4% 2019 - 1.3% 2020 - 1.3% 2021 - 1.5% 2022 - 1.6% Hammond says the OBR is forecasting another 600,000 people in work by the 2020s. Hammond says he will do the OBR forecasts now. “This is the bit with the long, economicky words in it,” he says, joking about Michael Gove. He will stick to drinking water, he says, although he is tempted by something more exotic, he says (referring to drink). He asked the PM to bring some cough sweets just in case, he jokes. Hammond says he has a clear vision of what a global Britain looks like: a prosperous and inclusive economy, where everyone can shine, and the dream of home ownership is open to all, a civilised, tolerant place, an outward-looking nation, that is a force for good in the world. That is the Britain he wants, he says. He will not build it today. But he will build the foundations. Hammond says he understands the frustration of families whose budgets are under pressure. So he chooses a balanced approach, he says. Hammond says the government chooses the future, and chooses “to run towards change”. Britain is at the forefront of the technological revolution, he says. But we must invest to secure that future. That is what he is doing, he says. Hammond says the Brexit talks are at a critical phase. He is clear that one of the biggest boosts he can give to business is to “make early progress in delivering [May’s] vision, with an implementation plan that allows businesses [to invest with confidence]”. But he is preparing for every outcome. Hammond says an extra £3bn is being set aside for Brexit contingency planning. Hammond says the economy “continues to grow, continues to create more jobs than ever before and continues to confound those who talk it down”. The future will be full of opportunities. He wants to seize those opportunities, he says. Philip Hammond is starting now. The Independent’s political editor, Joe Watts, spotted something interesting during PMQs... Labour’s Yvette Cooper also wants to see Universal Credit reformed: Labour’s Toby Perkins says people with severe disabilities are worse off on universal credit because there is no disability component. Whatever is in the budget, UC will shame the government, he says. May says the government spends £50bn a year on disability benefits. UC is helping people get into work, she says. Not long to wait now.... PMQs - Snap verdict: Who cares, really, given it’s budget day, which will be something of a relief to Corbyn, who didn’t really cause May much trouble. She made a crass error in her final reply, but otherwise she brushed aside Corbyn’s attacks on Brexit and on tax avoidance with surprising ease. Surprising, because Corbyn was raising an issue, Brexit and Ireland, where the government’s position is extraordinarily weak. But it was a revelation to hear Corbyn raise Brexit in the first place because generally it is a topic that he has avoided (probably because it is an area where Labour itself is divided, and where Labour’s stance is in some respects fudged). Still, all soon forgotten ... Corbyn says the government voted down an amendment to the EU withdrawal bill last night on workers’ rights. Turning to tax avoidance, he asks if May will adopt new measures on this. Or is she threatening to turn Britain into a tax haven? May says she will take no lectures on this. The government has raised more than £160bn by measures on tax avoidance, she says. Corbyn says David Cameron blocked EU proposals for a public register of tax. When it comes to Brexit, this government is a shambles, he says. The Tories promise action on tax avoidance. But they vote against it, he says. The government has no energy, no agreed plan and no strategy to deliver a good Brexit for Britain. May says it was Labour that refused to allow tax avoidance measures to go through in a bill before the election. On Monday 76 Labour MPs voted in a different lobby from the front bench on customs measures, she claims. May is wrong about that. The division list is here. There were 76 opposition MPs voting for the amendment, but around half of those were from the SNP. There were only 28 Labour MPs voting in favour, against the Labour whip which said they should abstain. A thumbs-up for Jeremy Corbyn’s choice of question..... Michel Barnier said bankers would lose their passports, says Corbyn. But David Davis has promised free movement for bankers. Who else will get free movement? Nurses? May says Corbyn borrowed this question from Vince Cable, the Lib Dem leader. There will be no immigration rules, she says. She says she wants to get on to deal with the future trading relationship. Labour cannot decide whether it wants to be in or out of the single market and customs union. Corbyn says in April Davis said the European Banking Authority would stay in London. The government has voted down amendments that would protect workers’ rights. Why not? May says the government has guaranteed workers’ rights. She introduced a bill on this, she says. Labour voted against it. Jeremy Corbyn says he hopes MPs will join him in sending solidarity to eastern Nigeria, where 50 people were killed in a suicide bombing. The Irish PM has said the British do not seem to have thought through Brexit. Can May reassure him that there will be no hard border in Ireland? Theresa May echoes what Corbyn said about the bombing. On Ireland, she says she has repeatedly said the common travel area will continue to operate. And, on trade and goods, there will be no hard border introduced. The government does not want physical infrastructure at the border. Corbyn says the government has had 17 months to explain how this will work. The government has not engaged, he says. He says John Redwood, the Conservative MP, is a strategist for an investment firm. He recently advised people to invest abroad. Does May agree with him? On Ireland, May says the government has published a paper. She says she is happy to move on to discussions about the future trade relationship. She does not address the Redwood question. This is from the Telegraph’s Michael Deacon. As Hammond prepared to deliver the budget, here’s a reminder of how the national debt has risen (as a share of GDP) since the financial crisis. PMQs is starting soon. I will cover the May/Corbyn exchanges, and any budget-related answers. Philip Hammond will announce that £4.5m raised from the fines imposed on banks for Libor-rigging will go to charities helping veterans, the Sun reports. A good spot from Business Insider’s Thomas Colson. Philip Hammond is going to promise to eliminate rough-sleeping by 2027, the Evening Standard’s Joe Murphy reports. Here’s an extract from his story. A new homelessness reduction taskforce will be launched, aiming to halve the number of rough sleepers by 2022 and reduce it to zero by 2027. The budget will commit £20 million to schemes that support people who are on the brink of homelessness. “We want everyone to have a roof over their heads, and that’s why we’ve committed to eliminating rough-sleeping by 2027,” Mr Hammond said. “This new taskforce will be an important first step in the fight. I want to commend the Evening Standard for its tireless campaigning on homelessness, keeping this important issue in the front of people’s minds.” In 1947 Hugh Dalton resigned as chancellor after giving information to an evening paper about the contents of his budget that got published in the paper before the budget statement was over. But that was information about tax increases, which was more sensitive. The Long and Winding Road might be more appropriate, given the government’s efforts to cut the deficit since 2010..... Downing Street said the budget will adopt a “balanced approach”. Just to remind everyone how constrained it is, the Treasury has just tweeted out this, reminding us all that public sector debt stands at £1.7 trillion. This is from ITV’s Robert Peston. City experts are warning that the pound could suffer if the budget fails to impress Conservative MPs. Kathleen Brooks of City Index says the “biggest market-moving event” will be Hammond’s own performance, amid those rumours that he could be reshuffled out of the Treasury. She explains: Brexiteers are circling for his job, and this budget is the battlefield for mounting Brexit tensions within the cabinet. If the chancellor bombs then the knives will be out. If May is forced to sack her chancellor in the aftermath of this budget then this could be a big negative for the pound. Just last week the pound dropped 1.5% on rumours (unsubstantiated) in the Sunday Times that the Tory party were getting ready to oust May. Currently, sterling is bobbing around the $1.324 level, around 10% lower than before the EU referendum in June 2016. Philip Hammond and his team of Treasury ministers have just emerged from Number 11. After a quick pose with the budget red box, the chancellor has boarded his government car for the short drive to the House of Commons. We’ve had the usual briefing about the budget cabinet meeting this morning, and it’s fair to say we’re little wiser than we were before. The budget will, we were told by May’s spokesman, “adopt a balanced approach” between preserving the public finances and investment in areas such as the NHS and housing. Hammond set out what he termed “a vision for post-Brexit Britain” with his budget, and - as is traditional – received an adulatory round of banging on the cabinet table by colleagues once he’d finished. Boris Johnson and Michael Gove were among other ministers to speak, May’s spokesman said – and the latter did not use any long, “economicky” terms. Shelter has some interesting research that shows why Philip Hammond really needs to think about policies on housing – and not just home owners but renters too. In 2010, the Conservative party was ahead by a few points among people living in the private rented sector, but in 2015 Labour had a lead of just over 10 points with that group – and by 2017 it was well over 20 points. That rises to over 30 for the social rented sector. The Tory lead has even been squeezed to just a few points for those with mortgages. The figures also shows that the Tories’ support dropped most dramatically in English marginals with the highest proportion of renting households. It also shows that groups labelled as “young JAMs and liberal youth” consider housing to be one of the issues they care most about, with the vast majority thinking the situation is getting worse and worse. As we mentioned earlier, if, as expected, Philip Hammond doesn’t raise taxes significantly, that will be unusual because the first budget after a general election normally sees the chancellor squeezing taxpayers as hard as he can get away with. Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, has the figures. In a post on his Facebook page Robert Peston, the ITV political editor, predicts this could be the most dull budget he has ever covered. In the round, however, I wouldn’t be at all surprised if this is the most dull budget of the 60 odd (if you include autumn statements) that it’s been my joy and privilege to cover in an absurdly long career as a hack. Which points to this government’s most serious weakness. It desperately needs to do big, bold and imaginative things, to prove to voters it has a vision and is in charge. But with its non-existent parliamentary majority, and the permanent threat of revolting MPs, it can’t do anything big, let alone bold. But, in a blog, Laura Kuenssberg, the BBC’s political editor, says being boring has its advantages. And there will of course be decisions announced today that will have an impact on people’s lives. There will be more money for the NHS, although not as much as they have asked for, there will be new policies to try to encourage house-building, there will probably be changes to universal credit, there will be measures that will make a difference to firms around the country. But for the Treasury today there’s no big bazooka - boring is good. It is possible of course that the Treasury has simply been managing expectations. By leading people to believe there’s not much to see, anything that seems a modest success might feel like a decent win. But the first political responsibility of Number 11 today is to try to avoid mistakes. Inspiring? Perhaps not. Vital to the prospects for the government and Philip Hammond’s career? Most definitely so. Here are two stories from today’s papers about Theresa May’s relationship with Philip Hammond. The Daily Telegraph (paywall) says Number 10 took control of pre-budget briefing yesterday because the Treasury was deemed to be doing it so badly. Theresa May’s relationship with Philip Hammond is close to breaking point this morning after No 10 was forced to take control of a last-minute Budget briefing amid fears the Chancellor’s latest financial statement will fall flat. Downing Street ordered the Treasury to rush out an announcement on schools last night after alarm bells started ringing over what one Cabinet source described as “the worst budget build-up in history” ... Mrs May finally appeared to have lost patience with Mr Hammond on Tuesday night after he fluffed his last chance to sell his Budget vision to the public. A preview of his Budget statement, released to the media in time for 10pm news bulletins and national newspapers, was described by Tory MPs as “uninspiring” and contained no mention of Brexit. Two hours later the Treasury performed an about-turn and announced extra money for teacher training and maths teaching following an intervention by Number 10. The Sun says May will not move Hammond in a new year reshuffle because she is too weak. Mrs May is refusing to move or fire her long-standing former political ally in a January overhaul of her top table, despite a series of bitter clashes with him this year and in the Budget’s run up. A close ally said: “There’s no doubt Hammond would do ‘a Geoffrey Howe’ on her from the backbenches. “He wouldn’t hold back, and that would be fatal with the state the party is in.” Here’s a photo from this morning’s cabinet meeting, via the prime minister: Wonder if Hammond tried out any of his famous jokes on the cabinet.... David Cameron was known for his ‘essay crisis’ style of government. But has Philip Hammond caught the habit? The Daily Mirror have spotted that a light was blaring at Number 11 at 4.30am this morning, suggesting a late finish, or an early start, ahead of the chancellor’s big speech. Whatever Philip Hammond announces today, Britain’s public sector faces hefty spending cuts over the next few years. That’s due to austerity measures announced since 2010, as our colleague Alan Travis explains: The Institute of Fiscal Studies says that existing plans mean that there will be a further £12bn cut in welfare spending by 2020/21, that the NHS will face its tightest funding period since the 1950s and that prisons will see a real-terms cut of 22%, followed by a tight settlement for the next two years. Labour has posted a video of John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, setting out his party’s demands for the budget. Philip Hammond is set to use the budget to end the anomaly that means police and fire services in Scotland are the only ones in the UK who pay VAT, the Press Association reports. But he is set to reject calls from the Scottish government and others to refund Police Scotland and the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service the £140m they have paid out so far. The services became subject to VAT when they were formed in 2013, when ministers at Holyrood merged regional forces together to create the two new national bodies. Since then SNP ministers have been pressing for them to be exempted from VAT like services south of the border, and after 13 Scottish Tory MPs were elected to Westminster in June, they are said to have been lobbying the Chancellor on the issue. Murdo Fraser, finance spokesman for the Scottish Conservatives in Holyrood, tweeted this last night. And the Scottish Conservatives tweeted this this morning. Global asset manager M&amp;G want Philip Hammond to get radical today, and announce the creation of a new sovereign wealth fund to pay for “socially useful investment”. They argue that this fund, financed by new debt, could easily be financed by selling UK government bonds. M&amp;G Investment’s fund managers Tristan Hanson &amp; Eric Lonergan say Hammond should seize the moment, as borrowing costs are so low. Today represents a near unprecedented chance for the Treasury to borrow money for the long-term at negative interest rates after inflation. This window of opportunity, which will at some point close, must be acted upon – especially at a time when businesses are cautious about investing in the UK. Some might raise concerns around the prospect of increasing public debt, but with the creation of such fund, additional liabilities would be matched by new assets on the other side of the balance sheet. There would, therefore, be no increase to government debt if we look at things in the round. M&amp;G is a major player in the bond market - so this does suggest there is appetite in the City for the UK to borrow more. All governments and chancellors have to perform U-turns from time to time. But the Treasury are probably particularly nervous about today because, remarkably, all three of the last budgets have ended up with the chancellor having to abandon one of the principal revenue-raising measures he announced. These weren’t relatively trivial U-turns, like George Osborne’s pasty tax one. (The pasty tax was a headline-grabber, but in fiscal terms, it was relatively trivial.) These U-turns all involved a central plank of the budget collapsing. The fact that three budgets in a row have backfired so badly is partly a reflection of economic circumstances, and partly a reflection of what happens when a government has a small majority (as the Tories did between 2015 and 2017). The first huge U-turn came after George Osborne’s summer budget in 2015. He announced plans to cut £4.4bn from tax credits. But this prompted a revolt in the Lords, and Osborne abandoned the cuts in his autumn statement. Osborne announced another big welfare cut in his spring budget in 2016, a cut to personal independence payments (a disability benefit) worth more than a £1bn a year by the end of the parliament. But that triggered Iain Duncan Smith’s resignation as work and pensions secretary and within a week of the budget the government cancelled the cuts. And in the spring this year, in his first budget as chancellor, Philip Hammond announced an increase in national insurance contributions for the self-employed. It was one of the only major announcements in the whole statement. But Hammond had not realised how damaging it would be breaking a Tory election promise, and a week after his budget he had to perform a humiliating U-turn. Economist Rupert Seggins has helpfully tweeted some charts showing where the government raises money.... ...and where it spends it. This is from Sky’s Lewis Goodall. It’s worth noting that Britain can borrow rather cheaply at present. Over in the City, UK 10-year government debt is changing hands at a yield (or interest rate) of under 1.3%. Back in 2008, it cost Britain over 4% per year to borrow for a decade. So, why not use this opportunity to invest more in infrastructure and training? Anastasia Nesvetailova, professor of political economy at City University, thinks it’s a no-brainer. She told Radio 4’s Today Programme that the UK would find plenty of buyers for additional debt to repair the damage caused by austerity. Nesvetailova argued: The UK can borrow very easily in the international markets. Big institutional investors need government paper [debt] as a safe asset for their financial investment. But Rupert Harrison, former advisor to George Osborne, argues that Hammond should stick to his goal of getting the deficit down. As Harrison put it: “There’s a risk that we get complacent and think that the job’s done, that we can run 3% budget deficits indefinitely. That would be failing to learn from what happened in the run-up to the crisis in the 2000s when we ran big deficits. We would go into the next crisis even more vulnerable than last time, with a higher level of debt, and having failed to fix the roof when the sun was shining… But.... if extra borrowing was used wisely, then the economy would grow faster, meaning debt as a percentage of GDP could actually be lower in the long term. The BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg has been tweeting some steers as to what will be in the budget. If are looking for a very detailed analysis of the economic background to the budget, and the issues likely to come up, it will be hard to beat this 55-page briefing paper from the House of Commons library (pdf). There is a summary of what it is saying here. Like the Red Box and the chancellor’s glass of water, political artist Kaya Mar is a regular feature of budget day. Here’s his latest effort to mark Hammond’s speech: You can get up to speed on today’s budget speech with these charts, showing how growth has slowed and productivity has stalled: On budget day the cabinet meets at 8am so that the chancellor can brief his colleagues on what he is going to announce. Here are pictures of some of the cabinet ministers arriving for this morning’s cabinet which is still going on. The economic challenges facing Philip Hammond as he drew up this budget are as tricky as the political ones. With growth having slowed this year, real pay shrinking, and the Brexit bill looming, Britain’s economic outlook is rather challenging. So it’s hard for the chancellor to “seize the opportunities for Britain” and “invest to secure a bright future” (as he’s expected to pledge today). Hammond’s situation is complicated because the independent Office for Budget Responsibility will revise down its estimate of Britain’s long-term productivity gains, and economic growth. The OBR has (belatedly?) concluded that Britain’s economy isn’t going to bounce back from the financial crisis, and output per worker probably won’t recover to its pre-crisis rate of growth of around 2.1%. The larger the downgrade, the greater the impact to future tax revenues and earnings growth — meaning a larger budget deficit in the years ahead. So Hammond is going to lose much of the ‘headroom’ he created for himself in the last budget to protect the economy through the Brexit process. The Resolution Foundation estimate this cash war chest has shrunk from £25bn to £14bn - quite a deterioration since March. The chancellor is likely to announce that Britain has borrowed less than expected this year, following better-than-expected tax receipts since March. But borrowing is likely to be higher than expected towards the end of the forecasting period, thanks to the OBR’s gloomier outlook. That means there simply may not be the financial firepower for the radical measures Britain needs, without Hammond tearing up his goal of cutting the deficit to below 2% of GDP in 2020-21, and balancing the budget sometime in the next decade. But the chancellor does have one card up his sleeve. English housing associations are being reclassified as part of the private sector, which takes £5bn of borrowing off the books. That could provide some wiggle room to invest in, say, housing or boost public sector pay. Hammond is expected to announce support for Britain’s high-tech industry to develop technologies such as artificial intelligence and driverless cars. That could help boost productivity in future years, but only if the UK can compete with the budgets of massive US players like Tesla, Apple, Google.... In short, it’s a difficult budget -- something Hammond could probably do without right now. Economically, the Brexit talks are likely to have a bigger impact on the UK’s future than whatever the chancellor pulls out of the red box today. According to the BBC news this morning, Philip Hammond, the chancellor, will stand up at 12.30pm to deliver a budget intended to “revive the government’s fortunes”. Good luck with that. A more jaundiced view might be that his primary goal is to avoid catastrophe. The first budget after a general election is normally the one chancellors use to raise taxes. But given that the Conservative party on its own doesn’t have a parliamentary majority, and that the voters’ tolerance of austerity seems to have reached its limit, Hammond has very little room for manoeuvre. My colleague Larry Elliott, in his pre-budget analysis, reckons it will be “the trickiest budget for a generation”. It would be a challenge for even the most creative, dexterous, authoritative chancellor. But Hammond is not that man. He was chosen by Theresa May as a steady, City-friendly, fiscally conservative safe-pair-of-hands unlikely to overshadow her, but since then their relationship has deteriorated swiftly and he only avoided the sack after the general election because the result left her too weak to move him. But his long-term future at Number 11 is uncertain and there has been speculation that he could be moved in a reshuffle. Only last week Nick Timothy, May’s co chief of staff until June and for many years someone whose views were thought to be interchangeable with hers, wrote a column in the Sun deriding him as useless (I paraphrase, but only a bit). The Tory right would like to see him go because he’s accused of Brexit thoughtcrime (he thinks it’s a lousy idea, and finds it hard to pretend otherwise). And his last budget backfired when he had to abandon one its main money-raising measures within a week. For the chancellor, a budget that doesn’t lead to a U-turn and sees him still in his job at Christmas would amount to a result of sorts. Anything else would be a welcome bonus. Here is the Guardian’s overnight budget preview story. And here is our guide to what to look out for. I’ll be covering the build-up to the budget, the announcement itself, and the reaction with my colleague Graeme Wearden. After Hammond sits down we will be focusing particularly on the “small print” in the budget, the surprise and hidden announcements buried in the red book. We will also be flagging up the best analysis. The key timings are: 12pm: PMQs (we will cover the May/Corbyn exchanges, and budget-related comments) 12.30pm: Hammond’s budget statement. 3pm: Office for Budget Responsibility press conference.

In a company memo, obtained by the Hollywood Reporter, Lasseter writes that he has fallen short in creating a culture that engenders “support and collaboration” and hints at behavior that he has been confronted about. “I’ve recently had a number of difficult conversations that have been very painful for me,” he writes. “It’s never easy to face your missteps, but it’s the only way to learn from them. As a result, I’ve been giving a lot of thought to the leader I am today compared to the mentor, advocate and champion I want to be. It’s been brought to my attention that I have made some of you feel disrespected or uncomfortable. That was never my intent.” Lasseter, who is one of the founders of Pixar and the director of Toy Story, also apologizes for letting employees down while adding more details about the conduct that has led to him taking a sabbatical. “I especially want to apologize to anyone who has ever been on the receiving end of an unwanted hug or any other gesture they felt crossed the line in any way, shape, or form,” he writes. “No matter how benign my intent, everyone has the right to set their own boundaries and have them respected.” In a statement, a Disney spokesperson responded: “We are committed to maintaining an environment in which all employees are respected and empowered to do their best work. We appreciate John’s candor and sincere apology and fully support his sabbatical.” The memo has arrived at the same time as an investigation by the Hollywood Reporter into complaints about Lasseter’s behavior. “You’d hug him and he’d whisper in your ear, a long time,” a former insider said. “He hugged and hugged and everyone’s looking at you. Just invading the space.” It also lands just as Pixar’s latest film Coco is released in the US, with pundits predicting it to win out at the Thanksgiving box office. Lasseter was named chief creative officer of both Pixar and Walt Disney Animation Studios in 2006. News of Lasseter taking a leave of absence follows on from Jeffrey Tambor stepping down from his role in Transparent over reported inappropriate behavior and CBS deciding to cut ties with Charlie Rose after reports of misconduct."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"sport/2017/nov/22/ashes-beginners-guide","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-22T10:00:17Z","webTitle":"Ashes beginner’s guide: Everything you wanted to know but were afraid to ask | Simon Burnton","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/nov/22/ashes-beginners-guide","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/nov/22/ashes-beginners-guide","fields":{"headline":"Ashes beginner’s guide: Everything you wanted to know but were afraid to ask","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"When does it start? The first Test starts in Brisbane on Thursday morning local time, or for Blighty-based fans at 12 midnight GMT, with further matches to come in Adelaide, Perth, Melbourne and Sydney. Brisbane Cricket Ground is better known as the Gabba – it being situated in the borough of Woolloongabba – and also, worryingly for England, as the Gabbatoir, due to the regularity with which visiting teams are slaughtered there. West Indies were the last touring side to win at the Gabba, and that was in 1988. England last won in 1986 and have lost five and drawn twice since. Midnight? That’s no time to be watching cricket Count your blessings: the second Test in Adelaide is a day/night match which thus starts for local audiences in mid-afternoon and for viewers in England at 3.30am. On the plus side, there’ll still be cricket on at breakfast time (unless you’ve stayed up until 3.30am, in which case you might sleep through it). How can I watch this unfolding joy/nightmare? BT Sport have exclusive UK rights to their first Ashes tour, and in addition to live coverage they will show extended highlights at the end of play, and put a briefer version online for free every day at 7pm GMT. There will be radio commentary on 5Live Sports Extra, and over-by-over coverage of every session and every match at theguardian.com/sport. Who’s going to win? Australia have won six of the last seven Ashes series on home soil and are odds-on favourites to win this one as well. It’s not just England who have a bad record there: in the last five years only South Africa have won a series in Australia, while not a single one of the other teams to have tried – Sri Lanka, England, India, New Zealand, Pakistan and West Indies – has won so much as a single Test. On England’s last visit, four years ago, they lost all five. Why are England so bad at playing cricket in Australia? It’s partly about the conditions, which are slightly but crucially different to their own. In Britain it’s often a bit chilly and cloudy, with moisture on the ground and in the air, all of which helps bowlers get the ball to swing and seam. England’s best fast bowlers, James Anderson and Stuart Broad, are particularly good at harnessing this, while foreign batsmen can find the experience of facing them rather bewildering. England also use English-made balls with pronounced, hand-stitched seams which offer extra assistance. Australian summers are normally hot and dry, making the ball less likely to move unpredictably and favouring pure pace and aggression, while they use Australian-made balls with slim, machine-stitched seams, which rarely swing beyond the first few overs. On their last tour England were repeatedly taken apart by the fastest, most aggressive bowler to be seen, Mitchell Johnson, who took more wickets than Broad and Anderson combined. But as well as all that, England tend to come off second best in the psychological warfare that Australia specialise and delight in. Does the first ball really set the tone for the series? It certainly has. In 1994 Phil DeFreitas opened up with a long hop that Michael Slater smashed before going on to make a rapid 176. Australia won the Test by 184 runs and the series 3-1. And then, there was 2006 when England came to the Gabba to defend the Ashes having won the urn back for the first time in 18 years in the historic 2005 home series. The hype was enormous and, first ball, Steve Harmison sent down a ball so wide it ended up in the hands of Andrew Flintoff at second slip. Harmison later said: ”I can’t think of a worse ball to bowl than that. In fact, I can’t remember ever bowling a ball as bad as that.” The result? A 277-run victory for the Australians en route to a series whitewash. Australians specialising in warfare? Surely you’ve made a mistake? Just as a cuddly Mogwai turns into an evil Gremlin if it’s fed after midnight, otherwise friendly Australians turn all sorts of mean when they come into contact with someone who might beat them at cricket. Their crowds are rabidly hostile, and their players more likely to engage in a secondary non-contact sport known as “sledging”, which involves flinging the most novel and intimidatory of threats and insults at opposing players during the brief periods when nobody is flinging rock-hard cricket balls at them. For example there was the time when Anderson, not the most gifted of batsmen, came out to face Johnson on England’s last tour and Australia’s captain, Michael Clarke, suggested he should “get ready for a broken fucking arm”. Anderson scored two runs; Clarke was given a small fine. Who are the star players? Australia’s fast bowling attack of Josh Hazlewood, Mitchell Starc and Pat Cummins is pretty scary, though Nathan Lyon, a spinner, has taken nearly twice as many wickets over the last year as any of them. The captain, Steve Smith, and David Warner are the standout batsmen. England’s own captain, Joe Root, and the opener Alastair Cook lead what has been described by one Australian broadcaster as “one of the poorest English batting lineups I have ever seen”, which will be sorely missing the absent all-rounder Ben Stokes. Where’s Stokes? He’s watching from home, having been arrested in September on suspicion of causing actual bodily harm in an incident outside a Bristol nightclub. He is still under investigation, and will stay in England while that remains the case. Should police decline to proceed he could join the tour, thereby replacing the threat of prosecution by the authorities with the threat of persecution by the Australians."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"technology/2017/nov/24/data-breach-hits-department-of-social-services-credit-card-system","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-23T17:00:07Z","webTitle":"Data breach hits Department of Social Services credit card system","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/nov/24/data-breach-hits-department-of-social-services-credit-card-system","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2017/nov/24/data-breach-hits-department-of-social-services-credit-card-system","fields":{"headline":"Data breach hits Department of Social Services credit card system","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The Department of Social Services has written to 8,500 current and former employees warning them their personal data held by a contractor has been breached. In letters sent in early November the department alerted the employees to “a data compromise relating to staff profiles within the department’s credit card management system prior to 2016”. Compromised data includes credit card information, employees’ names, user names, work phone numbers, work emails, system passwords, Australian government services number, public service classification and organisation unit. The department failed to warn staff how long the data was exposed for but a DSS spokesman told Guardian Australia that the contractor, Business Information Services, had advised that the data was open from June 2016 until October 2017. The data related to the period 2004 to 2015. The letters from the DSS chief financial officer, Scott Dilley, blame “the actions of the department’s third-party provider” and say the compromise “is not a result of any of the department’s internal systems”. “The data has now been secured,” Dilley wrote. He said there was “no evidence” of improper use of the data or the department’s credit cards. The DSS spokesman said that on 3 October the Australian Signals Directorate had notified it of the compromise. “The Australian Cyber Security Centre immediately contacted the external contractor to secure the information and remove the vulnerability within hours of notification,” he said. Asked to assess the severity of the breach, the Australian Privacy Foundation chairman, David Vaile, said it had affected a “significant number” of people and noted the department had given staff “no clue how far back” it extended or how long data was exposed for. He said that employees’ usernames, full names and system passwords were “material that could be quite useful for identity theft, fraud and masquerading”, where an attacker pretends to be an authorised user. Vaile said the notification was a “masterpiece of passive aggressive writing” that sought to downplay the effect of the breach, when it should be for the benefit of the victims to provide as much information as possible to counter the threat. It did not contain acknowledgement that outsourcing functions to an external provider “represents an increase risk and in this case it has come home to roost”, he said. Vaile questioned how extensive the department’s inquiries were into whether the data was accessed, adding that little comfort could be taken from the fact departmental credit cards had not been charged because consequences of a data breach can take time to materialise. A spokeswoman for Business Information Services said that as a result of a “control vulnerability” some historical information about employees’ work expenses “was vulnerable to possible cyber breach”. “There is no evidence of a cyber-attack, only that it was possible,” she said. The spokeswoman said the information included “partially anonymous work-related expenses” including “cost centres, corporate credit cards without CCV and expiry dates and passwords that were hashed and therefore not visible”. “The bulk of credit card information within the data had expired.” The BIS spokeswoman said the vulnerability was “secured within four hours”, the data is no longer publicly accessible and it had undertaken a security review. The DSS spokesman said the department “takes security seriously”. He said the department has been working with the ACSC and Office of the Australian information commissioner to notify 2,000 current and 6,500 former employees and to work with the external contractor “to ensure effective arrangements are in place, and to support affected staff”. The letter also suggested employees may wish to change or strengthen passwords if they used the same password across work and personal accounts."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2017/nov/21/fifa-full-play-nasser-al-khelaifi","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-21T20:47:44Z","webTitle":"Fifa trial: Qataris were in talks for company caught up in alleged bribery scheme","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/nov/21/fifa-full-play-nasser-al-khelaifi","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/nov/21/fifa-full-play-nasser-al-khelaifi","fields":{"headline":"Fifa trial: Qataris were in talks for company caught up in alleged bribery scheme","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Nasser al-Khelaifi, the chairman of a powerful Qatari sports investment company that owns Paris Saint-Germain, was in secretive negotiations to take over a company accused of paying football officials millions of dollars in bribes, a federal court in New York heard on Tuesday. The claim was made by Santiago Peña, a former financial executive at the Argentinian marketing company Full Play, as part of testimony in the trial of three former South American football officials accused on multiple bribery counts. Peña is a star US government witness in the sprawling investigation into corruption at Fifa, the sport’s governing body. He has laid out detailed evidence that Full Play paid multimillion-dollar bribes to a group of football officials in exchange for the rights to regional competitions and World Cup qualifiers. During testimony on Tuesday, Peña revealed that al-Khelaifi, referred to only by his first name and “[the] head of soccer club … Paris Saint-Germain” by defence attorneys, was in negotiations with the owners of Full Play, Hugo and Mariano Jinkis, to buy the company out. Both Hugo and Mariano Jinkis – father and son – have been indicted by US prosecutors on corruption charges, but remain in Argentina. Peña said the deal was kept almost entirely confidential within Full Play and only he, the owners and one other finance executive, were aware of the negotiations. The former executive said that once Full Play’s owners had been indicted in the US government investigation, unveiled after a dramatic raid on a hotel in Zurich in May 2015, the deal was abandoned. “After 27 May, logically, the potential transaction was ended,” Peña told prosecutors during testimony on Monday. He added that he deleted emails relating to the negotiations shortly after the indictments were announced. A spokesman for Qatar Sports Investments, the Qatari firm chaired by al-Khelaifi, confirmed to the Guardian that the company had examined acquiring a controlling shareholding in Full Play but decided against it “after closer inspection”. On Tuesday Peña said the takeover would have seen the Qataris obtain 51% of the company, with an option of a further 19%, for $212m. Executives referred to the deal as “the New York Project” – a reference to the 212 area code in Manhattan and the sum being offered. They had been working on negotiations “for more than one year,” Peña said. He added that under the proposed arrangement Hugo and Mariano Jinkis “would continue to operate the company” after the proposed takeover occurred. Peña, who worked at Full Play between 2009 and 2015, has implicated Hugo and Mariano Jinkis in a series of multimillion-dollar bribe payments. Key to his evidence has been the disclosure of a ledger the prosecution claims shows records of bribe payments made to a group of South American football officials on the region’s governing body, Conmebol. Peña said he used codewords, mostly car manufacturers’ names, to denote bribe payments made to each of the officials, including defendants Manuel Burga, the former head of the Peruvian football association and Juan Ángel Napout, the Paraguayan former president of Conmebol, who have pleaded not guilty to multiple counts relating to corruption. Al-Khelaifi is seen as a leading figure in the Gulf state’s push into the international sports world including hosting the 2022 World Cup, and is also the chairman of prominent broadcaster beIN. Last month he was accused by Swiss prosecutors of bribing the former Fifa secretary general Jérôme Valcke to purchase broadcast rights to World Cup tournaments."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/nov/23/marriage-equality-no-vote-reflects-religion-not-ethnicity-says-tim-soutphommasane","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-22T17:00:06Z","webTitle":"Marriage equality no vote reflects religion not ethnicity, says Tim Soutphommasane","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/nov/23/marriage-equality-no-vote-reflects-religion-not-ethnicity-says-tim-soutphommasane","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/nov/23/marriage-equality-no-vote-reflects-religion-not-ethnicity-says-tim-soutphommasane","fields":{"headline":"Marriage equality no vote reflects religion not ethnicity, says Tim Soutphommasane","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Australia’s race discrimination commissioner, Tim Soutphommasane, says the high no vote in western Sydney in last week’s historic same-sex marriage postal survey reflects religious observance rather than ethnicity, and he has warned against an outbreak of crass, cultural stereotyping. Soutphommasane used a speech at the University of Western Sydney to issue a pointed warning against adopting “easy narratives” devoid of evidence about the behaviour or inclinations of particular ethnic groups in Australia. “In a world that many describe as post-truth or post-factual, our social cohesion is not always well served by jumping to conclusions,” he said. “Once-appealing narratives take hold, they can help fuel stereotypes about others – and these can be difficult to shake off. Sometimes this is because they may conveniently help to confirm cultural hierarchies in our society.” Soutphommasane said a narrative has sprung up since the postal survey which centres on ethnic minorities or multicultural communities being intrinsically hostile towards same-sex marriage, and to the LGBTI community at large. He said while some ethnic communities hold to the view that marriage is between a man and a woman, that view is shaped often by religious or cultural traditions. The race commissioner said a more clear-eyed examination of the postal survey data suggests religiosity, or religious observance, was a more significant factor for no voters – a fact well understood by the no campaign, which targeted messages to a range of communities in Sydney’s west. Soutphommasane said if you look at the voting trends outside western Sydney, a more mixed picture emerges – a picture where seats with populations of more than 40% born overseas overwhelmingly voted yes. He pointed out that the most multicultural electorates in New South Wales and Victoria recorded high yes votes – seats like Sydney, Grayndler, Kingsford Smith, Bradfield, Batman, Wills, Gellibrand and Chisholm. “To suggest that an overwhelming majority of multicultural communities voted no – and did so out of some essential cultural hostility against gays and lesbians – is to entertain something that comes close to an unkind stereotype,” the race commissioner said. He said the 38% national no vote included people from a range of backgrounds “yet judging from some commentary, you’d be mistaken to think that vote came almost exclusively from migrant and ethnic communities”. Soutphommasane pointed to a double standard in some of the public commentary, where people from “multicultural backgrounds are held to a standard that isn’t necessarily applied to others”. He said there is an element where a no vote is acceptable from someone of the majority, but unacceptable if the position is held by a minority. “There is that notion that migrants are somehow ungrateful to Australia in not extending to others the kind of respect and tolerance that they demand themselves,” he said . “How interesting that this judgment doesn’t appear to have been formed about others who may have voted no”. Soutphommasane said false narratives around racism stoke populist narratives which have the potential to erode social cohesion and racial harmony in a multicultural society. “Such challenges have always been present for our multiculturalism,” he said. “There can never be any guarantee against such challenges”. “The best defence of our cohesion and harmony, as ever, is our vigilance and our virtue. We must be prepared to defend liberal values of equality, tolerance and non-discrimination. “And it is not enough for our society merely to be non-racist; it must be resolutely anti-racist.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/nov/22/china-turns-back-comrade-bob-change-zimbabwe","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-22T06:30:12Z","webTitle":"China turns its back on Comrade Bob to embrace change in Zimbabwe","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/nov/22/china-turns-back-comrade-bob-change-zimbabwe","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/nov/22/china-turns-back-comrade-bob-change-zimbabwe","fields":{"headline":"China turns its back on Comrade Bob to embrace change in Zimbabwe","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Confirmation of Robert Mugabe’s ouster prompted revelry on the streets of Harare. “The Goblin has gone!” raved one. Thousands of miles away in Beijing – for years Mugabe’s most powerful backer – there were no obvious signs of jubilation. “China respects Mr Mugabe’s decision to resign,” foreign ministry spokesman Lu Kang told reporters, praising his “historic contribution” to Zimbabwe’s liberation. “He remains a good friend of the Chinese people.” But experts believe China’s leaders will be both relieved and contented to see the back of “Comrade Bob” – a suspicion reinforced by the approving tone coverage of his demise has taken in the Communist party-controlled press. “We need change in our country,” China’s official news agency Xinhua – whose correspondents’ dispatches are expected, above all else, to reflect the party line – quoted one Zimbabwean teacher as saying of Mugabe’s resignation. “We’re very happy,” another Zimbabwean told party mouthpiece the People’s Daily. “Finally things will change.” Ross Anthony, an expert in China-Africa relations from South Africa’s Stellenbosch University, said that while Beijing had backed Mugabe since his days as a Marxist revolutionary in the 1970s, it had increasingly seen him as erratic, an embarrassment and a threat to Chinese investments. A case in point was Mugabe’s controversial indigenisation law, which required all foreign companies to be controlled by Zimbabweans and was a particular blow to Chinese interests in its diamond industry. “I imagine there are quite a lot of officials in Beijing who will be happy to see Mugabe go,” Anthony said. Since the curtains began to fall on Mugabe’s 37-year reign last week, Beijing has done little to hide its view that its longtime ally was a difficult customer. In an article for Xiakedao, a social media account run by the People’s Daily, Zhang Weiwei, a former interpreter for Deng Xiaoping, recalled a tetchy 1985 encounter between Mugabe and the Chinese leader. As Deng, the architect of China’s economic opening, prepared to receive Mugabe in Beijing’s Great Hall of the People, he complained about their last meeting, four years earlier. According to Zhang, Mugabe had used that audience to criticise Deng for supposedly rejecting Mao Zedong and his tumultuous Cultural Revolution. “He grumbled a bit,” Deng told his then foreign minister, Wu Xueqian, according to the account. After a second, similarly testy meeting with Mugabe, Deng urged his visitor not to repeat Mao’s mistakes by destroying Zimbabwe’s economy in the name of ideology: “Comrade Mugabe … please pay special attention to our leftist errors.” Zhang concluded Mugabe had ignored Deng’s warning. Had he not done so, “Zimbabwe might not have gotten itself in into this difficult situation”, he reflected. Opinion pieces in China’s state-run media this week have also highlighted the economic turmoil Mugabe inflicted on Zimbabwe. “The country has turned into a big slum plagued by hunger,” one scholar wrote in the Global Times. Anthony said that, for Beijing, embracing life after Mugabe was in many ways “a no-brainer”. “Chinese diplomacy is very practical and very adaptable. It’s still going to be Zanu-PF and they have a deep relationship with China, so it’s not even that much of a game-changer for them.” Andrew Nathan, an expert in Chinese foreign policy from Columbia University, agreed Beijing would have no bones in switching allegiance to whoever replaced Mugabe. “I don’t think it cares much [what comes next]. It wants to be on the good side of the regime … They did cooperate with Mugabe; they will cooperate with his successor.” Chinese profiles of Mugabe’s likely successor, Emmerson Mnangagwa, painted him as a reliable, China-friendly figure who had studied Marxism and military engineering in the Middle Kingdom. “In past interviews Mnangagwa has repeatedly emphasised that Zimbabwe needs to ‘look east’,” a report in Shanghai’s The Paper said approvingly.

In Harare there was dancing and singing, honks and cheers, and tears of joy. Many of those celebrating have known no other ruler. Once he was a liberation hero to his people. When he lost their support he hung on by every means at his disposal. Now his brutal reign is over. But the hope is shaded this time by deep concern about what lies ahead. Forcing his resignation was hardly simple: it took much manoeuvring, a military intervention and the opening of impeachment proceedings before he had to bow to the inevitable. What comes next is murkier still, though Emmerson Mnangagwa, his recently fired vice-president, is expected to take over. There is not much exultation on that score, except among “the Crocodile’s” relieved allies. They had attempted to brand a transition effected primarily by the military and factional interests in Zanu-PF, intent on preserving their own power and resources, as “a new era” – to understandable scorn. Mr Mnangagwa understands that he is not a popular figure in the country, even if the military seem to like him. He does not share Mr Mugabe’s liberation aura, yet is branded by their terrible record in power. His role in removing Mr Mugabe may lend him a degree of credibility, but his best hopes will rest on reviving the economy – and, perhaps, on deferring next summer’s elections for as much as three years. The opposition is weak and divided, and Morgan Tsvangirai, leader of the Movement for Democratic Change, in poor health. They were so badly damaged by power-sharing before that they are immensely suspicious of entering a transitional administration. But they may believe a deferral would help them, too; and the president’s resignation has undercut their leverage. Some in civil society fear they will negotiate harder for political positions than for commitments to the structural measures so desperately needed for free and fair elections, including a sorely needed overhaul of the register of voters, full independence for the electoral commission and reform of the repressive cyber-security regime. Those celebrating on Tuesday are hopeful, not naive. Some thanked the generals. But many of those toasting Mr Mugabe’s departure are not supporting a coup, but its result. They know the part that Mr Mnangagwa and the military played in his rule. They understand the dangers ahead. But they also know that a man they loathed has gone; that Zanu-PF has fractured; and that Zimbabwe has a great deal on its side: natural resources; plenty of young, well-educated, ambitious citizens (even if many have left the country in recent years); and historically strong infrastructure, even if political institutions desperately need to be rebuilt. To make the most of those assets, the people will need support. Theresa May described Britain as Zimbabwe’s “oldest friend”, an interesting gloss on its colonial history. Mr Mugabe was initially backed by UK cash. That and much more gives Britain a special responsibility to support Zimbabweans; but also makes it all the more essential that it listens and responds to their wishes, without attempting to impose an agenda. When tens of thousands took to the streets at the weekend, they insisted on their stake and voice in these proceedings. Will they get it?"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"football/2017/nov/22/ange-postecoglou-stays-true-to-his-convictions-until-the-very-end","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-22T04:12:15Z","webTitle":"Ange Postecoglou stays true to his convictions until the very end | Paul Connolly","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/nov/22/ange-postecoglou-stays-true-to-his-convictions-until-the-very-end","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/nov/22/ange-postecoglou-stays-true-to-his-convictions-until-the-very-end","fields":{"headline":"Ange Postecoglou stays true to his convictions until the very end","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Considering an increasingly uncomfortable and world-weary Ange Postecoglou has spent the past month throwing esoteric smoke bombs at questions about his future it hardly seems surprising that on Wednesday he announced his resignation as Socceroos coach. A bigger shock would have been to hear that he was staying on. Nevertheless, on the surface, his decision to leave the Socceroos a week after overseeing their qualification for the 2018 World Cup in Russia doesn’t make a lot of sense. Though it may be disingenuous on his part – given that he would have been heavily involved in all manner of discussions with Postecoglou over the past weeks and, indeed, years – even Football Federation Australia CEO David Gallop conceded this morning that he too was “puzzled” by it. For most of us in the cheap seats it does indeed seem odd. You go to the back-breaking trouble of tearing down and then rebuilding a playing style in-line with an aspirational philosophy, you scour the world for overlooked Australian talent, you soak through business shirts from Kazakhstan to Bangkok, and you make yourself the target of the slings and arrows of both outrageous fortune and look-at-me punditry; and you do this all in the hope of steering your team to the World Cup finals, football’s biggest stage. But then just when you’ve done the hardest bit, just when you’ve got them over the line despite all the public challenges and personal sacrifices along the way, you chuck it all in. This isn’t the way these things normally happen. Coaches resign all the time, of course, but usually only when they notice the axe glinting above their heads. One suspects we’ve a lot to learn yet abut the dynamic between Postecoglou and his employers at FFA but there’s no suggestion at this time that Postecoglou’s position was in jeopardy. So why has he quit? For one thing, and this says much about his character, his determination to chart his own course and stick to it no matter what the weather throws at him, it was never all about the World Cup. “Bigger things [than World Cup qualification],” he said, “were driving me when I took this job and from that perspective I’ve accomplished what I wanted to do.” Nevertheless, he said, his decision to stand down, a decision made in the best interests of him and his family, was just an instinct, “an instinct [that] it’s the right time for me, it’s the right time for the team, the organisation ... for me it feels like the right time.” You can’t argue with that. Did anyone really want him to stick it out and take the Socceroos to the World Cup if his heart was not in it? That said, in a media-fed world that eschews nuance for click-bait extremes, it’s not the most conclusive of explanations and it will do nothing to prevent criticism and speculation: “Postecoglou’s a quitter, he can’t handle criticism, he’s got a big money job lined up already, he’s leaving his team in the lurch” – the responses can almost be scripted. On the subject of criticism, at least, it does seem fair to say that Postecoglou struggles with it. During an often disappointing World Cup qualifying campaign Postecoglou seemed to get increasingly short and defensive as if taking personally any criticism of the team’s playing style, their lack of goals, their defensive vulnerabilities. Any veneer of equanimity dropped off him like rubble from a cliff-face the longer the qualifying rounds went on. He said when he took over as Socceroos coach in 2013 that he invited informed debate and criticism, that this made for a mature football nation. This didn’t always seem to be the case when put to the test. That said, it makes little sense that criticism from the media – particularly ex-players-cum-pundits – would be his reason for standing down, especially as he has pointed out in the past his desire to coach in Europe. As he would well know, media scrutiny in the big European leagues will be like a blowtorch to the trousers compared to the partisan attentions of the Australian media who, for the most part, were behind the team. Be that as it may, Postecoglou has now gone and the search for a successor commences. Whoever that will be remains to be seen but it is fair to say that whoever it is they will find the Socceroos in good shape, certainly much better shape than Postecoglou found the national side back when he took over from Holger Osieck in October 2013. In those intervening four years – years in which Australia, playing with a verve and boldness we hadn’t seen for a long time, won their first Asian Cup – Postecoglou dared to aim high. Having honed his philosophy at Brisbane Roar and Melbourne Victory, Postecoglou declared early his desire that Australia should refuse to accept its place as the kids’ table of world football, that it should strive to play the kind of sophisticated football that both entertains and challenges the very best. You might argue that Australia doesn’t have the cattle to beat the best at their own game, but Postecoglou showed unwavering faith in his players and his systems. He showed his willingness to live and die by his convictions, and unlike most politicians he was into nation-building, planning for the future of the game in Australia long beyond his own tenure. As Trent Sainsbury said on Twitter this morning, “The belief and confidence he’s instilled in this team will keep us on the path to great things.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"society/2017/nov/22/doctors-overprescribe-drugs-due-to-fears-of-facing-complaints","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-22T00:05:05Z","webTitle":"Doctors 'overprescribe drugs due to fears of facing complaints'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/nov/22/doctors-overprescribe-drugs-due-to-fears-of-facing-complaints","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2017/nov/22/doctors-overprescribe-drugs-due-to-fears-of-facing-complaints","fields":{"headline":"Doctors 'overprescribe drugs due to fears of facing complaints'","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Patients are being put at risk because doctors are giving them drugs they do not need and sending them for unnecessary surgery to avoid a complaint being made against them, research has revealed. Medics are so scared of being complained about that they are also giving patients more tests than their symptoms merit and not performing procedures that involve more risk than usual. Four out of five doctors who become the subject of a complaint find the experience so stressful that they start practising more “defensive medicine” than before, according to a survey of 6,144 doctors in Britain about whom a patient, relative or colleague had complained. “This involved ‘hedging’, which includes performing more tests than necessary, over-referral and overprescribing as well as ‘avoidance’, which includes avoiding procedures, not accepting high-risk patients or abandoning procedures early,” according to research by a team led by Prof Tom Bourne of Imperial College London, whose findings have been published in the journal BMJ Open. “These behaviours may have a serious impact on patient care,” they warned. While litigation, complaints and investigations are intended to protect patients from poor care and medical negligence, the “burden and stress associated with these processes are clearly having unintended consequences and it may be argued that when examined as a whole, these structures may be causing more harm to patient care than good,” the study said. “While the regulatory system may protect patients from the misconduct of a relatively small number of doctors, it has a perverse effect on the majority of doctors who become preoccupied by defensive practice,” it added. Doctors who resort to “fear-driven working practices that could compromise patient care” also waste vital resources and their conduct “creates significant costs for the NHS”, the co-authors added. Bourne could not quantify how much NHS spending goes on that, but pointed to a study that found such practices accounted for 10% of Italy’s health budget. The General Medical Council, which regulates Britain’s 250,000 doctors, receives 9,000-10,000 complaints a year. About 160 doctors a year are suspended or banned from practising altogether after a complaint to the GMC. However, medics can also have their conduct investigated after a complaint to the hospital trust, health board or GP surgery that employs them. Some are investigated by several different bodies. Prof Helen Stokes-Lampard, chair of the Royal College of GPs, said that while regulation of the medical profession is vital to maintain patient safety, most complaints to the GMC are not upheld. “If we’re at a stage, as this research indicates, where some doctors are making decisions based on fear of recrimination and not what is necessarily in the best interests of the health of the patient in front of them, it is not conducive to high-quality, patient-centred care – and something in the system is not working properly,” she added. Being complained about is often bad for doctors’ mental health, with many experiencing depression, anxiety or stress because of a process that many believe takes too long and is unfair on them, the authors found. Many also have trouble sleeping and become angry and irritable. The report’s authors recommend sweeping changes to the existing complaints system, including that doctors should be able to contact colleagues while they are suspended, that suspension should only be used as a last resort and that investigations should have to stick to tight deadlines. The GMC said it had recently improved how its system of investigating complaints against doctors works. “We are carrying out fewer full investigations than ever before, thanks in part to the use of provisional inquiries to improve the information we have available when deciding if a full investigation is necessary,” a spokesman for the council said. “We now have a dedicated health team and have made other changes to support vulnerable doctors. “We continue to be concerned about the health and welfare of all doctors, but particularly doctors in training. This matters because of the impact on doctors themselves, the potential impact on patients and the risk that, unaddressed, good doctors can end up leaving the profession altogether.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/nov/22/the-queensland-elections-renewables-versus-coal-debate-isnt-about-jobs-its-a-culture-war","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-22T03:44:05Z","webTitle":"The Queensland election's renewables versus coal debate isn't about jobs.

It's a culture war","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Of the issues in the Queensland election campaign, proposals for new investment in electricity generation stand out among the sharpest division. Labor and the Greens want more renewables, while the Liberal National party and One Nation are pushing for a new coal-fired power station. The disputes are not over the desirability of public ownership (both sides support it). Nor are they, in any serious sense, about electricity prices (no one can reduce them by much). They aren’t even about jobs, or rather, they are more about what kinds of jobs we want to create than about the number that will be created. Paradoxically, the closest parallel to the current debate is not over energy or economics it all. Rather it is the bitter culture war over equal marriage. Faced with a trend which has swept almost the entire developed world and seems certain to prevail everywhere in time, the supporters of coal are seeking to delay the inevitable. As part of the global push to reduce CO2 emissions, investment in renewable solar and wind power has soared, while coal-fired power is disappearing from most countries in the developed world. The choice between wind turbines and steam turbines might seem to be purely one of technology. But since environmentalists support renewable energy, the demands of the culture war require that conservatives must oppose it. Before spelling this point out, it’s worth looking at the spurious rationales that have been put forward for putting public money into coal. Despite the rhetoric that surrounds it, the push for new coal-fired power isn’t about creating jobs. Taking account of both the construction and operation phase, the number of jobs associated with generating a given amount of renewable electricity is greater than the number required to generate coal-fired power. Solar PV alone employs over 10,000 people in Australia, more than the total in all forms of conventional generation. The coal-fired power plant proposed for north Queensland is claimed to create “up to” 750 jobs during construction and maintain 150 full-time positions. By contrast, proposals for a shift to 50% renewables have been estimated to involve 6,400 full time jobs over the next decade. Nor is there any reason to suppose that building a new coal-fired power plant would reduce electricity costs. Both economic analysis and the outcomes of competitive bidding processes show that new coal-fired power is more expensive than renewables, even without taking account of the cost of CO2 emissions. These facts explain the startling decline of coal-fired power over the past decade. Hardly any new coal-fired plants have been commissioned in the developed world in recent years. Of the 120 coal-fired power plants proposed in Europe in 2007, none have been brought to the construction stage. There is only one plant being constructed in North America: a 17 MW plant built by the University of Alaska, Fairbanks. There are a handful of exceptions to this trend of which the most notable is Japan where the response to the Fukushima disaster was to propose 45 new coal-fired plants. Economic and environmental reality is starting to bite, however, and it now appears unlikely that most of these proposals will come to fruition. Coal still has some momentum in the developing world, where rapid electrification has created a demand for new generation capacity from all sources. Even here, however, demand for renewables is accelerating while hundreds of proposed coal-fired power stations have been scrapped. Far from considering new coal-fired power stations, the real debate is about how fast existing ones will be closed. Attempts to form a government in Germany have foundered on disputes over how fast to wind down coal. More positively, at the UN climate conference in Bonn last week, 19 nations including the UK, New Zealand and Canada joined the Powering Past Coal Alliance and pledged to phase out coal-fired power altogether. If the end of coal-fired power is inevitable, as this analysis suggests, why is the political right fighting so hard to prevent the closure of old power stations and even to build new ones? The answer, as with equal marriage, is that the culture war is not, ultimately, about outcomes. Rather it is about stoking outrage against those (gays, greenies and leftists in general) who can be blamed for the changes that conservative voters find distressing, most of which are due more to financialisation and globalisation than to cultural shifts. Unfortunately, even if the fight against renewables is ultimately doomed to failure, the consequences of delay can be disastrous. If the policies being pushed by the LNP, nationally and in Queensland, are implemented, there is virtually no chance that we will meet our commitments under the Paris agreement. We can only hope that the rest of the world will be more sensible.

At a press conference in Adelaide on Wednesday, Kakoschke-Moore announced she had received advice from the UK Home Office on Friday, confirmed by a specialist barrister, that she had received British citizenship from her mother, who was born in Singapore in 1957. Kakoschke-Moore had always believed she was not British because her father had received advice from the British embassy in Oman she was not eligible for citizenship when she was 12. She said she was “heartbroken” to discover she was British, which she described as “extremely surprising” because she “had no reason to believe I was a British citizen until that point”. Kakoschke-Moore explained that her mother was born in Singapore, a former British colony, which gave her “citizenship of the United Kingdom and colonies” and became a British citizen in 1983 when the British Nationality Act came into effect. Kakoschke-Moore, born in Darwin in 1985, then gained that citizenship by descent. Kakoschke-Moore said she would request the matter be referred to the high court to determine how the vacancy would be filled, adding she would “continue to run” for the NXT and “at this stage” her ambition was to come back to the Senate. A recount of the 2016 Senate election would likely elect the NXT candidate Tim Storrer, who unsuccessfully attempted to replace Xenophon in the Senate by challenging the party’s chosen successor. Xenophon said he and his colleagues were “devastated” by the loss of Kakoschke-Moore from the Senate, but predicted it was “not the end of her political career”. Xenophon said the party had preliminary legal advice the position may not be filled by a recount, claiming the situation was “uncharted legal territory” because of the high court’s recent decision involving Hollie Hughes. Xenophon clarified that he was not suggesting that Storrer had an office of profit under the crown, as in the case of Hughes, but rather there was “an issue about him not being a member of the party” for some of the time since the 2016 election. Section 44(1) of the constitution prohibits citizens or subjects of a foreign power from sitting in parliament. Kakoschke-Moore is the third Nick Xenophon Team member to be caught up in the citizenship crisis. Xenophon was referred to the high court but cleared of having a section 44(1) disqualification and MP Rebekha Sharkie may be referred to the court because the renunciation of her British citizenship was not effective until after the nomination date for the 2016 election. Kakoschke-Moore joins Barnaby Joyce, Fiona Nash, Malcolm Roberts, Larissa Waters, Scott Ludlam, Stephen Parry, John Alexander and Jacqui Lambie as the ninth parliamentarian to be disqualified for foreign citizenship. Asked what the citizenship issues demonstrated about NXT’s processes, Xenophon said voters would see that section 44 had “a much broader scope than anyone could have anticipated” and many parties including cabinet ministers had been caught out. Xenophon acknowledged Sharkie may be referred to the high court but said she was in a “very strong position” because she had taken reasonable steps to renounce her British citizenship on 19 April, 2016. The revelation comes ahead of a new requirement for MPs and senators to disclose their foreign citizenship and steps taken to renounce it, agreed between the Coalition and Labor. Senators will have to make disclosures by 1 December while MPs will have until 5 December, because the Turnbull government cancelled a week of lower house sittings."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/nov/23/they-say-that-manus-is-hell-seeking-salvation-among-the-standoff","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-22T17:00:06Z","webTitle":"'I cannot leave my neighbour hungry': support for refugees from priest and major on Manus","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/nov/23/they-say-that-manus-is-hell-seeking-salvation-among-the-standoff","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/nov/23/they-say-that-manus-is-hell-seeking-salvation-among-the-standoff","fields":{"headline":"'I cannot leave my neighbour hungry': support for refugees from priest and major on Manus","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The major and the father seek salvation for the refugees of Manus Island, Papua New Guinea. Two Manusian men – Catholic priest Father Clement Taulam and retired army major Michael Kuweh – are defying the PNG and Australian governments in calling for assistance for the refugees and asylum seekers on Manus, and for a peaceable solution to the standoff inside the condemned Australian-run detention centre. Speaking at his Papitalai parish church on Los Negros Island, across a small bay from the detention centre, Taulam said the enforced shutdown of the centre – in which 380 men remain – had left people vulnerable and suffering. Over years of pastoral care, he has built up friendships with many of those in the centre, he told the Guardian and the Asylum Seeker Resource Centre. “Now when they say they have no food, no water, no lights, they are deprived physically but they are saying too, that the physical is also spiritual for them. They are deprived of faith. They are suffering.” Taulam said no government seemed willing to take care of the men who remain in the centre. “Australia seems to be saying, ‘Papua New Guinea, this is your responsibility’. And Papua New Guinea is saying to Australia, ‘Do your work, clean up your mess.’ And while this is going on, these people are suffering.” “I’ve been talking with them, going to see them. A lot of them want to go to Australia, because that was their initial intention, but it looks like Australia doesn’t want them and that’s why they put them out here to process them to other countries. We really don’t know what the outcome will be. Because right now those people are in a situation where they are really hard up and they are suffering.” Kuweh spent decades in the PNG military, rising from an enlisted rank to become a senior officer. He trained and served alongside Australian troops for years. He said Manusians were famously hospitable and had welcomed West Papuan refugees fleeing political violence in the 1960s. But he said Manusians were being stopped from providing food, water and medical assistance to the refugees and asylum seekers inside the detention centre. “Five years is a gruelling experience for many, and it doesn’t sit well for us, because … we are people of hospitality and the current situation is [that] the authorities denied us to give them [help]: ‘You can’t do that.’ Well, you can’t stop a Manusian to deliver anything. “I cannot leave my neighbour hungry. And leaving [people] without basic needs is out of the ordinary. Whose policy is that? Inhuman, totally inhuman.” Kuweh said Manus’s reputation had been damaged internationally by media coverage of the abuses, violence and privation over nearly five years of the detention centre’s operation. “We are being sunk,” he said. “Our name is being painted with all kinds of connotations. It is not good.” The situation inside the Manus Island detention centre, three weeks after it was formally shuttered, grows increasingly dire. Water is running low and the makeshift wells dug by the men inside have been deliberately befouled by PNG immigration in an attempt to coerce the men into leaving. There is a meagre and dwindling supply of food and precious little medicine. The fraught underground supply chain of essentials coming from Manusians outside anxious to help is ad hoc and vulnerable. Kon Karapanagiotidis from the Asylum Seeker Resource Centre said he was inspired to meet the father and the major and “to see men of such decency and integrity” taking action to ensure the men on Manus were not forgotten. “The story of the retired major and father in of all the suffering and injustice we witnessed on Manus shows us the power of people’s every day humanity and decency,” he said. “These men highlight an important story that has been missed by many.” But, Karapanagiotidis said, the responsibility for assisting should not fall to Manusian citizens. “The villains are not the local people of PNG,” he said. “Many feel as much unease, disgust and distress as to what has been done to the refugees and people seeking asylum on Manus as we do. The fault lies with the Australian government.” The crux of the standoff between the refugees and asylum seekers who remain in the detention centre and the authorities who want them gone is the safety of refugees moved to the Manus community, and their opportunities for a peaceable and productive future. Fraught relations between Manusians and the transplanted refugee and asylum seeker community have marred settlement attempts. Those inside the centre say they cannot be safe in Lorengau. Manus Island is a small, close-knit and familial community. Almost everybody in the province is connected by the tight bonds of wantok, the tribal ties and obligations that reach across the island. Manusians proudly boast of their island’s reputation as the friendliest of PNG’s provinces. The Christian values of charity and hospitality to strangers run deep here and are proudly proclaimed. And many Manusians are empathetic towards the refugees’ situation and have made significant efforts – often at great risk to themselves – to assist the men inside the centre and those seeking to make a life outside. But there is a significant minority that resents the imposition of the new population, which is exclusively young men. Tensions, present since the centre’s reopening in 2013, have been growing with the steady movement of refugees to the East Lorengau accommodation close to the township. There have been an increasing number of violent incidents between the local and refugee populations. Refugees have been attacked with machetes and iron bars, others report having been threatened, beaten and robbed numerous times. There is, too, tension over relations between refugees and Manusian women. Several babies have been born from these relationships, which have – in some circumstances – proven controversial in the conservative Christian community. One asylum seeker was accused of sexual offences against an underage girl. He was charged but denied the allegations. He died before the offences came to court. Compounding social issues, there is little physical space for refugees to go. Ninety-seven per cent of land in PNG is held customarily by family groups and is in many cases their sole source of income and food. Refugees sent to live in Lorengau find themselves forced to squat on someone else’s property and that owner is often resentful of their presence. Other issues grate too: the refugees are seen, by some, as receiving favourable treatment. They are being housed, sometimes with air-conditioning, and given allowances for food and medical treatment, benefits not afforded to Manusians. No one, not the Australian, PNG, or Manusian governments, is claiming that Manus Island represents a durable and safe solution for the men held on the island. Taulam said the concerns over safety were real, though the hostility towards refugees did not represent the majority of Manusians. “I have spoken to a few refugees who have gone to Lorengau and we do have some young people on the street who snatch their phones and things like that,” he said. “I think that at times some of them have been beaten. And so they feel that way that Lorengau is not safe for them because those things can happen. It happens in Papua New Guinea, it can happen to anyone. “Sometimes they say that Manus is hell. And we feel bad about that, because Manus is a good place and the people here are good.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/nov/23/read-this-to-be-the-smartest-person-at-the-thanksgiving-table","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-23T11:00:28Z","webTitle":"The stories to read to be the smartest person at the Thanksgiving table","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/nov/23/read-this-to-be-the-smartest-person-at-the-thanksgiving-table","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/nov/23/read-this-to-be-the-smartest-person-at-the-thanksgiving-table","fields":{"headline":"The stories to read to be the smartest person at the Thanksgiving table","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Across the turkey and cranberry sauce, your most opinionated relative waits, armed by social media for a yearly ritual: the Thanksgiving duels over current events, politics, and culture – the conversations that swing between asking for the stuffing and telling your family to stuff it.

Democracy demands to know","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Late last year, the Electoral Commission started an investigation into a striking set of circumstances. In February 2016 Steve Baker MP, lobbying for Vote Leave to be designated the “official” leave campaign, sent a round robin email asking recipients to support it, because it claimed to have found a loophole in the spending rules. “It is open to the Vote Leave family to create separate legal entities each of which could spend £700k: Vote Leave will be able to spend as much money as is necessary to win the referendum,” he wrote. But Baker – now a minister in the Department for Exiting the European Union (DExEU) – got it wrong. The law that protects our democracy from capture appears to make this behaviour illegal: when a sockpuppet signs your cheques, the spending still counts as yours. The Electoral Commission knew about Baker’s email – it was reported in the Times. But despite knowing that Vote Leave appeared to have contemplated acting unlawfully, the Electoral Commission went ahead and designated it as the official leave campaign. Then we come to the referendum campaign. With under a month to go, Vote Leave was bumping up against the limits of what it could lawfully spend. But it had plenty of money left over from wealthy donors. Of the £6.8m it spent in the referendum, around 40% was with a then obscure digital agency called AggregateIQ. It couldn’t spend more itself; it had a £7m cap, and needed a small safety margin. Breaching that cap could delegitimise the result. Enter Darren Grimes. Back then, he was a fashion design student with a modest social media presence. He had been closely involved in the Vote Leave campaign. He was in their offices during the campaign, and tweeted a photograph of himself wearing a Vote Leave T-shirt, with Michael Gove.. As Vote Leave’s returns to the Electoral Commission show, it gave AggregateIQ another £625,000. But this time the services were delivered not to Vote Leave but to Grimes. Vote Leave used the same device to pass £100,000 more to AggregateIQ for services notionally provided to Veterans for Britain. Problem solved, it thought. And, after a cursory and inadequate investigation, earlier this year the Electoral Commission agreed. Enter an unsung hero. Jenna Corderoy, an investigative journalist and transparency campaigner, unearthed a cache of correspondence between the commission and Grimes. It was passed to me, and reading it I was shocked by the quality of the commission’s investigation. It appeared to me to have failed to ask even the most basic facts. So I got together a team of lawyers – Polly Glynn, Jessica Simor QC and Tom Cleaver – and we issued urgent judicial review proceedings. Earlier this week, the day before it had to file its formal case in the high court, the Electoral Commission caved. A month ago it had asserted our claim was “without merit”. Now, a full 18 months after the vote, it agreed to reopen the investigation. And it asked us to agree to discontinue our high court claim. But why does all of this matter? If it turns out that Vote Leave executed Baker’s plan, it will have very substantially exceeded the amount of money it was allowed to spend, and will have committed a criminal offence. If so, we cannot know how much difference that illegal spending made to the vote. But parliament thought overspending could make a difference – that’s why it imposed caps. And wealthy donors thought it could make a difference – that’s why they donated those hundreds of thousands of pounds. And Vote Leave thought it could make a difference – that’s why it appears to have risked criminal sanction to pass those extra hundreds of thousands of pounds to AggregateIQ. If Vote Leave did commit a criminal offence – and the Good Law Project stands ready to bring a private criminal prosecution if the Electoral Commission will not – then parliament will have to work out how much it cares about the laws it enacted. The thing about an advisory referendum is that it is for parliament to decide what to do with the advice the electorate gives. It may be that parliament once was inclined to take the advice, but new facts may cause it to revisit its value. Of course, parliament could have gone for a binding referendum, as it did with the vote on electoral reform. But a binding referendum would have come with much stronger safeguards, and a serious breach of spending limits might well have invalidated the result. It’s not just about Brexit. The reason we have spending limits is because we want to live in a democracy, not a plutocracy. We want all the people to have the power, not just the rich ones. And the Electoral Commission’s job is to protect our democracy: to police those limits, carefully, sentiently, vigorously, without fear or favour. If it doesn’t do that job, our democracy can’t function. It’s bad enough our democracy should be for sale. But it’s unforgivable for the Electoral Commission to bite the hand it lives to serve. I am considering the matter with my legal team. But I am unlikely to accept the Electoral Commission’s request that we pull our high court challenge. Our democracy stands on the brink. We cannot afford any institutional failure by the Electoral Commission. I would rather place my trust in the law. • Jolyon Maugham QC is a barrister and director of the Good Law Project"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/nov/22/manus-humanitarian-crisis-a-damning-indictment-of-australias-refugee-policy-unhcr","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-21T23:00:28Z","webTitle":"Manus humanitarian crisis a 'damning indictment' of Australia's refugee policy: UNHCR","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/nov/22/manus-humanitarian-crisis-a-damning-indictment-of-australias-refugee-policy-unhcr","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/nov/22/manus-humanitarian-crisis-a-damning-indictment-of-australias-refugee-policy-unhcr","fields":{"headline":"Manus humanitarian crisis a 'damning indictment' of Australia's refugee policy: UNHCR","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The humanitarian crisis on Manus Island is manmade and entirely preventable, the UNHCR has said, labelling it a “damning indictment of a policy meant to avoid Australia’s international obligations”. The UNHCR also revealed accommodation for the refugees and asylum seekers is still not fully constructed, more than three weeks after the detention centre was officially closed and Australia’s immigration minister Peter Dutton said community housing was ready for detainees. It came as Papua New Guinea police and immigration deferred a joint operation to “politely” request the men to leave the centre ahead of a supreme court appeal case on Wednesday afternoon. The police commissioner, Gari Baki, said Operation Helpim Friends, was on hold pending the outcome of the case, filed on behalf of the refugees and asylum seekers. He earlier pledged the operation – assisted by the paramilitary police mobile squad – would use no force, but refugees “will be asked politely to pack up and voluntarily leave the centre”. Nai Jit Lam, UNHCR’s deputy regional representative in Canberra, made the comments from Manus Island in a briefing to the UN Palais des Nations in Geneva. Lam told the international community the situation on Manus was “very serious and deteriorating by the day”. About 380 men are inside the former detention facility without food, running water or medical care, saying they fear for their safety in the Lorengau community. There have been frequent attacks on detainees and well-documented tensions with locals. Inside the centre the situation was “desperate”, and outside, where authorities claim the men have accommodation and services waiting for them, it is “profoundly inadequate”, Lam said. Australia remained responsible for the refugees and asylum seekers, Lam said, accusing the country’s government of in effect creating and then abandoning “a humanitarian crisis at the doorstep of the international community”. “It is vital that Australia take responsibility and play an active role in achieving solutions for all the people Australia forcibly transferred to Papua New Guinea,” he said. “This is a manmade and entirely preventable humanitarian crisis. It is a damning indictment of a policy meant to avoid Australia’s international obligations.” The United Nations has been on the ground since the end of last month, and Lam detailed the current situation, which Lam described as the consequences of a problem created four years ago, “when Australia forcibly transferred people, refugees and asylum seekers to PNG and Nauru under their offshore policy”. Rubbish and waste was accumulating inside the centre, where services and water have been shut down, and health and sanitation was becoming a significant issue, as was the risk of disease, Lam said. Four members of staff assigned to look after the cases of the 700 men are not working due to local contractual disputes, the UN observed. Local tensions remain high with at least two further incidents at alternative accommodation units in the past week, including a break-in and switching off of a generator in the middle of the night, and a road blockade by locals. “Beyond the physical accommodation that we have been talking about, the most basic services needed for asylum seekers and refugees are still not adequately provided for outside the centre,” Lam said. His observations concluded that accommodation was still under major construction and possibly weeks away from completion. “After three weeks and constant announcements that alternative accommodation outside the centre and together with the services are ready, what we have observed so far actually represents a very different picture,” Lam said. Refugees and Manusian staff on the island have told the Guardian that the centres are not yet habitable. Pictures show heavy earth-moving equipment still on the sites, and work continuing to build fences and install services. At the West Lorengau centre running water is available only intermittently, sometimes only for an hour a day, and the supply of electricity is similarly intermittent. The Australian government has turned a deaf ear to the pleas of the refugees and asylum seekers, international human rights organisations, the Australian Medical Association, and the government of New Zealand, among others. The New Zealand prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, has called the situation unacceptable and has sought to offer her country’s assistance. Last week, having had its offer to resettle 150 refugees rejected, the New Zealand government offered $2.7m to PNG to provide essential services on Manus. Dutton dismissed the offer, saying it would be better spent on “another environment somewhere, to Indonesia for example”, and suggested Australia’s border protection policies had benefited New Zealand because boats were not getting to Auckland. He also warned against PNG and New Zealand making any kind of deal without Australia’s involvement, saying the two countries would have to think about their relationships with Australia and what kind of impact a deal would have. The Australian government was prioritising a deal made with the US’s Obama administration to take up to 1,200 refugees, but only 54 have so far been resettled."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/nov/22/ban-smoking-french-films-cigarettes","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-22T12:35:26Z","webTitle":"A ban on smoking in French films?

The idea makes me fume","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The French Socialist senator Nadine Grelet-Certenais has fired up a heated debate in France over the depiction of smoking in the movies. She wants it stubbed out, for good, on the basis that Gallic heroes puffing away on the silver screen makes the filthy habit seem cool and provides the evil tobacco industry with free advertising. Ban it, and everything will be made miraculously better – c’est simple. Her call has been taken up by the health minister, Agnès Buzyn, and suddenly film-makers have a fight on their hands. The problem with this is that it totally ignores the venerable history of French cinema, which plays out as a long, drawn-out visual love letter to the act of smoking. Smoking a cigarette and cinema have always gone perfectly together – they are both ways of killing time, after all – but the moving image also captures the act of smoking so much better than other art forms, such as still photography. The flare of a match or lighter, and then the upward curl of smoke are forever seductive. All the best French film directors knew this and have exploited it endlessly. Think of virtually any famous French film and cigarettes are an essential ingredient. Jean-Luc Godard’s À Bout de Souffle (Breathless) opens with Jean-Paul Belmondo driving and smoking, a fag dangling from his lower lip, and for the next 90 minutes he chainsmokes his way through the entire story until, shot in the back, he runs away, still puffing, to collapse and die on the street. Virtually his last act on falling to the pavement is to exhale a cloud of smoke, as if the very life is escaping out of him. For years, critics have thought the title refers to the love affair between Belmondo and Jean Seberg, or possibly the spirit of the new wave and the film’s construction, but actually it was all about the fags. Belmondo was literally à bout de souffle from industrial amounts of nicotine. Indeed, take the smoking away and what is left? French philosophers are still wrestling with this question in cafes across the country. Belmondo’s main iconic rival was Alain Delon, another alpha male who moodily puffed his way through hundreds of titles. One of the most stylish openings to any film is Jean-Pierre Melville’s Le Samouraï, which sees Delon lying on his bed smoking, a thick cumulus hovering above his prone body while a canary cheeps (or coughs) away in the corner. Melville lets the shot run for a full two minutes and the only movement in the entire scene is the undulation of the smoke and Delon’s hand lifting the cigarette to his lips. What all the great directors understood was that smoking on screen not only looks cool but also foreshadows mortality and therefore serves to define character. The antiheroes Belmondo and Delon portrayed are always fated to die, just as each cigarette they devour is fated to be stubbed out or tossed in to the Seine. Miraculous, then, considering their prodigious on-screen consumption of Gauloises and Gitanes, that both of these actors are still alive and now into their 80s, managing to outlive any of their onscreen alter egos and thereby questioning the politicians’ logic that banning smoking in the movies will help the nation’s health. If Belmondo and Delon still draw breath, then can smoking really be that bad for you? In any case, the movies may be the wrong target. As cinema continues its long decline, cigarettes have been revived and rediscovered on television. Popular American serials are currently thick with the fog of smoking, not least in 70s-set shows such as David Simon’s The Deuce and David Fincher’s Mindhunters. The Deuce even has twin James Francos, so that he can inhale and light up twice as often. The reality is that smoking and the moving image are inextricably linked, no matter where the stories are set. As long as there are tales to be told, film-makers will always employ the prop of a lit cigarette. • Stephen Leslie is a writer and photographer"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/nov/22/philip-ruddock-to-examine-if-australian-law-protects-religious-freedom","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-22T05:24:05Z","webTitle":"Philip Ruddock to examine if Australian law protects religious freedom","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/nov/22/philip-ruddock-to-examine-if-australian-law-protects-religious-freedom","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/nov/22/philip-ruddock-to-examine-if-australian-law-protects-religious-freedom","fields":{"headline":"Philip Ruddock to examine if Australian law protects religious freedom","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The former Liberal minister Philip Ruddock has been appointed to examine if Australian law adequately protects the human right to religious freedom. Ruddock’s appointment by cabinet, announced on Wednesday, is designed to head off a bruising debate about religious amendments in a same-sex marriage bill, but the treasurer, Scott Morrison, said the review was “no substitute” for those amendments. The prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, said it was important to look at the issue of religious freedom carefully, in light of the yes vote and impending legislation on marriage equality. While senior conservatives including Peter Dutton and Mathias Cormann have publicly suggested a religious freedom bill can be considered next year, separately to a marriage bill, others including Morrison and Liberal senator, David Fawcett, have insisted it be considered at the same time. Ruddock has been asked to report by 31 March. Turnbull said a variety of proposals for legislative changes to protect freedom of religion have been put forward in recent months but many of them go beyond the immediate issue of marriage, and parliament needed to be wary of them. “Any reforms to protect religious freedom at large should be undertaken carefully,” he said in a statement on Wednesday. “There is a high risk of unintended consequences when parliament attempts to legislate protections for basic rights and freedoms, such as freedom of religion. The government is particularly concerned to prevent uncertainties caused by generally worded bill of rights-style declarations. “This will be a timely expert stocktake to inform consideration of any necessary legislative reforms.” Turnbull said Ruddock was the right person to conduct the review because he had served as Australia’s special envoy for human rights. Ruddock will be helped by an expert panel consisting of the recently appointed president of the Australian Human Rights Commission, Rosalind Croucher, the Hon Annabelle Bennett and Father Frank Brennan. Morrison said he and Turnbull had been working on this appointment since the same-sex marriage postal survey returned a yes vote last week. “This is not a substitute for not dealing with amendments to the same-sex marriage bill in the parliament,” Morrison told the ABC’s AM program on Wednesday. “Those amendments, as individual members of parliament, will still be pursued and as you know I’ve a view that they should be supported. “What this does is says to 4.9 million Australians who [voted no], and I think to many more Australians who also believe religious protections to be looked after, that we will do a thorough review of this.” He said Ruddock would listen to the anxieties and fears of people who were concerned about the consequences that same-sex marriage could have for religious freedom. “I think this is a positive move,” he said. The Australian Christian Lobby director, Lyle Shelton, displayed hostility to the proposed review, claiming it was not sufficient because “the freedom of speech of 5 million Australians is about to be wiped out before Christmas”. “Sadly the new civic totalism can’t even by resisted by [the Liberal party],” he said. In a statement, the Institute of Public Affairs research fellow, Morgan Begg, said that section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act – which prohibits speech that offends, insults or intimidates people based on their race – “must be included in any review of religious freedoms”. “Freedom of speech is at the heart of freedom of religion,” he said. “You can’t live with a religious worldview if you don’t also have the freedom to express that worldview without threat of legal restriction.” Ruddock told Sky News on Wednesday he did not know if he was getting paid for the role and he was not interested in the money. He also would not reveal how he voted in the same-sex marriage survey, saying he did not think it was relevant. “I am known to have been responsible as the attorney general for implementing certain legislation,” he said, referring to legislation he introduced to parliament in 2004 explicitly banning same-sex marriage. Marriage celebrants have been required by law since 2004 to say that marriage is “the union of a man and a woman to the exclusion of all others”. “I don’t think I ought to be making judgments in relation to these issues, and purporting to make statements on the basis of how I may or may not have voted in which people will suggest that my judgment ... has been in some way impaired. “That’s a matter which I’m going to turn my mind to openly with the others that have been chosen ... will we bring our independent judgments to bear in the most appropriate way.” Ruddock recently became the mayor of Hornsby shire council in Sydney. He was Australia’s second-longest serving member of federal parliament, sitting in the House of Representatives for 43 years from 1973 to 2016."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2017/nov/24/tracking-trump-turkey-pardons-thanksgiving","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-25T06:00:16Z","webTitle":"Tracking Trump: turkey pardons and teeing off with Tiger Woods","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/nov/24/tracking-trump-turkey-pardons-thanksgiving","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/nov/24/tracking-trump-turkey-pardons-thanksgiving","fields":{"headline":"Tracking Trump: turkey pardons and teeing off with Tiger Woods","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Last weekend Faced with a quiet moment, Donald Trump tends to stir up a spat with a sports star or a celebrity, seemingly in order to open new fronts in America’s “culture wars” and reassure his base about which side he’s on. When it comes to sports, Trump’s targets are often African American, and he pursued a few such targets this week. Regular readers may remember that when last week the president asked China to free three UCLA basketball players accused of shoplifting, his main concern was that the players would thank him, which they did. But when LaVar Ball, the father of one of the arrested players and an inveterate attention seeker himself, questioned just how critical a role Trump actually played, it enraged the president. “I should have left them in jail!” he tweeted on Sunday, adding six hours later that he “should have gotten his son [LiAngelo Ball] out during my next trip to China instead … Very ungrateful!” Trump – whose sons Donald Jr and Eric are well-known hunters – also gave more clues about his perhaps surprisingly critical views on the US Fish and Wildlife Service plan to allow imports of elephant trophies from Zimbabwe and Zambia, tweeting: “Big-game trophy decision will be announced next week but will be very hard pressed to change my mind that this horror show in any way helps conservation of Elephants or any other animal.” Monday Returning to his racially tinged offensive, Trump singled out Marshawn Lynch of the Oakland Raiders for sitting down during the playing of The Star-Spangled Banner. “Great disrespect!” tweeted the president, adding another dog whistle for the base when he pointed out that Lynch had stood up “for the Mexican anthem”. Black athletes have been protesting during the national anthem since the summer, to highlight police violence and racial injustice. Tuesday Sexual misconduct accusations against the Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore are a less divisive issue, at least outside Alabama – Moore has been condemned widely, including by numerous GOP figures. But after some prevaricating Trump came down on the candidate’s side. Asked the memorable question “Is Roy Moore, [allegedly] a child molester, better than a Democrat?”, Trump pointed out that Moore denied the claims against him, one of which involves a woman who was 14 at the time, and said: “I can tell you one thing for sure: we don’t need a liberal person in there, a Democrat.” Trump has himself been accused by numerous women of sexual harassment. He denies the claims. His stance prompted a rare show of unity from New York’s fiercely rivalrous tabloids: As Thanksgiving approached, Trump took part in the tradition of pardoning a couple of turkeys, with the White House Instagram account asking beforehand: “Which turkey should President Trump pardon?” Reports that Donald Trump Jr, Michael Flynn and Paul Manafort were madly refreshing the page could not be confirmed at press time. Wednesday After getting up bright and early to resume his feuds with Ball and the kneeling NFL players, Trump informed his Twitter followers he would be “having meetings and working the phones from the Winter White House in Florida (Mar-a-Lago)”. (Donald, stop trying to make “Winter White House” happen – it’s not going to happen.) A White House spokesperson, however, was less on-message, telling press travelling with the president she expected a “low-key day”, according to the pool report shared by journalists. Within minutes, a correction arrived: “While the White House communications staff expects the press pool to have a ‘low-key day’, the president will NOT have a low-key day and has a full schedule of meetings and phone calls.” Just over an hour later, the Trump motorcade set off from Mar-a-Lago, arriving at Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach at 9.26am. Various parts of the White House and Republican party had a similarly full schedule, in their case plugging various bits of Trump-related Christmas merch: Thursday Trump made a Thanksgiving visit to Coast Guard Station Lake Worth Inlet in Florida, handing out sandwiches and asking one musclebound fellow if he could beat him at arm wrestling. He then spent four hours at his golf club, before heading back to Mar-a-Lago for a Thanksgiving meal with friends and family. The menu included “turkey, stuffing, mashed potatoes and gravy, sweet potatoes w marshmallows, a variety of baked goods, local produce and cheeses, red snapper and Florida stone crab”, according to Melania’s spokeswoman. “Dessert includes various cakes and pies,” she added. But the worries of the world intruded with reports that lawyers for the former national security adviser Michael Flynn have stopped working with Trump’s team, suggesting Flynn may now be cooperating with the special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 US election and any links to Trump’s campaign. If true, that could be a worrying sign for the president. Friday Trump returned to the golf course on Friday at just after 9am, this time in the company of the professionals Tiger Woods and Dustin Johnson – and unusually, he admitted as much on Twitter, perhaps unable to resist the name-drops. The president was careful, however, to make clear he would not spend the whole day on the green. “I will be heading over to Trump National Golf Club, Jupiter, to play golf (quickly) with Tiger Woods and Dustin Johnson,” he tweeted. “Then back to Mar-a-Lago for talks on bringing even more jobs and companies back to the USA!” He wrapped up at about 1.30pm, spending a similar amount of time there as he had the previous two days. “I play golf to relax,” Trump said in one of many tweets slamming Barack Obama’s golf habit in 2011. “My company is in great shape. @BarackObama plays golf to escape work while America goes down the drain.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2017/nov/21/thibaut-courtois-chelsea-contract-talks-spanish-interest","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-21T18:47:03Z","webTitle":"Thibaut Courtois’ Chelsea contract talks on hold amid Spanish interest","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/nov/21/thibaut-courtois-chelsea-contract-talks-spanish-interest","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/nov/21/thibaut-courtois-chelsea-contract-talks-spanish-interest","fields":{"headline":"Thibaut Courtois’ Chelsea contract talks on hold amid Spanish interest","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Thibaut Courtois does not expect discussions to resume over a new contract at Chelsea until the end of the season, when he will be entering the final 12 months of his deal. The previous round of talks in May failed to reach an agreement. The goalkeeper, who spent three successful years on loan at Atlético Madrid after joining Chelsea from Genk, has been an integral part of the team who have won two Premier League titles in the past three seasons. His agent, Christophe Henrotay, held talks with the champions towards the end of last season, seeking to take the Belgian’s wages closer to the £200,000 a week level enjoyed by Eden Hazard at Stamford Bridge and another of the division’s elite goalkeepers, David de Gea, at Manchester United. Although Courtois – who kept 16 clean sheets in the league last season – is happy at Chelsea and willing to sign improved terms, he has regularly expressed his fondness for life in La Liga, where his situation continues to be monitored by a number of clubs, notably Real Madrid. His former girlfriend has returned to Spain with the couple’s two children. Chelsea are well aware of interest in him from Spanish clubs and will be anxious to achieve a positive resolution before the player goes into the final year of his deal, potentially damaging his value and their bargaining position. “The most important thing is to perform well for myself and the team,” said Courtois before the Champions League game against Qarabag. “Regarding my contract, that’s something where Chelsea must deal with my agent. I don’t think there have been any new developments. We have so many games at the moment, and I prefer to focus on the team’s matches, my own performances, and there will be time enough towards the end of the season to have talks.” Courtois will seek to smooth Chelsea’s progress into the knockout phase with victory in Azerbaijan on Wednesday, with the visitors’ squad having stuck to Greenwich mean time in an attempt to overcome the four-hour time difference with one eye on Saturday’s daunting trip to Liverpool. The players took the six-hour flight on Monday, training in Baku on the eve of the tie, and will make the 2,500-mile return journey immediately after the match. They do not expect to arrive back in London until around 5am. That has dismayed Antonio Conte, who aired his frustration earlier this season when his team were asked to play Manchester City on the Saturday after the game at Atlético on the Wednesday night. This week’s scenario is arguably more brutal – Liverpool play Sevilla on Tuesday – given the travelling involved, with Conte again asking questions of the Premier League and television companies involved in fixture scheduling. “I’m a bit surprised because it’s the second time this situation has happened,” he said. “The first time it was the same: when we played on Wednesday away at Atlético Madrid and came back to London at 5am and then, on the Saturday, we played Manchester City, who had played on the Tuesday. Now this. It will be very difficult for us to recover. Whoever prepared the fixtures for the league must pay great attention. I don’t like to find excuses but sometimes I think it’s right to give respect for our job. “I’d like to underline I’m talking for all the teams who are playing in the Champions League, not just for Chelsea. At this moment, England needs to try to understand this problem and change something. For a lot of time, there hasn’t been an English team playing a final in the Champions League. Why is this? The teams are very strong, and every team has the possibility to go through to the Champions League final. Whoever prepares these fixtures must pay great attention. We are doing our job but we want also a bit of respect for our job. “We won’t be back until 5am, but then to prepare the game in only one day will be very difficult. But this isn’t the first time. Imagine playing against Manchester City in the same condition? If we’d won the game, the gap would only be three points now. If we’d drawn it, it would be six points. Now it’s nine points. Now there is another big game against Liverpool. So if you ask me if we’re ready to catch up City, whoever prepares the fixtures must change something.” Conte may seek to rest some players before the game at Anfield and will consider whether N’Golo Kanté, Gary Cahill and Tiémoué Bakayoko are required to start in Baku’s Olympic stadium. “It’s normal to have rotation for the team but I trust all my players,” he said. “I have a squad with great maturity. My players know very well the importance of the game against Qarabag. Don’t forget that Qarabag have drawn twice against Atlético Madrid, and Roma struggled a lot before winning here against them. We have great respect for this team. If someone thinks this game will be easy, it won’t be.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2017/nov/28/channel-flopping-tour-tv-worst-genres","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-28T09:00:00Z","webTitle":"Channel flopping: a tour of TV's worst genres","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/nov/28/channel-flopping-tour-tv-worst-genres","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2017/nov/28/channel-flopping-tour-tv-worst-genres","fields":{"headline":"Channel flopping: a tour of TV's worst genres","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The Weekend Cookery Show Deathless celebration of all things banter, forged in vinaigrette and molten moccasin Hours of: Scallops in chino runoff.

Two of her best and most memorable works, which reveal her father’s influence, are a striking self-portrait from 1954, and a 1957 portrait of Stanley himself. She had three solo shows of her paintings in London, and contributed to many mixed exhibitions, from the London Group to the Royal Academy shows. The first of her one-person shows was at Lauderdale House in Highgate, in 1993, the second at the Boundary Gallery in St John’s Wood in 2001, both in north London, but it was the third that really established her reputation. In 2015, the Fine Art Society in Bond Street mounted the first West End exhibition of her work, to coincide with the publication of her autobiography, Lucky to Be an Artist. Fifty of her paintings from all periods were shown along with her etchings, accompanied by a group of pictures by her family: works by her parents, her uncles Gilbert Spencer and Richard Carline, and by her grandfather George Carline. This show came at the suggestion of a friend, the painter David Inshaw. He recalled visiting her house in Clapham (where, according to her son, she had inscribed “Daring, Joy and Love” on her bedroom wall), expecting to find it hung with paintings by herself and her parents. But the walls were oddly bare, with not even her own work in sight. The public has always been more interested in the Spencer/Carline family’s eccentric lifestyle than in the art produced and Unity spent a substantial part of her life explaining if not defending her parents. This was not always an easy task, as her unusual upbringing had left her prey to depression, and her own life was a troubled one. She recorded its ups and downs in her memoir and wrote matter-of-factly: “Children of geniuses tend to have a rather hard time of it.” She did however sum up Stanley thus: “My father needed to be alone a great deal, not because he had a ‘monkish’ temperament but simply that he had to go into himself and rummage around and walk about inside himself; this was his source of strength and conviction.” This is a precise description of a very particular artistic identity. Born in Hampstead, north London, Unity was the second daughter of Hilda (nee Carline) and Stanley. Of Unity, Stanley commented: “The baby looks awful but will improve with time”; in fact, she grew into a beautiful woman. The Carlines were an artistic dynasty of some repute, and both Unity’s parents were painters. This made for a lively and unusual existence. For instance, as a small baby, Unity was wrapped in a shawl and laid on a chair in the chapel at Burghclere, in Hampshire, while her father continued to paint the murals that are one of his finest achievements. By 1932 the family had settled in Stanley’s home village of Cookham, in Berkshire. Both parents were difficult, Stanley legendarily so, and after meeting and becoming infatuated with a local artist, Patricia Preece, he soon decided he and Hilda could no longer live together. When Unity was four, her mother took her to live with her Grannie Carline in Hampstead, where she went to Miss Osborn Smith’s school. Her older sister, Shirin, had already been sent away to live with a distant relative, a Mrs Harter, when Unity was born. “So from then until I was about 19 there were big gaps when we saw little or nothing of D [her father].” And when she did see him, her loyalties were divided, in even the most basic of ways. “M [her mother] tried to make me tidy, D liked me to be untidy.” In 1937, Hilda and Stanley divorced, and Stanley married Patricia. Hilda could not take the strain, and two years later Unity was sent to Epsom to live with Shirin and Mrs Harter. This was not a happy time and Unity felt rejected. It seemed that neither of her parents would take responsibility for her, and thus she began to suffer from the deep-seated anxiety and low self-esteem that were to plague her for many years. Although she maintained that both her parents were loving people, neither was especially demonstrative, except when it came to art. Hilda gave Unity her first oil painting lesson. Stanley talked to her about the design and rhythm of a painting and once told her that design was the image of the soul. Unity had the chance to get to know her father better in the 1940s when his relationship with Patricia was finally over (although she would never grant him a divorce) and began to visit his daughters regularly. Unity was by now at Badminton school, which had moved from Bristol to Devon during wartime (1941-48). “I didn’t feel resentful – rightly or wrongly,” Unity said. “I felt that he was honest about what had happened … that he had taken himself to task over it. And that meant a lot to me.” But time was running out for Hilda, whose behaviour became increasingly irrational. Not only did Unity have to face the challenge of understanding her mother’s mental illness, but Hilda, being a Christian Scientist, would never accept that she was ill, which made her terminal cancer even more difficult to cope with. Unity was determined to be a professional artist and had just started as a student at the Slade (after two years at Wimbledon Art School) when her mother died in 1950. In 1956 she suffered her first bout of depression, which lasted for more than a year. However, she kept working during these dark times, earning her living teaching art, first at The Downs in Herefordshire, then at Bedgebury Park school in Kent (1956-61). Stanley died in 1959, and Unity’s feelings of loneliness and her need to be protected and loved became ever more pronounced. The following year she joined the International Voluntary Service and spent two summers working in Germany, digging trenches with pickaxes and helping to build homes for Hungarian refugees. In 1961 she met Leslie Lambert, who was to be the father of her son and who, she wrote, “was to blight the next decade of my life”. Almost 20 years older than Unity, he was a communist, former trade union official and a member of the Salvation Army, but also moody and unstable. By her account, life with him was surpassingly difficult, as he subjected her to a campaign of mental cruelty, and nagged her into getting pregnant. Their son, John, was born in 1963. The couple did not marry, and legal battles ensued over the child’s custody, which were only resolved when Leslie died after a heart attack in 1971. Unity herself nearly collapsed, and she received counselling and therapy to help her through the subsequent 10 years. She was also drawn to the Quakers for comfort. It was not until 1975 that she returned to teaching, first at a Rudolf Steiner school in London and later at Long Close school in Slough (1980-88). For a year in between she taught art to hairdressers at Langley College of Further Education in Slough (1977). Dance and music were immensely important to her, and if she had not been an artist, she once said, then she would have wanted to be a professional dancer. One of her early paintings reveals her varied interests, the subject being a backstage view of an opera: “I’m in the foreground because I was living in two worlds. I was a student at the Slade and a member of the chorus of The Merry Wives of Windsor.” She poured herself into her art, and painted orchestral rehearsals and concerts, travel by bus and tube, all kinds of domestic scenes and landscapes. Her painting life was interrupted by spells of profound depression (until they miraculously ceased in 2001), but these emotional upsets gave her a wider spectrum of subject to put into her art. She developed a form of surrealist dream painting, and her more inventive work often makes direct reference to Edvard Munch’s symbolic treatment of psychological themes. Although art for her was an important form of therapy, she was very clear about the role of art in healing people: she knew it did not automatically make them good artists and she had no illusions about the difference between amateur and professional. She remarked late in life: “People say to me, ‘Oh Unity, it must be so relaxing to be an artist.’ Absolute rubbish. Art is hard work. I am lucky to be an artist.” Unity is survived by her son, John, and her sister, Shirin. • Unity Rose Spencer, artist, born 24 May 1930; died 18 October 2017"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"business/2017/nov/22/jobs-risk-furniture-maker-multiyork-administration","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-22T18:53:34Z","webTitle":"Furniture maker Multiyork enters administration, putting 500 jobs at risk","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/nov/22/jobs-risk-furniture-maker-multiyork-administration","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2017/nov/22/jobs-risk-furniture-maker-multiyork-administration","fields":{"headline":"Furniture maker Multiyork enters administration, putting 500 jobs at risk","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Multiyork Furniture has called in administrators, putting more than 500 jobs at risk. The furniture maker, which employs 547 people in 50 shops and manufactures upholstered furnishings in Thetford, Norfolk, has struggled amid a tough retail market in which shoppers are shying away from spending on expensive items for their homes. Multiyork had reportedly been put on the market by its major shareholder, the furnishings tycoon Charles Wade of Wade Furniture Group, which also owns beds maker Feather &amp; Black. The two brands are run as separate entities and the administration does not include the bed maker. Administrators said that Multiyork has fallen into financial difficulties as it could not meet its financial liabilities as a result of trading losses. The company had net debt of £1.9m at its 2016 year end, according to the latest accounts filed at Companies House. It recorded a profit of just £479,000 in the 53 weeks to 2 October 2016 after a £714,000 loss a year before. The company increased sales by 5.4% to £50.4m, partly thanks to an extra week’s trading on the year before. The brand, which was founded in 1978 and initially operated in the Old Mill site in the village of Mellis, Suffolk, was rescued from receivership by Wade in 1995. Allan Graham of Duff &amp; Phelps, who was appointed joint administrator on Tuesday, said the business would continue to run for a short period as administrators continue to look for a buyer. “We are asking interested parties to come forward as quickly as possible,” he said. “Trading conditions for UK retailers continue to be difficult due to a number of factors including economic uncertainty, rising commodity prices, increasing business rates and the fall in value of the pound which has increased the cost of importing raw materials and products,” Graham said. “This appears to be leading to a sharp fall in consumer confidence and less money being spent on discretionary items.” The collapse of Multiyork comes after B&amp;Q, John Lewis and online electrical goods specialist AO all pointed to a slowdown in major purchases for the home this week. Redecorating, renovating and DIY projects are being put on hold as household budgets come under pressure in the run-up to Christmas. Sofa specialist DFS, which also owns Sofa Workshop and Dwell, last month revealed a 22% plunge in annual profits as it said shoppers were cutting back on big-ticket purchases. But not all furnishings businesses are suffering. On Wednesday, ScS, one of the UK’s largest retailers of upholstered furniture and floorings, revealed a 2.9% rise in orders at established stores in the 16 weeks to 18 November. Dunelm also flagged a sales recovery last month, easing concerns after the departure of its relatively new chief executive John Browett. Graham said that the current management of Multiyork would continue to work with administrators to review all orders placed up until 22 November with the intention that all orders would be completed. “We ask that customers who have placed orders be patient during this time and you will be contacted with further updates in relation to your order shortly,” he said. •Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"education/2017/nov/22/children-need-courses-in-computing-and-finance","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-22T18:42:57Z","webTitle":"Children need courses in computing and finance | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2017/nov/22/children-need-courses-in-computing-and-finance","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/education/2017/nov/22/children-need-courses-in-computing-and-finance","fields":{"headline":"Children need courses in computing and finance","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"How sad to read how far behind we are in teaching children computing skills (We’re sending analogue children into a digital future, 20 November). In the late 1970s I was one of the first computer studies teachers. Our secondary school started with one microcomputer and 90 pupils taking computer studies as an option subject. The computer was booked solidly from early morning to night-time so pupils could access the exciting new technology for their coursework, which was 100% programming. Pupils of all abilities were totally engaged with the practical side of the course and derived huge satisfaction from even the simplest of programs. It was also unique in providing an outlet for the brightest pupils to stretch themselves, with future Oxbridge students working at projects way beyond the understanding of their teachers. Then, as the years passed by, came the educational “experts” who decided that learning IT skills (how to use PowerPoint, Word, Excel etc) was the way forward and computer studies courses became a thing of the past. Without a doubt, had computing courses expanded in line with the development of the technology, Britain could have been leading the world, not sitting marvelling at what children in other countries can produce. Bob Epton Brigg, Lincolnshire • John Harris addresses an important issue: of course school computer education ought always to have been about much more than PowerPoint. Forty years ago I was lecturing to civil servants at the now-defunct Civil Service College (abolished by the Tories in 1995) on ICT and systems. Our students were both IT specialists and generalists/fast-streamers. We covered just those topics that John Harris references – logical and structured thinking (in essence, programming), systems analysis and design, project and cost management and implementation. The title of his piece embodies a further issue. Children – we humans – are analogue, and although the systems we use now and in the future are digital, I contend that we are more easily able to control them through analogue interfaces. A turned knob to control volume has advantages over buttons – the knob shows the setting by its position, and is capable of a delicacy of adjustment that a button cannot easily offer. One of the design lessons that children should be learning is that the command and control and feedback interface is as important as the underlying application; each is useless if the other is ineffective. Greg Conway Amersham, Buckinghamshire • Great to see the Guardian raising the cause of financial education for young people (Vital lessons in finance ignored as secondary schools fail Generation Debt, 11 November). But there’s a big hole in the article: if most teachers can’t/won’t do it due to a lack of time, training or resources, what’s the solution? How can young people get access to this vital information, learn skills such as budgeting and address mindsets like delayed gratification now? We can’t afford to be purists about this any more. Money skills are but a single bullet point covering just public finances and some maths on a guideline of a national curriculum mandated to 11- to 16-year-olds in less than 50% of schools. Those who care have to be realists about the funding, time and expertise available. Teachers shouldn’t be expected to do everything; they need support. It’s time to seriously look at alternative provision. Our charity, MyBnk, can deliver everything prescribed on the national curriculum in three 100-minute sessions by a single trained and tested education officer. Because we have the time teachers don’t and build our programmes with young people, we can bring a dull subject to life using modern, updated resources. Schools pay just a third of the delivery cost. The City gets it. The Tax Incentivise Savings Association has brought together 20 leading investment firms to support our primary school lessons in Kickstart Money. I welcome one and all to join me on the frontline to see what’s really going on! Declan Wilkes Head of communications, MyBnk • The amendment of Baroness Kidron to the upcoming data protection bill to include child protection measures (Report, 18 November) is welcome, albeit long overdue. Tech firms have effectively been allowed to get away with barraging children with targeted advertising and notifications, and we have all heard the horror stories of kids spending thousands on their parents’ cards thanks to one-click payments built in to children’s games and apps. This is unscrupulous and unacceptable. Children rarely have the money to fund these in-app purchases. Exploiting their lack of financial knowledge could be perceived as stealing directly from kids’ pockets or their parents’ wallets. The payments and financial industries have made moves to support parents in protecting their children online – building in extra layers of authentication and enabling parental notifications and spending limits with youth-focused pre-paid or debit cards. However, we must also question whether children are aware when they are being targeted or marketed to. Regulation is crucial, but building in online awareness to financial education classes in schools could arguably be just as effective. This modern and dangerous problem requires collaboration between parents, schools, government and the financial sector. At a time when personal and household debt in the UK is at an all-time high, it is more important than ever to prepare young people for the digital economy and instil in them financial confidence and competence for the future.

The chancellor unveiled plans, including a new duty band on still cider and perry with an alcohol content between 6.9% and 7.5%, in a move the Treasury said was aimed at “white cider”. White cider is often cited as a particular problem for alcoholics and homeless people because it is cheap but strong. But traditional cider makers, some with decades of history in the craft, warned that they would be caught up in legislation that might not even have the desired effect. Arfur Daley, of the family-run Gwatkin Cider, in Herefordshire, said: “It won’t affect the larger cider makers. But the more artisanal cider makers it will affect. I’d like to see an exception if you’re using whole fruit. Larger cider makers use concentrate, but everything we make is from the apples.” Neil Worley, managing director of Worley’s Cider, in Somerset, said that while small producers could suffer, white cider firms could still sell cheap high-strength drink. “They will just reformulate to 6.9%,” he said. “At £3.50 a bottle the price would be 15.5p a unit and at 6.9% it’s 16.9p per unit, so the difference is negligible.” But the plans also drew criticism from larger white cider firms, such as Aston Manor Cider, whose 7.5% Frosty Jack’s brand costs £3.59 for a three-litre bottle in the shop Iceland. A spokesperson said the duty rise had no merit. “What this action will mean is that the vast majority of white cider consumers – not the chancellor and his friends perhaps – will be disproportionately penalised,” the spokesperson said. The budget also included measures which pubs and alcohol firms said would be worth more than £400m a year to them and their customers. A freeze on alcohol duty will save beer drinkers £117m a year, according to the British Beer &amp; Pubs Association, while the Wine and Spirits Trade Association said its members would save £247m. The measure means that the Treasury will forgo nearly £1.2bn in alcohol duty by 2023. Pubs hit by a rise in business rates will get a £1,000 discount extended for another year, a move saving them about £20m in all, according to the Association of Licensed Multiple Retailers. The measure for calculating business rate increases will change from the RPI measure of inflation to CPI, which the association said would save pubs £100m over four years."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"stage/2017/nov/24/margaret-cho-love-pauline-and-her-pens-from-league-of-gentlemen","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-24T14:00:00Z","webTitle":"Margaret Cho: ‘I love Pauline and her pens from The League of Gentlemen’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/nov/24/margaret-cho-love-pauline-and-her-pens-from-league-of-gentlemen","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2017/nov/24/margaret-cho-love-pauline-and-her-pens-from-league-of-gentlemen","fields":{"headline":"Margaret Cho: ‘I love Pauline and her pens from The League of Gentlemen’","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The funniest standup I’ve ever seen It was Paul Foot’s private show for specially selected audience members at a small pub in London.

A colleague tweeted a picture of it that went viral. We noticed it after arriving at hospital with a patient in a critical condition. It had been our first job of the day and when we had pulled up outside the property, people were waiting outside to meet us. I could tell from the expression of one man that he was very concerned. We weren’t going to be at the scene for long. The patient was vomiting blood. I told my colleague to get a stretcher. We usually take a measured approach to parking but with an incident like this we want to know what is going on before looking for a parking space that could see us backtracking 200-300 metres. The road was double parked and, to be honest, I can’t remember if my crewmate had blocked the drive. The note didn’t surprise me. I’ve seen it before. I was probably more surprised that someone hadn’t confronted us. It would be more common for people to knock on the door or approach us in person while we’re on a job. When you’re working as a solo responder in a car, that can be quite intimidating. The tweet was covered by most of the UK national newspapers. It was the most read story on the BBC website for a while. It wasn’t long before the story escalated further. I was concerned about how quickly details of my patient’s condition were published. I’m not sure who disclosed that they were vomiting blood. I found it upsetting that some titles were quick to mention that they were in a rehabilitation facility but that they were clean at the time we attended and took them to hospital. Does that matter? Does it make their life any less important? These details would have made the patient identifiable to some people – perhaps even some family members who didn’t know they were in rehabilitation. I later found out via the media that my patient had died. I was only with them for 45 minutes, but they were conscious and I had talked to them. Many patients are unconscious or too poorly to communicate, so you expect the worst. This wasn’t like that. Normally I’d find out about a patient through a colleague or someone at the hospital. All this information came out because of one tweet. I have mixed thoughts about social media. I think, in healthcare, we have to use it to our advantage to take opportunities to educate people about what we do, as well as for health promotion to big audiences. Nobody would take any notice if all we were doing was saying the symptoms of a stroke. I think we’re navigating fine lines, however. My main concerns are around personal information that could make people identifiable when they don’t want to be. Even if people consent to images or details being shared – like a woman who has had a baby in the back of an ambulance – is it informed consent when someone is in a vulnerable position? Getting in an ambulance is a stressful incident for many, after all. A couple of weeks later and I am still troubled. How did it get to the point where the national media was reporting personal details that would normally remain confidential and potentially amounted to intrusion into a family’s grief? As paramedics, we have brief relationships with people at their most vulnerable: a short window where trust is gained and reassurance is given. I think of my patient’s family and their grief, which has been overshadowed by this social media storm. In 17 years of working for the ambulance service, there have been few cases that I have taken home with me, but this is one I cannot avoid. This story made headlines, but I wonder if it’s helped anybody. Has it made people think twice before being confrontational with ambulance crews? Livingstone House, where we attended, is a charity. Has it had any donations? Has it been helped? I would like to think so, but probably not.

The November 2017 budget was its economic equivalent. Forget the extra money to paper over the cracks in the NHS. Leave to one side the willingness to throw money at sorting out universal credit. The real story was not the latest attempt to boost home ownership but the news from the Office for Budget Responsibility on the state of the economy. This was little short of calamitous. For the past 100 years and more the UK has gradually got a bit better at doing things. New machines have been introduced. Workers have become more skilled. More has been produced with less effort and as a result living standards have risen steadily. Until the financial crisis, this improvement in productivity averaged 2% a year, with periods of stronger growth in the 1950s and 1960s balancing out the bad times, such as the 1920s and early 1930s. The OBR, the government’s independent forecasting body, says this long-term trend has been broken. Britain can no longer expect productivity growth of around 2% a year; instead it will have to make do with around 1% a year. Before the financial crisis, the UK was at or near the top of the G7 league table; now it is at the bottom. Inevitable consequences flow from this. Slower growth means individuals and companies pay less tax. Unless public spending is cut, that means the government has to borrow more. It is now more than 10 years since the start of the financial crisis and the OBR’s gloomy outlook marks the moment when Britain has to stop kidding itself. Growth is not going to return to its pre-crash levels. The 21% gap between output per hour now and where it would have been had it remained on its pre-2007 path is never going to be closed. Britain is substantially and permanently poorer. According to Philip Hammond, there is nothing to worry about. Britain is alive with innovation and is at the cutting edge of the coming fourth industrial revolution. Churchillian rhetoric of the “blood, sweat and tears” type is not really Hammond’s style, even though on this occasion it would have been merited because the economy is now going to be £49bn smaller at the end of the current parliament than previously envisaged. The chancellor’s message, rather, was to keep calm and carry on. The best that can be said for Hammond is that he didn’t make a bad situation worse. He could have responded to the OBR’s gloomier forecasts by hunkering down, by imposing fresh public spending cuts or raising taxes. Instead, he has done the opposite. He has decided to increase spending and borrowing to see the economy through what is expected to be a rocky period when the UK leaves the EU in 2019. In its own modest way, the budget adhered to Keynesian principles. There will be an extra £2.7bn of borrowing in 2018-19 and a rather more substantial £9.2bn in 2019-20, when Britain will be leaving the EU. It certainly makes sense for the government to be leaning against the wind at a time when the private sector is inevitably going to be wary of investing, especially since the chancellor can do so by once again pushing back the date by which Britain’s public finances will be back in the black. In the dim and distant days of 2010, George Osborne promised he could get on top of the UK’s budget deficit in one five-year parliamentary term. That soon became two parliaments and now, it would appear, the earliest date for budget balance will be the middle of the next decade. Osborne’s notion that he could cut the economy back to growth has been tested to destruction over the past seven years. Britain has ended up with slower growth, weaker productivity, stubbornly high borrowing, a doubling of debt and growth that is still over-dependent on personal debt. The good news is that Hammond has effectively called time on the age of austerity. The bad news is that his drip-feed of new money is not nearly enough to compensate for previously announced Whitehall spending cuts, the benefits freeze and the fall in real incomes caused by the cost of living running ahead of inflation. Listening to Hammond, the impression was of a real giveaway budget of the sort that Nigel Lawson delivered in 1988. He hit most of the politically sensitive targets by providing emergency help for the NHS, freezing fuel duties, addressing the universal credit debacle and abolishing stamp duty for first-time home buyers. With the exception of the stamp duty change, which will only push up house prices and place them further out of the reach of young people, there were reasons to welcome most of what Hammond announced. Business liked the help he announced on business rates and, given that the budget was all about preparing Britain for technological change, the increased generosity of the research and development tax credit made sense. But the money has been spread thin as a closer investigation of the Treasury’s red book – which costs the various budget measures – makes clear. The NHS has not received as much as it needs to meet ever-increasing demand; nor was the extra investment in housing nearly as generous as it sounded. The £300m for universal credit next year is tiny when set in the context of a £2tn economy. Hammond thinks his supply side measures will help to revive productivity growth. There are some analysts who think the OBR is being too negative and that there are already signs that productivity is picking up. The alternative view is that Britain has had one recession a decade since the 1970s and sooner or later will have another serious downturn. It is about to go through the Brexit process with the economy in poor shape. From that perspective, this budget needed to put Britain on a war footing in order to win what will inevitably be a long battle to raise productivity. And it didn’t. •Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2017/nov/22/the-truth-about-who-really-picks-up-the-tab-for-care-home-provision","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-22T18:43:14Z","webTitle":"The truth about who really picks up the tab for care home provision | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/nov/22/the-truth-about-who-really-picks-up-the-tab-for-care-home-provision","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2017/nov/22/the-truth-about-who-really-picks-up-the-tab-for-care-home-provision","fields":{"headline":"The truth about who really picks up the tab for care home provision","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Your article (Soaring care home costs mean you now pay £34,000 a year, 18 November) fails to give an accurate account of the financial obligations of self-funders. This happens all too often across the media. Local authorities do not “pick up the tab” when a person’s assets fall to £23,250. In fact, LAs continue to take £1 per £250 on a sliding scale until a person’s assets reach £14,250. At this point a care home resident is allowed to hold on to the remaining sum. However, their contributions do not end there as a council will claw back any pensions, state or private, while also expecting families to pay top-up fees. My mother has severe dementia and has been in a nursing home for over four years and has paid over £250,000, having been compelled to sell her two-bedroom flat and use her savings. One of the major problems is the privatisation of care homes as there is no limit to what they can charge a self-funder when demand is so high. This inevitably means that a person’s resources diminish quickly and then the LA has to step in. A few years ago I became aware of newspaper advertisements around the world encouraginge people to invest in UK care homes as they’d be assured of a 8% return on their stake. Yes, there is a compelling need for a concrete plan on the future of social care, but it must re-examine the whole structure on which provision is founded. Our elderly must not be treated as mere commodities but with the dignity and fairness they deserve.

The 46-year-old man is alleged to have broken into the house in Coatbridge on Monday night, but to have then been too tired to actually leave. He was eventually discovered by the homeowners, who alerted the police. Monklands police tweeted: A Police Scotland spokeswoman said: “At around 11.50pm on Monday, police were called to a house on Corsewall Street in Coatbridge after a householder discovered a man in his house. “A 46-year-old will be subject of a report to the procurator fiscal.” It is not the first time a burglar has fallen asleep on the job. A few years ago, Texan Kevin Connelly found a burglar asleep in his guest room in Houston and called the police. In Florida, the Sarasota county sheriff’s office was called after a cleaning lady found a man sleeping on a bed next to a bagful of jewellery he had intended to steal. “The man was still sleeping when deputies arrived. They were able to snap his photo with the loot without him even noticing,” the sheriff said at the time. And in Purcell, Oklahoma, Steven Walker, who lived alone, said he was surprised to return from a doctor’s appointment and discover a stranger in his home. “I guess he was looking for something valuable. I just don’t have anything. Once he pilfered through everything, I think he gave up and took a nap,” Walker said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2017/nov/22/james-toney-donald-trump-head-saved-world-trouble-boxing","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-22T16:03:02Z","webTitle":"James Toney: I should’ve knocked Donald Trump’s head off and saved the world lots of trouble","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/nov/22/james-toney-donald-trump-head-saved-world-trouble-boxing","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/nov/22/james-toney-donald-trump-head-saved-world-trouble-boxing","fields":{"headline":"James Toney: ‘I should’ve knocked Donald Trump’s head off and saved the world lots of trouble’","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"“Why?” James Toney says fiercely as, just a foot away, the once brilliant and intimidating boxer leans forward and stares at me. “You wanted me to stop fighting? Why? Why?” I look at my favourite boxer, who used to be rated as the best pound-for-pound fighter in the world, and prepare to tell him the obvious reason. But, pausing first, I remember the compelling stir Toney created in the early 1990s. Before then, when he was still carrying a gun and selling crack on the outskirts of Detroit, Toney’s life seemed distorted by his violent past. His father had repeatedly beaten his mother, Sherry, at gunpoint. When James was only one, his dad shot Sherry and left them for dead. But Sherry is an incredible woman and, even though James was troubled, she channelled his incoherent rage. She brought him to a boxing gym so that, if he wanted to fight everyone, at least he could learn how to do it properly. I fell for the Toney story in May 1991, on a steamy night in Iowa, when he became the world middleweight champion on the banks of the Mississippi. He came from behind to knock out the undefeated and exalted Michael Nunn, the hometown favourite. Having lived up to his nickname of “Lights Out”, Toney screamed: “I told ya so!” to the stunned crowd of 10,000. At 22 he had become the youngest world middleweight champion in 50 years. I was fascinated by his female entourage. His mother, the indestructible Sherry, wore a big black hat and flashing red fingernails. Sarah, his beautiful girlfriend and future first wife, did not look much like the psychology student she was in that heaving ring. Jackie Kallen, his manager, was a middle-aged suburban white woman whose Jewish faith was honoured by the yellow Star of David on Toney’s black trunks. “Oh my God,” Kallen cried as she held a glowering Toney, “you did it.” Intrigued by these contrasts, I tracked down Toney and his team. We forged a surreal friendship and, while following him for five years, Toney allowed me a privileged insight into his world – whether it was at home or being with him in the last anxious hours before world title fights, in hushed dressing rooms and even walking together to the ring. Toney was the dark star of a book I wrote about boxing. Dark Trade included other fighters such as Mike Tyson, Oscar De La Hoya, Chris Eubank and Michael Watson – but Toney meant the most to me. Twenty-three years ago this month we were in Las Vegas. Toney was still ranked the world’s best boxer as he faced the similarly unbeaten Roy Jones Jr in a fight worth a $30m HBO contract for Toney if he won. In November 1994, lacking the discipline to stay in shape, Toney drained himself trying to make weight. He lost a unanimous points decision and was crushed. It took him three hours to leave his dressing room but when he came to the after-party I admired him more than ever. I watched him being kissed by the old Jewish ladies, related to Kallen, and embraced by his homeboys. “Thank you for being here, man,” he said simply to me. A few days later media outlets across America reported that Toney had threatened to shoot Kallen for having allegedly made him fight when he had flu and weight problems. His mother calmed him down and, slowly, he recovered. It took him a long time but he was named fighter of the year in 2003, when he outclassed the previously unbeaten Vassiliy Jirov to become world cruiserweight champion and moved up to heavyweight, where he totally dominated and stopped the once formidable Evander Holyfield. Fourteen years later Toney is in Bristol and asking: “Why, why?” when I say I wished he had stopped fighting on the glorious night he beat Holyfield. My answer as to why I wish the 49-year-old was not even involved in an exhibition bout on Saturday night is clear. “I care about you,” I tell my old friend. “I know,” Toney says. “I had 93 pro fights but tell me: Do I look like a punch‑drunk motherfucker?” Toney’s face is bloated compared with the young middleweight I knew. But apart from some scarring he is relatively unblemished. He was also the best defensive fighter of the late 20th century and slipped punches better than any of his contemporaries. That was part of Toney’s appeal. Despite his profane and swaggering threats, he was a slick traditionalist who epitomised the art of hitting while not being hit. But, as his artistry faded and he became a fat heavyweight who barely trained, Toney absorbed damaging punches. He is still amusing today – whether hollering my name as if he is Michael Buffer or telling me he could whip anyone if he put his mind to it – but there is no escaping Toney’s increasingly slurred speech. “I feel fabulous,” he insists. “People go on about my speech but I’ve always had a speech impediment.” It’s true Toney always spoke with a slur but he is much harder to understand today. “How long you know me?” he asks. “Since 1991? Damn, we’re old now. But I’m the same motherfucker you knew when I was 24. I still think quick. I’m fast. I’m funny.” I laugh and Toney whoops. “I’m funny as fuck. So why should I have stopped fighting?” Boxing can cause brain damage and even death. No fighter is immune to the misery boxing can bring down if he remains in the ring too long. “But I’ve been fighting since I came out of the womb,” Toney says. “I’m the most natural fighter you’re ever seen. Floyd Mayweather’s a good fighter but he’s not as natural as me. Who is more natural than me? Please don’t say Anthony Joshua. I’m not a bullshit fighter and boxing ain’t like the 80s and 90s. I call it BSB. Bullshit boxing. Four fights and you get a title fight. I beat Nunn to win my title [in his 27th fight] on May 10 and my first defence was against [the accomplished] Reggie Johnson in June. Who does that now? Defend their title a month after winning it? I then went to Monaco and beat Francesco Dell’Aquila. My last fight that year was against Mike McCallum. Four world title fights in seven months.” McCallum, The Body Snatcher, was a great fighter – and Toney describes him as the best he ever faced. “He taught me so much but I beat him in the fight of the year. Mike McCallum was complete. Before that we sparred at the Kronk [the renowned Detroit gym] and everyone knew you had a war or you died in the Kronk.” Those gym wars took their toll but it’s hard to believe Toney will fight a local novice called Sam Pomphrey in Bristol. Pomphrey has had only two pro bouts, winning both in 2015, and he is a personal trainer rather than a fighter. Toney should avoid trouble but it upsets me that he is stepping inside a ring again – apart from the sadness of seeing him in a “white collar” bout. I thought his last-ever fight had been in May when he beat Mike Sheppard, an old journeyman, in a promotion called The Final One? “It was my final fight. This one is an exhibition. Sheppard was a fight and I stopped him, boom, and went home. I’m in Bristol for some fun. It’s not a real fight. If it was a fight the price has to go up.” Toney is still volatile and his mood suddenly changes. We’re sitting in an office with his manager, the gentle John “Pops” Arthur, and the Bristol promoter Matt Crouch. Toney points at Crouch. “Matt’s calling it a fight. If it’s a fight the pay’s got to go up.” Pops shakes his head. “It’s not a fight. There are no licences, no medical examinations – so it’s an exhibition. You can have fun.” Toney is unconvinced. “I came for an exhibition but they’re saying fight. If this is not a five-round exhibition where’s the money?” “We signed for 10 rounds,” Pops explains. “We’re men of our word. We’ll stick to it. James is getting mad because it’s being promoted as a fight but Matt is just trying to sell tickets. James, if you want to be mad at anyone, be mad at your Pops. I negotiated this deal.” “I don’t want to be played like a punk bitch,” Toney snaps. I know Toney well enough to find a way to take the heat out of the office. “Everybody will love you on Saturday, James,” I suggest. Toney relaxes. “Man!” he sighs, “I love England! I hate the fighters but I love the people. Where else can you get 80,000 people watching a fight like with Joshua and Klitschko? People here are so genuine.” Toney has already told me he could probably beat Joshua if he put his mind to it but Pops would not allow him to take a proper fight again. So I ask who will win when Joshua and Deontay Wilder meet in an explosive world heavyweight title unification bout next year. “Joshua. He’s much better than Wilder – who is wild. They’re good fighters but Joshua wins. I like Joshua. I like Danny Jacobs. That’s my guy, a good dude. Keith Thurman. He’s the truth. Triple G [Gennady Golovkin] is a good fighter.” Toney is less enthused by Donald Trump. “He’s a fucking asshole. Remember when he was a promoter and he had me and Roy [Jones] on the same bill in Atlantic City. I should’ve punched him in the face but my mom and Jackie stopped me. Trump pointed to me and was saying: ‘Call Whatsisname over here.’ I’m thinking: ‘Whatsisname? I’m your headline attraction and you can’t say my name?’ I said to Trump: “I’m going to bust your head open, motherfucker.’ My mom and Jackie pulled me away but I should’ve knocked his head off and saved the world lots of trouble. He’s the president but he’s a racist. Look at Colin Kaepernick.” Kaepernick, the former quarter-back for the San Francisco 49ers, has led a restrained protest against racism by taking a bended knee rather than standing for the national anthem. He is now locked out of American Football. “That’s why Colin Kaepernick hasn’t got a job. Pure racism from Trump down.” Pops shakes his head. “I was with the Bureau [FBI] for 24 years and I never seen it this bad. Trump has a way of promoting racism and lots of people can’t see it.” More cheerfully, Pops and Lights Out tell me about their plans for a reality television show, starring Toney as a bounty hunter. “Everybody’s a villain and I catch them,” Toney beams. “I go after real criminals. Our stuff is not edited. I get to bust open heads for real.” Pops confirms Toney is now working as a part-time bounty hunter. “He knew this bounty hunter guy called Lucky. James did some dry runs and we took it from there. A cable company’s now talking about a 13-show season.” I’ll be happier if Toney is a bounty hunter rather than a fighter. Those amazing days have gone and it’s a relief to hear him say: “I’m happy. I’ve got five kids and life is sweet.” We call his mother in Michigan and leave a message because, as Toney tells me: “My mom will kill me if she don’t speak to you.” We go out into the gym, walk straight past the ring and Toney is chortling and hugging me. “We had fun again, man.” I kid around and tell him he is still the king. “Say it again, man,” Toney hollers as his new girlfriend laughs. “You’re still the king,” I say to the great old fighter. “Twenty-six years,” Toney says with an incredulous smile, “and you still know it.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"film/2017/nov/26/beach-rats-review","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-26T08:00:04Z","webTitle":"Beach Rats review – wounded beauty of a lost boy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/nov/26/beach-rats-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2017/nov/26/beach-rats-review","fields":{"headline":"Beach Rats review – wounded beauty of a lost boy","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Frankie (Harris Dickinson) is adrift. “I don’t know what I like,” he mumbles. But perhaps it’s more the fact that he doesn’t want to – or can’t – admit to himself that, while he toys with the idea of a girlfriend and tools around with his delinquent buddies, he is drawn, time and again, to gay hook-up websites in search of older men. The Brooklyn summer of Eliza Hittman’s superb second feature is an endless fairground ride of cheap highs and long, dragging, wasted moments. Escape comes in pill form, filched by Frankie from the stock of prescription medication intended to take the sharp edges off his dying father’s pain. Frankie and his boys bask like lizards, shirtless and heavy-lidded as they eye the girls on the beach. Hittman shares something of Claire Denis’s gift for finding vulnerability in a chiselled male body and a kind of bruised poetry in the tough-guy swagger of these teenage kids. But it’s to Dickinson that the watchful camera always returns. British by birth, but utterly persuasive in the skin of this Brooklyn-born lost boy, he is undoubtedly one of the discoveries of the year. There’s a wounded beauty to his performance; he captures the kind of tortured inarticulacy that speaks volumes. Frankie’s fumbled attempt to reconcile his two worlds unfolds with a casual savagery at Beach Rats’ climax. Understated throughout, the film boldly concludes while Frankie is still processing the fact that his life just changed for ever."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"culture/2017/nov/22/uk-police-investigate-second-kevin-spacey-sexual-assault-claim","type":"article","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-22T17:02:55Z","webTitle":"UK police investigate second Kevin Spacey sexual assault claim","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2017/nov/22/uk-police-investigate-second-kevin-spacey-sexual-assault-claim","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/2017/nov/22/uk-police-investigate-second-kevin-spacey-sexual-assault-claim","fields":{"headline":"UK police investigate second Kevin Spacey sexual assault claim","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"British police are investigating Kevin Spacey over a second sexual assault allegation, the Guardian understands. The Metropolitan police said on Wednesday they were looking into the fresh claims against the Hollywood actor, having opened an investigation into similar allegations against him earlier this month. According to the latest allegations, Spacey sexually assaulted a man, identified only as Victim 2, in 2005. The claims were referred to the Met by City of London police last Friday, Scotland Yard said. The earlier claims related to an alleged sexual assault perpetrated against a man identified as Victim 1 in 2008 and were referred by the same force. Each was allegedly committed in the Lambeth area of south London and, in each case, police refused to name the suspect. However, officers did confirm that each was made against the same man and he is understood to be Spacey. “Officers from the child abuse and sexual offences command are investigating,” the Met said on Wednesday. Spacey has faced a series of accusations of sexual misconduct in the US and the UK. Last week, the Old Vic theatre, where he was artistic director from 2003 to 2015, said it had been contacted by 56 people with 20 individual allegations of inappropriate conduct, including some allegedly perpetrated against former staff. It said 14 were so serious it had advised the complainants to contact the police, and apologised for failing to ensure there was an environment in which people felt they could come forward. “The Old Vic apologises wholeheartedly to the people who told us that they have been affected. We’ve learned that it is not enough to have the right process in place. Everyone needs to feel able to speak out no matter who they are,” the theatre’s executive director, Kate Varah, said. “That apology really goes to the people who feel they were affected by this but what is also important to understand is there is a new way forward for this organisation.” The concerns about Spacey’s behaviour came to wider public attention after the revelations about Harvey Weinstein. The actor Anthony Rapp told BuzzFeed that when he was aged 14, Spacey, then 26, had tried to “seduce” him. Spacey said: “I honestly do not remember the encounter, it would have been over 30 years ago. But if I did behave then as he describes, I owe him the sincerest apology.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"music/2017/nov/23/bjork-utopia-review-tinder-album-singer-dating-app","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-23T12:00:01Z","webTitle":"Björk: Utopia review – romance, angst and troublingly thin tunes","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/nov/23/bjork-utopia-review-tinder-album-singer-dating-app","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2017/nov/23/bjork-utopia-review-tinder-album-singer-dating-app","fields":{"headline":"Björk: Utopia review – romance, angst and troublingly thin tunes","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"At this stage in her career, no one expects Björk’s latest record to sound much like her last one. And yet it’s hard to avoid heaving a thankful sigh when Arisen My Senses, the opening track of her ninth studio album, Utopia, crashes into life: birdsong giving way to bright splashes of electronics, beatific-sounding harp chords and cascading beats not unlike the oft-sampled rhythm track of Schoolly D’s old rap classic PSK, What Does It Mean? It sounds positively ecstatic, which comes as a relief. Utopia’s predecessor, 2015’s Vulnicura, was a remarkable record, a latterday entry into the canon of legendary break-up albums. It attained its place alongside Marvin Gaye’s Here, My Dear and Dylan’s Blood on the Tracks by setting its fathomless misery to atonal string arrangements and abstract electronics that, during its central track, kept vanishing into a single flatlining beep. It was raw, brave, challenging, unique and all the other adjectives heaped on it in reviews, but with the best will in the world, any album so harrowing that the appearance of gloom-laden vocalist Anohni constitutes a moment of light relief is going to be one that defies you to listen to it repeatedly. Utopia reanimates Vulnicura’s collaboration with Venezuela-born electronic auteur Arca, but is made of lighter material. Aside from his endlessly shifting soundscapes, distorted beats and penchant for sonic tapestries made from manipulated vocal samples, the album’s primary sound is woodwind, provided by an assembly of 12 female flautists from Reykjavik, which automatically lends it a far airier quality than the claustrophobic Vulnicura. It is, Björk says, her “Tinder album”, and its advance billing as a kind of Songs for Swinging Bachelorettes is borne out by its lyrics, which are obsessed both with technology and the vicissitudes of budding romance. “Is this excess texting blessing?” ponders Blissing Me, the saga of “two music nerds … sending each other MP3s”, before reverting to grief: “our physical union a fantasy, I just fell in love with a song”. Courtship, meanwhile, does indeed seem to deal with the emotional after-effects of blithely swiping left on a dating app: “he downturned me, I then downturned another, who then downturned her – the paralysing juice of rejection”. All this is set to music that constantly shifts like landscape from a train window. If it’s less hard work emotionally than Vulnicura, Utopia is still filled with tracks that float free from any kind of formal verse-chorus structure, and that occasionally sound as if they’re being improvised. But clearly an enormous amount of thought and care has been expended on the sound of the album, and on the timbre of Björk’s voice – there’s much deliberate rolling of rs for dramatic effect and playing on the quirks of her accent. And it frequently yields breathtaking results: the way the harp and flutes give way to a punishing industrial rhythm on Losss, on which the post-divorce gloom of Vulnicura suddenly erupts again; the 10-minute sprawl of Body Memory, a song that keeps swinging from fear to a desire to live in the moment, overflowing with choral vocals, glitching beats and buoyant, breathy woodwind. Equally, there are times when you wonder whether as much attention has been lavished on the tracks’ central melodies, which sometimes seem troublingly slender. Blissing Me hangs on the same eight-note refrain for virtually the entire song; the drone of Features Creatures feels flat rather than hypnotic; Tabula Rasa has a gorgeous, shimmering arrangement, a beautiful lyric about parenthood (“I hope to give you the least amount of baggage, you got the right to make your own fresh mistakes”) but no real tune to hang them on. At those moments, wading through Utopia’s 71 minutes can be a strangely frustrating, alienating experience, like watching a very long film where the camera is continually focused on the scenery rather than the action. It all ends with a defiant statement of intent. “Imagine a future and be in it … your past is a loop, turn it off,” she sings on Future Forever. It’s presumably a reference to escaping the fallout of the events detailed on Vulnicura, but it might as well be Björk’s musical mission statement. In a sense, Utopia fulfils it: it doesn’t sound like anything else, it’s audibly the work of an artist mapping out their own fresh musical territory. But occasionally, it also feels like the work of an artist with their eyes so firmly fixed forward they’ve blocked out their audience: an emotional journey you watch, intrigued, from a distance, rather than feel or participate in."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"football/blog/2017/nov/22/jeff-stelling-expected-goals-stats-xg-soccer-am","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-22T15:56:29Z","webTitle":"Never mind Jeff Stelling’s derision, expected goals – xG – is here to stay | Paul MacInnes","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2017/nov/22/jeff-stelling-expected-goals-stats-xg-soccer-am","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/blog/2017/nov/22/jeff-stelling-expected-goals-stats-xg-soccer-am","fields":{"headline":"Never mind Jeff Stelling’s derision, expected goals – xG – is here to stay","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Jeff Stelling is known for being a cheery sort. The most exasperated he ever gets is when Hartlepool are drubbed and, even then, he usually bears it with the fatalism of the long-suffering supporter. This week, however, the Sky Sports presenter has starred in a much-shared clip in which he goes on an actual rant. And the subject? Expected goals. In the run-up to their coverage of the north London derby, Stelling observed to his Soccer Saturday pundits that Arsène Wenger had done a daft thing. “He quoted expected goals!” Stelling said to an audible “No!” from one of his guests (perhaps Phil Thompson). “He’s the first person I’ve ever heard take any notice of expected goals, which must be the most useless stat in the history of football! What does it tell you? The game’s finished 3-1, why do you show expected goals afterwards?” Stelling’s remarks prompted much laughter in the studio and, after Soccer AM took a grab of the video, it got a lot of chuckles online, too. The sole exception perhaps being among the football analytics community, who were of the mind that expected goals is not actually the most useless stat in the history of football. That’s possession. The basic concept of expected goals is simple. It answers the question: should a player have scored that chance? Or, when you add all the chances together, should a team have won that match? Defining each chance according to lots of different factors and then comparing that chance with similar moments in past matches, the outcome is a percentage: that chance, one time out of 10, would be a goal. The question of whether this stat is useful to you depends on what you want from a game. A lot of people, increasingly known as “real football people”, don’t need a stat to tell them what they can see with their own eyes. Others, the analytics crowd or “football nerds”, think it provides context. Especially if you didn’t actually watch the game. Dig down into what makes up an expected goals statistic (commonly known as “xG”) and things can get more complicated. There are lots of different takes on xG, compiled by everyone from the stats gurus Opta to individual fans. While they all might include the same basic information – location of the chance, where the ball had previously arrived from – each will have their own idiosyncrasies. Some might weigh the fact the chance fell to a striker’s foot rather than their head as being more likely to be a goal, but what happens when that head is Andy Carroll’s? There are lots of unknowns in any model and, when you put them all together, that might make the ultimate figure less reliable rather than more. There is a bit of Old Man Yells at Cloud about Stelling’s outburst and that’s probably on purpose. Soccer Saturday is a bunch of old pros watching television, the ultimate “real football men” and perhaps the diametric opposite of nerds plotting outcomes on graphs. Its audience, meanwhile, are those people who turn on the telly to get their football information on a Saturday afternoon. They are unlikely to be keen followers of the latest trends in statistical analysis. On the other hand they might be more likely to see football as a simple game that doesn’t need to become any more complicated. Stelling is just giving his audience what they want. There will likely be more gotchas of this kind in the months and seasons ahead (and whatever you think of xG, the subtext that Wenger only mentioned it because he lost to Manchester City is surely spot-on). But the broader point is that xG got a mention on Soccer Saturday. It also features regularly, if briefly, on Match of the Day. Expected goals is a stat that’s here to stay and in just a few years time will be part of the furniture. The question is whether it is the end of the quantification of football or just the beginning."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"uk-news/2017/nov/22/jeremy-corbyn-budget-shows-tories-are-unfit-for-office","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-22T19:32:15Z","webTitle":"Tory MPs rally around Hammond's budget after Corbyn attacks","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/nov/22/jeremy-corbyn-budget-shows-tories-are-unfit-for-office","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2017/nov/22/jeremy-corbyn-budget-shows-tories-are-unfit-for-office","fields":{"headline":"Tory MPs rally around Hammond's budget after Corbyn attacks","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Conservative MPs have countered Jeremy Corbyn’s swingeing criticism of the budget as the work of “a government no longer fit for office” with a broad endorsement of Philip Hammond, in sharp contrast to their open reservations about the chancellor’s plans last year. Hammond’s colleagues used the first of four days of scheduled debate about the budget to praise not just his high-profile announcements on housing, but also his commitment of £3bn to prepare for any Brexit eventuality. In his response to the budget, Corbyn – it is the leader of the opposition who traditionally speaks rather than the shadow chancellor – said Hammond had completely failed to tackle a national crisis of stagnation and falling wages. “The test of a budget is how it affects the reality of people’s lives all around this country,” the Labour leader said. “And I believe as the days go ahead, and this budget unravels, the reality will be – a lot of people will be no better off. And the misery that many are in will be continuing.” Largely eschewing direct focus on Hammond’s specific announcements in favour of a broader critique of the government’s wider economic approach, Corbyn castigated Hammond for again missing deficit reduction targets, and for a continued spending squeeze on schools and the police. Speaking about housing, Corbyn said rough sleeping had doubled since 2010, and that this Christmas 120,000 children would be living in temporary accommodation. “We need a large-scale publicly funded housebuilding programme, not this government’s accounting tricks and empty promises.”Summing up, he said: “We were promised a revolutionary budget. The reality is nothing has changed. People were looking for help from this budget. They have been let down. Let down by a government that, like the economy they’ve presided over, is weak and unstable and in need of urgent change. They call this budget ‘Fit for the Future’. The reality is this is a government no longer fit for office.” The response from the bulk of Conservatives who spoke on the first day of debate was generally positive. Hammond’s first budget as chancellor last year had been marked by a humiliating U-turn on his most high-profile plan, to increase national insurance contributions for the self-employed, within a week. But this year members praised the £3bn funding for Brexit planning. Cheryl Gillan, who supported leave, said the money was “very important”. She told the Commons: “We do have to create an environment where we don’t have uncertainty about the economic impact and I hope that money will go towards providing more certainty in that area.” The first MP to speak after Hammond and Corbyn was Nicky Morgan, the Conservative former education secretary, who chairs the Commons Treasury committee, a role she took after the election. Morgan, one of the more vocal Brexit sceptics on the Tory back benches, welcomed Hammond’s plans, but noted that the financial models were based around a “relatively benign” departure from the EU. She said: “That cannot be guaranteed, and even though a transitional arrangement that would allow for such a smooth adjustment is manifestly in the interests of both the UK and the EU, it might, of course, not happen.” On future funding for the NHS and other services there “is not pot of gold under the Brexit rainbow”, Morgan warned. The Treasury committee would look in the coming weeks into the budgetary consequences of failing to reach a Brexit deal on transition, Morgan said, and would also examine the likely impact of Hammond’s raising of the stamp duty threshold for first-time homebuyers. John Redwood, the veteran Eurosceptic Tory MP, in contrast hailed the economic forecasts in the budget as more “realistically optimistic” about the benefits of Brexit, even though he argued they could have been more bullish still. But Jo Swinson, the Liberal Democrats’ deputy leader, said Hammond’s budget had to be seen amid reduced growth forecasts which predict the economy in 2021 as being £45bn smaller than had been projected in March. “And so I’m afraid his attempt to paint a cheerful vision of the future were rather less successful than his jokes,” Swinson said. “The truth is, as the chancellor knows, this budget and the next budget and the budget after that, and all the future budgets are made all the more difficult because of Brexit, and because of the extreme approach to Brexit this government is taking.” Labour’s Angela Eagle, formerly the shadow business secretary, noted that the £3bn extra set aside for Brexit was greater than the near-£2bn more promised for the NHS. Hammond had made no mention of financing for social care, or about the cost pressures on councils, Eagle said: “It’s 15 years of austerity – cut after cut, pressure on public services, year in, year out, with no end in sight.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/nov/22/search-for-missing-argentinian-submarine-enters-critical-phase","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-23T09:04:10Z","webTitle":"Argentinian submarine hunt to return to previously searched area","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/nov/22/search-for-missing-argentinian-submarine-enters-critical-phase","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/nov/22/search-for-missing-argentinian-submarine-enters-critical-phase","fields":{"headline":"Argentinian submarine hunt to return to previously searched area","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Ships and planes hunting for an Argentinian submarine that went missing in the south Atlantic a week ago are to return to a previously searched area as relatives of those onboard voiced their frustrations with rescue efforts. An Argentinian navy spokesman, Captain Enrique Balbi, said search teams would return to the area about 30 miles north of the ARA San Juan’s last registered position after a “hydro-acoustic anomaly” was determined by the US and specialist agencies to have been produced just hours after the final contact with the submarine on 15 November. “It’s a noise. We don’t want to speculate” about what caused it, Balbi said. With the seven-day limit on the ARA San Juan’s oxygen reserves having been reached on Wednesday morning, what hopes that remain are pinned on the submarine having been able to replenish its oxygen supply by surfacing at some point during the past week. Helena Alfaro was just one of many family members who congregated at the Mar del Plata naval base where the submarine was originally scheduled to arrive on Monday. “I feel like I’m waiting for a corpse,” said Alfaro, the sister of Cristian Ibañez, a radar officer on the missing submarine. “So much protocol, so much protocol,” she complained to TN news network, referring to the Argentinian navy’s long delay in advising the president, Mauricio Macri, that it had lost contact with the submarine. Justifying the delay, navy chiefs said that military protocol advises a 48-hour waiting period before beginning search efforts for submarines lost at sea. “I feel like I’m at a wake, that’s how I feel,” said a tearful Alfaro. “I also feel time passing and time is crucial. I’m deeply pained by the decisions taken. Why so much protocol? Is protocol going to bring them back?” Macri is reportedly angry with his navy commanders because of their handling of the crisis. According to the Infobae website, Macri’s defence minister, Oscar Aguad, only learned the submarine was missing when he read about it in the press, after the navy announced last Saturday that it had lost contact with the San Juan on 15 November. Also being called into question is the wisdom of having deployed a 34-year-old submarine to make the 10-day journey from the Argentinian port of Ushuaia, the southernmost city in the world, to the naval base in Mar del Plata. The state of disrepair of Argentina’s naval fleet has long been an issue in the country. In one notorious incident, the navy’s British-built destroyer Santisima Trinidad, which participated on the Argentinian side in the 1982 war with Britain over the Falkland Islands, sank while moored at the Puerto Belgrano naval base in 2013. It took the navy two years to refloat the vessel. In a video that went viral online, Macri can be seen being berated by a relative of a San Juan crew member during his visit to the Mar del Plata base on Monday morning because of the age of the submarine. “It’s practically suicide to send them out in something so old,” a female relative is heard telling the president in the video. “Couldn’t you invest the state budget in trying to buy a new submarine? You’re playing with the lives of our people. Does someone have to die for things to change?” The UK Ministry of Defence said on Wednesday that an RAF aircraft had landed in Argentina to help with the search efforts. The MoD said the British military plane, which took off from Brize Norton in Oxfordshire, is packed with three tonnes of equipment, including 12 deep emergency life-support pods. HMS Protector, a Royal Navy ice patrol ship that arrived on Sunday, was deployed to the vessel’s last known location, and used its sonar equipment to search below the waves for the missing sub. An RAF C-130 has also joined the search following an offer of assistance, and members of the specialist Submarine Parachute Assistance Group are also offering expert advice. HMS Clyde, an offshore patrol vessel that was returning from a patrol to South Georgia, has also assisted with the search efforts."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/nov/27/anna-jones-recipes-ramen-noodle-soup-greens-tofu-miso","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-27T12:00:00Z","webTitle":"Ramen noodles with fresh greens and chilli miso","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/nov/27/anna-jones-recipes-ramen-noodle-soup-greens-tofu-miso","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/nov/27/anna-jones-recipes-ramen-noodle-soup-greens-tofu-miso","fields":{"headline":"Ramen noodles with fresh greens and chilli miso","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"There are few foods that lure me in more than a bowl of ramen. I like to hedge my bets when I’m making my dinner choices, so I’m a fan of any dish where a little of everything – a note from every family of flavour – is in attendance. And nowhere is this more the case than with this Japanese noodle dish. There is something quite solitary about a bowl of ramen. Maybe it’s the inevitable slurping that comes with noodles and soup, which is why I often find myself eating it on my own, a calm meditative pleasure in the middle of a hectic day or when I’m in need of some bolstering warmth. Most people will know ramen as noodles served in a deeply flavoured meat broth, and while meat is not my thing, I get the appeal of that savoury, umami bowlful. Rich in oil, the broth hugs the noodles, making the whole dish deeply satisfying. Here I use almond milk to add a similar deep silkiness. This might sound a little strange if you are used to a clearer soup, but it works. If you are still sceptical, then replace the milk with more water or even stock. I’ve included a quick recipe for a chilli miso paste, or to use the proper term, miso tare. It’s a well-flavoured paste that keeps in the fridge for a couple of weeks and is a handy source of an almost instant flavourful dinner. Use it as a base for a swift coconut milk curry, stir it into a quick vegetable soup for some added kick, toss it through cooked noodles or brown rice, or just spoon it on the side of a bowl of leftovers. While this is a dish I crave when the days are short, it’s easy to adapt to the seasons. Any quick-cooking green vegetable or leaves or even thinly sliced or shaved root will sit well in a bowl of ramen. Late-autumn ramen Making ramen at home means you can tailor it to your tastes. For me, that means toothsome noodles, fresh greens still with some colour and bite, the pleasing soft texture of tofu – occasionally a little pickle, and a knockout liquor punchy with miso, ginger, chilli and garlic. Serves 4 10 radishes, thinly sliced 2 tbsp rice wine vinegar A squeeze of honey or maple syrup 350g dried ramen noodles – I use egg ramen or brown rice noodles 100g kale (I use a mix of purple and green), pulled from its stalks and roughly torn 1 tbsp tamari or soy sauce 200g firm tofu 1 litre unsweetened almond milk 3 tbsp chilli miso (see recipe below) A pinch of turmeric 1 Put the sliced radishes in a bowl with the rice wine vinegar and a squeeze of honey or maple syrup. Toss and put to one side. 2 Cook the noodles in boiling water. While they are cooking, scrunch the kale with the tamari or soy and divide between four bowls. Cut the tofu into pieces and divide these between the bowls. 3 Gently heat the almond milk until just hot, but not simmering. Put the chilli miso and the turmeric into a small mixing bowl and add a little of the hot milk. Mix it well to thin it out then pour it into the pan of milk. 4 Drain the noodles and divide between the four bowls, then pour over the broth. Chilli and ginger miso flavour booster This will make much more miso tare than you will need for the above ramen recipe. You can store the remainder in the fridge for up to 3 weeks. It can be called upon later for quick soup and broth suppers, for adding to dressings and for roasting veg in. It can be frozen too – ice-cube trays are useful for making handy portions. Makes a small jarful 150g white miso, or chickpea miso 1 tsp crushed chilli flakes A bunch of spring onions, thinly sliced, including the green parts A small thumb-size piece of ginger, peeled and grated 2 garlic cloves, peeled and grated 2 tbsp mirin A pinch of salt 1 tbsp fermented gochujang paste (optional) 1 Combine all the ingredients in a small saucepan over a gentle heat.

So, sure, there have been tweaks to her CV for this Netflix remake, not least because there are now 10 episodes; box sets can make films seem as fleeting as adverts, events that only remind you of the story. But the premise – the bit that made it arresting and sexy, combustible, stinging and talked-about – remains unchanged: Darling is sleeping with three men, a stable and mature one (Jamie Overstreet), a narcissistic and shallow one (Greer Childs), and an eccentric and playful one (Mars Blackmon). She’s not doing it for cutesy, Shakespearean reasons; she’s not trying to make her mind up, or refereeing a battle between her head and heart. She’s doing it because she’s “sex positive, polyamorous, pansexual”. “I consider myself abnormal,” she says, in a direct-to-camera monologue that takes a bit of getting used to, “but who wants to be like anybody else?” But why this kind of abnormal, the world around her asks. Doesn’t she ever feel like “giving [her] coochie a rest?” (from her best friend). Is she a sex addict? (from Childs). Contexts change, contexts remain the same: “She is a woman who is juggling three men, and I think there are more women like that now,” Lee said in an interview with feminist scholar Salamishah Tillet, “but the way those women are judged hasn’t necessarily changed as far as men go.” It would be a kiss of death to call this an “issues-based dramedy”, but it is a drama, it is comic, and it does have issues. When female desire is acknowledged as a force in its own right, which it almost never is, why is that still so threatening? Why is it pathologised and what does that do to female autonomy? Alongside that, before “intersectionality” had been coined (though not long before), the original film had this driving curiosity: what happens if you take the gender who aren’t allowed erotic agency (women) , and the race who aren’t allowed sexual expression (people of colour) , and you unite those in one lascivious character? “How often,” Lee asked in 1986, “have you seen a black man and woman kiss on the screen?” The question is quietly devastating; the decades haven’t resolved it. Rather, other flashpoints have emerged, and this remake fillets in the gentrification of Brooklyn, the Black Lives Matter movement, economic and political iterations of racism that were, culturally if not literally, a lot more ignorable last century. When the film came out, the feminist critique was distilled by bell hooks, who asked whether Darling really did embody bold, self-confident female desire, or something else entirely: part way through, Jamie rapes her, an old-school 70s screen rape, where she starts off saying “no” and ends up enjoying it. Was it really rape, considering they’d had sex before, and she’d met him in order to have sex, and she only said no at the beginning? Debates were had in newspapers then that would now only come up in golf clubs. The New York Times concluded that “his violence seems natural and does not diminish interest in or sympathy with the character”. So you cannot say there has been no progress. Lee said 10 years ago, in an interview with NPR, that he regretted the scene; asked why he didn’t just go back and cut it out, he said: “You gonna go back to Gone With the Wind and cut out the Mammie stuff? It’s done.” In this series, Darling isn’t raped by any of her lovers, but rather, is grabbed in the street by a stranger – the fly-posted art she then does in response is vandalised. This feels painfully current and much more challenging than any ‘is-it-isn’t-it?’ conversation about a rape. These violations colour everything, the way Darling relates to men, to women, to intimates, to strangers, to her work, to her parents, in a way that’s vividly relatable. Yet I was also biting back the collective urge of the un-woke sisterhood, to minimise: come on, Nola, some guy just grabbed your wrist; some other guy just sprayed “cunt” all over your posters; the world didn’t end. That has been the most interesting question, post-Trump, post-Weinstein: not why men protect themselves. nor why men protect each other; not why women don’t speak out, nor even why women don’t defend one another; but that germ of hostility for the woman who thinks she shouldn’t be accosted, molested, harassed. What makes her so special? Past the harassment, in Darling’s behaviour and its counterpoints in her friends, these questions persist: how does she get to be so happy in her skin, how come she isn’t saving for an arse-implant, why isn’t she waiting by the phone for a guy, what makes her believe in her art, in herself? Spike Lee wrote the original Nola Darling himself, and for her descendant, collaborated with four female writers, Radha Blank, Eisa Davis, his sister Joie Lee and the playwright Lynn Nottage. It shows; she sounds more three-dimensional, more realised. She is winningly played by DeWanda Wise. The real work of Hercules is not to make her credible but to make her likable, when she doesn’t seek approval: sometimes it comes off, sometimes it doesn’t. It’s exhilarating when it doesn’t.

The Simon Langton grammar school for boys in Canterbury, which caused controversy last year when it invited its former pupil Milo Yiannopoulos, the rightwing controversialist, to speak, sparked fresh concerns this week with a new debating forum that it said was designed to be “an antidote to the poison of political correctness”. Some parents and pupils backed the school. But now it has distanced itself from the term “unsafe space” after other pupils and parents voiced their alarm on social media. The local Labour MP whose sons attended the school but have now left also voiced her reservations. The scheme’s name is a reference to the phrase “safe space” – a zone in which a person or category of people can feel confident they will not be exposed to discrimination, criticism, harassment or any other emotional or physical harm. The head of school, Ken Moffat, said the phrase unsafe space was “a bit of a misnomer”. “The name is the Tong Centre for Creative Research, it is not called ‘the unsafe space’ and that’s not a phrase I am wedded to and expect to see wither over time.” In a letter to parents, Moffat dismissed concerns raised in media reports. “Our aim is quite simple: to continue with what we are already doing in allowing our young men and women to debate interesting ideas at the highest level possible with speakers from both within and without the school community,” he wrote. “Just because we use the term ‘freedom of speech’ does not mean we will indulge homophobic, xenophobic, racist or sexist beliefs. Hate crime is illegal everywhere.” Earlier in the week some pupils tweeted their alarm after learning that the proposed “unsafe space” would examine “the most beautifully disturbed and disturbing ideas, all of them presented without trigger warnings”, and that wide-ranging studies would incorporate a number of unexpected texts such as Mein Kampf. Others spoke of the support for the idea. The school, which is mixed in the sixth form, has also scheduled lectures on the subjects “Women versus feminism” and “Not all cultures are created equal”. Rosie Duffield, the MP for Canterbury whose two sons attended Simon Langton, agreed students were capable of critical thinking on a variety of topics, including the political and occasionally the controversial. “Where, however, a body of students and/or parents have taken offence on an issue, school leadership and governors need to address whether a line has been crossed and decide on whether further action is appropriate,” she said. “We must not fear debate, but the way in which ideas are presented and framed needs to be very carefully considered indeed.” Duffield had been due to speak at the school on Friday but has postponed, citing diary pressures. One parent with two sons at the school posted in a Facebook group: “I went to this school. I now have two boys in yr 10 and 11. Boys there share the most racist, sexist, fascist comments as if they are saying ‘hi’. Feminism is a complete joke to them. “I think a lot of adults have forgotten just how immature 15- to 18-year-old boys are. They’re all nice lads and they’ll find their way to adult values in their own time. This will not help either way.” Another parent whose sons have now left the school said: “I have faith in the young people at the school, but as a boys’ school it may already be an ‘unsafe’ space for young women. Giving a platform to hate speech is not the best way forward.” Pupils claimed that the teacher in charge of the “unsafe space”, Prof James S, had joked about LGBT groups by presenting the term with a string of extraneous letters and numbers appended to it. A member of staff at the school said that the term “LGBTQQIP2SAA” had been adopted from an LGBT-friendly website. James S, the director of humanities at the school, told pupils the first “unsafe space” session would be devoted to a memo circulated by a Google employee, James Damore, who was later sacked, that claimed women were innately less capable as engineers. James S defended it as a “much-needed forum for debate”. There were suggestions after news of the “unsafe space” appeared in the media that there had been anger within the school at some descriptions of its intentions. A printout of a media report was anonymously pinned to a school noticeboard on Tuesday with the word “wrong” written next to each paragraph. On Wednesday the school’s head teacher, Dr Matthew Baxter, forwarded a document to the Guardian in which James S accused a student of posting “a compromising lie” on Twitter about the intentions behind the project. Moffat said the school had received a large number of letters of support from parents and only one expressing concern. “There is no rightwing agenda in the school, which seems to be what you are implying,” he said. “We are simply pushing a spirit of intellectual freedom and openness to ideas whilst maintaining the British value of tolerance and respect for each other.” Joanne Bartley, of the Kent Education Network, a community group that campaigns against grammar schools, said: “We hear many reports that alt-right views are popular among boys in grammar school sixth-forms. “There is absolutely nothing wrong with young people having varied political views, but the recent Canterbury youth parliament had grammar school pupils speaking on issues such as benefit fraud and immigration, yet we know extremely limited numbers of children from families on benefits or asylum-seeking families are educated in selective schools. “The social divide in grammar schools is a real problem. Grammar school pupils might be our future politicians, but how can they know about real life when they only mix with others of the same gender, class and aspirations?” An Ofsted spokesperson said: “Schools should be places of debate where young people can learn to challenge the opinions of others and in particular build the resilience to tackle extreme views. Of course this should be done in an age-appropriate manner and in a way that does not undermine fundamental British values.” • This article was amended on 14 February 2019 to remove some personal information."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/nov/22/iranian-and-turkish-leaders-arrive-in-russia-for-syria-talks-with-putin","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-22T17:47:06Z","webTitle":"Putin brings Iran and Turkey together in bold Syria peace plan","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/nov/22/iranian-and-turkish-leaders-arrive-in-russia-for-syria-talks-with-putin","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/nov/22/iranian-and-turkish-leaders-arrive-in-russia-for-syria-talks-with-putin","fields":{"headline":"Putin brings Iran and Turkey together in bold Syria peace plan","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"A peace settlement to end the six-year Syrian civil war will require compromise by all sides, including the Assad government, Vladimir Putin has said as the presidents of Iran and Turkey arrived in the Black Sea resort of Sochi amid some of the most audacious Russian diplomatic activity in decades. The summit between the three powers, all deeply involved in the conflict, is designed to pave the way for a settlement likely to leave Syria’s Russian- and Iranian-backed president, Bashar al-Assad, in power within a reformed Syrian constitution. It follows the near-collapse of the Syrian opposition since Moscow’s armed intervention in 2015 and the military defeat of Islamic State in all of the major towns and cities that were under its control. “The militants in Syria have sustained a decisive blow and now there is a realistic chance to end the multi-year civil war,” Putin declared as he hosted Iran’s Hassan Rouhani and Turkey’s Recep Tayyip Erdoğan in Sochi. “The Syrian people will have to determine their own future and agree on the principles of their own statehood. It is obvious that the process of reform will not be easy and will require compromises and concessions from all participants, including of course the government of Syria.” Putin hosted Assad in Sochi on Monday and extracted a more emollient tone than normal. He insisted on Wednesday that Assad was committed to a peace process, constitutional reform and free elections. The Russian leader also held a frantic round of telephone diplomacy with other world leaders including Saudi Arabia’s King Salman, Israel’s Benjamin Netanyahu and Donald Trump. Putin urged Iran and Turkey to start a discussion with him on the reconstruction of Syria. “Given the colossal scale of the destruction it would be possible to think together about the development of a comprehensive program for Syria,” he said. He claimed military de-escalation zones had reduced the levels of violence and hundreds of thousands of refugees were returning home. The three-way summit endorsed his plan for a Syrian national dialogue congress to be held in Russia in December. The meeting is intended to help frame a constitution for an integrated Syria, including the terms of presidential elections in which Assad would be entitled to stand. But in a sign of the difficulties ahead, Erdoğan is insisting Syrian Kurds are excluded from the congress on the grounds that the Kurds are linked with Turkish Kurdish groups that Turkey says are terrorists. Syrian Kurds have been instrumental in the defeat of Isis as part of the US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces. Erdoğan was once one of the main backers of the splintered Syrian opposition but is now primarily focused on what Turkey sees as the Kurdish threat on its border. Rouhani said the grounds for a political settlement had been laid but he argued it was “unacceptable” for foreign troops not invited into Syria by the government to remain in the country – a reference to US troops in the north-east of the country. Separately, Israel is demanding that the Iranian military presence inside Syria is reined back, especially near the occupied Golan Heights. The UN special envoy Staffan de Mistura will be briefed on Putin’s plans in Moscow on Thursday. Simultaneously, Syrian opposition leaders are meeting in Saudi Arabia to choose a new negotiating team and platform for UN-sponsored peace talks in Geneva that are due to restart on 28 November. The reconstitution and expansion of the negotiating team has already led to mass resignations by prominent Syrian opposition figures including the former chair of the High Negotiations Committee, Riyad Hijab. Those who have resigned complain that the international community, especially Russia, is trying to force them to accept that Assad can remain in office despite his brutal tactics in the civil war, including the UN-documented use of chemical weapons. They also claim Putin, despite his denials, is undermining the UN peace process in favour of a separate peace track with Russian-selected delegates to the national dialogue congress. De Mistura told the opposition delegates they could instil a new dynamic into the Geneva talks if they could agree “a cohesive, representative, strategically wise, effective team that reflects the diversity of the Syrian society and is ready to negotiate without preconditions, in the same way as the government will be expected to do.” The flurry of diplomatic activity underlines the degree to which the US and the EU have been sidelined from the process."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/nov/23/loneliness-disabled-people-britain-isolation","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-23T08:00:24Z","webTitle":"Loneliness: the second cruel stigma Britain inflicts on disabled people | Frances Ryan","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/nov/23/loneliness-disabled-people-britain-isolation","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/nov/23/loneliness-disabled-people-britain-isolation","fields":{"headline":"Loneliness: the second cruel stigma Britain inflicts on disabled people","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Increasingly, I feel lucky to leave the house. That’s a strange feeling for someone to have, particularly someone in their early 30s. As a millennial, I know I should be concerned with my nonexistent pension or ever diminishing chance of buying a home – and I am, really. But as a disabled person, I’m aware that nowadays even basic parts of a normal life can’t be taken for granted: going to the office, meeting friends in the pub, even regularly seeing another human being. New research from the disability charity Scope has found almost half of working-age disabled people are chronically lonely, saying they “always or often” feel lonely. Staggeringly, that works out at about 3 million lonely disabled people in Britain. The Office for National Statistics has described Britain as “the loneliness capital of Europe” – finding that we’re less likely to have strong friendships or know our neighbours than inhabitants of any other country in the EU. Young people are said to be particularly affected. But the Scope research points to what can only be called an epidemic of loneliness for disabled people in this country. It’s possible, of course, to be surrounded by people and still be lonely – but break down this week’s study, and this is about stark isolation. On a typical day, one in eight disabled people have less than a half-hour’s interaction with other people. We’re rightly increasingly aware of how old age can lead to severe isolation – a recent study by the Jo Cox Commission on Loneliness found that almost three-quarters of older people in the UK are lonely – and the psychological and physical damage this can cause. However, we rarely talk about how, for a whole section of society, loneliness linked with disability and long-term health problems is a stain on decades of people’s lives. Perhaps one of the most disturbing findings of Scope’s research is how younger disabled people, like millennials generally, are affected: 85% of young disabled adults (classed as 18- to 34-year-olds) admit they feel lonely. Beware of thinking that loneliness is some natural byproduct of disability. The strain of ill-health and disability can often lead someone to be isolated, but how society chooses to respond can either help fix it or compound it. I recently had a bad health spell that meant I was pretty much stuck in bed for two months. But even once I was better, I was very aware that – without support to leave the house or a relatively flexible job – I would still be in bed. These sorts of fears are even stronger at a time when the government is dramatically underfunding the social care system, and tightening eligibility on disability benefits. I speak daily to disabled people who are essentially cut off from society – twentysomethings unable to go to university, and not because of health problems but because they don’t have a social care package that enables them to get to lectures. Others are forced to be “put to bed” at 8pm because their council has restricted their care slots. Increasingly I hear from disabled readers who for years have used the Motability car scheme to do something as basic as go to the shops but who, in their tens of thousands, are now housebound after cuts saw this benefit taken away. Or wheelchair users who haven’t been outside for months because, stuck in inaccessible housing, they can’t get beyond their own front door. Last week the Guardian’s Disability Diaries chronicled how wheelchair users have to turn down invitations to see friends because the pub or restaurant – or public transport – isn’t accessible. It isn’t exactly surprising that disabled people are isolated when it’s still often impossible for us to get in the building. But attitudes towards disability are also powerful barriers. Two-thirds of the British public admit that they actually feel uncomfortable talking to disabled people, according to separate Scope research. Worryingly, millennials are twice as likely as older people to feel awkward around disabled people: a fifth of 18- to 34-year-olds have actually avoided talking to a disabled person because they are unsure “how to communicate with them” – as if having a disability makes us a separate species. It’s well established that there’s a stigma around admitting to loneliness – but for disabled people, a stigma around disability is contributing to loneliness. Imagine how lonely day-to-day life can be when the majority of the public avoid talking to you. Whether it’s government policy removing our social care packages or a stranger ignoring us in the street, tackling this persistent idea that a disabled person is somehow different to other people – that we don’t want to work, laugh in a pub or go on a date – is going to be a crucial part of ending disability’s chronic loneliness. Britain has a problem with isolating disabled people. Acknowledging that this actually matters is perhaps the first place to start. • Frances Ryan is a Guardian columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"global/shortcuts/2017/nov/22/whatever-happened-to-the-likely-lads-a-melancholy-masterpiece-of-a-tv-theme-tune","type":"article","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"Global","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-22T15:09:35Z","webTitle":"Whatever Happened to the Likely Lads?: a melancholy masterpiece of a TV theme tune","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global/shortcuts/2017/nov/22/whatever-happened-to-the-likely-lads-a-melancholy-masterpiece-of-a-tv-theme-tune","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global/shortcuts/2017/nov/22/whatever-happened-to-the-likely-lads-a-melancholy-masterpiece-of-a-tv-theme-tune","fields":{"headline":"Whatever Happened to the Likely Lads?: a melancholy masterpiece of a TV theme tune","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Few British sitcoms have ever balanced comedy and melancholy as perfectly as Whatever Happened to the Likely Lads? It didn’t deal in black humour in the latterday manner of Human Remains or Nighty Night – there was sharp, witty writing, slapstick humour, it dabbled in farce – but equally, there was no mistaking the way every episode was shot through with wistfulness, nostalgia and regret. It was there in Bob and Terry’s tendency to lapse into reminiscence at the slightest provocation; in Terry’s inability to settle back into civilian life after five years in the army; and in the late Rodney Bewes’s face, which seemed to naturally arrange itself into a mournful expression. And it was there in the music that accompanied the credits, the work in part of the show’s co-author Ian La Frenais. La Frenais was clearly quite the frustrated songwriter, almost invariably getting a hand in the themes for the programmes he wrote, often with deleterious results (witness Joe Fagin’s appalling 1984 hit That’s Livin’ Alright, which began life as the closing theme to Auf Weidersehen Pet). But this time he and co-writer Mike Hugg of Manfred Mann came up with one of those TV themes that appeared to immediately bury into the viewer’s brain. Unlike Dad’s Army or Porridge, Whatever Happened to the Likely Lads? is not perpetually repeated, apparently at the insistence of Bewes’s co-star James Bolam; it was last shown on terrestrial TV 20 years ago. The theme never became a hit: despite the invention of a fake band called Highly Likely to promote it, it barely scraped into the Top 40. Yet everyone who saw Whatever Happened to the Likely Lads? seems to remember the music, perhaps because it hits exactly the same sweet spot between melancholy and uplift as the programme it bookended. It is only the song’s chorus – in truth, the rest of the song is a bit of a disjointed mess, which may account for its failure to storm the charts – but in eight lines and 30 seconds, it manages to capture perfectly the programme’s themes. The lyrics are remorselessly downcast, reflecting the central characters’ tendency to boozy nostalgia – “It’s the only thing to look forward to – the past” – but they appear to be sung by a rousing chorus of voices: there’s something of the football terraces about it. There’s also a string arrangement you would describe as soaring were it not buried deep in the mix. Like the show itself, the music is very much a product of its era: between its clomping beat, liberal application of echo, a chord pattern that is simultaneously triumphant and oddly wistful (not unlike the kind of chord sequence known as a “glam descend”, found everywhere from Metal Guru to All the Young Dudes), and arms-around-your-mate singalong quality, it might easily have been the handiwork of Slade. Dejection, camaraderie, longing, the early 70s: its theme is Whatever Happened to the Likely Lads? in a nutshell."},"isHosted":false},{"id":"sport/2017/nov/22/rugby-league-six-nations-2018-ireland-england","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-22T13:25:27Z","webTitle":"A 2018 rugby league Six Nations on cards but Ireland not keen on England B","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/nov/22/rugby-league-six-nations-2018-ireland-england","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/nov/22/rugby-league-six-nations-2018-ireland-england","fields":{"headline":"A 2018 rugby league Six Nations on cards but Ireland not keen on England B","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"England are pencilled in to play Ireland in Dublin next autumn under the auspices of a new Six Nations tournament to increase the strength of northern hemisphere rugby league. The tournament is provisionally on the Rugby League International Federation’s calendar and would comprise the same participants as rugby union’s Six Nations in 2018. Of those six, Ireland, Scotland, Wales, France and Italy were eliminated in the group stages of the current Rugby League World Cup, while England face Tonga in a semi-final on Saturday. Richard Egan, the chairman of Rugby League Ireland, told the Guardian: “The provisional RLIF fixtures at the minute show that there is a Six Nations next year. It’s unconfirmed at the minute, though, and that’s where I have issues in developing the sport here. “In other sports you can buy tickets years in advance but I can’t guarantee what fixtures I’ve got to sell next year.” It is unclear when the RLIF plan to announce the details officially, though the tournament should take place in October and November, following the conclusion of the domestic season. However, that clashes with England’s three-Test series against New Zealand next autumn, details of which the Rugby Football League confirmed on Tuesday. That lends weight to the suggestion that the England Knights concept – an emerging talent side similar to union’s England Saxons – may return to play in the tournament. Egan, however, would be keen to see the strongest England side possible travel to Ireland to play in Dublin. He said: “We’re down for a provisional fixture against England in the capital and a game against Italy here, but if it’s an England B team that doesn’t work for me. “Super League clubs won’t release the big Irish players like Kyle Amor to play against England B. If we’re playing England, we want it to be the real deal.” Ireland won two of their three group games at the World Cup but still failed to qualify for the knockout stages, a victim of the tournament’s existing convoluted format. However, Egan is keen to build on their success in the coming years by persuading the RFL to induct a team from Ireland into the English leagues. “There needs to be a clear three-year plan in place, and while we’ve got some major brewers and companies in Ireland interested we need a commitment,” he said. “We’ll strengthen our domestic competition and then the following year, take the leading lads out of that to play against some teams in England. Then, in year three, we’d hopefully enter League 1. “I’ve approached the RFL and said it needs to happen; you saw the amount of Irish interest and heritage in 2013 when we sold out our World Cup game with England. Could you sell a weekend in Dublin away to a group of Leeds fans to watch their side play? I think so.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/nov/23/promise-new-labour-dust-lessons-brexit-tony-blair","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-23T10:00:27Z","webTitle":"Brexiteers, remember how the promise of New Labour turned to dust | Richard Power Sayeed","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/nov/23/promise-new-labour-dust-lessons-brexit-tony-blair","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/nov/23/promise-new-labour-dust-lessons-brexit-tony-blair","fields":{"headline":"Brexiteers, remember how the promise of New Labour turned to dust","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Twenty years after New Labour’s triumphant electoral victory, Tony Blair and Gordon Brown are still squabbling. But far more important than the competing accounts of when the former agreed to make way for the latter is understanding why the promise of New Labour turned out to be false. We all remember Tony sipping champagne with Noel. A wall of flowers for a people’s princess. Damien’s shark in the Royal Academy, just a few rooms away from Tracey’s tent. Geri in her Union Jack, proclaiming the rise of girl power. Doreen Lawrence demanding an inquiry for her murdered son. In 1997, these were seen as harbingers of a fairer, more open and more modern Britain. Today, after a decade of crisis, protest, riots, racism and referendums, we know only too well that New Labour and the liberal culture that enveloped it did not create a “new Britain”. The English establishment has always had a knack for spotting a good (and subversive) idea – before quickly making it their own. That’s why there hasn’t been a revolution in England since 1688. From the Great Reform Act of 1832 to the construction of the welfare state, grassroots agitators, parliamentary radicals and news of revolution abroad have forced the establishment – both recalcitrant reactionaries and liberals willing to compromise – to absorb a few radical ideas and save itself. In doing so, it strengthened the existing order further. In 1997 New Labour took this establishment penchant for pursuing marginal reform that reinforces the status quo and developed it into the operating principle of a whole political culture. It defined the historical moment. In his new office at the Treasury, its walls painted brilliant white and its floors cheaply carpeted, Gordon Brown oversaw an ambitious expansion of spending on schools, healthcare and his new Sure Start scheme. And so the Labour government made marginal but valuable improvements: the neoliberal juggernaut slightly decelerated. But there was no attempt to stop, let alone reverse, it. This would have meant reconstructing the economy and the state on fundamentally fairer terms. Inequality rose more slowly under New Labour than it had during 18 years of Tory rule. Nonetheless, it rose substantially. Brown’s plan turned out to be not only unambitious, but counterproductive. He funded his expansion of the welfare state using revenues generated by continuing the deregulation of the City, which allowed financial markets to take new risks and make enormous profits that he expected would swell the Treasury’s coffers. But since the 2007 financial crisis, austerity and stagnation have swept away New Labour’s painfully incremental improvements. Something similar happened when New Labour attached itself to the Stephen Lawrence campaign, and then made only the slightest dent in the racism institutionalised in the state and society. Jack Straw and Tony Blair emphatically endorsed the finding of a judicial inquiry that the failed Metropolitan police investigation into the Lawrence’s racist murder had been “marred by … institutional racism”. This contributed towards a progressive myth of a more tolerant future. Optimistic liberals pointed to the increasingly taboo nature of racist slurs, and the wide acceptance of mixed-race families. But two decades later there has been little change to the racialised imbalance in who gets stopped and searched, and in who suffers police violence. The class divide between white and ethnic-minority communities remains deep and wide. The slow diminishing of personal prejudice not only did nothing to tackle institutionalised racism: it provided cover for inaction. This dynamic – powerful systems and rigid inequalities being strengthened by changes and reforms that might have been expected to diminish them – reached beyond Whitehall and into our pop culture. The year that Blair moved into Downing Street, the Spice Girls became the biggest band in the world. They did something that, for a totally artificial, middle-of-the-mainstream pop band was exceptional and extraordinary: they introduced their young fans to explicitly ideological ideas of independence and solidarity. “We have come up against a few guys who expect five bimbos,” Geri Halliwell told a reporter. “It just means you’ve just got to shout a bit louder to get your way. We’re freshening up feminism for the 90s.” Too often, however, the Spice Girls’ marketing taught their fans to value conventional good looks and fashion. Girl power was, as pointed out by the US journalist Rachel Giese, “feminism-lite”; but it was also a marketing ploy designed to turn little girls into demanding and sexualised consumers. Fortune magazine doled out cynical marketing advice: “If you want to sell to the girl power crowd, you have to pretend that they’re running things, that they’re in charge.” This “girl power” wasn’t simply an accessible version of feminism; it was its free-market antithesis – a commercial system that used against women not just women’s lack of privilege, but also their political desire for equality. Geri Halliwell was not in on the con: just as Brown wanted to spend as much as he could on Sure Start, she thought the Spice Girls could make a small difference. Nonetheless, today we are disappointed that the optimistic vision of 1997 failed to come about. Its compromises and appropriations, presented as acts of grand reform, have paved the way for our current upheaval. People are angry about the cost of living, racism, misogyny, the distance between themselves and centres of power. Under New Labour the tension between the promise of reform and the reality of the status quo became an unsustainable contradiction. Blair insisted, from the beginning, that what a society worn down by Thatcherite market globalisation needed was more of the same. But he justified this by appropriating the rhetoric of both social democracy and national greatness. He announced, in his conference speech a year after entering office, “a new agenda: economies that compete on knowledge, on the creative power of the many, not the few; societies based on inclusion not division”. He justified Britain’s international role on the basis that “I am a patriot. I want Britain strong.”” Blair built support for the pro-globalisation policies that were eroding the welfare state by promoting nationalist feelings of regret for that erosion, creating a devastating sense of disruption for Britain’s “left-behinds”. His nationalist rhetoric, along with his anti-asylum policies, helped to ensure that when the backlash came, it did so in the isolationist and xenophobic form of Brexit and anti-migrant feeling. When Brexiters – I’m looking at you, Boris Johnson – talk of “letting the British lion roar” and an extra £350m a week for the NHS, are they also playing the establishment trick of branding stasis as change? They should consider how they will be remembered if Brexit also delivers more of the same – if it reinforces the conditions that motivated many leave supporters: de-industrialisation, precarious employment and insecure housing, and the rolling back of the welfare state. If that’s the kind of Brexit we get, then history will condemn the current government and its promises of transformative change even more severely than it has judged the happy, smiling and optimistic administration that came to power 20 years ago. • Richard Power Sayeed is the author of 1997: The Future That Never Happened"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"music/2017/nov/23/goran-kajfes-subtropic-arkestra-reason-why-vol-3-review-headspin-recordings","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-23T18:20:08Z","webTitle":"Goran Kajfeš/Subtropic Arkestra: The Reason Why Vol 3 review – delightfully weird covers","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/nov/23/goran-kajfes-subtropic-arkestra-reason-why-vol-3-review-headspin-recordings","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2017/nov/23/goran-kajfes-subtropic-arkestra-reason-why-vol-3-review-headspin-recordings","fields":{"headline":"Goran Kajfeš/Subtropic Arkestra: The Reason Why Vol 3 review – delightfully weird covers","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Led by the staggeringly prolific Swedish trumpeter Goran Kajfeš, the Subtropic Arkestra are possibly the best of those many bands who meld Afrobeat, Ethio-jazz and big band funk.

And given the news that growth had been downgraded to 1.5% and the low forecasts for growth stretching out until 2022, Philip Hammond needed all the laughs he could get. Things didn’t go brilliantly in the run-up to the speech. First up, people noticed how the Treasury team didn’t quite manage to pull off a tribute to the Beatles’ Abbey Road album cover. Then the chancellor got stuck in traffic on the way from Downing Street to the House of Commons. Behind a white van with a Europhile logo. This came days after he avoided another potentially awkward vehicle-related photo op as a passenger in a self-driving car. There may have been a U-turn on taking that car trip, but Hammond didn’t back away from mentioning self-driving vehicles in his speech. “I know that Jeremy Clarkson doesn’t like them, but there are also other reasons to pursue this technology,” he said, going on to indulge in some wordplay about Clarkson’s fellow Grand Tour presenters, suggesting it was “not the first time you’ve been snubbed by Hammond and May”. The line went down well in some quarters. Theresa May joined in with a joke about the coughing fit that blighted her conference speech last month. Hammond said he’d asked a colleague to bring cough sweets, and the prime minister duly obliged. In perhaps his spikiest comment, Hammond took a swipe at his colleague Michael Gove, joking that the details from the OBR were “the bit with the long economicky words in it” – a reference to criticism of the environment secretary’s apparent angling for the chancellor’s job. The former Scottish Labour leader Kezia Dugdale’s controversial appearance on I’m a Celebrity … also got a mention, as Hammond quipped about the opposition: “I’m Labour, get me out of here.” Not everybody was impressed with the attempts to distract from the dismal figures with jokes. Here’s Theo Bertram, a former adviser to Tony Blair and Gordon Brown: Nor was the general secretary of Unison pleased: The nation’s awkward relationship with alcohol was illustrated by the fact that the chancellor both spoke about the grave threat to health posed by drinking and made jokes about it. He opened by stressing that he was sticking to water, despite being tempted with something stronger (it is a tradition that chancellors are allowed to drink alcohol at the despatch box when delivering their budget speeches). Hammond was also moved to wish a “Merry Christmas, Mr Deputy Speaker” when announcing that a freeze on alcohol duty would mean a pint of beer would cost 12p less and a bottle of whisky £1.15 less than if the government had persevered with increases planned by Labour. But this was just after announcing that the duty on high-strength white cider would rise, citing “excessive alcohol consumption by vulnerable people” as the reason. Announcing that he was increasing air passenger duty on premium-class tickets and private jets, Hammond muttered “sorry Lewis” – a reference to the F1 champion Lewis Hamilton, who was recently revealed to have avoided paying European taxes on his private jet. At one point, Hammond boasted: “Don’t let anyone say I don’t know how to show the country a good time.” This wasn’t, alas, a self-congratulatory reference to his own performance at the dispatch box. Rather, it was a slightly sarcastic take on an announcement that more maths schools would be introduced around the country. Still, as one spoof account on Twitter pointed out, things aren’t what they used to be with budgets, are they?"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2017/nov/22/new-nuclear-power-cannot-rival-windfarms-price-energy-boss-innogy","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-22T15:37:07Z","webTitle":"New nuclear power cannot rival windfarms on price, energy boss says","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/nov/22/new-nuclear-power-cannot-rival-windfarms-price-energy-boss-innogy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/nov/22/new-nuclear-power-cannot-rival-windfarms-price-energy-boss-innogy","fields":{"headline":"New nuclear power cannot rival windfarms on price, energy boss says","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"New nuclear power stations in the UK can no longer compete with windfarms on price, according to the boss of a German energy company’s green power arm. Hans Bunting, the chief operating officer of renewables at Innogy SE, part of the company that owns the UK energy supplier npower, said offshore windfarms had become mainstream and were destined to become even cheaper because of new, bigger turbines. Asked whether nuclear groups that want to build new reactors in the UK could compete with windfarms on cost, even when their intermittency was taken into account, Bunting replied: “Obviously they can’t.” His comments came after MPs criticised the £30bn cost to consumers for EDF Energy’s Hinkley Point C nuclear power station, and said ministers should revisit the case for new nuclear before proceeding with more projects. Innogy recently secured a subsidy of £74.75 per megawatt hour of power to build a windfarm off the Lincolnshire coast, which is £17.75 cheaper than Hinkley and should be completed about three years earlier. “What we see now [with prices] is with today’s technology. It’s not about tomorrow’s technology, which is about [to come in] 2025, 2027, when Hinkley will most likely come to the grid ... and then it [windfarms] will be even cheaper.” While the company is planning to use the most powerful turbines in the world today for the Lincolnshire windfarm, Bunting said even bigger ones in development would drive costs down further. “A few years ago everyone thought 10MW [turbines] was the maximum, now we’re talking about 15[MW]. It seems the sky is the limit,” he said. “[It] means less turbines for the same capacity, less steel in the ground, less cables, even bigger rotors catching more wind, so it will become cheaper.” However, EDF argued that nuclear was also on a path to lower costs. “Early offshore wind projects started at around £150 per MW/h and developers have shown they can offer lower prices by repeating projects with an established supply chain – the same is true for nuclear,” an EDF spokesman said. “EDF Energy’s follow-on nuclear projects at Sizewell and Bradwell will remain competitive with other low-carbon options and we are confident they can be developed at a significantly lower price than Hinkley Point C.” In an interview with the Guardian, Bunting said Innogy was strongly committed to the UK despite its subsidiary npower merging with the big-six supplier SSE. A third of the group’s renewables staff are based in the UK. “The npower and SSE merger does not for us mean we are going to leave the UK. No way. We’re going to stay here, and grow here,” he said. He argued the new supplier would be good for billpayers, contrary to consumer groups’ fears. “There is an industrial logic in it. I think at the end of the day it will help competition because then you have two large players on the market, and they will be more efficient.” Bunting said he would like to build onshore windfarms in the UK too, if the government rethought its ban on subsidies for them. He said the political argument against them – public opposition in Tory shires – no longer stood because potential windfarms in Scotland and Wales were more likely to win subsidies. “England shouldn’t worry because England doesn’t have such good wind conditions … in an auction [for subsidies] the English sites would anyway struggle to qualify against Welsh and Scottish sites.” Innogy would also take a close interest in building large solar power plants, if ministers reopened support for them, he added. Bunting rejected the idea that the subsidy costs of paying for clean power should be shifted off energy bills and into general taxation, as British Gas’s boss has argued for. Such a change would make the cost of clean power less transparent and deter households and businesses from taking steps to save energy, he said. “If part of the energy [costs] is tax-financed it will become completely intransparent,” he said. A spokesman for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said: “We need a diverse energy mix to ensure that demand for energy can always be met, and both nuclear and renewables will play an important role in this for many years to come.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2017/nov/23/jane-review-goodall-tarzan-chimp-behaviour-documentary","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-23T08:00:24Z","webTitle":"Jane review – wondrous footage lights up Goodall's Tarzan dream","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/nov/23/jane-review-goodall-tarzan-chimp-behaviour-documentary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2017/nov/23/jane-review-goodall-tarzan-chimp-behaviour-documentary","fields":{"headline":"Jane review – wondrous footage lights up Goodall's Tarzan dream","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Here is a portrait of the primatologist as a young woman.

Goodall says that it was her mother who built her self-esteem when she was growing up – encouraging her to see beyond the expectations that a nice, middle-class girl from Bournemouth should get married and start a family. Instead, she dreamed of living with animals in the jungle like Tarzan. There are more than 40 documentaries about Goodall. What makes this one – directed by Brett Morgen, who made The Kid Stays in the Picture – essential, is Goodall’s reflective mood and the wondrous 16mm archive footage shot by Hugo van Lawick, the great wildlife photographer National Geographic sent to film her in Tanzania. The pair fell in love and married (though in the end, Goodall’s happy-ever-after was with the chimps not Van Lawick).

Do they bring real-life experiences to those highly choreographed moments when they’re leaping with ecstasy, racked by grief or, as in the climax of Stravinsky’s Rite of Spring, dancing themselves to death on behalf of a fearful, threatened community? These are some of the questions posed by Goat, the raw, funny and occasionally searing new piece of dance theatre that Ben Duke has made for Rambert. The setting is an ambiguous space that is part meeting hall, part performance arena, and its “characters” are a group of dancers and musicians who have gathered to enact some kind of cathartic emotional ritual. Miguel Altunaga plays a reporter sent to describe it, and the tone at first is wickedly funny as Altunaga – a pitch perfect combination of intrusive and bewildered – tries to make sense of what’s happening. “Amazing energy,” he pronounces as the group rock through a happy-clappy ensemble. Then as the group divide into individual solos, contorting their bodies into expressions of private feeling, he trails after the dancers, hoping for elucidation. One of them, her limbs tied into an agonised knot, explains breathlessly that she’s dancing about the “stigma of addiction”. Another, his eyes rolling back in his head with exertion, says he’s expressing a sense of betrayal. It’s a brilliant riff on the worst cliches of interpretative modern dance but Duke is soon flipping the work into something deeper, darker and more personal. His inspiration for Goat came from watching footage of Nina Simone, who, legendarily, appeared to suffer and exult through every emotion of every song she sang. Duke has replicated some of that rare intensity on his stage by having the marvellous Nia Lynn performing some of Simone’s best-known repertory. The richness of Lynn’s range, from the celebratory Ain’t Got No, I Got Life to the ineffably bleak Ballad of Hollis Brown, brings a thrilling emotional charge, even to Duke’s more overtly comic material. The second half of Goat is framed directly around the scenario of Stravinsky’s Rite and it is here that the work begins to posit its teasing and surprisingly affecting relationship between the passions of the real world and the choreography on stage. Once the group have prepared their victim, Liam Francis, for sacrifice, one of them delivers a fraught, furious speech listing all the evils – from killing seals to asbestos poisoning – that his death is intended to purge. When Altunaga shoves his microphone at Francis, the doomed man can barely talk and his fate comes to seem even more vivid to us when, after his solo “dance to the death”, Hannah Rudd takes his broken body in her arms and delivers a heartrending monologue about losing a lover in a recent terrorist attack. By the time Lynn closes the work with a wrenching rendition of Feelings, we’re in an emotional no man’s land, unsure where artifice begins or ends. Goat is a precariously poised work, playing with a multitude of ideas. The fact that it comes across as coherently as it does is due to the exceptional skills of its cast, who make even the deliberately fake look somehow transparently true. That onstage honesty is deeply refreshing and it casts an interesting light on the two works that precede Goat in the programme. Itzik Galili’s A Linha Curva is an unabashed street party of a dance, inspired by the music and movement of Brazil. Galili is clever in how he concentrates the exuberance of his material through the strictness of his geometric structure, and Rambert’s dancers who’ve been performing the work since 2009 are exemplary in combining Latin-inflected sass with meticulous speed. Hips swivel, feet drum, bodies skid and slide. But the work falters, for me, when Galili attempts to channel actual street life into the choreography and especially when the male dancers, hopped up on testosterone, compete to outdance and outflirt each other. It is harmless fun, but the language is predictable verging on trite. Even the superb dancers of Rambert cannot give much credibility to Symbiosis, a work created by the Greek choreographer Andonis Foniadakis. Set to a commissioned score by Ilan Eshkeri, the choreography is, according to Foniadakis, inspired by the pattern and behaviours of city life. But the relentlessness of the dance material – every phrase revved up to head-tossing, leg-flicking levels of hyperactivity – resists any kind of emotional, musical or narrative logic. If Altunaga’s character wandered in from Goat to ask the dancers what they were meant to be doing, I’m not convinced any of them would be able to answer. At Sadler’s Wells, London, until Saturday.

Following another day of debate about the bill, which seeks to transpose EU statute into UK law post-Brexit, the government faced possible defeat over amendments intended to maintain the scope of the EU charter on fundamental rights. Several of the amendments were tabled by Dominic Grieve, the Tory former attorney general and a leading Brexit rebel, with speculation that enough of his fellow Tories would back some of these to inflict defeat. However, the solicitor general, Robert Buckland, said the government was willing to work with Grieve to see how rights under the charter could be kept after Brexit, and would introduce its own amendment to this effect later in the bill’s passage. Grieve said this was sufficient reassurance for him and that he would not press for a vote on his amendments. Ken Clarke, another leading Conservative Brexit rebel, refused to guarantee he would not press for a vote on one amendment, which would allow Britons to mount legal challenges under the charter after Brexit, to which he was the second signatory after Grieve. However, with Grieve backing away, the chances of a government defeat were notably lessened if a vote was called. Buckland said he did not fully agree with Grieve’s amendment, which would allow challenges to EU law retained after Brexit “on the grounds that it is in breach of general principles of EU law”, and questioned whether it would add anything “that is relevant or material” to existing rights. But Buckland said: “Let me say that we do recognise the strength of views from my right honourable friend and, indeed, from other honourable members and honourable friends on this issue – many of whom have spoken this afternoon. “We’re listening, and we are prepared to look again at this issue to make sure that we are taking an approach that can command the support of this house.” Buckland said he would happily discuss a way forward with Grieve, “and agree to work together with us in this shared endeavour”, which would result in a government amendment in the report stage, the next part of the bill’s passage through the Commons. The climbdown illustrates again how vulnerable ministers are over the bill, given the number of potential Tory rebels often exceeds the government’s tiny DUP-aided majority. During the debate, the government also said it would publish by 5 December a review of the implications of removing the charter of fundamental rights from UK law. This was in response to an amendment by the Labour MP Chris Leslie, who said in response he would not push for a vote on this. Speaking earlier in the debate, Grieve said the government should appreciate the results of recent decades of advances over human rights. “On the whole, western democracies have tended in that time to develop the idea of rights,” he argued. “I know that for some members that appears to be anathema – it makes them choke over the cornflakes – but it is a development that I have always welcomed and that, it seems to me, has delivered substantial benefits for all members of our society, particularly the most vulnerable.” Fellow Tory MPs should bear the issue in mind, Grieve said, “because the issue will not go away”. He added: “If we do not seek to act on it, the idea of a modern Conservative party starts to fray at the edges, and I do not wish my party to gain a reputation for ignoring these key issues.” Paul Blomfield, Labour’s shadow Brexit minister, said his party would back moves to enshrine EU rights protections. “The failure to transpose the charter [of fundamental rights] into EU retained law creates a gap in our statute book and as the Equality and Human Rights Commission has stated the bill as it stands will not achieve the government’s stated aim of non-regression on social justice issues and that’s something very serious for this House to take account of,” he said. “By compiling and codifying these rights in a single document, the charter in effect created new rights and certainly created new protections. “In short, the charter is the most effective key to unlocking vital rights, and to fail to transpose it and make it operable in UK law is to lock away those rights and deny UK citizens the key to accessing them.” Dominic Raab, the justice minister, rejected the arguments, saying the EU withdrawal bill would actually improve rights protections “precisely because we are making sure that the substantive rules of EU law will be retained on day one of exit”. He added: “This country has a longstanding tradition of liberty and rights, and we intend to build on that following our departure from the EU. The government are resolute in that commitment.” The debate marked the third of eight planned days of debate during the committee stage for the bill, which now faces potential amendments totalling 176 pages, giving scope for other potential defeats."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/nov/21/medicine-agency-britain-brexit-european-medicines-agency-industry","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-21T17:52:22Z","webTitle":"A key medicine agency has left Britain.

This is the start of a Brexodus","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Amsterdam has won the right to become the new host for the European Medicines Agency (EMA). In a nail-biting final round last night, the 19 European cities that had put in bids had been whittled down to Milan and Amsterdam, sharing an equal number of votes. A draw from a hat sealed it for Amsterdam. Moments later, the same scenario played out for the European Banking Authority (EBA), with Paris and Dublin going into a hat and Paris being drawn. And so it is settled. The EMA will move from London to Amsterdam after Brexit – taking with it nearly 900 jobs, a budget of €322m, and some 40,000 business visits every year, which support local hotels, restaurants, taxis and so on. Also likely to move with the EMA is the attendant industry that congregates around it for easy access to the regulator. It’s a substantial loss of finances, talent, infrastructure and influence. As the EMA leaves the UK, the question now becomes: does the UK leave the EMA? The EMA is the regulatory body for the single market for medicines, and the two are entwined. Do we want to stay with that market of 510 million people and its regulator, or splinter off as a market of 65 million with our own framework that decides what medical drugs and devices can be developed and sold here? During the referendum debate, the leave campaign claimed that the EU generated repressive “red tape” for clinical trials and life sciences, and that the UK should be free to be more innovative in this area. However, in the overwhelming judgment of our own life sciences industry, any potential gains would be small beans compared with the profound damage caused by splitting our huge collaborative market. In September 2016, the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry (ABPI) and BioIndustries Association (BIA) jointly wrote: “Creating a standalone UK regulator would require significant resource, time and expertise, and … would likely still leave the UK behind the US and EU for new product launches, to the detriment of UK patients.” Switzerland and Canada have separate approval systems and are typically six months slower than the EU to bring new medicines to market – a critical consideration for new life-saving drugs. The government is caught between industry reality in one ear and continued Brexit fantasy in the other, hoping for a magical hybrid deal. Meanwhile, the sands of time are running out. Companies fret over potential market fracture. On the EMA’s own website, a series of FAQs on legal concerns repeats that companies, processes and certain people must be established in the single market if they want the authorisations and support of the EMA after Brexit. The EMA guidance is unflinching advice to up sticks and move to elsewhere in Europe in order to preserve access to the single market for medicines and its regulator. Virginia Acha, executive director of research, medical and innovation at ABPI, estimated that the restructuring costs arising from UK pharma companies following the EMA’s guidance would run to “hundreds of millions of pounds”. Two pharmaceutical companies, AstraZeneca and Eisai, have already spent millions starting to duplicate their testing and approval procedures elsewhere in the EU in order to ensure market access after 2019. The UK government knows it does not have enough time to arrange the Brexit it wants, and so is asking for a transition phase that respects single market rules, followed by some kind of deal that would ideally keep harmonisation with the EMA at least for a while. That means drugs developed or made here could be sold into the EU without separate authorisation and vice versa. Yet a timely deal is not a sure thing. After the precarious hurdle of the “divorce bill” lie multiple sectors all vying to get priority on deal-making and avoid falling off the over-stacked plate. Until any deal is finally signed, the colossal uncertainty continues to eat away at talent recruitment and inward investment. These are real issues and consequences. The delusion of “it’ll be alright on the night” should now be dispelled with the EMA and EBA relocations. As recently as April, the Department for Exiting the European Union denied that they would have to move, with a spokesman brazenly and erroneously stating that their fate “will be subject to the exit negotiations”. It is time to stop the gaslighting. The EMA is gone. Without quick governmental moves to commit to preserving the EMA regulatory framework, the EU science programme, the European investment bank, Euratom and more, the high-value European medicines and research marketplace will continue to be lured from our shores. • Mike Galsworthy is co-founder of the Scientists for EU (@scientists4EU) and Healthier In the EU (@healthierIN) campaigns"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"news/2017/nov/21/corrections-and-clarifications","type":"article","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-21T20:59:01Z","webTitle":"Corrections and clarifications","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2017/nov/21/corrections-and-clarifications","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/2017/nov/21/corrections-and-clarifications","fields":{"headline":"Corrections and clarifications","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"• The tennis player Andy Murray was absent from the 2017 ATP World Finals not because of “his unreliable knee” as we had it, but due to a hip injury (Dimitrov holds his nerve to win thriller, 20 November, page 12, Sport). • A comment article (Marriage is about power, property and control – it’s time for a more equal form of partnership for all, 20 November, page 5, G2) said marriage certificates in the UK required only the names of the couple’s fathers, not their mothers.

The promise of economic growth is that the poor can live like the rich and the rich can live like the oligarchs. But already we are bursting through the physical limits of the planet that sustains us. Climate breakdown, soil loss, the collapse of habitats and species, the sea of plastic, insectageddon: all are driven by rising consumption. The promise of private luxury for everyone cannot be met: neither the physical nor the ecological space exists. But growth must go on: this is everywhere the political imperative. And we must adjust our tastes accordingly. In the name of autonomy and choice, marketing uses the latest findings in neuroscience to break down our defences. Those who seek to resist must, like the Simple Lifers in Brave New World, be silenced – in this case by the media. With every generation, the baseline of normalised consumption shifts. Thirty years ago, it was ridiculous to buy bottled water, where tap water is clean and abundant. Today, worldwide, we use a million plastic bottles a minute. Every Friday is a Black Friday, every Christmas a more garish festival of destruction. Among the snow saunas, portable watermelon coolers and smartphones for dogs with which we are urged to fill our lives, my #extremecivilisation prize now goes to the PancakeBot: a 3D batter printer that allows you to eat the Mona Lisa, the Taj Mahal, or your dog’s bottom every morning. In practice, it will clog up your kitchen for a week until you decide you don’t have room for it. For junk like this, we’re trashing the living planet, and our own prospects of survival. Everything must go. The ancillary promise is that, through green consumerism, we can reconcile perpetual growth with planetary survival. But a series of research papers reveal there is no significant difference between the ecological footprints of people who care and people who don’t. One recent article, published in the journal Environment and Behaviour, says those who identify themselves as conscious consumers use more energy and carbon than those who do not. Why? Because environmental awareness tends to be higher among wealthy people. It is not attitudes that govern our impact on the planet but income. The richer we are, the bigger our footprint, regardless of our good intentions. Those who see themselves as green consumers, the research found, mainly focused on behaviours that had “relatively small benefits”. I know people who recycle meticulously, save their plastic bags, carefully measure the water in their kettles, then take their holidays in the Caribbean, cancelling any environmental savings a hundredfold. I’ve come to believe that the recycling licences their long-haul flights. It persuades people they’ve gone green, enabling them to overlook their greater impacts. None of this means that we should not try to reduce our footprint, but we should be aware of the limits of the exercise. Our behaviour within the system cannot change the outcomes of the system. It is the system itself that needs to change. Research by Oxfam suggests that the world’s richest 1% (if your household has an income of £70,000 or more, this means you) produce about 175 times as much carbon as the poorest 10%. How, in a world in which everyone is supposed to aspire to high incomes, can we avoid turning the Earth, on which all prosperity depends, into a dust ball? By decoupling, the economists tell us: detaching economic growth from our use of materials. So how well is this going? A paper in the journal Plos One finds that while, in some countries, relative decoupling has occurred, “no country has achieved absolute decoupling during the past 50 years”. What this means is that the amount of materials and energy associated with each increment of GDP might decline but, as growth outpaces efficiency, the total use of resources keeps rising. More important, the paper reveals that, in the long term, both absolute and relative decoupling from the use of essential resources is impossible, because of the physical limits of efficiency. A global growth rate of 3% means that the size of the world economy doubles every 24 years. This is why environmental crises are accelerating at such a rate. Yet the plan is to ensure that it doubles and doubles again, and keeps doubling in perpetuity. In seeking to defend the living world from the maelstrom of destruction, we might believe we are fighting corporations and governments and the general foolishness of humankind. But they are all proxies for the real issue: perpetual growth on a planet that is not growing. Those who justify this system insist that economic growth is essential for the relief of poverty. But a paper in the World Economic Review finds that the poorest 60% of the world’s people receive only 5% of the additional income generated by rising GDP. As a result, $111 (£84) of growth is required for every $1 reduction in poverty. This is why, on current trends, it would take 200 years to ensure that everyone receives $5 a day. By this point, average per capita income will have reached $1m a year, and the economy will be 175 times bigger than it is today. This is not a formula for poverty relief. It is a formula for the destruction of everything and everyone. When you hear that something makes economic sense, this means it makes the opposite of common sense. Those sensible men and women who run the world’s treasuries and central banks, who see an indefinite rise in consumption as normal and necessary, are beserkers: smashing through the wonders of the living world, destroying the prosperity of future generations to sustain a set of figures that bear ever less relation to general welfare. Green consumerism, material decoupling, sustainable growth: all are illusions, designed to justify an economic model that is driving us to catastrophe. The current system, based on private luxury and public squalor, will immiserate us all: under this model, luxury and deprivation are one beast with two heads. We need a different system, rooted not in economic abstractions but in physical realities, that establish the parameters by which we judge its health. We need to build a world in which growth is unnecessary, a world of private sufficiency and public luxury. And we must do it before catastrophe forces our hand. • George Monbiot is a Guardian columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"books/2017/dec/11/the-100-best-nonfiction-books-shakespeares-first-folio-1623","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-11T05:44:13Z","webTitle":"The 100 best nonfiction books: No 97 – The First Folio by William Shakespeare (1623)","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/dec/11/the-100-best-nonfiction-books-shakespeares-first-folio-1623","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2017/dec/11/the-100-best-nonfiction-books-shakespeares-first-folio-1623","fields":{"headline":"The 100 best nonfiction books: No 97 – The First Folio by William Shakespeare (1623)","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"In 1612, a contemporary of Shakespeare’s, the playwright Thomas Heywood, published An Apology for Actors, in which he expressed a patriotic sentiment about the English language, boastful at the time, which now seems unexceptional: Our English tongue, which hath been the most harsh, uneven and broken language of the world... is now continually refined, every writer striving in himself to add a new flourish unto it; so that it is grown into a most perfect and composed language. The coming of age of English at the beginning of the 17th century, after a golden generation of extraordinary growth and innovation, is symbolised by the publication of a landmark edition that the playwright himself had never bothered with in his own lifetime. Indeed, it was not until seven years after his death, thanks to the First Folio, that his work began slowly to acquire the canonical status it enjoys today. Towards the end of November 1623, the bookseller Edward Blount, who traded at the sign of the Black Bear near St Paul’s, finally held in his hands the text of a great volume for which he had long been waiting: Mr William Shakespeares Comedies, Histories &amp; Tragedies. Published according to the True Originall Copies. In the words of one critic: “It is hard to overstate the importance of this literary, cultural and commercial moment.” The book now known as the First Folio (the first authoritative edition of Shakespeare’s plays) established “Shakespeare” for all time and it did this in two principal ways. First, it collects some 36 plays, including 18 scripts (notably Macbeth, Julius Caesar, As You Like It and The Tempest) which would be otherwise unknown. The trove of work thus assembled gave posterity not just a cast of immortal characters (Bottom, Falstaff, Lear, Portia, Jaques, Prospero et al), but also a heap of new words (including, for example, catastrophe, exaggerate, assassinate, indifference, monopoly and paradox). Second, it definitively connects his contemporary Ben Jonson (who declared his rival to be “the soul of the age”) and some of the actors who had first performed these plays with the historical person, the playwright himself, a figure helpfully illustrated by a famous frontispiece, the engraved portrait of the artist that has become an icon of “Shakespeare studies”. Other facts about the First Folio, a canon of incomparable power and authority, and the text that would help launch Shakespeare’s global literary afterlife are indisputable: both its value (somewhere north of $5m in rare books’ sales) and its comparative rarity (approximately 240 copies survive worldwide in public and private collections). This First Folio also does not include collaborations such as Pericles or The Two Noble Kinsmen. On the other hand, it does establish three categories for Shakespeare’s work – comedies, histories and tragedies – that survive to the present. Furthermore, it promotes a seductive myth of the artist’s genius, as “a happy imitator of nature”. According to John Heminges and Henry Condell, the two actors from the acting company the King’s Men responsible for putting this volume together: “His mind and hand went together and what he thought he uttered with that easiness that we have scarce received from him a blot in his papers.” This is a particularly tantalising reference. All the contemporary, working manuscript materials of Shakespeare’s plays are lost. We have his signature on several legal documents but – apart from one scene, his contribution to Sir Thomas More – nothing in his hand: no prompt copy, no printer’s proofs, nothing. As so often with Shakespeare, when you look closely at his work, you find layer upon layer of mystery, entwined with fathomless ambiguity. The First Folio does, however, have one significant and unequivocal characteristic. Unlike Shakespeare’s producers, Heminges and Condell were determined to promote the poet’s authorship. The name of Shakespeare had not been much of a selling point among Elizabethan playgoers, as the sometimes anonymous Quarto editions of his work indicate. For this Jacobean edition, however, his publishers wanted to create a literary artefact, a legacy volume. This, triumphantly, is what the First Folio achieves. After 1623, Shakespeare and his works are on the march across the English-speaking world. Which brings us to that frontispiece by the Dutch engraver Martin Droeshout. As the Shakespeare scholar Emma Smith has noted, this portrait “exists in three separate states”, indicating the trouble taken with the likeness. Droeshout’s engraving projects what Smith calls “an abiding sense that the man and his plays must be deeply interconnected… The book [the First Folio] presents us with a person, a personality, through his work.” In thus branding their volume, his publishers were leaning on a secure and careful image of Shakespeare himself to encourage its market and champion its contents. This in turn, brings us back to Ben Jonson, whose salute to Shakespeare faces the Droeshout portrait. Jonson’s role is crucial because his testament to Shakespeare and his work dominates the opening page of the First Folio. “Who is Ben Jonson?” we might ask. In brief, he is Shakespeare’s great rival, a playwright who had already gone to great lengths to oversee a collected edition of his own dramatic works, a man convinced of his own importance, mildly obsessed with posterity. Garrulous, argumentative, jealous, proud and deeply committed to exposing hypocrisy and corruption, Jonson is never a man to kowtow to nobility or privilege. How does Jonson make his contribution to this collected works? He writes in strikingly generous (almost awestruck) terms about a man he had mercilessly satirised in his lifetime. Opposite the portrait of his friend, he identifies the image of a writer whose work, he declares, far surpasses the quotidian limits of his ordinary life. It’s Jonson who coins the “sweet Swan of Avon” (ie the declaration that the author of the First Folio is from Stratford), in his dedicatory poem, and it’s Jonson who declares that he is “the applause, the delight, the wonder of our stage”, and then – a few lines later – that he is “not of an age, but for all time” and claims him, with proprietorial certainty, as “my gentle Shakespeare”. Here, beyond question, is one great literary figure paying posthumous tribute to another. This must confound those conspiracy theorists for whom “Shakespeare” is simply an alias, an elaborate code for other hands. You have to ask yourself, confronted with this documentary evidence, why on earth would Jonson, who never took instruction from anyone, who was notoriously awkward and who had competed with Shakespeare throughout his professional life, take part in a cover-up. There are countless examples of how impossible it is to imagine Sir Francis Bacon or Edward de Vere (the 17th Earl of Oxford) or anyone else writing these plays. Tiny details betray the work of a man steeped in everyday life: for instance, the brilliant detail from the history plays of the problem of fleas breeding in the corners of taverns where men have been pissing. This brings us back to Shakespeare’s provincial origins. As many have noted, it’s been hard for some to accept that a man from the lower orders, not formally educated at Oxford or Cambridge, could be a genius, the greatest playwright who ever lived. Combined with a natural human appetite for mystery, this has flourished into the “Anonymous” fantasy maintained by the Shakespeare-deniers. The First Folio is the obvious refutation of this nonsense. In the real world of serious literary criticism, it remains, in the words of the RSC’s Complete Works, an edition based on the First Folio, “unquestionably the most important single book in the history of world drama”.

The long-anticipated verdict was previously delayed for half an hour after Mladic asked the judge if he could take a short bathroom break. The delay was extended as rumours began to circulate that the former Bosnian Serb commander, who had appeared healthy when sitting in court, had suddenly been taken ill. As he entered the ICTY courtroom, Mladic had infuriated relatives of the victims as gave a broad smile and gave a thumbs up to the cameras. Mladić, who was commander of the Bosnian Serb army during the 1992-95 Bosnian conflict and for several years was one of the world’s most wanted fugitives, is now 74 and in poor health. His lawyers have argued he is not well enough to hear his verdict and sentence in person, but it is not clear whether they will seek a last-minute postponement. A judge has already rejected a defence effort earlier this month to have the judgment put off. The trial in The Hague, which took 530 days spread over more than four years, is arguably the most significant war crimes case in Europe since the Nuremberg tribunal, in part because of the scale of the atrocities involved. The International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) heard from 591 witnesses and examined nearly 10,000 exhibits concerning 106 separate crimes. Legal scholars say Mladić is almost certain to be found guilty of genocide for the massacre at Srebrenica in July 1995, where more than 7,000 Muslim men and boys were killed, most by summary execution. The Bosnian Serb political leader, Radovan Karadžić, was convicted of genocide last year for his role in the Srebrenica killings. Mladić was shown on video giving orders to his troops as the army-age men and teenage boys were separated from their families, shortly before the executions began. “He is definitely the personification of evil for many, many survivors and victims and that’s why this trial is so important – because it gives a certain sense of justice to people who have been have waiting for this moment for many years,” Serge Brammertz, the ICTY chief prosecutor, told the Guardian, on the eve of the verdict. Brammertz oversaw the successful hunt for Mladić during the general’s last years in hiding and then his marathon prosecution. He said: “The Mladić case has definitely been one of the most important cases at this tribunal. He was been on the run for many years, and I remember when I started in 2008, everyone was quite pessimistic about the chances of getting Mladić ever arrested.” The Bosnian Serb military leader was first indicted in 1995 but the Nato allies who sent peacekeepers to Bosnia after the war initially had little interest in arresting him, fearing it could only be achieved with a major battle and significant bloodshed. After UK, US, French and German special forces stepped up their efforts to hunt war criminals in 1997, Mladić went into hiding, eventually withdrawing to Serbia, where he was sheltered by the army. Brammertz said it was European solidarity in demanding Serbia hand over war crimes suspects on the ICTY list before Belgrade could even begin talking about financial aid and eventual EU membership, that eventually led to his arrest. He was found by Serbian police, living in squalor in May 2011, in a cousin’s village home near the border with Romania. The Mladić trial is the last major case to be heard by the tribunal, an ad hoc experiment in justice established by the UN security council, that is now winding down. In Bosnia, the verdict will be closely watched to see if Mladić is found guilty of genocide on another count, concerning mass killings elsewhere in Bosnia outside Srebrenica, particularly in Prijedor, where Bosnian Serb forces ran horrific prison camps and murdered thousands of Muslims and Croats. Karadžić was found guilty of crimes against humanity for mass murder in locations apart from Srebrenica, but not for genocide, which caused outrage among Bosniaks (Bosnian Muslims) who have been seeking acknowledgment from the tribunal that genocide was committed across the country. There was also fury that Karadžić was sentenced to 40 years rather than life imprisonment. Any sentence less than life for Mladić is likely to trigger protests from survivors and victims’ families. In Serbia and the Serb-run half of Bosnia, the ICTY trials have done little to change the minds among nationalists, who still see Mladić as a war hero and increasingly deny Serb responsibility for the mass murders of the Bosnian war."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2017/nov/21/electoral-commission-documents-reveal-more-details-on-vote-leave-donations","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-21T21:22:15Z","webTitle":"Electoral Commission documents reveal more details on Vote Leave donations","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/nov/21/electoral-commission-documents-reveal-more-details-on-vote-leave-donations","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/nov/21/electoral-commission-documents-reveal-more-details-on-vote-leave-donations","fields":{"headline":"Electoral Commission documents reveal more details on Vote Leave donations","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Fresh detail has emerged from the investigation into whether Vote Leave breached a £7m spending limit during the referendum campaign by donating £625,000 to a fashion student. The Electoral Commission has noted, in documents seen by the Guardian, that Darren Grimes, who was 23 at the time, was apparently able to coordinate large sums to be spent with a social media marketing firm before receiving official confirmation of the amounts Vote Leave were intending to give him. Vote Leave, Grimes and a third group, Veterans for Britain, are under investigation by the election regulator over referendum spending. It was not against election rules for Vote Leave to donate to Grimes or other third parties as long as the spending was not coordinated. The watchdog reopened its investigation after an early decision not to take action was due to be challenged in a judicial review next month. A document submitted by the commission as part of the review process reveals the relationship between Vote Leave and Grimes. It describes how Grimes told Vote Leave on 13 June last year he would like to use a donation offered at an unknown date the previous week on a digital campaign with Aggregate IQ. The referendum was held 10 days later. Vote Leave told Grimes on 14 June that it had decided to donate £400,000 to him, the day after Vote Leave itself received a £1m donation, and Grimes provided his AIQ reference number for the payment to be made directly. “It appears Mr Grimes was in a position to make arrangements with AIQ to provide services to him on 13 June ... before receiving confirmation of the amount to be donated,” the review said. A third donation of £180,000 six days later was agreed within 22 minutes, the Electoral Commission found. The donation “appears to be the exact amount that Mr Grimes needed to pay AIQ for services he had apparently already agreed with them, despite there being a gap of only 22 minutes between the offer and his asking for it to be paid to AIQ”. The Electoral Commission undertook the review amid proceedings launched by the Good Law Project, a crowd-funded legal campaign spearheaded by barrister Jolyon Maugham, to force a judicial review into the watchdog’s original decision not to proceed with investigations into Vote Leave and Grimes earlier this year. Maugham said the document was proof that the Electoral Commission’s original assessment had been inadequate. “The Electoral Commission claim there is new information,” Maugham told the Guardian. “But everything they rely on was already in the public domain – if you cared to look for it. I’m afraid the reality is that they just failed to do a proper investigation last time around.” Maugham said he was still likely to press ahead with the legal proceedings, although the Commission argues its decision to reopen the investigation renders them moot. Vote Leave’s legal limit as the designated leave campaign was £7m. It spent £6.8m according to official figures, spending 40% of that on services provided by Aggregate IQ. Grimes was permitted to spend up to £700,000 during the referendum campaign because he was an independent pro-leave campaigner. The review, authored by the watchdog’s head of regulation, Louise Edwards, also said that the emergence of a donation by Vote Leave to a second organisation, Veterans for Britain, was key to its renewed investigation. Veterans of Britain also spend money with Aggregate IQ, in its case £100,000. “The commission is now aware that there were two campaigners who apparently independently decided to use Vote Leave donations for AIQ services at or around the same time,” the review said, noting that Vote Leave also spent considerable sums with the small Canadian firm. The commission said it now had increased knowledge of the financial links between the different leave campaigners, as well as the significance of the digital campaign as “a key technique in the referendum amongst an overlapping group of campaigners ... and a use of a small number of providers, including AIQ, for that campaigning”. In a separate development, the commission also denied that it authorised the donations to Grimes or BeLeave, despite claims previously made by its campaign director, Dominic Cummings. Cummings, a former senior aide to Michael Gove, tweeted in September that the Electoral Commission had been informed about Vote Leave’s intention to donate its extra income that would have otherwise put it above the spending limit. In tweets to Maugham, Cummings wrote that the Electoral Commission “gave us written permission in advance for what we did. When they suddenly told us we could make donations we were so shocked we asked for written confirmation and got it.” Cummings described it as “extremely surprising” but said it would be “pointless them having an investigation/reporting us to cops cos we’d just hand over their own letter giving permission”. Cummings did not respond to requests for comment on Tuesday. Vote Leave sources added the campaign had asked the Electoral Commission what it could do with additional funds raised, which would put it over the £7m limit, and had been told it could donate the funds to external campaigns. The decision to give the money to Grimes, whose campaign had been focused on social media until then, was a calculated risk and the campaign would not have been able to object if he had spent it elsewhere, sources said. A spokesman for the Electoral Commission said: “We don’t ‘clear’ donations. Any donation made by Vote Leave was a decision for it. We had no correspondence with Vote Leave, Mr Grimes or BeLeave about Vote Leave’s decision to donate. “Consequently, as we had no correspondence with any of the organisations involved seeking or giving ‘clearance’ to these donations, we have nothing of that nature to release under any past or further FOI request.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"science/2017/nov/22/why-do-left-handers-excel-at-certain-elite-sports-but-not-others","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-22T05:30:11Z","webTitle":"Why do left-handers excel at certain elite sports but not others?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/nov/22/why-do-left-handers-excel-at-certain-elite-sports-but-not-others","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2017/nov/22/why-do-left-handers-excel-at-certain-elite-sports-but-not-others","fields":{"headline":"Why do left-handers excel at certain elite sports but not others?","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"From cricketer Wasim Akram to baseball pitcher Clayton Kershaw and table tennis star Ding Ning, the world of sport has no shortage of left-handed players. But now researchers say they’ve worked out why lefties are overrepresented in some elite sports but not others. The study, published in the journal Biology Letters, suggests that being left-handed is a particular advantage in interactive sports where time pressures are particularly severe, such as table tennis and cricket – possibly because their moves are less familiar to their mostly right-handed opponents, who do not have time to adjust. “The data suggests that the heavier the time constraints are operating in a sport, the larger the proportion of left-handers,” said the study’s author, Dr Florian Loffing of the University of Oldenburg in Germany. “We are less used to playing lefties, and [so] might end up in not developing the optimal strategies to compete with them.” While it is thought that about 10-13% of the population is left-handed, it has long been noted that in certain interactive sports there is often a surprisingly high proportion of left-handers playing at elite levels. Southpaw stars have seen significant success in sport, with big names including baseball aces Sandy Koufax and Randy Johnson, cricketers Garfield Sobers and Mitchell Johnson and table tennis’s Wang Nan and Kasumi Ishikawa. Previous research has punted a number of possible explanations, including that left-handers have more efficient connections between the two hemispheres of their brain. Others have suggested that lefties have the edge due to an element of surprise: since most players are right-handed, players will be more used to playing against right-handed partners. But the question remained: why did different sports show such different proportions of left-handed players? To probe the issue, Loffing collected the names and handedness of the top 100 or so players for badminton, squash, tennis, table tennis and – for men only – cricket and baseball, across six years between 2009 and 2014. Players were only counted once if they cropped up several times, and only bowlers were considered for the batting sports as batters do not directly apply time pressure to their opponents. The initial findings showed a significant difference in the proportion of left-handed players in different sports, with more than 30% of top baseball pitchers left-handed, compared to just under 13% of male badminton players and 8.7% of male squash players. For women, more than 19% of top table tennis players were lefties, compared to fewer than 8% of tennis and badminton players and 8.4% of squash players. Loffing looked at the time constraints present in each sport, analysing recordings or data collected by systems such as Hawk-Eye to measure, for example, the time between the ball hitting opponents’ rackets in a tennis rally, or the time between the release of a ball and it being hit by a bat. The results revealed that time pressure was highest for baseball, followed by cricket and table tennis, with other racket sports less fast-paced; squash, for example, had the lowest time pressure. The findings matched well to the trend in prevalence of left-handedness for the different activities. Loffing said that the results suggest simply being a rarity does not explain why left-handed players are more common in certain sports. For both sexes, it seems time is of the essence – possibly because high pressure makes it harder to anticipate what an opponent with an unfamiliar trait might do. He also notes that the study appears to support a long mooted idea that left-handedness was never lost in humans since it might have offered an edge in a punch-up. Loffing admits that other factors could be at play, including team strategies in some sports. But he advises right-handers to get as much exposure to playing lefties as possible, particularly under pressure, and suggests left-handers keen for a sneaky edge might want to take up fast-paced sports. Dr Scott Hardie of the University of Abertay, who was not involved in the research, said “Another way to look at this might be that it is not about rarity, but about the way that left-handers may be able to deal with fast-paced information and dealing with reactions.” Chris McManus, a professor of psychology and medical education at University College London who was acknowledged in the study, welcomed the research but said the left-handed advantage was probably confined to elite players. “What [it] is saying is yes there can be an advantage [for left-handers], but it is only there when the going gets really tough, and that is when the game gets faster and faster,” he said. “That means that the amateurs won’t show the effects very much – they are not really playing at that level.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2017/nov/21/letters-helen-john-obituary","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-21T17:08:32Z","webTitle":"Letters: Helen John obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/nov/21/letters-helen-john-obituary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2017/nov/21/letters-helen-john-obituary","fields":{"headline":"Letters: Helen John obituary","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Liz Brandow writes: I remember Helen John so vividly – her sense of humour and practical common sense were invaluable.

It’s problematic in a number of ways. Firstly, very little of it involves what most people would recognise as archaeology – digging up cultural material from the ground for study. Most of the material legacies of modern conflicts remain above ground and embedded in current society, necessitating a more anthropological, interdisciplinary approach. Secondly, the time periods under study are often within living memory, and often remain highly contentious within the affected regions. This means that modern conflict archaeology can be a political minefield – as well as an actual minefield. I’m currently working in Iraq down in Basra province at the two thousand-year-old city of Charax Spasinou, founded by Alexander the Great in 324 BC. Thirty years ago, however, the site was home to thousands of Iraqi soldiers. The Iran-Iraq war was dragging towards its end, both sides exhausted by the waves of offensives which had made 1987 the war’s bloodiest year. That spring the Siege of Basra had cost the lives of at least 60,000 Iranian and 20,000 Iraqi soldiers. Charax Spasinou wasn’t the only archaeological site re-occupied during the eight-year conflict. The border area between Iran and Iraq is phenomenally rich in archaeology, and archaeological sites often made the best defensive positions – rising ground into which earthworks could be dug. There’s hardly an ancient tell in eastern Iraq that doesn’t have the remains of an artillery emplacement or observation post dug into the top of it. At Charax Spasinou it was the ancient city’s still imposing ramparts which led to the site being incorporated into the Iraqi defensive lines north of Basra. The surviving mudbrick ramparts on the northern and eastern sides of the city (conveniently the directions from which Iranian attacks were most likely) stand to a height of up to eight metres above the flat alluvial plain and run for almost 3.5km. When the Iraqi army arrived, engineers refortified Charax Spasinou for modern warfare. At least 45 gaps were punched through the upper level of the ancient walls, with ramps of debris on the inner side so that tanks and artillery could be embedded in the ramparts. Along the top of the ancient walls, infantry positions were dug into the mudbrick and connected by trenches running behind them along the reverse slope. At least 199 of these dugouts are still visible on the top of the ramparts, each big enough for between two and four men. In some areas the remains of sandbags can still be seen emerging from the silt. The alterations to the ancient wall are the most visible reminder of the war at Charax Spasinou, but the greater impact on the archaeological site was from activity inside the walls, which damaged the city’s buildings just below the surface. In front of the walls and behind them the army used bulldozers to throw up berms, as well as digging auxiliary trenches and storage pits for equipment and ammunition. Hundreds of vehicles; tanks, APCs, fuel tankers and supply trucks, were stationed behind and around the walls of Charax. Each was protected by bulldozed banks of ancient archaeological deposits, usually heaped into a horseshoe shape to give protection on three sides and escape via the fourth. So far I’ve counted 212 such vehicle emplacements within the five square kilometres of the ancient city, not including the many more which are visible immediately outside the ramparts. As might be expected from such an intensive occupation of the landscape, a considerable amount of military material remains on the surface, although this is quickly disappearing in the harsh environment of southern Iraq. Metal fragments are everywhere, most are unidentifiable but there are large vehicle fragments in clusters where trucks and troop transports have been left to disintegrate. Corroded green copper bullets mix with the ancient Parthian and Sassanian coins. More personal items are sometimes in evidence. An occasional helmet, buttons, the zip from a coat, an Iraqi army sock; the small leavings of the men who fought here through some long, hard years. Ail Wehayib Abdul Abbas, who keeps an eye on the site for the antiquities authorities and is currently helping us with our geophysics, remembers the war at Charax Spasinou. He was conscripted into the army at the age of 18 and fought in the northern sector around Halabjah before being transferred to the southern front in the later stages of the war. The army engineers arrived in 1984, he tells me, and cut the ancient walls and dug their trenches. Hundreds of tanks and troops were based at the site and the local villagers were moved to nearby towns. The Iranians never quite reached Charax Spasinou. Ali Wehayib says they were stopped at Majnoon, now an important oil field a kilometre north of the site, during their closest offensive in 1987. Nevertheless, Charax Spasinou carries deep scars from the conflict, as does Ali Wehayib, who rolls up his trouser leg to show me. The recording of the Iran-Iraq war remains at this site and the surrounding area forms a part of the archaeological survey we are carrying out here, and one that I’m very happy be working on. In every respect, the military legacy at Charax Spasinou represents an important phase of occupation at the site, as well as being the material record of significant historical events which had a profound impact on Iraq and the wider region. When we consider military activity at archaeological sites, particularly those related to the recent and ongoing conflicts in Iraq and Syria, they are too often bewailed purely as damage to the archaeological record. While the use of archaeological sites as military positions is an unfortunate aspect of war, it’s important to remember that these activities are also the record of important historical and political events in a landscape which continues to be shaped by human occupation. The Charax Spasinou project is supported by the British Council’s Cultural protection fund, which is set up in partnership with the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, and by the Iraqi State Board of Antiquities and Heritage."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/nov/21/lost-in-the-language-of-lingerie","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-21T18:26:23Z","webTitle":"Lost in the language of lingerie | Brief letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/nov/21/lost-in-the-language-of-lingerie","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/nov/21/lost-in-the-language-of-lingerie","fields":{"headline":"Lost in the language of lingerie","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"I was at the dress rehearsal of Marnie at the ENO which was received rapturously by the audience.

Tianno walks in calmly and confidently, then sits down. Daisy is less sure – she shuffles in, a bit frozen up, sits down as far from Tianno as possible, but then feels the need to say something. “Horrible weather out there,” she says. (These people are English ones.) Brooke, too, is a little bit shy. She plays with her hair. Miylah is very confident. “I do not like girls,” she announces and sits next to Tianno, who isn’t one. And Jack struts in like a rockstar, swinging his arms and checking out the people in there already, before flopping nonchalantly into a chair. Not I’m A Celeb (it’s a room with chairs, remember, not a fake clearing with papier mache rocks in the jungle), but The Secret Life of 5 Year Olds (Channel 4). It’s an interesting age, says Dr Laverne Antrobus, one of the psychologist-commentator-spies: “They are going through a phase of experimentation, trying on different identities, to see which one fits.” I think Jack is trying on the identity of the Fonz, and has decided it’s a perfect fit. Jack does want to be seen as the lad, but he’s more complex than that, his dad explains. We see this later, with a temptation experiment (the kids are left with dispensers of ice-cream and hundreds and thousands, to see who can’t resist the immediate reward and who sees greater value in restraint). Jack’s group dives in immediately, it’s a big fat ice-cream free-for-all, hundreds and thousands are flying all over the place. But Jack’s not joining in. He’s worried about getting into trouble. Later, though, he remembers things differently. “I just helped myself without asking,” he brags. That itself is a sign of some sophistication, explains the other psychologist-commentator-spy, Dr Sam Wass. “Lying to protect a rebellious self-image is something we don’t see much at this age,” he explains. God, it looks complicated, trying to figure out who you are. I think I’m still doing it; I know I still lie to protect a rebellious self-image. Oh, and shy Brooke and shy Daisy? Not shy at all, it transpires. Brooke is soon trying to get a kiss off Tianno (unsuccessfully, but he has to pretty much run away to avoid it). And shy Daisy? Not just pretty much Miss Assertive 2017, but also an engineering genius and a great manager of people. I take it all back. The way a person enters a room says nothing at all about them – it might even say the opposite, if you see what I mean (though I suppose that says something too). It’s endlessly fascinating though. And as it happens, I’ve got a five-year-old Jack at home, so I’m watching this with extra interest – looking for recognition and reference points, similarities and differences, as well as maybe hoping to glean some idea of his world between 8.45am and 3.15pm, about which he’s not forthcoming. TV Jack’s detailed knowledge of south London bus routes is very familiar – we had the same with the underground, though now we’ve moved on to the cultivation of vegetables, oddly. And actually I’m watching with my Jack – an extra pair of eyes, as well as extra interest. We’re about average in the general knowledge quiz; we know who lives at 10 Downing Street and how many minutes there are in an hour; but we’re similarly wrong about the population of the UK (we say 1,000) and on the function of the belly button (we say it’s for tickling, TV Jack says it’s to make you sit on the toilet). The best contribution comes from Yash, who accuses the other team of being “sore winners”. My Jack’s principal interest is in the facilities at The Secret Life of 5 Year Olds school, especially the treehouse. And, by the way, when am I going to make him a treehouse? Hmmm. Hey, maybe we could enroll him in the TSLOFYO – it looks brilliant. Not just the treehouse, but everything – class size, teacher-to-student ratio, lovely teachers Sharon and Simon, fun activities, a bit of science. It must take place in the holidays, right, so as not to interfere with school? I’m thinking (presumably free) school holiday childcare, with the added bonus that you find out something about who your child is … Yeah, but do you want millions of others finding out too? I’ll discuss it with his mother, but I suspect we’re not quite ready to put ours on TV. We’re very grateful to all these other people who were, though. Your children are amazing – hilarious, terrifying, generous, kind, mean, manipulative, adorable, dishonest, and wise. For which they make great television.

But that’s it","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Kezia Dugdale, the former leader of Scottish Labour, has jetted off to the Australian bush to join Ant and Dec and the cast of 12 in this year’s I’m a Celebrity. It would be fair to say her decision has split the entire country, and particularly Scottish Labour. Dugdale’s announcement came on the eve of the naming of the party’s new leader, Richard Leonard. The Dugdale affair overshadowed his first meeting with MSPs this afternoon where it was accepted she should not after all be suspended from the party, thereby agreeing with a call Jeremy Corbyn had already made. The political row since the news broke on Friday has followed a familiar path – a bilious piece in the Scottish Daily Mail which is now mysteriously hard to access, a well-targeted tease from Nicola Sturgeon, tweeting her support for #teamkez, and a general atmosphere of outrage over an MSP taking well-paid time out from her day job. Dugdale was reportedly told by the party not to go, but went anyway, joining a roll of parliamentarians from Nadine Dorries to Penny Mordaunt who have tried reality TV as a career accelerant, with, it is only fair to say, mixed results. Dugdale herself has not yet landed in the jungle, where the other contestants – not including many household names – are already breakfasting on bugs, weeping silently on camera etc etc. My money is on Stanley Johnson, father of Boris, who at some point will reveal that at his prep school funnel-web spiders were a delicacy and the washing facilities in the bush are a definite improvement. Everyone who goes on a show like I’m a Celebrity takes a particular risk that is now so familiar from repeated experience it can only trigger a cacophany of mental warning klaxons, however limited a contestant’s perception of their place in the world. Dugdale cannot be surprised to discover that there is simply no interpretation of her decision that excludes her desire to a) earn a quick buck and b) feature in tabloid headlines. The lingering impression that Scottish Labour is a nest of vipers from which eight minutes in the panic pit with 40 pythons is a welcome break could reasonably described as unhelpful. The interesting question is whether she can get something other than the pay cheque out of the exposure. Some of her political predecessors – Nadine Dorries Robert Kilroy-Silk and perhaps, sadly, least forgettably, George Galloway – merely confirmed pre-existing prejudices relating to narcissism, connectedness with the real world and unsuitability for public life, weaknesses that were swiftly identified by the voting public. But Ed Balls managed to use Strictly Come Dancing to pull off a striking rehabilitation from a political career that had ended in ignominy when he lost his seat in 2015. On the other hand, Balls is not a man to be held back, least of all by self-doubt, and like Michael Portillo 20 years ago, he pivoted from defeat to recovery with a generous and elegant concession speech. Strictly worked for Balls because he took it seriously but kept it in proportion. This is a handy life skill for anyone, but it is invaluable for politicians. But it also worked because it makes proper, recognisable and learnable demands of the contestants. No one can take the intentional nastiness of I’m a Celebrity, which reflects some of the deliberate humiliation that is at the heart of bullying, and make something better of it. The most contestants can hope for is to cling stoically to dignity and thus reveal a more admirable side of their character than the bit they exposed by agreeing to take part in the first place. Strictly, on the other hand, teams the amateur with the professional and challenges them to aspire to the professional’s expertise. That requires a freakish combination of steeliness of purpose (trying to reach stratospheric skill levels) with an apparent lack of inhibition and even a streak of self-parody. What to make, then of Mordaunt, the new international development secretary who fought her way out of political invisibility three years ago to take part in Splash!, a diving contest on ITV. Anyone reckless enough to try a back dive from a high board at any time, let alone on television, should probably be banned from any position of responsibility for ever. Unusually, while name recognition in politics is usually the result of some epic political cock-up, Mordaunt’s advantage was that no one knew who she was when she started. Now she is in the cabinet there are an unusual number of pictures of her in a swimsuit, which in some quarters is preferable to knowing anything more of her politics except that she is a Brexiter. Fighting back the thought that reality TV contests could catch on as an alternative to primaries or any other system of trying to assess parliamentary candidates, I can only say it might be wise to see how Mordaunt works out in her new job before advocating TV contests involving extreme hazard as anything other than a nice little earner."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"music/2017/nov/21/taylor-swift-reputation-biggest-selling-us-album-2017-in-one-week","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-21T18:49:09Z","webTitle":"Taylor Swift scores biggest selling US album of 2017 in one week","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/nov/21/taylor-swift-reputation-biggest-selling-us-album-2017-in-one-week","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2017/nov/21/taylor-swift-reputation-biggest-selling-us-album-2017-in-one-week","fields":{"headline":"Taylor Swift scores biggest selling US album of 2017 in one week","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Taylor Swift’s Reputation has become the biggest-selling album of the year in the US in a single week, with 1.23m sales. That total comfortably beats the 931,000 copies of ÷ sold by Ed Sheeran since he released it in early March. Swift has kept all but four songs from Reputation off streaming services such as Spotify and Apple Music, meaning that fans need to pay to download the album or buy it on CD if they want to hear it. She also, somewhat controversially, created a promotion where fans who bought multiple copies of the album increased their chances of getting tickets to her upcoming tour, thus further driving sales. Nielsen, which collates album sales data in the US, said that Reputation sold more copies than the rest of the top 200 albums put together. Swift’s previous three albums have all sold more than a million copies in the US in their first week– a feat increasingly difficult to achieve as the popularity of downloads and CDs continues to wane. Her label Big Machine reported that a further 905,000 copies were sold worldwide, 84,000 of which were in the UK, which gives it the sixth-largest first week UK sales of the year, behind albums by Sam Smith, Liam Gallagher, Take That, Rag’N’Bone Man and Swift’s friend Ed Sheeran, who sold 671,000 copies of ÷ in the first week of its release. Swift’s impressive US total is still some way off the all-time first week sales record set by Adele in 2015, when her album 25 sold 3.37m copies in the US in its opening week. Forbes, meanwhile, has estimated that Swift is the third highest-earning female musician in 2017, dropping from the top spot last year when her earnings were driven by tour revenues from her previous album, 1989. She was estimated to have earned $44m (£33m) this year, below Beyoncé, whose Formation world tour helped generate earnings of $105m (£79m), and Adele, who earned $69m (£52m)."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/nov/21/counting-down-a-meaningful-advent","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-21T18:29:18Z","webTitle":"Counting down a meaningful advent | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/nov/21/counting-down-a-meaningful-advent","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/nov/21/counting-down-a-meaningful-advent","fields":{"headline":"Counting down a meaningful advent","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"I share Anne Abbott’s irritation (Letters, 17 November) at the depressing and materialistic selection of advent calendars reviewed in G2 (16 November).

As the UK’s historic decision to quit the EU plays out, it doesn’t take much for the softly spoken 78-year-old and five-times rally-driving champion to cast his mind back to the days when customs posts and army checkpoints brought life in the picturesque village of Pettigo to a halt. “We had about half a dozen incendiary bombs before the big one,” he says, tilting his chin to the other classic-cars garage across the road, now run by his son. “That blew the garage right into the river.” Pettigo is unique in Ireland as it is the only village divided by the border after Ireland gained independence from Britain in 1922. The river that runs beneath his workshop window places Johnston’s Protestant family in Northern Ireland and his largely Catholic neighbours on the other side of the 1820s cut-stone bridge in the republic of Ireland. This village has seen more than its fair share of pain. Just to be associated with Britain during the Troubles of the late 60s to 90s was to be a target. “One day, a couple of IRA men came to the garage. I was held at gunpoint. They walked me up the road and held me at the customs post,” he says, pointing to the stone wall outside his garage. “It wasn’t because I was a Protestant, it was because I was in the UDR [the part-time Ulster Defence Regiment, which supported the British army]. They fired at me. It was a bad shot and the bullet went under my arm and hit my apprentice. I skedaddled up the road and they fired after me. It was very frightening, but I got to my house and came back and got a weapon and fired a few shots back,” says Johnston. That is just how it was back then. His attackers didn’t even wear balaclavas. “But they weren’t locals. I don’t think anyone was ever apprehended,” he says. There were 28 “incidents” in this village, including several fatalities. One man was shot by the SAS; another died of his injuries in an incident the same day Johnston was attacked. A neighbour of Johnston’s was gunned down by the IRA as he tended his cattle. Thanks to the arrival of the single market in 1993 and the Good Friday agreement in 1998, the border in Pettigo is now invisible, apart from a sign advising that speed limits switch from miles to kilometres at the old yellow-and-green customs shed on the Donegal side of the bridge. Cross-border trade has flourished since peace and, although it is not on a main border road, the village is blighted by the rumble of trucks carrying everything from freshly cut timber to Magners cider across the interstate bridge. “We definitely don’t want a hard border here as we had one before, but if we do get one, there’s going to be hassle and I’d say trouble as well,” says Johnston. Brexit has jolted memories and generated new anxieties along the 310-mile border from Donegal to Louth and what locals fear most is that old divisions and enmities will be stoked. It is estimated that one million people live in the border communities, and they are already feeling the impact. “What you don’t see here is the silent hurt – everyone here was affected,” says Natasha McGrath, community development officer at the Termon Complex, a cross-border sports and community hall across the river. The EU spent €8.3m (£7.4m) on the centre, the second-biggest single beneficiary of peace programme funds after the Peace bridge in Derry. McGrath fears that the EU funds released after the Good Friday agreement, which have underpinned peace, are now at risk. “We have spent the last two decades building bonds, socially, culturally, economically. The two states are bound together and now they are going to be cut apart,” she says. It is a fear that is felt throughout the shops and businesses of Pettigo. “You always have to worry when you divide a community,” says Martin Eves, who runs Enviro Grind, a successful compost and wood processing plant, just a few miles down the road on the Donegal side. “Building bridges takes years and, in my opinion, we are doing great. It’s not perfect, but to introduce division now is a complete retrograde step. It is not good to segregate people.” His business will be affected, in ways he cannot predict. He is not sure his contracts with councils in Northern Ireland will be left intact after Brexit – EU rules may mean that every load of compost from over the border in Fermanagh must be declared. “It’s the Berlin Wall approaching us here,” he says, adding that those sitting on green leather seats in Westminster “don’t care about Northern Ireland”. With 18 backroads criss-crossing the Pettigo hinterland, he predicts smuggling will flourish post-Brexit, another worry for businesses. “I can guarantee you that will happen within a half-hour of the Brexit agreement being signed,” says Eves. “There are plenty of rogues and cowboys out there only too happy to get going.” Petrol, cigarettes and heating fuel were the mainstays during the Troubles, with some industrial-scale border operations linked to the IRA in south Armargh’s “bandit country”. The head of those operations, Thomas “Slab” Murphy, allegedly amassed a fortune through fuel laundering and smuggling, estimated by BBC’s Underworld Rich List at between £35m and £40m in 2004. Patrolling the border was notoriously difficult and suggestions of cameras on every road to monitor movements of goods and people after Brexit seems unworkable. In the old days, the back roads were spiked, blocked or blown up by the British army to stop smuggling or paramilitary activity. “I remember sometimes there would be a massive crater in the road when we’d go see my grandad, because the army would have blown it up,” says Kevin Leonard, 34, a vet who works in Enniskillen and who certifies animals for cross-border slaughter on a daily basis. “It would mean a 10-mile diversion. Sometimes we’d just go across the river on the tractor.” The Irish government has identified 11 “national” routes (not including Pettigo) involving the frontier, one crossing the border twice and the N54 crossing three times. The tax authorities in Dublin have suggested that eight of these could have customs stations. But there at least 200 more crossings to consider. Ray O’Leary, assistant secretary in Ireland’s department of transport, told a conference in Dublin this week: “There are twice as many crossing points [into the EU] as from the Arctic to the Black Sea. That’s an extraordinary thing to think about – Donegal to Louth has more crossings than the line from the north of Europe to the south of Europe.” The issue with the border created by the partition of Ireland in 1922 is that it is so random, zig-zagging its way around the six counties in an unruly fashion. “The territorial divisions can be traced back to old clan loyalties. The system of 32 counties, established by the British administration in Dublin, was in position in the 17th century and has not changed since,” says James Anderson, professor of political geography at Queen’s University Belfast. He says the boundaries of counties are likely to have followed old Gaelic chieftains’ territories and maybe turf-cutting rights, explaining why places such as Rosslea and Clonooney are surrounded on three sides by a foreign state. The fears now being expressed in Pettigo are set against a backdrop of tense politicking over the border, which has escalated in the last fortnight. Ireland and the rest of the EU maintain that the only way to avoid a hard border is for Northern Ireland to stay in the customs union and single market, even if the UK pulls out. Arlene Foster, leader of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), which is propping up the Conservative government, is adamant Northern Ireland must quit the customs union and this week accused Brussels and Dublin of trying to “blackmail” Brexit negotiators. For the pro-Brexit media, it is good knockabout material for pungent anti-EU editorials, with the Sun labelling the taoiseach a “Brexit buffoon” who should “keep his gob shut”. For people on the border, the war of words simply underlines how voiceless their communities feel. “We’re forgotten as it is, here in Pettigo,” says McGrath. “I think [a hard border] will socially exclude us. Theresa May hasn’t a notion. I don’t know if they give a crap about us on the border, and that’s my polite way of putting it.” Some 60 miles away, in Armagh, the Centre of Cross Border Studies is holding a conference raising just these worries. Of major concern to its speakers is the continued stability of the Good Friday agreement, which spawned a web of cross-border initiatives on everything from health to fisheries, sport to security. The EU spent the summer mapping out those activities and has now documented 142 areas touched by EU law, now in jeopardy, including cross-border health schemes. “People who have worked in cross-border co-operation say it is a game-changer,” says Pamela Arthurs, chief executive of the East Border Region, a cross-border community initiative. “The potential for Brexit to go back to the bad old days, when ambulances were stopped at the border and patients taken out of one ambulance and put in another, is there,” she tells delegates. It is through the work of people such as Arthurs, who have devoted their lives to improving life on the border, that cancer patients in Donegal (in the Republic) can now get treatment in Derry (in Northern Ireland), while children in “the north” can access cardio services in Dublin. “Brexit is not just the topic for the dinner table here. It is real life, and here, in the east of Northern Ireland, it looks like it’s going to affect us in a bad way,” Arthurs says. The Irish Central Border Area Network surveyed bordered communities for a report submitted to the EU last week. “What people are saying is that any route to [a hard] border is a route to the past that people are afraid of,” says its chief executive, Shane Campbell. “Anything that goes back is seen as a failure.” One of the reasons border people in the north, who voted overwhelmingly to remain in the EU, feel unheard is the fact they are not represented in either regional or national government. For the past year there has been no government in Northern Ireland, and Sinn Féin, which won every border constituency in the 2017 general election, does not take up its seats in Westminster. “In my view, people in Antrim [an area loyal to the union of Britain and Northern Ireland] couldn’t care less about the border, but they will find themselves affected,” says Anderson. “Unionists are fond of saying most of our trade is not with the south but with Britain to the east, but it is quite possible that milk from cows in Ballymoney or Coleraine goes south.” Agrifood is an all-island single market – a third of the milk from cows in Northern Ireland goes south for production into butter, cheese and infant formula. Many of the big household names have cross-border operations, including Guinness and Baileys Irish cream. According to the book Brexit and Ireland, by RTE broadcaster Tony Connelly, Baileys’ parent company, Diageo, buys 275m litres of milk from 40,000 dairy cows on 1,500 accredited farms north and south of the border. It is a result of this barrier-free trade that large-animal vet Kevin Leonard has carved a livelihood doing the EU paperwork on farms in county Fermanagh. “This morning, I looked at 298 lambs that were going to be slaughtered in county Kildare tomorrow,” he says. “I checked they were healthy, checked the paperwork, that they were all tagged and they were fit to travel.” He is concerned that Brexit will destroy the farms in the area. “People are eating less lamb; they want food that cooks quickly, ready meals. Almost half the lambs reared in the north of Ireland, around 300,000 a year, go to an abattoir just outside Dublin because there is no capacity in Northern Ireland. About 70% of those go to France,” he says. As he fans out 11 pages documenting the animals’ origin, age, breed and other details, such as confirmation the truck is washed out with an officially approved disinfectant beforehand, he explains that he is a small farmer himself. He doesn’t understand why any farmers voted for Brexit – 87% of their income comes from EU subsidies and they will be wiped out if that money is not replaced. Then there is the issue of farm inspections – some straddle the border, with stories of farms with “their back door in the north and the front door in the south”. One of the partners in his practice is from the border town of Belcoo, 20 minutes away, and needs to cross the frontier “three or four times a day just to get to work”. Belcoo, which runs into another village, Blacklion, on the south of the border, was on one of the old “approved roads” for freight, as was Rosslea further east, where army watchtowers practically cut off the town before the single market in 1993. Gerry Scott, 59, a builders’ merchant on Rosslea’s high street, sketches out the border on a pad in his back office. His shop is in “the north”, but the woodland visible from his office window is “the south”, as is the land behind him and to the right. “We are surrounded, like an island. I have customers from all over. I hope communities here won’t be forgotten. We employ eight people and a couple of people part-time. Now, we can trade for 360 degrees; if there’s a hard border we can only do 180 degrees,” he says. Half an hour away in the Republic, peace has brought bustling business in the agrifood sector, with Monaghan to the south now the mushroom capital, from which millions of punnets are transported daily to supermarkets across Britain. A few miles north of the border in Ballygawley, Elaine Shaw is surveilling a £25m plant under construction that will produce compost made up of straw and poultry droppings. She supplies specialist mushroom-growing medium for 25 growers on both sides of the border, and fears that Brexit will add prohibitive costs to the business. “Our worry is that the government could let this sector just dwindle away, and once that has gone, you’ll never get it back,” she says. “We are stronger together. We just worry that the DUP want Brexit and won’t yield anything on the customs union and single market.” The resilience of the border communities is a point of pride here. “Local people just learn to adapt; they are different because their life is all about adapting,” says David Parkes, a 25-year-old jockey, who is back from the UK to recuperate from an injury, in Middletown, a border crossroads on the northern side between Monaghan and Armagh. One of the 11 national roads crossing the border passes through here, and the derelict remains of the customs checkpoint stands alongside Parkes’s family farm. Nowadays, Middletown is little more than a few houses, a garage and a money-changing cabin, whose businesses wax and wane according to the currency exchange rates. He notes that Monaghan, 10 miles away, is booming with dairy, mushroom and chicken farms, while noting that “it is sad” that Armagh, half an hour away, “is a bit hit and miss”. “People on the border learn to sell and buy anything,” he says. “We could sell sand to the sheikhs. A lot of people are money-driven around here.” A Protestant, he explains that he has spent his life as an “in-betweener”, derided in a segregated school because he had Catholic friends. He remembers the British army helicopters landing in his neighbours’ fields, the stories of shootings at the customs house, and the smuggling. He supports the suggestion that the new border could run down the Irish Sea, placing border and passport controls at airports and docks where there is room for vehicle inspections, and time for passport checks. “Or they could just do it on the other side, in England. That way you’d take away the power from the DUP. What could they complain about then?” he says. Peace has been welcome, and now neither Parkes nor the rest of those living by the border know what is around the corner. “Border people, we are in a minority,” he says. “Someone is going to decide our lives at a stroke of a pen. We don’t have a voice in this.” This article was amended on 29 November 2017.

History lesson Kazan considers itself Russia’s “sporting capital” and the Kazan Arena is one of an impressive array of stylish, modern – and expensive – sporting facilities to have sprung up there in recent years. It was designed by Populous, the architects behind Wembley and the Emirates, and was built in time for the 2013 Summer Universiade, where it hosted football and athletics. As a sleek, modern facility it will serve the World Cup well – even if it will, amazingly, be one of the tournament’s oldest stadiums. Star attraction Anyone who gets lost en route should just look for the high-definition screen – the world’s biggest outdoor one, organisers proudly proclaim – on the side of the stadium. It covers 4,030 square metres and will probably bear both competing nations’ flags on a given matchday. Those arriving from the air may want to appreciate the waterlily-themed roof of this riverside stadium. Any hitches? Nothing major. The Confederations Cup was a successful dry run and the Russia v Iran friendly went off without any problems in October. Access could be better though: the stadium lies to the north-east of the city centre, away from the metro, and taxis were sometimes discouraged from operating in its vicinity during last summer’s tournament. Legacy Rubin Kazan, the Russian Premier League side, moved to the Kazan Arena from the Communist-era Central Stadium – which is situated near the city centre and well worth visiting – in 2014 and will continue to be based there. In common with most of next summer’s stadiums there are plenty of seats to go round for club games: Kazan’s average attendance in the recently-completed season was 9,706. In order to pay off the cost of a facility that ended up costing nearly three times more than the initially mooted $155m there will be an emphasis on hosting cultural and commercial events too – and if Kazan’s long-term ambitions bear fruit it could even host Olympic events one day. Ekaterinburg Arena Capacity: 35,696 Completed: March 2018 (upgrade of stadium originally built in 1957) Cost: $215m Games hosted at Russia 2018: Egypt v Uruguay, 15 June; France v Peru, 21 June; Japan v Senegal, 24 June; Mexico v Sweden, 27 June. History lesson As with the Luzhniki some 1,000 miles away, the old Central Stadium in Ekaterinburg has been renovated for next summer’s competition. It is a year younger than the national stadium, dating back to 1957, and is the long-term home of Soviet league stalwarts Uralmash – these days known as FC Ural. Full international football has yet to take place here although Russia’s under-21s have passed through three times. The ground’s biggest past dalliance with global significance came in 1959, when it held the World Allround Speed Skating Championships. Star attraction The new stadium soars high above the vestiges of its predecessor but does, at least, retain the old facade – which, like at the Luzhniki, is quite a work of art. But the biggest point of interest may be the temporary stands behind each goal that sit outside the main stadium structure. Such a bizarre sight triggered widespread media interest, and some ridicule, in October. Any hitches? It took some time to settle on a final design, mainly in order to preserve the existing facade, so construction started fairly late. The solution that has been settled upon is certainly eccentric, but Fifa insists the temporary stands were the most cost-effective and practical way to ensure the required 35,000 capacity. Just make sure you bring your binoculars. Legacy Those temporary stands will be taken down and capacity reduced to manageable 23,000 – which seems more than ideal for FC Ural, who will play here after the World Cup and flirted with relegation from Russia’s top flight last season. Fisht Stadium Capacity: 47,659 Completed: December 2013 Cost: $519m Games hosted at Russia 2018: Portugal v Spain, 15 June; Belgium v Panama, 18 June; Germany v Sweden, 23 June; Australia v Peru, 26 June; Round of 16, 30 June; Quarter-final, 7 July. History lesson This venue is no stranger to big events, having been conceived and delivered for the 2014 Winter Olympics and Paralympics. When it hosts the World Cup it will become the second stadium – along with Turin’s Stadio Olimpico – to have held both events. Four Confederations Cup games were held here and Russia drew 3-3 with Belgium in a friendly eight months ago. Star attraction The view beyond the stadium’s open north end, taking in the Krasnaya Polyana mountains, will be something to behold, while the Black Sea is visible to the south. It is a spectacular location and the sweeping roofs of its two main stands are certainly dramatic. Any hitches? Nothing significant where the World Cup is concerned, although it needed some expensive reconfigurations – notably the removal of its roof – to comply with Fifa regulations. The biggest issue may be its location: it is actually in Adler, around 18 miles from the centre of Sochi, although supporters coped during a successful run at the Confederations Cup and it is well placed for the airport. Legacy It would have been a touch embarrassing if Sochi, currently without a functioning professional club, had no team to play in its own venue after the World Cup. How fortunate, then, that Dinamo St Petersburg – a moderate second-tier outfit – have decided that the best way to escape Zenit’s shadow is to move 1,500 miles and start afresh there next season. Crowds may still be low, though, and the annual maintenance cost of the stadium could reach $8m so international games and training camps will be among the events relied upon to fill the void. Its capacity will be reduced when the tournament is over, although reports vary as to by how much. Kaliningrad Stadium Capacity: 35,212 Completed: March 2018 Cost: $300m Games hosted at Russia 2018: Croatia v Nigeria, 16 June; Serbia v Switzerland, 22 June; Spain v Morocco, 25 June; England v Belgium, 28 June. History lesson This brand new facility will provide the Russian exclave, squeezed in between Poland and Lithuania, with an impressive stadium whose concept was originally based on the Allianz Arena. It is situated on Oktyabrsky Island, to the east of the city centre – a picturesque setting that had effectively been a wilderness for many years until this project began. Star attraction The location is probably Kaliningrad Stadium’s most seductive factor. Design-wise, the stadium is fairly functional even if it is easy enough on the eye. Any hitches? Oktyabrsky Island has proved a difficult location, largely because wetland grass does not make the soundest foundation for major structures. The original, more ambitious, design for the stadium included a bigger capacity and a retractable roof: financial concerns ended up scuppering that, as did the fact that the company which drew up the plans went bankrupt four years ago. It all meant that ground was not broken on the revised, simplified project until September 2015 but Kaliningrad is ready for the World Cup. Legacy The capacity will be cut to around 25,000 after the World Cup and Baltika Kaliningrad, the local side, will play here. It risks being another venue that is rarely filled: the club have not played in the Russian top flight for two decades and typical crowds at their current Baltika Stadium home number in the low thousands. They did sell out both the stadium’s pre-tournament test matches, though, while concerts and other events are also expected to take place here. Beyond sport, Oktyabrsky Island and its surrounds will benefit from a new residential development as well as parks and riverside embankments. Spartak Stadium Capacity: 45,360 Completed: September 2014 Cost: $430m Games hosted at Russia 2018: Argentina v Iceland, 16 June; Poland v Senegal, 19 June; Belgium v Tunisia, 23 June; Brazil v Serbia, 27 June; Round of 16, 3 July. History lesson The Otkrytiye Arena was conceived as a home for Spartak Moscow – who had never really had a home to call their own despite their status as one of Russia’s leading clubs. A long-term project to change that finally gathered speed in the mid-2000s, with ground broken in July 2007. It proved something of a false dawn, with a number of delays and quibbles about the design putting the project on ice, but by September 2014 Spartak at last had a permanent abode, the Russian national team had another occasional venue – and the World Cup had a stadium that should be popular among supporters. Star attraction The statue of the Thracian gladiator Spartacus, situated in front of the stadium, will be the most popular photo opportunity for visitors here – while the outer shell of the ground, usually strikingly patterned in Spartak’s red and white, can take on the colours of the Russian flag. But the arena itself is enjoyable to spend time in – it was purpose-built for club football and feels that way. The stands are close to the pitch and it is easy to generate an atmosphere, as around 15,000 Chile fans showed to fine effect at the Confederations Cup. Any hitches? Nothing significant where World Cup preparations are concerned, although the stadium was originally due to be completed before Russia’s hosting was even announced. It proved a fun, lively venue last summer; a minor gripe would be that, although the stadium has its own metro station and is easy enough to access in around half an hour from the city centre, those looking to get out quickly afterwards may find congestion scuppers their best-laid plans. Legacy Spartak will continue playing here, and the national team will doubtless make further appearances. Several major rock concerts have taken place inside the stadium, a trend that will doubtless continue. A new residential development is also planned for an area that, although not unfavourably situated, is somewhat barren. Luzhniki Stadium Capacity: 80,000 Completed: June 2017 Cost: $400m Games hosted at Russia 2018: Russia v Saudi Arabia, 14 June; Germany v Mexico, 17 June; Portugal v Morocco, 20 June; Denmark v France, 26 June; Round of 16, 1 July; Semi-final, 11 July; Final, 15 July. History lesson The grand dame of Russia’s stadiums may not need too much introduction. She has been around since 1956 and has a long, eventful history that includes hosting the 1980 Olympics, the 1999 Uefa Cup final, the 2008 Champions League final between Manchester United and Chelsea, and the 2013 World Athletics Championships. In Communist times it was known as the Central Lenin Stadium and was the most important ground in the USSR. It has hosted more than 3,000 games at club and international level – including November’s friendly between Russia and Argentina, which was its official reopening after an extensive renovation before the World Cup. Star attraction This is one of those stadiums whose history you can smell as soon as you get within a few hundred yards. Its classic Soviet facade has been preserved and anyone attending a game will almost certainly walk past the huge statue of Lenin that guards the front entrance. From the concourses there are fine views over the city, and especially the spectacular Moscow State University building. The modernisation has been carried out tastefully: it is a stadium fit for a World Cup final. Any hitches? Nothing major, although a small fire in October 2015 caused brief alarm. The renovated ground was delivered on time and the Russia v Argentina match was – along with a subsequent fixture against Brazil – a successful dry run for this summer. There were long queues to access the transport system after the first game, though: a useful tip could be to dart south-east and head out to Vorobyovy Gory station rather than joining the hordes looking to access the Luzhniki or Sportivnaya stations to the north. Legacy Luzhniki’s place in the future of Russian sport is perfectly secure. It will be the national team’s home, even though they will doubtless make use of the other major facilities that have sprung up for this tournament, and will continue to host big domestic games too. Further European finals are surely a possibility. Nizhny Novgorod Stadium Capacity: 44,899 Completed: February 2018 Cost: $290m Games hosted at Russia 2018: Sweden v South Korea, 18 June; Argentina v Croatia, 21 June; England v Panama, 24 June; Switzerland v Costa Rica, 27 June; Round of 16, 1 July; Quarter-final, 6 July. History lesson Ground was broken on this new stadium in March 2015. It is situated in Strelka, a western district of Nizhny Novgorod, and is one of several World Cup stadiums to be placed attractively by a river – or two, in this case, at the confluence of the Volga and the Oka. Work on the project finished during the winter and the curtain was raised with a match between local side Olimpiyets and Zenit St Petersburg’s second string on 17 April. Star attraction The design promises to be one of the World Cup’s most striking, with slim pillars supporting from the outside and surrounding a semi-transparent facade. But the view over the 500-year-old Nizhny Novgorod Kremlin is the real selling point and the sense of place should be strong. Any hitches? Plumes of black smoke were seen rising from the site last October after a fire broke out. It looked more serious than it was, thankfully, and appears to have had little impact on either the delivery or those working on the project. This aside, the process has been relatively smooth. Legacy Olimpiyets will play their games here and the second-tier club, not remotely a big fish, will hope the surge in interest seen during the stadium’s three warm-up fixtures continues. In May, 42,000 packed in for a match against Luch-Energiya Vladivostok, a barely believable figure for that level. The novelty will surely wear off although other sports may well be played inside the arena, too. Rostov Arena Capacity: 45,145 Completed: December 2017 Cost: $330m Games hosted at Russia 2018: Brazil v Switzerland, 17 June; Uruguay v Saudi Arabia, 20 June; South Korea v Mexico, 23 June; Iceland v Croatia, 26 June; Round of 16, 2 July. History lesson Situated on the banks of the River Don, this is another brand new facility and one that – like several of its peers – has suffered a few false starts. Eventually construction began towards the end of 2014 and the finishing touches were just about done by Christmas last year, although this was seven months after the originally mooted completion date. Star attraction Rostov Arena will be notable for its roof – which imitates the meanderings of the river. There are attractive views over that and the south-west Russian city. Any hitches? In common with some of the other stadiums, the plans for Rostov Arena were downsized after original projections were judged to have overreached. The initial plan was a joy to behold – a modern, teardrop-shaped venue that promised to be unique. Eventually spiralling costs put paid to that; the pared-down version is fine but will have little to really distinguish it from the rest. Despite these conscientious efforts to save money, reports suggest the end product cost only 15% less than had been planned for its more lavish predecessor. Legacy FC Rostov, who were known as the “Russian Leicester” during their surprise title push three seasons ago, will move in. The capacity will be reduced by around 5,000. The stadium will be the focal point for a wider redevelopment of the Don’s left bank – with shops, restaurants and business premises planned. Saint Petersburg Stadium Capacity: 64,287 Completed: April 2017 Cost: $1.5bn (rumoured) Games hosted at Russia 2018: Morocco v Iran, 15 June; Russia v Egypt, 19 June; Brazil v Costa Rica, 22 June; Nigeria v Argentina, 26 June; Round of 16, 3 July; Semi-final, 10 July; Third place play-off, 14 July. History lesson Krestovsky Stadium was supposed to be one of the world’s most exciting, cutting-edge sports arenas. That may still be the case but the path here has been fraught with delays, soaring costs and numerous controversies – denting the pride many in Vladimir Putin’s home city feel about its new attraction. It took a decade to build and was finished eight years after the originally mooted completion deadline. That would have predated Russia’s securing of the World Cup and made for a much smaller, lower-key venue; the project rapidly escalated in scope after 2010 and it became, according to some estimates, the world’s most expensive football stadium. Star attraction The stadium is, for those not counting the cost at least, worth the wait. Its vertiginous stands are spectacular, the views out on to the Gulf of Finland from behind the seats are wonderful and the ‘Spaceship’ design is unmistakable. For anyone wanting to make sure of a few thrills before the football kicks off, the vast park on the approach to the ground contains a number of decidedly white-knuckle rollercoasters. Any hitches? Far more than could be listed in this space. But the practical niggles encountered in the past year or two have commanded particular attention – they include a serially leaky roof, which some officials have attributed to damage caused by cormorants, and a pitch initially found to have vibrated seven times more than the permissible limit. Concerns have also been raised about the levels of formaldehyde and ammonia in the materials used to finish some of the internal structure. On a matchgoing level, thousands of supporters were caught out by the mile-long walk from the nearest metro station at the Confederations Cup, meaning the stadium started filling up only towards half-time. These troubles perhaps pale into insignificance when an in-depth investigation last year by the Norwegian magazine Josimar, which alleged at least 110 North Koreans had been working at Krestovsky in atrocious conditions, comes into play. Legacy Zenit St Petersburg will continue to play here – after some early false starts that saw them return to their old Petrovsky Stadium – and hope that the facility helps them push on in their quest to become a more consistent European force. Whether they can ever fill it remains moot, although 50,000 came through the turnstiles when they beat Celtic in last season’s Europa League and their average attendance is not too far short of that. Samara Arena Capacity: 44,807 Completed: April 2018 Cost: $320m Games hosted at Russia 2018: Costa Rica v Serbia, 17 June; Denmark v Australia, 21 June; Uruguay v Russia, 25 June; Senegal v Colombia, 28 June; Round of 16, 2 July; Quarter-final, 7 July. History lesson Ground for the Cosmos Arena was broken in 2014. The project has been controversial locally and its originally mooted location on an island outside the city was rejected after heavy criticism. It was not an easy ride towards construction although the end product, amid an attractive green setting, is pleasing to the eye. Star attraction One of the tournament’s more striking venues. Samara is proud of its history as one of the primary hubs of the Soviet space programme and the 65m-high glass dome, which will be lit up at night, promises to be spectacular. The city itself should be an enjoyable visit – raw, energetic and beautifully situated at the confluence of the Samara and Volga rivers. Any hitches? Samara is arguably the bad boy of Russia’s stadium projects. It was riddled with delays, while costs soared and by mid-2015 it was already more than €40m over its original budget. That contributed to a change of constructor in early 2016. A number of tweaks to the original plan – including a downscaling of the dome, intended to be 80m high – had to be made to cut costs and prevent it falling further behind schedule, while in August a fire added to the many difficulties. Eventually it was signed off on 27 April – one day before its first test match, between local side Krylia Sovetov and Fakel Voronezh. It has been cut ridiculously fine and the surrounding infrastructure will hardly have had the most rigorous of workouts before its doors are opened for the World Cup. Legacy Krylia (whose name, wonderfully, means “Wings of the Soviets”) will move there from their creaking Metallurg Stadium – which is itself worth a look if you can brave an iffy neighbourhood. They have been a yo-yo club recently but will be back in the top flight next season after a year away. It is an old club with rich tradition but, even so, it would take some turnaround for them to fill the ground. A residential development is expected to surround the new structure in good time. Mordovia Arena Capacity: 44,442 Completed: March 2018 Cost: $300m Games hosted at Russia 2018: Peru v Denmark, 16 June; Colombia v Japan, 19 June; Iran v Portugal, 25 June; Panama v Tunisia, 28 June. History lesson Saransk is the smallest of the World Cup host cities and, to Russians, was a surprising choice of venue – particularly when a football-loving city such as Krasnodar, to the south-west, will have an outstanding facility sitting idle. But Mordovia Arena, whose construction began in 2010, should serve its purpose well enough and is situated near enough to both railway station and newly completed airport for a swift getaway if supporters are seeking brighter lights. Star attraction There is nothing particularly flashy here although the stadium’s brightly coloured exterior, intended to reflect the rich palette of the Mordovia region’s arts and crafts, will hopefully be photogenic. Any hitches? Construction was considerably delayed – not least due to a lengthy suspension between 2013 and 2015 – so this proved to be another of the World Cup venues’ stragglers, although three test events in April involving local side Mordovia Saransk went off smoothly. Legacy Capacity will be scaled back to around 28,000 and Mordovia will move in. They have a habit of moving between the top three divisions and are back in Russia’s second tier next season. When Syzran-2003 visited the new venue for its third warm-up fixture in mid-May, 41,057 fans came to see what the fuss was about; 11 days later 973 were in attendance when Mordovia finished their season with a match against Ural’s reserves at their old Start stadium. Make of that what you like; Saransk has never been a football-mad city and the commercial facilities inside the ground will probably be subject to a heavy sell, while other sports will be played on the site. Volgograd Arena Capacity: 45,568 Completed: March 2018 Cost: $280m Games hosted at Russia 2018: Tunisia v England, 18 June; Nigeria v Iceland, 22 June; Saudi Arabia v Egypt, 25 June; Japan v Poland, 28 June. History lesson The stadium is new, but the site can tell a tale or two. Here used to stand the Central Stadium, home to Rotor Volgograd and venue for the goalless first leg of their famous Uefa Cup win over Manchester United in 1995. That was a classic Soviet bowl; its replacement, where work began in 2015 after the old ground’s demolition, looks very different and its exterior design is intended to resemble basketwork. Star attraction The finished article has a light, airy feel that should sit well with visitors; it will be worth a pilgrimage, too, for anyone wanting to remember one of the more enduring European shock results of the 1990s. Any hitches? A few minor issues. In June 2017 a small fire broke out on the site after a welding accident, and it had to be combed thoroughly for unexploded ordnance after bombs from the Battle of Stalingrad were found in 2014. Existing concerns about its location on a wetland area briefly raised their heads again in April when photographs purporting to show a crack in a concrete beam supporting the upper tier circulated online; a statement assuring the public of their safety was swiftly made. Legacy Rotor expect to play here although, as with many of these venues’ tenants, their ability to get anywhere near filling the ground is in grave doubt. Last season they finished fourth-bottom of the second tier and although 24,000 watched one of the stadium’s test events against Krylia Sovetov in May it would probably take another visit from United to draw a full house again. The capacity will drop by around 10,000, which could help.

It’s virtually invisible from three sides because it nestles into the angles of an old boundary wall that runs between back gardens and an imposing Victorian school. As owner Selim Bayer explains: “You’re walking around the wall and suddenly there’s a door. People are always amazed and ask, ‘Oh! Are we here?’” It’s not just an obscure spot, but also an unpromising one. The house is built on the site of a caretaker’s shed and the scrap of wasteland behind it. Because it is bounded on three sides by a Grade II listed wall, only the fourth side has windows. So it’s a revelation to come inside and be struck by the sense of space and light in here. It is proof positive of the power of good architecture and has justly earned a place on the Riba House of the Year long-list, currently being explored in a special Grand Designs television series. This house has been a while in the making. It sits over the former prison vaults of the old Clerkenwell House of Detention – which is not as spooky as it sounds, the vaults having long since been converted into offices. When the site’s landlord wanted to convert the shed above the vaults into a dwelling, he asked Coffey Architects, a young practice then based in the vaults, to come up with a design and get the planning permission. But once this was in place, the landlord sold up. Bayer, an Istanbul architect looking for a London base with his wife Eren, a graphic designer, brought the architects back in. It might seem strange for one architect to hire another but, as Bayer explains: “Coffey already understood the site and the planning situation, I liked their style and they were really friendly and easy-going, so it made good sense.” Practice boss Phil Coffey assigned the project to a young member of the team, Ella Wright, and she and Bayer went back to the drawing board. Like much great architecture, the house’s key features are a reaction to the constraints of the site. First, they needed to bring in light and did this with elegant glass-topped coffers in the ceilings. Continuing the “hidden” theme, the frames sit out of sight, providing a serene and simple look. “We love the way the ceiling creates a beautiful shadow-play as light falls differently on each plane,” says Bayer. The restrained palette of materials includes concrete for the fire surround-cum-bench, the kitchen splashback, bathroom shelving and for the floors. “It ages beautifully and has a finish like marble,” says Bayer. The floor was poured in sections that align with the ceiling coffers and wall panels to zone each area and create a subtle sense of geometry. Oak panelling offsets the concrete and glass to bring a feeling of cosiness and warmth to the space, as well as concealing an impressive amount of storage throughout the house – the hidden element at play again. “We put so much thought into where and how everything would be stored – it was like designing a boat,” says Bayer. Even kitchen essentials such as the kettle and toaster are concealed in a cabinet to avoid clutter. Bayer and Wright designed much of the furniture themselves. The dining table seats six, but slots into a niche when it’s just dinner for two. In the master bedroom the glass roof light slides out of sight at the touch of a button. “We can look up and see the trees, the sky, the stars – it feels like the countryside, in the heart of London.” The winner of the Riba/Grand Designs House of the Year will be revealed on 28 November on Channel 4 at 9pm (coffeyarchitects.com)"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"technology/2017/nov/21/apple-students-illegal-overtime-reports-iphone-x-foxconn-interns","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-21T17:01:35Z","webTitle":"Apple under fire over reports students worked illegal overtime to build iPhone X","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/nov/21/apple-students-illegal-overtime-reports-iphone-x-foxconn-interns","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2017/nov/21/apple-students-illegal-overtime-reports-iphone-x-foxconn-interns","fields":{"headline":"Apple under fire over reports students worked illegal overtime to build iPhone X","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Apple has been accused of relying on students working illegal overtime to build the iPhone X, through its contractor Foxconn, which manufactures the devices in Zhengzhou, China. According to the Financial Times, students working at the Foxconn plant, as part of a three month “work experience” placement, were routinely working 11-hour days assembling the newest phone, breaking Chinese overtime laws in the process. Student labour is common, and legal, in manufacturing hubs in China. The students must be paid, and the placements must be voluntary, with the number of temporary workers swelling employment at the Zhengzhou factory threefold in the busiest time of the year, the paper reported. But, according to the Financial Times, such work experience should be limited to just 40 hours a week. Six high school students, out of a group of 3,000 from one vocational school sent to work at the factory, told the paper that those legal limits were exceeded. In a statement, Apple said: “During the course of a recent audit, we discovered instances of student interns working overtime at a supplier facility in China. We’ve confirmed the students worked voluntarily, were compensated and provided benefits, but they should not have been allowed to work overtime.” “At this facility, student intern programs are short term and account for a very small percentage of the workforce. When we found that some students were allowed to work overtime, we took prompt action. A team of specialists are on site at the facility working with the management on systems to ensure the appropriate standards are adhered to.” “Apple is dedicated to ensuring everyone in our supply chain is treated with the dignity and respect they deserve. We know our work is never done and we’ll continue to do all we can to make a positive impact and protect workers in our supply chain.” Foxconn told the newspaper that “all work was voluntary and compensated appropriately” but admitted that “the interns did work overtime in violation of our policy”. Li Qiang, the executive director of New York-based nonprofit China Labour Watch, said: “When Apple’s production demands it, Apple completely ignores the labour standards they have set. “Apple allows factories to make workers put in overtime hours without restriction … and for student workers to work night shifts and put in excessive overtime hours.” The voluntary nature of these student placements has long come under scrutiny. The Financial Times quotes one student as claiming “we are being forced by our school to work here” – a claim Apple denies. The student, who is training to be a train attendant at the Zhengzhou Urban Rail Transit School, said that the work had nothing to do with her studies. More than five years ago, three other Foxconn plants in China were found to be in breach of numerous health and safety regulations, exceeding working hours – including some employees working for more than 11 days straight - and being over-reliant on student labour. In the 2012 report, which covered Foxconn’s 178,000 workers in Guanlan, Longhua and Chengdu, the Fair Labor Association noted that student workers, aged 16 and 17, peaked in the summer month at more than 5% of the entire workforce. The average age at the plants was just 23. In October, Quanta Computer, another Taiwan-owned technology manufacturing firm whose clients include Apple, HP and Sony, was accused of relying on student labour working 12-hour days to build laptops. “We were forced to come,” said one 18-year-old intern at Quanta Chongqing, according to Hong Kong-based non-profit Students and Scholars Against Corporate Misbehaviour. “Every semester, our school recruits new students but our campus is small. When they don’t have enough space in the classrooms or dormitories, they force students out to do internships and then let the new students stay in our dorms.” Quanta Computer denied the report’s allegations and said: “After internal verification, we believe that the allegations … are untrue and unfair to the company.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"artanddesign/2017/nov/21/mary-reid-kelley-and-patrick-kelley-we-are-ghosts-review-tate-liverpool","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-21T18:25:31Z","webTitle":"Drag acts and drunken sailors – Mary Reid Kelley and Patrick Kelley: We Are Ghosts review","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2017/nov/21/mary-reid-kelley-and-patrick-kelley-we-are-ghosts-review-tate-liverpool","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2017/nov/21/mary-reid-kelley-and-patrick-kelley-we-are-ghosts-review-tate-liverpool","fields":{"headline":"Drag acts and drunken sailors – Mary Reid Kelley and Patrick Kelley: We Are Ghosts review","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The films of American artists Mary Reid Kelley and Patrick Kelley are, to use a technical term, bonkers. Actors and sets are rendered as though they inhabit a slapdash monochrome painting, rejigged as a silent-era black-and-white movie. The actors wear cartoonish theatrical makeup, which extends to cover their clothes and all the objects and furnishings that surround them. This, in itself, is arresting and strange. Somewhere between the avant garde and the amateur, between theatre and cartoon, history lesson and literature class, their films are equally curious in their subject matter. For their first UK exhibition in a public gallery, Mary and Patrick (the pair prefer to use their first names) are showing two films and a number of lightbox photographs. In one film, This Is Offal, we find ourselves witnessing the autopsy of a drowned woman. In the second, In The Body of the Sturgeon, we are on board a US submarine, somewhere in the Pacific, in the closing days of the second world war. It’s hot in there, dank and claustrophobic. You can feel the testosterone murk, the sweat, the sense of fraught lassitude. No wonder one young submariner takes to drinking torpedo fuel, with dire results. While he declines in his abyssal throes, a voiceover recites lines cobbled together from bits of Henry Wadsworth Longfellow’s The Song of Hiawatha, published in 1855. The lines may be Longfellow’s, repurposed and recontextualised, but the voice and the silent-screen antics of her drunken sailor are Mary’s. Later, she becomes a pair of radio operators: President Truman, delivering a recorded message announcing the dropping of the atomic bomb on Hiroshima; and an astonishing drag act, the female artist pretending to be a male sailor pretending to be a female burlesque performer, with huge pointy breasts fashioned from metal funnels (bought from the Kelleys’ prime prop store, Home Depot). Patrick lurks in the background, playing an accordion. There is order here, of a very strange sort, and things keep on getting stranger. The artists claim Das Boot, Wolfgang Petersen’s six-hour film drama about life and death on a U-boat, as one of their influences. Judith Butler’s gender performativity and Longfellow’s jury-rigged pentameters give the whole thing a Homeric, epic feel. All this takes place on a homemade set and lasts a little more than 12 minutes. The ribald, comic aspects of the film – Mary and Patrick’s work is frequently ghoulish and hilarious – does not diminish its tragic aspect. Painted-on stubble and moustaches, wrinkles, scars and redrawn muscles overlay real bodies with an idea of a projected otherness. The use of Longfellow’s epic poem needn’t delay us too much, except to say that the clever literary clowning is as much a kind of drag act as all the parodic, manly makeup and Mary’s performance in the belly of the submarine, urinating on her shipmates. I guess it keeps up their spirits, in the fetid tin-can atmosphere, before the craft accidentally encounters a mine and sinks. The larger theme of the film seems to be the theatre of war and its conduct – and the crew’s distance and isolation from it, as they sweat on their bunks with their pin-ups and their books and their homemade entertainments. One has a copy of Carson McCullers’ The Heart is a Lonely Hunter (the book’s cover is hand-drawn). The world floods in, like water. A single viewing is not enough. This Is Offal (groaning puns and wordplay are part of the artists’ tragic-comic shtick) began life as a live performance at Tate Modern. Here, Patrick plays the anatomist, confronted by a drowned female corpse on the slab. His delivery strikes a leaden note. Mary’s southern-inflected voice has all the eagerness of a keen student. Even dead, as she is here, with coins over her eyes, she’s the star. Her dissected organs and limbs are bit-part players, arguing among themselves. “What are you,” says the liver to the heart, “the Beethoven of organs?” “I’m the heart of the matter,” says the heart. Liver: “You’re the VP of Gore!” Heart: “You’re the Pollock of splatter!” And on it goes, with its allusions to Ophelia and CSI, to Thomas Hood’s 1844 poem The Bridge of Sighs, to Andrew Marvell’s 1681 Dialogue Between the Soul and the Body. The artists wear their academicism lightly, not least because their films are so entertaining; so boisterous, delightful and grim; such peculiar, disturbing and erudite pleasures.

If the crew are still alive the submarine would only have one day’s worth of oxygen reserves left. If the vessel is found, a submarine rescue chamber (SCR) will be lowered to couple with the vessel’s hatch and bring the crew up to the surface six members at a time. US rescue equipment and personnel left the Argentinian port of Comodoro Rivadavia on Tuesday heading for the last known location of the San Juan. The SCR and other equipment left aboard the Skandi Patagonia, an oil exploration vessel hired by the US Navy for the rescue mission, heading for the spot 432km (268 miles) east of the Argentinian coast from where the submarine made its last transmission. If the vessel is found, the SCR will be lowered down a cable to try to couple up for the rescue. A total of 49 ships and aircraft from Argentina, the US, the UK, Brazil, Chile and other countries were taking advantage of improved weather conditions to search an area larger than the state of California. More than 100 personnel were participating in the rescue operation, including US and Argentinian navy operatives. The US navy said it was deploying four unmanned undersea vehicles in the search . A large liferaft found in the search area on Monday night, and flares sighted by rescue ships, turned out not to be from the San Juan, the Argentinian navy said on Tuesday. Underwater sounds detected earlier on Monday and seven satellite phone calls that failed to connect on Saturday were not from the missing submarine either, it has been confirmed. Relatives of the 44 crew members have gathered at the Mar del Plata naval base where the submarine had originally been scheduled to arrive on Monday. Argentinian flags and signs bearing messages of hope for their loved ones had been attached to the wire fence around the base. “We trust in God,” said one sign. The families were receiving psychological support from naval doctors at the base. “We’re grateful for the support,” María Victoria García, the mother of Luis Esteban García, told the TN news station. “I have my sights placed on God and the Virgin Mary asking them to bring him back. I am shouting to the sea to send back my son.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"science/2017/nov/21/francis-crick-institutes-700m-building-too-noisy-to-concentrate","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-21T18:18:59Z","webTitle":"Francis Crick Institute's £700m building 'too noisy to concentrate'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/nov/21/francis-crick-institutes-700m-building-too-noisy-to-concentrate","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2017/nov/21/francis-crick-institutes-700m-building-too-noisy-to-concentrate","fields":{"headline":"Francis Crick Institute's £700m building 'too noisy to concentrate'","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"It is a £700m cathedral to biomedical science, where scientists work together to make breakthroughs in cancer, neuroscience, pandemics and genetics. But the Francis Crick Institute is not proving to be the easiest place to concentrate. A year after opening, some of the 1,250 people working at the Crick Institute, in its central London laboratory, have complained that the open plan design, intended to assist informal collaboration, means some areas set aside for thinking and writing up research are too noisy. Chattering members of the public and colleagues celebrating PhD awards have been cited by those who, anecdotal evidence suggests, have been struggling to adapt to working alongside the building’s cavernous atrium. “There are individuals that complain,” said Nicholas Luscombe, leader of one of the Crick’s research groups. “Some people like the background noise as if they were working in a cafe. Some want absolute silence and it’s not great for that. My view is the layout has been extremely successful in terms of what it set out to achieve. You keep bumping into people and that has created new collaborations for me.” The Crick is carrying out tests on noise levels and examining whether the acoustics need to be improved, a spokeswoman said. Dr Kerstin Sailer, reader in social and spatial networks at University College London’s Bartlett School of Architecture, who is researching the way the building is performing, said “some people say it is very loud, specifically those spaces close to the atrium”. “One person said you get visitors coming in, public events, people celebrating passing their PhD so there is a lot of background noise,” she said. “The other problem that is hard to solve is that it is all hard surfaces so sound buffering is harder than in an office space.” She said only a handful of other people in the building had made similar points but estimated that the noise has the potential to affect about a quarter of the people in the building. She stressed that the positive aspects of the open plan design, allowing greater collaboration, may well outweigh any drawbacks. “The building was designed to maximise opportunities for scientists working in different areas of research to meet and share ideas, and feedback from our staff suggests that this is happening,” said the Crick’s chief operating officer, Sam Barrell. “Since moving in last year, we are continuing to optimise the building to provide the best working environment for everyone.” The noise issue in Britain’s flagship new laboratory emerged as one of its antecedents from the 1960s was hailed by architectural experts as among the country’s best designed workplaces. The laboratory of molecular biology in Cambridge was where Sir Francis Crick worked after winning the 1962 Nobel prize for decoding DNA with Jim Watson. It was praised by the dean of the Bartlett, Prof Alan Penn, who has been examining how open plan offices affect behaviour in workplaces ranging from advertising agencies to science labs. They believe they have identified layouts which maximise “creative interplay” between workers without obliterating altogether the quiet many people need to work effectively. In a lecture on Tuesday – titled “Who likes working in open plan?” – Penn identified the laboratory as a leading example of workplace design. He said his research revealed how the building blended cellular laboratories with busy circulation spaces, allowing scientists from different research groups to effectively share ideas. “What we observed is that people walking around would stop and join a conversation in a door of a laboratory,” said Penn. “What was going on was that conversations inside the laboratory were next to where the large scale movement along the corridor. That led to discussions between research groups. Proof of that interplay was evident at meal times. The groups around the tables were mixed from all groups. You got inter-disciplinary interactions taking place.” By contrast, the researchers concluded the former Cancer Research UK laboratory in Lincoln’s Inn Fields, London, was less conducive to interaction and that scientists were less likely to mix at meal times. The researchers concluded the design also hampered quiet thinking because conversations would take place “next to people who were reading and writing where they had knocked through areas. That disturbed people who were reading and writing”, said Penn. The impact of office layout on creativity was understood by Steve Jobs, who reportedly obsessed over ways to structure the atrium when planning a new office for Pixar, and even where to locate the toilets, so that serendipitous personal encounters would occur. Penn’s research suggests that open plan offices function well by allowing people to see each other and so “recruit” each other to help with tasks or solve problems. An analysis of the HHCL advertising agency, which devised the “You’ve been Tango-ed” ads, found the perception of a staff member’s usefulness was directly related to how much they were seen on the open plan office floor. “With a few exceptions, such as with top executives, never being seen means you are found less useful,” said Penn. They found staff “recruited” other visible employees. “If you walk past someone who wants to talk to you, they will flag you down,” said Penn. “It may be only 30 seconds but useful information is exchanged. If you have an open plan system that doesn’t let people recruit people like some of these cubicle farms, then you get all of the disruption and all of the noise but none of the benefits of recruiting people.” Prof Alan Penn’s dos and don’ts of office design Do take account of different types of staff in your organisation; some jobs need territory, some are nomadic. Do have “contemplative” areas for your staff to think, read or write. Do create space for creative interaction where staff can randomly bump into each other and chat, and organise the circulation so that different groups or divisions are brought together. Don’t go too far in reducing the number of desks in pursuit of agile working, eg below the average number of staff in the office. Don’t assume that only the boss needs to have an office when the office junior might need top concentration to do their work. Don’t install cubicles in the hope of reducing interruptions, they stop you from recruiting passers by into conversation, and are not effective in reducing noise."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2017/nov/21/millennials-struggling-to-make-ends-meet","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-21T18:28:44Z","webTitle":"Millennials struggling to make ends meet | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/nov/21/millennials-struggling-to-make-ends-meet","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2017/nov/21/millennials-struggling-to-make-ends-meet","fields":{"headline":"Millennials struggling to make ends meet","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Sajid Javid’s comments reported in Peter Walker’s article (‘£90k is a lot of avocados’: Javid defends millennials who can’t afford a home, theguardian.com, 16 November) could not be more accurate.

Under-25s are excluded from the pitiful “national living wage”. From 21-24 we can be paid as little as £7.05 per hour, and for 18-20 a shocking £5.60 for doing exactly the same hours in exactly the same job. Even working full-time a 24-year-old might get as little as £14,500 per annum. And we’re far more likely to be on a zero-hours contract. You can’t build a life on that. We want to move out, start families, make our own way in the world. We’ll never do that while being exploited as cheap labour for big retail and catering businesses.

The Commons public accounts committee said the subsidy contract for Hinkley Point C, agreed in 2016 after years of delays, would hit poorest households hardest. The power station is expected to cost billpayers £30bn over the lengthy of the 35-year contract, adding £10-£15 to the average household energy bill. But an assessment by the committee concluded that no one in Whitehall was championing consumers’ interests during negotiations with French company EDF Energy. The final bill for consumers was exacerbated by government not renegotiating the guaranteed power price for fear that EDF and its Chinese partner CGN would walk away from the project, which the MPs said was a questionable assumption. Officials agreed a price of £92.50 per megawatt hour in 2013 but fossil fuel price projections fell between then and the contract being signed in 2016, pushing the cost to consumers up fivefold from £6bn to £30bn. At the time the Department of Energy and Climate Change – now the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy – did not consider a ceiling on the guaranteed price, the MPs were told. Meg Hillier, chair of the group of MPs, said: “Billpayers have been dealt a bad hand by the government in its approach to this project.” The criticism from the committee follows a damning report by the UK’s spending watchdog, the NAO, which found the contract for Hinkley had locked consumers into a “risky and expensive project”. The NAO attacked the government for failing to explore alternative financing models, such as taking stake in the project, a criticism that the MPs echoed. The public accounts committee said it was also disappointed that the government appeared to have no plan in place to maximise the wider benefits of the project, beyond the clean power it will provide. “The department does not know to what extent UK workers and companies will benefit from Hinkley Point C and the wider follow-on new nuclear programme, and has no plan in place to show how it will maximise the wider benefits of the project,” the report said. A BEIS spokeswoman said: “The government negotiated a competitive deal for the construction of the first new nuclear power station in a generation as part of our energy mix, which ensures consumers won’t pay a penny for any construction overruns and until the station generates electricity in 2025.” The MPs urged the government to publish a plan B for keeping the lights on, in the event the power station does not come online in 2025 as planned. EDF has already warned that the plant could be completed 15 months late. French, Japanese and Chinese developers hope to secure financial incentives from the UK to build other new nuclear power plants, but the MPs said the government should re-evaluate the strategic case before going ahead with more projects. “The government made some grave strategic errors here and must now explain what it will do to ensure these are not repeated,” said Hillier of the Hinkley contract. EDF defended the deal and said Hinkley would help cut costs for other future nuclear power stations, such as the one it hopes to build at Sizewell in Suffolk. A spokesman said: “The agreed price is lower than 80% of other low carbon capacity contracted so far and the project has restarted UK nuclear construction after a quarter century. Construction is fully under way and is already delivering a huge benefit to British jobs, skills and industrial strategy.” •Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2017/nov/21/net-neutrality-rules-to-be-ditched-as-expected-fcc-decision-sparks-protests","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-21T16:35:48Z","webTitle":"US telecoms regulator unveils sweeping plans to dismantle net neutrality","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/nov/21/net-neutrality-rules-to-be-ditched-as-expected-fcc-decision-sparks-protests","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2017/nov/21/net-neutrality-rules-to-be-ditched-as-expected-fcc-decision-sparks-protests","fields":{"headline":"US telecoms regulator unveils sweeping plans to dismantle net neutrality","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The top US telecoms regulator has unveiled sweeping plans to overturn Obama-era rules designed to protect an open internet. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) chairman, Ajit Pai, plans to repeal “net neutrality” regulations that were championed by tech companies and consumer groups. The rules but have been heavily criticized by internet service providers and Pai. “The FCC will no longer be in the business of micromanaging business models and pre-emptively prohibiting services and applications and products that could be pro-competitive,” Pai told Reuters. He added that the Obama administration had sought to pick winners and losers and exercised “heavy-handed” regulation of the internet. “We should simply set rules of the road that let companies of all kinds in every sector compete and let consumers decide who wins and loses.” The move is likely to spark a furious battle before the FCC’s vote on the proposals on 14 December. About 21m comments were submitted to the regulator as it discussed the proposals, and activists have flooded legislators with more than 250,000 calls condemning Pai’s plans. The FCC’s plans will be challenged in court. Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi called the decision “an all-out assault on the entrepreneurship, innovation and competition at the heart of the internet”. Net neutrality is the principle that all traffic on the internet is treated equally. Its supporters argue that equal access to the internet has been essential in creating today’s dynamic online world. On the chopping block are rules established in 2015 that prevent broadband companies from charging more for internet “fast lanes” for certain content and from blocking or slowing certain content. Critics charge that removing the rules will hand ISPs control of the internet – allowing them to pick winners and losers by slowing some services while giving preferential treatment to those they favor. Scrapping the current regime will be a major victory for the broadband and cable industry which fought through the courts to stop the net neutrality regulations. They, and Pai, a former Verizon lawyer, have argued the rules are an unnecessary and costly burden on internet providers that hampers investment and innovation. “The truth of the matter is that we decided to abandon successful policies solely because of hypothetical harms and hysterical prophecies of doom,” Pai said in a speech about the creation of the net neutrality rules earlier this year. The fight has divided the tech world and comes as cable providers are moving to take control of more and more online content. On Monday the justice department sued to block AT&amp;T’s takeover of Time Warner, which would hand the telecoms company control of CNN, HBO and Warner Brothers among other assets. The justice department cited comments from AT&amp;T’s own DirecTV satellite business that “vertically integrated programmers” – which own the means of distribution as well as the content – can “much more credibly threaten to withhold programming from rival [distributors]” and can “use such threats to demand higher prices and more favorable terms”. Amazon, Etsy, Google, Reddit, Wikipedia and other tech companies have all called for the protection of net neutrality, arguing that it essential in creating the level playing field that has allowed so much innovation online. Free speech groups too are worried about the FCC’s latest moves. Concerned that it could lead to censorship online. A series of protests are planned for 7 December, the week before the FCC vote, at Verizon stores nationwide. “This is the free speech fight of our generation, and internet users are pissed off and paying attention,” said Evan Greer, campaign director of Fight for the Future, which is organizing the protest. “Ajit Pai may be owned by Verizon, but he has to answer to Congress, and lawmakers have to answer to us, their constituents. The corrupt bureaucrats trying to kill net neutrality are hoping to avoid public backlash by burying the news over the holiday weekend. We’re taking our protest from the internet to the streets to make sure that doesn’t happen,” she added."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"education/2017/nov/21/graduate-in-1m-claim-was-badly-let-down-by-oxford-court-told","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-21T15:57:14Z","webTitle":"Graduate in £1m claim was badly let down by Oxford, court told","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2017/nov/21/graduate-in-1m-claim-was-badly-let-down-by-oxford-court-told","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/education/2017/nov/21/graduate-in-1m-claim-was-badly-let-down-by-oxford-court-told","fields":{"headline":"Graduate in £1m claim was badly let down by Oxford, court told","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"An Oxford graduate is suing the university for £1m on the grounds that his failure to get a top degree 17 years ago cost him the chance of a lucrative legal career. Faiz Siddiqui alleges the “inadequate” teaching he received on the Indian special subject part of his modern history course resulted in him getting only a low upper second degree when he took his finals in June 2000 instead of a first or high 2:1. Siddiqui, 39, has blamed the situation on a number of members of staff being absent on sabbatical leave and a failure to find cover. He has also alleged that a tutor failed to submit medical information about him to examiners. He claims he would have become an international commercial lawyer if he had gained the top qualification at the end of his time at Brasenose College, and that his clinical depression and insomnia have been significantly exacerbated by his “inexplicable failure”. The legal battle between Siddiqui and Oxford has been ongoing for more than a year. Last year a judge allowed Siddiqui’s action to proceed to be fully argued after Oxford claimed the case had no merit and had been brought outside the legal time limit. It was decided at the time that Siddiqui had a real chance of persuading a judge that the case was not time-barred or that it would be just for it to proceed in any event. At the high court in London on Tuesday, Siddiqui’s barrister, Roger Mallalieu, told Mr Justice Foskett that in 2000 Siddiqui was a “driven young man” aiming for a postgraduate qualification from an Ivy League university before a career at the tax bar in England or a major US law firm. “Whilst a 2:1 degree from Oxford might rightly seem like a tremendous achievement to most, it fell significantly short of Mr Siddiqui’s expectations and was, to him, a huge disappointment,” Mallalieu said. Siddiqui’s employment history after Oxford in legal and tax roles was “frankly poor” and he was now unemployed, the barrister added. “Mr Siddiqui has been badly let down by Oxford. He went there with high – perhaps extraordinarily high – expectations. “He and others became the victims of poor teaching provision by the university in what was anticipated to be his favoured special subject, and he, uniquely among his peers, was further disadvantaged by his personal tutor not conveying his knowledge of his illnesses to those responsible for making reasonable adjustments and for moderating his examinations.” Siddiqui is bringing a loss of earnings claim of at least £1m against the chancellor, masters and scholars of Oxford University. The university denies negligence and causation and says the case has been brought “massively” outside the legal time limit. The university has previously admitted it had “difficulties” running the module in the year Siddiqui graduated because half of the teaching staff responsible for Asian history were on sabbatical leave at the same time. Siddiqui has said the standard of tuition he received from Dr David Washbrook declined as a result of the “intolerable” pressure the historian was placed under. In the academic year 1999-2000, four of the seven faculty staff were on sabbaticals. At the hearing last year, Mallalieu said that of the 15 students who received the same teaching and sat the same exam as Siddiqui, 13 received their “lowest or joint lowest mark” in the subject. If Siddiqui wins, the case could open the floodgates for similar claims from students complaining about inadequate teaching, unsuitable accommodation and poor decision making at the university. The seven-day hearing is concerned only with liability, with damages only to be assessed at a later date if Siddiqui succeeds."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/blog/2017/nov/21/australia-england-ashes-2017-2018-guardian-writers-predictions","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-21T18:12:00Z","webTitle":"Australia v England, Ashes 2017-18: Guardian writers’ predictions","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2017/nov/21/australia-england-ashes-2017-2018-guardian-writers-predictions","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/blog/2017/nov/21/australia-england-ashes-2017-2018-guardian-writers-predictions","fields":{"headline":"Australia v England, Ashes 2017-18: Guardian writers’ predictions","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Who will win?

Their coach, however, is in no rush to repeat the experience. “Players did a great job dealing with all the challenges we had to deal with. I think we’re fortunate there was no volcano eruptions or earthquakes, or anything else while we were down there,” Bill Belichick said in an appearance on WEEI on Monday. “You have two NFL franchises in an area that I don’t know how stable the geological plates that were below us [were], but nothing happened, so that was good.” Belichick’s fears are odd considering he has never voiced concerns about traveling to play any of the NFL teams in California along the San Andreas Fault, an area prone to earthquakes. The Patriots have also played in Seattle twice in the past 10 years; the city sits close to the volcanic Mount Rainier and it is believed an eruption could affect the city. Belichick did, however, cite other concerns about the Mexico City trip. “It’s a long way to go for a game,” Belichick said. “There’s a lot to it in terms of all the logistics of it. They are not used to having a NFL team so you have to go in there and handle a lot of the logistics. It took a lot of manpower, a lot of hours, a lot of energy out of our organization to do that. This week, we’re tired. We are exhausted from the trip. It was a good trip, but it took a lot out of us I think.” Belichick’s statement was seen as insensitive by some in Mexico after hundreds were killed in earthquakes earlier this year. Poncho Vera of ESPN Mexico accused the Patriots coach of “outrageous ignorance”. The NFL doesn’t share Belichick’s concerns and has said Mexico City will host a regular season game through until 2021. That will be good news for another member of the Patriots, Tom Brady, who said he had enjoyed the trip. “To be here and play in a different country and to have everyone cheer for our team, cheer for me and cheer for my team-mates is incredible. Hopefully there’s many more games here,” he said. “It’s a great experience. I’ve never been to Mexico City, but I’m definitely coming back. We stayed in a beautiful hotel, I had a beautiful view in my room. Just a very historic stadium. I know there’s been some really important sporting events here.” The Patriots lead the AFC East with an 8-2 record after the win over the Raiders.

Ben Arnold Naples ’44: A Wartime Diary 11pm, BBC Four In 1943, British officer Norman Lewis entered Naples with the American army and diarised everything he saw. What followed was a journey through a city turned upside down and inside out – overflowing with sex and death, violence and ingenuity. People ate cats and stole anything that wasn’t nailed down. Children turned feral. Unexploded mines made life even more of a lottery. And then Vesuvius erupted. Horrifying and thrilling. Phil Harrison Dark Files 9pm, History As any conspiracy theorist will tell you, there’s no such thing as a conspiracy theorist – the government just wants you to think that. This feature-length doc attempts to take a balanced view of a hot topic among “believers”. Namely, that Camp Hero on Long Island, a military installation decommissioned in 1981, continues to trial mind-control experiments. A former CIA man and a sceptical journalist join documentarian Steve Garetano to investigate. John Robinson Babylon Berlin 9pm, Sky Atlantic What Sky calls “the first chapter” of the Weimar republic procedural concludes in impressive fashion in this double bill. There’s some key backstory as, via Rath’s invitation to an evening out with colleagues, we learn more about the specific roots of his PTSD – and, a factor in Nazism’s rise, why some German veterans came to see social democracy as a “betrayal”. Meantime, in a city growing ever more dangerous, Lotte is still out freelance investigating. Series two begins next week. Jonathan Wright Film choice Men in Black 3, (Barry Sonnenfield, 2012), 6.05pm, Channel 4 Wisecracking Will Smith and hatchet-faced Tommy Lee Jones are a terrific double act as alien regulators Agent J and Agent K, but they’re outshone by Josh Brolin’s inspired turn as Jones’s younger self in this snappy sci-fi sequel.

Paul Howlett Fury, (David Ayer, 2014), 9pm, Channel 5 Brad Pitt as grizzled, taciturn tank commander “Wardaddy” Collier leads this old-fashioned second world war film, which is much in the tradition of Saving Private Ryan. Logan Lerman is a scared young clerk warily taken under the veteran’s wing when he is plunged into action. The weary crew, having fought their way through France, make a somewhat cliched stand at a nameless German crossroads; the combat is muddy, bloody and brutal.

Today, hardly anyone says anything else, not least because virtually all our dire predictions have become realities. Even public officials responsible for running and inspecting the NHS, who couldn’t be seen for dust then (the heads of NHS England, NHS Improvement and the Care Quality Commission), are going public on the gravity of the situation and begging the chancellor to do something in this week’s budget. Indeed, how could anyone say things are OK when, in response to an increase in the past seven years of at most 15% in A&amp;E attendances and admissions, waits in A&amp;E have gone up by 350% and waits for admission by 550%? Increasing waiting times are the canary in the mine. However, the Department of Health, whenever challenged with a another example of increasingly poor performance, excessive waits or other pressures, retorts not that this is incorrect but (without irony) that other things in the NHS are fine. In reality, all is not well. Once again, I am afraid, those who have just started to complain are saying too little and too late. The NHS isn’t getting into crisis, as they cautiously say. It is way beyond that and already failing, despite its internationally accepted efficiency. The shortfalls between what is demanded and what can be supplied are chronic, widespread and large, and growing inexorably. They also harm that much-prized efficiency, because you can’t manage efficiently when you are constantly running out of capacity. As a result, we have largely undone the benefits of nearly 30 years of growth and improvement in the NHS. I spent several years researching why failure happens while also working as an NHS chief executive, much of that time turning around failing NHS trusts. What I found was that if a crisis is unacknowledged, and therefore not dealt with, the organisation in question is unable to honestly confront and then tackle the difficult but treatable problems it faces, and instead minimises or even ignores or denies them. Because of this inaction, things get worse very fast and only bottom out when the true nature of the problems is accepted. Today, it is not individual hospitals or GP practices but the NHS as a whole that is in the incredibly dangerous descent phase. We should be not so much worried as massively alarmed. Whether the chancellor will give the NHS any relief remains to be seen. What is virtually certain is that it won’t be enough, or as sustained as it needs to be. A small one-off increase will simply reduce the rate of decline and not be part of a coherent long-term plan to put things right. To fix this failure of the whole “system” requires the equivalent of a Marshall plan for the NHS. That means a commitment at the outset to substantial funding increases year in and year out, in a planned, systematic way; it means increasing the NHS workforce as well as extending and renewing infrastructure so the NHS can deal with the demand already there and into the future. It won’t be cheap. But the alternative is to watch the NHS crumble around us, ultimately with a bill that will be a lot larger in terms of cash and, more importantly, of avoidable pain, suffering and mortality. Surely we don’t want that. • Jan Filochowski spent 20 years as an NHS chief executive, and is the author of Too Good To Fail?"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"business/2017/nov/21/uk-water-firms-admit-using-divining-rods-to-find-leaks-and-pipes","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-21T17:01:08Z","webTitle":"UK water firms admit using divining rods to find leaks and pipes","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/nov/21/uk-water-firms-admit-using-divining-rods-to-find-leaks-and-pipes","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2017/nov/21/uk-water-firms-admit-using-divining-rods-to-find-leaks-and-pipes","fields":{"headline":"UK water firms admit using divining rods to find leaks and pipes","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Ten of the 12 water companies in the UK have admitted they are still using the practice of water dowsing despite the lack of scientific evidence for its effectiveness. The disclosure has prompted calls for the regulator to stop companies passing the cost of a discredited medieval practice on to their customers. Ofwat said any firm failing to meet its commitments to customers faced a financial penalty. Dowsers, or water witchers, claim that their divining rods cross over when the presence of water is detected below ground. It is regarded as a pseudoscience, after numerous studies showed it was no better than chance at finding water. Some water companies, however, insisted the practice could be as effective as modern methods. The discovery that firms were still using water diviners was made by the science blogger Sally Le Page, after her parents reported seeing an engineer from Severn Trent “walking around holding two bent tent pegs to locate a pipe” near their home in Stratford-upon-Avon. Le Page asked Severn Trent why it was still using divining rods to find pipes when there was no evidence that it worked. Replying on Twitter, the company said: “We’ve found that some of the older methods are just as effective than the new ones, but we do use drones as well, and now satellites.” Le Page then asked the other 11 water companies whether they were using water dowsing. Only one, Wessex Water, said it did not use divining rods, and one, Northern Ireland Water had yet to reply. The other nine confirmed the practice was still used in some form in their areas. Christopher Hassall, a specialist in water management at the Leeds University school of biology, said: “This isn’t a technique, it’s witchcraft.” He told the Guardian: “We work with water companies to enhance the sustainability of drinking water supplies and it is frustrating that there are still some very peculiar practices that are going on in these companies.” He called for Ofwat to eradicate the practice. “The statutory bodies need to be stepping in. It is analogous to using homeopathy and reiki on the NHS. These are unproven practices that waste time and money. “Drinking water is a fundamental human necessity and something that the water companies should be managing as effectively and efficiently as possible without using these medieval witchcraft practices.” He added: “If they are going to be passing the charges on to us for using dubious practices, then that’s something everyone in the UK should be concerned about.” Le Page said she was surprised by the finding. “Ofwat should be looking into this because it’s a total waste of money. It’s not going to do any harm. But sending out somebody off to a location just to wave some sticks around is not a good use of time or money.” An Ofwat spokesman urged companies to consider the cost-effectiveness of techniques used to stop leaks. He said customers wanted to see a meaningful reduction in leakage and companies were required to agree specific leakage commitments in consultation with clients. “While it is ultimately a decision for each individual company how they deliver on those commitments, we expect them all to think very carefully about whether they are using the most efficient and cost-effective tools and resources,” the spokesman said. “Ultimately, any company which fails to deliver on the commitments it has made to its customers will face a financial penalty.” A spokesman for the sector’s trade body, Water UK, said: “Water companies are spending millions of pounds each year on innovative leakage detection schemes which has helped reduce leakages by a third since the 1990s, and it’s unlikely that a few individuals doing some unofficial divining has had much impact.” Le Page said those convinced by dowsing were being fooled by the “ideomotor effect”, a phenomenon observed when the act of thinking about something unconsciously triggers the muscles to move, and in this case, prompts divining rods to cross. “It so convincing when you do it, and you see the rods cross over, you really don’t realise that you are one the causing it,” she said. Anglia Water was the firm that was most insistent about the effectiveness of dowsing rods, inviting Le Page to a demonstration. The other companies, including Welsh Water, Scottish Water, South West Water, Southern Water and United Utilities, all confirmed the continuing use of some form of dowsing in tweets. Le Page questioned how the methods could still be in use given the evidence available that they did not work. Writing on her blog, she said: “Every properly conducted scientific test of water dowsing has found it no better than chance (eg here, here, and here, nicely described here). “You’ll be just as likely to find water by going out and taking a good guess as you will by walking around with divining rods.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/nov/21/whats-the-one-new-years-resolution-you-kept-and-how-did-you-manage-it","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-21T15:31:46Z","webTitle":"What's the one New Year's resolution you kept - and how did you manage it?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/nov/21/whats-the-one-new-years-resolution-you-kept-and-how-did-you-manage-it","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/nov/21/whats-the-one-new-years-resolution-you-kept-and-how-did-you-manage-it","fields":{"headline":"What's the one New Year's resolution you kept - and how did you manage it?","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"We often have good intentions when making a New Year’s resolution.

Thanks as always for following with us and be sure to check out the match report. A night like this could only end one way: with Gianluigi Buffon giving his gloves and shorts to the supporters and exiting the pitch wearing only a shirt, boots and his skivvies. There’s the final whistle and Barcelona have finished top of Group D! 90 min+2: Dybala takes the corner and nothing comes of it. That will most likely be that. 90 min+1: Matuidi taken out along the left flank by Pique, who is shown a yellow. Clear foul, that. Moments later, Dybala rips a low shot from the edge of the area that forces a diving save from a fully extended Ter Stegen. It’s out for a corner. Wow! 90 min: Juventus committing numbers forward here as they make a last push. The fourth official signals for three minutes of stoppage time. 87 min: Digne drags down his assignment and he’s shown a yellow card. 86 min: One last change for Juventus as Matuidi comes on for Douglas Costa. 83 min: The crowd swells as Douglas Costa has a shot on goal but it misses the target and hardly threatens Ter Stegen. 82 min: Jordi Alba enters for Iniesta, who walks off to a standing ovation from the Juventus supporters. How lovely. 79 min: Juventus are throwing more numbers forward but when they’re dispossessed, Suarez wins a found from Sandro, who’s already on a yellow but avoids further discipline from the referee. 76 min: Fifteen minutes to go and no goal in sight. Can someone break through and shake this one up? 72 min: Sandro is whistled for a foul on Semedo and shown a yellow card by the referee. 71 min: A second switch for Juventus as Marchisio enters for Cuadrado. 68 min: Oh dear! A heaven-sent chance for Barcelona squandered as Juve have a mix-up in the back leading to a one-on-one with Digne and Buffon but Digne opts to pass and like that it’s gone. 66 min: Juventus have made their first substitution as Bentancur, making his 11th appearance for Juve, for Pjanic, who was on a booking early on today. 64 min: Messi’s free kick is just high. Audible frustration starting to mount among the home supporters. 63 min: Suarez wins a foul from Benatia from a dangerous spot and Messi will take it. 61 min: The in-form Higuain, bottled so effectively by Pique tonight, manages to break free on the edge of the area and have a go on goal, but the shot is well off target. 59 min: Dybala has a shot on goal blocked by Iniesta and it’s out for a corner. Dybala takes it but nothing comes of it. 56 min: And here comes Messi. He’s entered the match for Deulofeu. Twenty-three goals in 23 appearances for club and country this year, although none in his last three games. 55 min: A ball is played to Suarez, who tries to flick it with the outside of his foot to Deulofeu, but he can’t quite maneuver it. What a pretty opportunity that might have been. Now Suarez is down with very incidental contact and has earned an earful from the crowd. 53 min: Barcelona have really dominated possession so far unlike anything we saw in the first half. And now it looks as if Messi will be entering ... 51 min: Rakitic plays the corner toward the far post and Pique has a shot blocked. It’s out for another corner for the visitors. Deulofeu delivers this one and it’s less threatening with Barca’s spell of possession ultimately petering out. 50 min: Suarez’s free kick sails over the bar but it appears to have taken a slight deflection and Barcelona will have a corner. 49 min: Khedira is whistled for another foul on Iniesta, picking up right where they left off in the first half. He was held as he carried an interception into the danger zone. Smart, tactical foul but Barca will have a free kick from a dangerous area. Suarez stands over it. 46 min: And we’re back under way for the second half. A half-time observation from Peter Oh, via email: From an aesthetic viewpoint, I’m disappointed that Barça aren’t using their classic blaugrana striped kit, even though it is an away match. Judging by the photo accompanying your coverage, they look like AS Roma today! You’re not the first to make that observation, Peter! Scoreless in Turin. Barcelona have failed to find the score sheet in three of their last four away Champions League games. Though supporters will no doubt take heart in the secret weapon stashed away for emergency. 45 min+1: Suarez has a go from distance, his first real opportunity of the match, and it skips harmlessly wide of the goal. 45 min: The fourth official calls for one minute of stoppage time. 44 min: Dybala takes the long way around a gaggle of Barcelona defenders and rips a left-footed shot on goal that soars above the Ter Stegen and the target. 42 min: Higuain, who’s scored in five straight appearances but has yet to make an impact so far (thanks to Pique), is whistled for a foul in Iniesta, who it must be said has kept a similarly low profile on the day. 38 min: Suarez, so quiet this evening, makes a breakneck run into the area but the flag goes up and he’s offside by some distance. 37 min: Some nifty interplay and improvisation in the final third for Juventus, but Cuadrado’s shot off a cushion-header set-up from the edge of the area sails far above the crossbar into the stands. 34 min: Khedira appears to grasp the face of Umtiti while vying for the ball. Not a foul, per se, bad as it looked. But the referee awards one anyway and Barcelona take over possession near the halfway line. 30 min: A big moment for the Serbian referee Milorad Mazic at the half-hour mark as Paulinho crashes to the turf in the area on what appears to be incidental contact. Rather than point to the spot, Mazic steps forward and shows the midfielder a yellow for simulation. Correctly, the replay confirms. 28 min: Deulofeu is ruled offside on a Barcelona attack. 25 min: Alex Sandro slips past Deulofeu and wins a free kick near the corner flag on the left-hand side. It’s delivered toward the top of the area, but Cuadrado can’t reach it before it’s cleared toward the halfway line. 23 min: A golden chance for Barcelona off a Rakitic free kick as the ball makes it through everyone and caroms off the post. It falls to Paulinho but he’s unable to negotiate it on target. 21 min: Pjanic is shown a yellow card for a foul on Iniesta. Would have been worse for Juve if he hadn’t made it. 18 min: A chance for Dybala but it’s thwarted by Ter Stegen. 17 min: Cuadrado’s attempted clearance very nearly falls to Iniesta for a point-blank opportunity, but the Barca veteran is unable to control it before it’s over the touch line for a goal kick. 14 min: Barcelona are dispossessed after a long spell of possession and Juve are quick on the counter with Cuadrado finding Costa in full sprint on the left flank, but Costa’s cross can’t find a target man and it’s back to Barca. Writes reader Charles Antaki, via email: I’m hoping that Gigi Buffon makes a dozen spectacular and match-saving games from now until the final, where he runs up and heads in the winning goal on the 97th minute. No real reason other than he seems a decent fellow, and after Italy’s elimination from the World Cup qualifiers, must be feeling like the last elephant left in the tribe. 10 min: Barcelona build it up from the back with a minute-long sequence of uninterrupted passes until Paulinho has a go from about 30 yards after a nice exchange with Suarez, but it takes a deflection en route and misses the target wide. 8 min: Pjanic wins a foul in Juve’s half when he’s nicked at from behind by Paulinho. Intimidating pace from Douglas Costa and Cuadrado have the hosts on the front foot early. 4 min: An positive start for both sides with lots of open play. It’s Juve on the attack, but Costa’s cross into the area is turned away by Pique and now it’s Barca on the counter. 2 min: Douglas Costa has the first chance of the game from inside the area but Ter Stegen makes the save at the near post. 1 min: And they’re off! Barcelona attacking right to left to right in their third kits, Juve from right to left in traditional home strips. Here’s a look at today’s teams. Goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon and defender Andrea Barzagli are back in the side for Juventus after resting for the team’s defeat at Sampdoria over the week-end. Juventus XI: Buffon, Barzagli, Benatia, Rugani, Cuadrado, Pjanic, Khedira, Alex Sandro, Dybala, Douglas Costa, Higuain Subs: Szczesny, De Sciglio, Marchisio, Matuidi, Mandzukic, Asamoah, Bentancur Barcelona XI: Ter Stegen, Nelson Semedo, Pique, Umtiti, Digne, Rakitic, Sergio Busquets, Iniesta, Deulofeu, Luis Suarez, Paulinho Subs: Cillessen, Denis Suarez, Messi, Alcacer, Jordi Alba, Aleix Vidal, Vermaelen Referee: Milorad Mazic (Serbia) Hello and welcome to today’s Champions League group stage match between Juventus and Barcelona. It’s been 225 days since Barca were toppled 3-0 at the Juventus Stadium in the first leg of their quarter-final tie last year, leading to their elimination after a goalless return leg and spelling the effective demise of Luis Enrique’s tenure at the club. They’ll look to avenge that setback today with the opportunity afoot to finish top of Group D with a game to spare. Juventus trail the La Liga frontrunners Barca by three points in the group and while they’ve clinched no worse than a Europa League place with two games remaining, a defeat today at home would leave them at risk of not qualifying for the Champions League knockout stage. Kick-off is just about 35 minutes from now. We’ll be back with the teams in short order. Bryan will be here shortly. In the meantime, here’s Sid Lowe’s latest La Liga blog: FC Barcelona pulled out of Butarque on an angular blue and orange bus that looked like it had been borrowed from a school trip in the 90s a bit before seven on Saturday evening and headed 30 kilometres north up the M40 to the airport at Barajas, their work done. Half of it, anyway. Nearby, just about visible from the terminal, stood the Wanda Metropolitano, where the rest of it was done for them. Not long after Barça had set off, and a couple of hours after Alavés had passed on their way north back up the A1 to Euskadi, Real Madrid embarked upon the shortest journey they’ve undertaken in La Liga, making the 10-minute trip from their HQ at Valdebebas to Atlético’s new home. It was a short trip, but when they returned a little before midnight, broken and bloodied, it felt like a long way back. For Barcelona, it had been a grand day out.

The chancellor of the exchequer stands up, conjures up the ghost of Sir Stafford Cripps, administers some pain and quickly moves on. In Westminster it is known as aligning the economic and political cycles. In plain English, it means getting the bad news out of the way early in order that there will be money to spare just before voters have to go to the polls again. Only rarely do governments deviate from this approach and when they do it rarely ends well. But these are not normal times. It is simply not possible for Philip Hammond to raise taxes in the hope that, given time, the public will have forgotten all about it. This is a minority government that might not go the distance and, rather like Denis Healey in 1974, Hammond has to prepare for the possibility that there will be another election before too long. What’s more, the reason it might not survive until the scheduled end of the parliament in 2022 is that a good chunk of the public decided in June this year that it wanted more houses built, more money spent on the NHS, less-crowded trains and better roads – the things Jeremy Corbyn said they could have if the government was prepared to borrow to invest and to tax the rich more heavily. The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, thinks the tide turned against austerity during the course of 2016, partly because the public wearied of cuts and partly because Labour articulated an alternative. Whatever the reason, the tide has turned at an inopportune moment for Hammond. Unexpectedly strong employment growth has meant the short-term outlook for the public finances is better than the chancellor thought it would be at the time of the last budget in March. There will not be much for Hammond to boast about because Britain has slipped from the top to the bottom of the G7 growth league table, but he will at least be able to say that the deficit in the current financial year has comfortably beaten expectations. But that is not the real issue. Hammond’s problem is that things look much worse in the years to come. The reason for that is that the independent Office for Budget Responsibility – to which the Treasury has outsourced economic and fiscal forecasting – has decided that the financial crisis caused permanent damage and that, as a result, the economy will never return to its pre-crash levels of growth. Ever since it was created in 2010, the OBR has expressed confidence that the virtual flat-lining of productivity – broadly speaking the improvement in the UK’s economic efficiency – was a temporary phenomenon caused by a particularly deep downturn. Sooner or later, the OBR thought, there would be a bounce-back in productivity to about 2% a year. After years of being proved wrong, the OBR now thinks productivity growth will average only 1.5% a year. While that doesn’t sound much, it will have a significant cumulative impact on the public finances. Weaker productivity limits the economy’s ability to grow without inflation breaching the government’s 2% target, and that in turn means a smaller tax take and bigger deficits. Hammond has pledged to abide by a self-imposed fiscal rule whereby the structural budget deficit – the part unaffected by the ups and downs of the economic cycle – is below 2% of national output (GDP) by 2020-21, and in March was on course to achieve this with £26bn to spare. At a stroke, the OBR will remove two-thirds of the buffer the chancellor thought he would have to see the economy through the Brexit process. Hammond is, therefore, being asked to do more just when the OBR is limiting his room for manoeuvre, and it is this mismatch which makes the budget so testing. Alistair Darling delivered his 2008 autumn statement and 2009 budget against a back drop of an imploding economy and crashing tax receipts but at least knew there was no alternative but to break the then Labour government’s fiscal rules by borrowing more. It is not nearly so simple for the current occupant of 11 Downing Street. Hammond could come up with the sort of giveaway package that Tory backbenchers are eager for, but only if he is prepared to break his fiscal rule. He is reluctant to do that, even though he is coming under pressure from his own backbenchers as well as McDonnell to do so. Alternatively, he could play it ultra-safe, using the gloomy productivity estimates from the OBR as a pretext. He is not keen on that option either. Nor, it is clear, is the prime minister, who behind the scenes has been pressing for bolder action in the budget. Hammond has signalled that the budget will be balanced. That means a bit more spending in sensitive areas – the NHS, housing and transport – but matched by revenue-raising measures elsewhere. He will try to address the reasons the Conservatives lost their overall majority in the election while at the same time sticking to his fiscal rule.

And if there’s one thing the Scots are good at, apart from politics, economics, terriers and whisky, it’s an honest broth. According to the Victorian journalist and author Christian Isobel Johnstone, who published her The Cook and Housewife’s Manual under the pseudonym Margaret Dods: “The French take the lead of all European people in soups and broths … the Scotch rank second, the Welsh next, and … the English, as a nation, are at the very bottom of the scale.” As an Edinburgh native, she may have been biased, but when one considers the likes of cullen skink, Scotch broth and our subject here, cock-a-leekie, it’s hard not to concede the point. The last, occasionally known as cockie-leekie, is often dated to the end of the 16th century, when the Lincolnshire-born traveller Fynes Moryson records having been served “pullet with some prunes in the broth” at a knight’s house in Scotland, although, given the widespread medieval tradition of meat and fruit pottages, it seems likely that similar dishes were once found throughout northern Europe – even (horror!) south of the border. Happily for us, however, this particular version remained popular in Scotland, and feels a pleasingly simple and wholesome celebratory dish to prepare the stomach for the month to come. The chicken As ever, many recipes call for what the redoubtable Maw Broon calls “an auld boiling fowl” (thanks to Twitter friend of the column Jon Dryden Taylor for supplying the recipe), which is, as we have seen previously, an appropriately tough thing to get hold of in 21st-century Britain. Catherine Brown reckons that “attempting a modern cock-a-leekie with an immature battery chicken is akin to attempting cassoulet without confit”, and, in the absence of decent chicken recommends using “a more flavourful pheasant or other game bird – cock or hen – which has roamed freely”. Having tried her recipe, I can confirm that pheasant makes a delicious soup, even when enjoyed from a bowl in a warm kitchen, rather than from a Thermos in the middle of a damp autumnal copse, but one with a distinct gamey character. Feel free to use pheasant here, if that’s what you have, but chicken, to some extent the older the better, remains the classic choice. Clearly, I wouldn’t dream of using anything other than a free-range, if presumably still hopelessly immature, chicken for any of the recipes I test, but the difference between the others lies largely in the cut and the preparation. Jane Grigson and Tom Kitchin call for whole birds, and Xanthe Clay and Graeme Taylor opt for chicken legs or drumsticks, with the latter roasting them before use. At this point, the prospective cock-a-leekie cook is faced with a choice: one dish or two? Using a whole bird produces so much excess meat that there is enough left over for another meal entirely – coronation chicken or curry or pie, perhaps, as takes your fancy. As I am only dealing with the soup, however, I’m going to go for legs alone, which should at least have done a bit of work on a free-range bird, and are considerably cheaper by weight than a whole chicken, which might even mean you can afford to buy better. Although roasting the meat first, as Taylor and Brown suggest, gives the broth the deep savouriness of a Sunday roast, if you have time to simmer the raw joints for several hours, you’ll reap a cleaner, clearer broth that testers claim tastes more intensely of chicken, and softer, juicier meat. (The time-pressed, however, should follow Taylor’s lead to have cock-a-leekie on the table in under two hours.) Many older recipes, including Johnstone’s and that in F Marian McNeill’s 1929 work The Scots Kitchen: Its Traditions and Lore with Old-time Recipes, also include beef of some sort, Johnstone being of the belief that, “if soup be the foundation of a good dinner, it is equally true that beef is the only foundation of a good soup.” Grigson’s version, from the Observer Guide to British Cookery, also collected in the Best of Jane Grigson, makes a stock from beef shin before adding the bird, which yields a rich, sticky and very beefy base – the chicken doesn’t stand a chance. Gorgeous, of course, but not much cock for your leekie. Brown adds a grilled sausage to the mix. A nut-brown sausage, of course, is rarely an unwelcome thing to come across at the bottom of the bowl, but unless you are making cock-a-leekie from a carcass that has been picked entirely clean, and feel in desperate need of extra protein, it does tend to overpower the delicate flavour of the broth. Leekies and other vegetables, herbs and spices The eagle-eyed among you may have noticed that leeks do not feature in the first mention of this particular dish, in 1598 – indeed, they don’t crop up until 1737, when “cockie leekie” appears in the accounts books of Ochtertyre House, near Stirling. Originally, perhaps, it would have been made with onions instead, but Scotland has long been noted for the quality of its leeks, which, according to Laura Mason and Catherine Brown’s book The Taste of Britain, “are distinguished from others by their long leaf (green flag) and short blanch (white)” so the evolution is a sensible one, especially given how particularly good leeks are in soup. Dods is of the belief that “the soup must be very thick of leeks”, and like Clay, Kitchin and Grigson, adds the leeks early, so that “the first part of them [can be] boiled down into the soup until it becomes a green lubricious compound”. This is important to infuse the whole broth with their distinctive flavour, but testers aren’t keen on the mushy results after two hours in the pot, so, like Kitchin and Grigson, I’m going to discard these sacrificial alliums and replace them with fresh ones, although cooked rather longer than the two minutes Brown recommends, because no one likes a crunchy leek. Indeed, as most of the punch of this particular vegetable, Scottish or otherwise, is concentrated in the green part, it seems to make sense to follow Broon in adding the green parts first, reserving the sweeter blanch for eating. Waste not want not, as my non-Scottish grandma always said. Given this high leek content, onions, as used by Kitchin and Taylor, seem unnecessary, but testers do like the sweetness of the carrots in their recipes, which seems to bring out the same quality in the leeks themselves. Seasoning wise, I would like to keep things as simple as possible, so while bay feels as if it blends in, thyme and parsley are overdoing it – and use white pepper if possible for seasoning; the gentler heat works better. The carbs If you would like to bulk out the soup, then you could do worse than try Dods’s suggestion of thickening it with fine oatmeal, although Kitchin’s basmati rice and Brown’s potatoes are probably more likely to be to modern tastes. Although I don’t find any recipes using it, I’m going to add barley: its chewy texture and nutty taste are perfect with the other ingredients. The prunes Back to those prunes, an earlier part of the recipe, perhaps, than even the leeks, although Dods, writing in 1826, calls their addition “obsolete”, and the great Ena Baxter doesn’t even mention them in her recipe (which again, I have a Twitter user, Linda Isted, to thank for). I disagree; their plump sweetness is one of the things that sets cock-a-leekie apart from the many other chicken and vegetable soups in circulation, and links us to the surprisingly exotic tastes of the cooks that came before us on these islands. That said, I prefer them used as garnish, as in Kitchin’s recipe – cooking them in the soup does lend the broth sweetness, but threatens to overpower the delicate flavour of the chicken and leaves the prunes mushy and bland. And mushy and bland is no way to honour a saint. Perfect cock-a-leekie soup (Serves 4) 2 chicken legs 2 large leeks 1 large carrot 1 bay leaf 100g barley (optional) 25g soft, dried prunes Put the legs in a large pan with 2 litres of cold water and bring to the boil. Meanwhile, wash the leeks well and chop off the coarse green parts, reserving the whites for later. Wash and coarsely chop the carrot. Skim the liquid, then turn down the heat to a very gentle simmer and add the leek tops, carrot and bay leaf to the pan. Season with a good pinch of salt and white pepper and simmer for 2 hours. Remove the carrot, bay leaf and leek greens and discard. Add the barley if using and cook for 15 minutes, then chop the white part of the leek into chunky circles and add to the pan. Cook for about 15 minutes until the leeks and barley are soft. Meanwhile, roughly chop the prunes. Scoop out the chicken and season the soup to taste. Pick the chicken meat from the bones and divide between bowls along with the prunes, and then pour over the soup. Cock-a-leekie: how do you make this Scottish classic? (Or do you just open a tin of Baxters’ finest?) If you’re celebrating St Andrew’s Day, what’s on the menu? And does Scotland really make the best soups in Britain?"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"media/2017/nov/21/charlie-roses-cbs-colleagues-react-to-allegations-he-does-not-get-a-pass-here","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-21T15:47:09Z","webTitle":"Charlie Rose fired by CBS following allegations of serial sexual harassment","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/nov/21/charlie-roses-cbs-colleagues-react-to-allegations-he-does-not-get-a-pass-here","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2017/nov/21/charlie-roses-cbs-colleagues-react-to-allegations-he-does-not-get-a-pass-here","fields":{"headline":"Charlie Rose fired by CBS following allegations of serial sexual harassment","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Charlie Rose was fired by CBS News on Tuesday, as his colleagues reacted with shock and horror to allegations of serial sexual harassment made against the veteran TV news show anchor – and made it clear they believe the women. In a statement, the CBS News president, David Rhodes, said his behavior was “extremely disturbing and intolerable”. “What may once have been accepted should not ever have been acceptable.” Rose said in a statement on Monday: “I am greatly embarrassed. I have behaved insensitively at times, and I accept responsibility for that, though I do not believe that all of these allegations are accurate. I always felt that I was pursuing shared feelings, even though I now realize I was mistaken.” Asked if he has anything to say to the women who had accused him of “wrongdoings”, he replied: “It’s not wrongdoings.” Co-hosts of CBS This Morning Gayle King and Norah O’Donnell presented the show without their usual third team member, Rose, on Tuesday and broke away from their normal news reporting style to give raw, personal opinions on the behavior alleged against him. “This is a moment that demands a frank and honest assessment about where we stand and, more generally, the safety of women,” O’Donnell began. The show had opened with a straight news report on a story that now involved their own station. A CBS This Morning reporter related the facts that Rose, 75, had been suspended from his job while the company looks into detailed accusations from eight women that he had made unwanted sexual advances towards them, as revealed by the Washington Post. Allegations include lewd phone calls, walking around naked in their presence, or groping their breasts, buttocks or genital areas, and the women were employees or aspired to work for Rose at the Charlie Rose show from the late 1990s to 2011, the Post reported. “It takes a lot of courage for these women to come forward,” said O’Donnell. King chimed in with: “We hope they will continue to speak up.” O’Donnell continued: “Let me be very clear. There is no excuse for this alleged behavior. It’s systematic and pervasive. Women cannot achieve equality in the workplace or in society until there is a reckoning and a taking of responsibility … this has to end, this behavior is wrong.” She added that she was very proud to work for CBS, among “incredible people”. King said she had only had an hour and 42 minutes of sleep the previous night after the explosive revelations. She said her children had called her and her best friend, the TV star and actor Oprah Winfrey, had called her. “She said ‘are you OK?’ I’m not OK,” said King, adding that she found reading the report about Rose “troubling, disturbing and painful”. She said she had enjoyed a friendship and professional partnership with Rose for the past five years and had held him in high regard and was struggling with how to deal with the news. “That said, Charlie does not get a pass here, he does not get a pass from anyone in this room. We are all rocked by this,” King said. King added that she “applauded” the women who had spoken out. “I can’t stop thinking about the anguish to these women, what happened to their dignity … their bodies … maybe their careers,” she said. Both women said they intended to speak to Rose later on Tuesday."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2017/nov/25/saturdays-best-tv-joe-orton-laid-bear-witnesses-a-frozen-death","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-25T06:00:16Z","webTitle":"Saturday's best TV: Joe Orton Laid Bare; Witnesses: A Frozen Death","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/nov/25/saturdays-best-tv-joe-orton-laid-bear-witnesses-a-frozen-death","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2017/nov/25/saturdays-best-tv-joe-orton-laid-bear-witnesses-a-frozen-death","fields":{"headline":"Saturday's best TV: Joe Orton Laid Bare; Witnesses: A Frozen Death","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Strictly Come Dancing 6.50pm, BBC One It is back to base camp after last week’s Blackpool extravaganza and the seven couples who made it through face a new challenge.

Wish granted. Fifty years after his brutal murder at the hands of lover Kenneth Halliwell, this revealing, rude and melancholy film, featuring the playwright’s own words, explores his short but dazzling life and career, plus a performance of an unpublished “pornographic” playlet (“While you were diddling Auntie, I got carried away with several rolls of embroidery cotton”).

That bodes well, as does the presence of Spiral’s Audrey Fleurot, who plays an amnesiac, linked to 15 dead men found frozen aboard an abandoned bus. It’s a far-fetched set-up, but the level-headed Lieutenant Sandra Winkler (Marie Dompnier) is still on hand to investigate.

Since the last century, its users have been prosecuted as a way of clamping down on dissenting American voices, at a cost of billions. However, leniency around medical marijuana since the 1980s has changed the legal outlook. Four states have legalised recreational use, and markets are evolving. Corporate pot can’t be far away.

There he is presented with Alicia Vikander’s beautifully formed Ava, who is clearly a robot (you can see most of her mechanical bits), but does she have consciousness? Writer Alex Garland’s directorial debut creates a bright and gleaming, Kubrickian near-futureworld, in which an eerie love story unfolds.

Her shows, for all their simplicity, can be hard to pin down, but her words are telling: “I’m always looking for the heart of a story,” she says. This is a director who deals in feelings. To those not paying attention, Cookson landed like a bolt from the blue. Most directors cut through in their 30s, but she was in her 50s when her circus-heavy staging of Jacqueline Wilson’s Hetty Feather was nominated for an Olivier award in 2015. Her calling card, however, was a magnificent, two-part Jane Eyre, a total theatre treat that translated Charlotte Brontë’s book into movement and music, colour and light. Since its premiere at the Bristol Old Vic in 2014, more than 250,000 people have seen it on stage or on screen – possibly unprecedented for a piece of devised theatre. It’s why, last year, Cookson got the National Theatre’s Olivier stage for Christmas – arguably the biggest family slot of the year – to put on Peter Pan. This year, as a mark of her newfound bankability, Marianne Elliott’s new commercial company has backed her to bring Narnia to life in Leeds. The West Yorkshire Playhouse has even boosted its capacity for the purpose, transforming its 750-seat amphitheatre into a vast, 1,000-plus theatre in the round. Cookson’s late rise says much about British theatre. Long considered a leading light in children’s theatre, creating work with Bristol’s Travelling Light, she is also one of the UK’s best creators of devised theatre. Neither form tends to make the main stage. “Children’s literature has always been sidelined,” Cookson says over lunch. “It’s the same in theatre. It is not given the respect it deserves. We’re very snobbish about it. I wish I knew why.” If Cookson had her way, the Unicorn – a theatre devoted to work for young people – would be attached to the National and every subsidised theatre would have kids’ shows running year-round. “As I get older, I’m more and more interested in how we get people into the theatre.” It was Tom Morris, Bristol Old Vic’s artistic director, who encouraged her to venture on to the main stage after he saw Travelling Light’s show Boing!. “The way she uses time on stage allows her to release meaning and emotion in a very profound, very theatrical way,” he says. Cookson’s work has a rare musicality as a result. Every action is articulated and the whole thing simply flows. That is rooted in Cookson’s work for children. If a show goes slack for even a second, they switch off. She says: “It would be the most painful thing, presenting an early years’ show, to hear: ‘I’m bored. Had enough now. I want to go home.’ The pain of that. It meant I hadn’t done my job properly. But the joy of seeing a five-year-old properly gripped, that’s so overwhelmingly satisfying.” For her, it happened, aged five, mid-Cinderella in Leatherhead. The Good Fairy got her. “Her wand lit up and that was it. I can still see myself lifting off my chair.” The daughter of two actors, Cookson “knew very early on theatre was something I wanted to do”. She found school frustrating, itching “to be physical”, not tied to a desk. She lived for a weekly dance class. “I had this bright-blue leotard and pale-blue tights and I felt so powerful.” Training as an actor at the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art, she fell for physical theatre. “The idea you could create meaningful theatre without text, through movement and music, was a revelation.” After early successes, she became unhappy with acting. Rejection was frequent and the work was banal. Cookson craved a challenge and longed for the creative spark of her physical theatre classes. She found it in Bristol, acting in rep. When the local youth theatre disbanded due to cuts, she set up a summer school, charging £10 a day. “Youth theatre was such a hugely influential part of my life and I was really affected by the idea it could just disappear.” Cookson was soon running the programme all year. Her directing style remains rooted in that: learning on the job, working with groups. “I don’t have a rule book,” she explains. “Every process is different.” In Leeds, her rehearsal room is full: 50 people working, sometimes all together, sometimes in clumps. Writer Adam Peck peers over his laptop. Puppeteer Craig Leo looks on, arms folded, as a rudimentary Aslan snakes around the room, Chinese-dragon-style. Choreographer Dan Canham clicks out the beats as the cast crouch in sync and Benji Bower, Cookson’s long-time composer, improvises a score alongside the action. In their midst, in a denim smock and stripes, Cookson is herself like a composer, fine-tuning each element to find the right feeling. When they run a scene, it’s immediately captivating: every second taut, everything in sync. “In order for theatre to take us out of the ordinary, you have to approach it on a very practical level,” she explains. “You have to trust that the simple tools of theatre – and they can be very simple, a couple of notes, the way you move an object – will transcend the everyday. I’m often interested in how simple that can be. How can we best tell this story?” We, not I. Her shows really do start from scratch. Cookson arrives armed with questions, some practical (“How do we make a sleigh without a set?), some abstract (“What is winter in Narnia?”). The team finds answers together. “Nobody brings anything in until we’ve started those discussions,” she says. Morris believes that is crucial: “The whole company agrees what the story is and how they’re going to tell it, so you get this terrific ensemble focus. The story can exist beyond language.” So, what is at the heart of The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe? Not Christianity, says Cookson – she’s far more interested in its latent paganism, the way the seasons unfold from eternal winter to new warmth – but children. The aim is to make the Pevensies real. “They’re evacuees, part of Operation Pied Piper.” She points to two lines in the text, a fleeting nod to air raids in London. “They’re torn from their family, ripped from familiar, safe and loving surroundings and taken to a strange place of unknowns – even before they get to Narnia. Their father’s at war. These children are traumatised.” Narnia is an expression of that: a frozen world in stasis that is ruled by the autocratic White Witch. Although initially sceptical of staging the book – the BBC version loomed large – the idea of examining childhood at a time of turmoil, not least its resonance with today’s refugees, hooked in Cookson. “We’re in a world of so much chaos,” she says. “Families are still being ripped apart.” Next year, Cookson and her company will present A Monster Calls, an adaptation of Patrick Ness’s bestseller about a boy coming to terms with his mother’s cancer. Cookson wanted to stage the book as soon as she had finished it: “Through stories, he learns to cope.” When Matthew Warchus, the artistic director of the Old Vic in London, mentioned the novel to her, she says: “I pulled out the dog-eared copy I’d been carrying around and replied: ‘When can I start?’” Childhood is central to all Cookson’s work, whether it’s aimed at adults or children. “Looking at childhood lets you consider yourself in a very truthful way,” she says. “If you can’t investigate how you came to be who you are, if you deny your childhood or block it out, you can’t really reach a sense of yourself.” The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe is at West Yorkshire Playhouse, Leeds, from 29 November until 27 January."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"society/2017/nov/22/type-of-alcohol-determines-whether-you-become-merry-or-maudlin-study","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-22T06:30:12Z","webTitle":"Type of alcohol determines whether you become merry or maudlin – study","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/nov/22/type-of-alcohol-determines-whether-you-become-merry-or-maudlin-study","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2017/nov/22/type-of-alcohol-determines-whether-you-become-merry-or-maudlin-study","fields":{"headline":"Type of alcohol determines whether you become merry or maudlin – study","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"While indulging in booze can inspire cheerful merrymaking in some, for others it can lead to a tearful journey to the bottom of the glass. Now researchers say the emotions people feel when drinking could be linked to their tipple of choice. An international survey has revealed that spirits are often associated with feelings of energy, confidence and sexiness – but on the flip-side anger and tearfulness – while red wine is the drink most commonly linked to relaxation, but also tiredness. While the researchers say the reasons for the links are likely to be complex, they hope the study will urge individuals to think carefully about the alcohol they consume. “From a public health perspective a lot of the time we have focused on issues around cancer, heart disease and liver disease – but an important aspect is the balance of emotional outcomes that people are getting from alcohol,” said Mark Bellis, co-author of the research from Public Health Wales NHS Trust. The study, published in the journal BMJ Open, is based on an anonymous online questionnaire that was completed by individuals aged between 18 and 34 who had drunk alcohol in the previous year. Part of an international survey on alcohol and drug use, the questions probed the type of alcohol drunk and associated emotions, and were asked in 11 different languages, with participants taking part from 21 countries around the world. The results, based on answers from almost 30,000 participants who had reported consuming both red and white wine as well as beer and spirits in the past year, reveal that certain types of alcoholic drink appear to be linked to particular emotions. Almost 53% of participants said drinking red wine made them feel relaxed – an emotion that was also linked to beer by nearly 50% of participants, and white wine by nearly 33%. By contrast, spirits were linked to feelings of confidence by just over 59% of participants, energy by more than 58% and sexiness by just over 42%. However, spirits were also more likely to be linked to negative feelings including tearfulness, with almost 48% of participants linking such tipples to feeling ill and nearly 30% to aggression. Meanwhile, more than 60% of participants said they linked red wine to feeling tired. White wine was the tipple least often linked to tearfulness, with only 10% saying they associated it with becoming weepy. “By and large spirits are having a stronger relationship in pretty well all of the outcomes – apart from those associated with red wine, around relaxation and tiredness,” said Bellis. Further analysis, taking into account age and other factors, revealed that women were generally more likely to report feeling the various emotions on drinking alcohol, with men more likely to report feelings of aggression. The proportion of participants reporting the various emotions, both positive and negative, generally increased with overall heaviness of drinking. Further differences were found for the various drinks when participants’ age, educational background and sex were considered. Drinking was found more likely to be linked to feelings of relaxation and tiredness when done at home; confidence, sexiness, energy – and feeling ill or aggressive – were more likely when out. However, the study had limitations, not least that it drew on a self-selecting group of participants, meaning it might have appealed to those more likely to take drugs and drink. It also did not take into account how much participants drank on any one occasion or whether they mixed drinks, and relied on participants thinking back to how they felt at the time. What’s more, it is not clear whether the alcohol itself triggered the emotions, or whether the social situation also played a role, while the concentration of the alcohol, presence of other ingredients, and people’s expectations of the drinks could also be important factors. Matt Field, professor of psychology at the University of Liverpool who was not involved in the research, said that the study was valuable, and agreed with the authors that it would be interesting to explore whether they way in which different drinks are advertised might affect the emotions people link to them. But, he said, it was far from clear that spirits were more likely than other alcoholic drinks to make people aggressive. “Because it is a cross-sectional snapshot there are a lot of things that might explain it,” he said. “It could be that people who are more prone to aggression after alcohol might favour spirits for reasons that we don’t know.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/nov/25/all-i-want-for-christmas-sali-hughes-meera-sodha-jess-cartner-morley","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-25T09:00:19Z","webTitle":"All I want for Christmas... by Sali Hughes, Meera Sodha and Jess Cartner-Morley","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/nov/25/all-i-want-for-christmas-sali-hughes-meera-sodha-jess-cartner-morley","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/nov/25/all-i-want-for-christmas-sali-hughes-meera-sodha-jess-cartner-morley","fields":{"headline":"All I want for Christmas... by Sali Hughes, Meera Sodha and Jess Cartner-Morley","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Sali Hughes and her friend Julia Marcus Julia I met Sal in the early 90s, when she landed in London from south Wales. She was in her teens and I was in my late 20s, and we bonded over a shared love of Madonna, Billy Wilder, Clinique lipsticks and rubbish catchphrases. She moved into my flat in Paddington about 27 years ago, and the stockings began. The first exchange would have definitely included an avocado or mango Body Shop body butter. My all-time favourite item from Sali was a Brenda from Beverly Hills 90210 action figure; we were obsessed with the show, and with Brenda in particular, so this was a massive score. It’s not about being grand and spendy. My biggest thrill is finding some gorgeous three-quid lip balm that has flown below her radar. That is the ultimate achievement. Sali We exchange stockings in early December, but open them last thing on Christmas Day. My children know that my stocking from Auntie Julia (my eldest’s godmother) is to remain untouched until everyone else is snoozing in front of the telly. Then we’ll text each other and enjoy “our” moment. We peel off the wrapping slowly, then have a full and grateful debrief on what we liked best, where the treasures were found, and laugh at the occasional duplicates. Often, the contents and its wrapping are themed: kitsch, music, the colour red. There’s always a mug (we’re both tea fanatics and exacting in our requirements). There’s always an unusual decoration or bauble. We enjoy the challenge of finding things the other hasn’t spotted (Julia is obsessed with discovering a lip product I don’t know about). I never go anywhere without keeping my eyes peeled for something quirky to surprise her with. Last year, I got her a beautiful tin of nappy rash ointment in Berlin. The joy for me is in the bonding ritual. It’s a closeness we alone share, and the stockings reflect our changing lives, interests and circumstances. When one of us has been hard up, it’s never an issue. Life ebbs and flows, but our love for each other is constant, comforting and dependable. Meera Sodha and her husband, Hugh Meera When you start going out with someone, establishing the rules of engagement around Christmas is an important hurdle. Luckily, we started dating in January, so I had 11 months on the run-up before taking the plunge. We both splurged in that first year: he bought me a Paul McCarthy artist’s edition from the Whitechapel Gallery and I bought him a nice watch to replace his Casio F-12. Each year, we agree to tone it down. But, as November creeps into December, the nervous conversations start. I find him tricky to buy for; he doesn’t like to have many possessions, so I tend towards buying him experiences. We’ve agreed limits when it hasn’t felt appropriate to splash out, such as in the year we got married. That year, he printed a hundred photos from our five years together and stuck them in a notebook with little captions and in-jokes . It was perfect, but wildly antisocial, because I sat by the Christmas tree for half an hour laughing (and crying) by myself. I have a notebook of drawings: what my perfect suitcase might look like; what rooms my theoretical social club might have; clothes I’d like to wear. Last year, Hugh chose material from Liberty and asked me to design an outfit, which he then had made up. It will be hard to top that. Hugh It’s the same pattern every year. I start relaxed, knowing that somewhere out there is something that will brighten her world and she will cherish for years to come. Then I slink into a cold sweat; I’ve got nowhere. However, I remain loyal to one rule: I must surprise her. My favourite present was the photo book I made a couple of years ago of our time together. Seeing her thumb through the pages, champagne glass in hand, smiling and giggling, is something I will never forget. Life is often a blur, but in that moment we both stopped and realised the sheer wonderfulness of our two worlds colliding in 2010. Jess Cartner-Morley and her sister, Alice Jess I have always thought that I enjoy buying presents for Alice mainly because she is a pure joy of a human being and she deserves them, plus a little bit because I am nice. Looking at this photo, it strikes me that there is probably another reason I love shopping for her: we look similar and we have a similar aesthetic. So, when I shop for her, I get to buy stuff I really like. I don’t remember buying presents for each other as children. I do remember identifying strongly with the big-sister badger in Russell Hoban’s A Birthday For Frances, who spends her pocket money on chocolate for her little sister’s birthday, but ends up eating it herself. But since we were teenagers, I have always loved spending money on her, even when I didn’t have any. I have no idea how I afforded the Stella McCartney dress I bought for her 21st. I’m fussy about clothes, funnily enough. Almost no one other than Alice would dare buy clothes for me sight unseen (and that’s the way I like it) but she never gets it wrong. Often, she buys me classic pieces: monogrammed pyjamas; for my 40th, a vintage art deco J on a gold chain. But her fashion taste is slightly more adventurous than mine. My birthday is in June and she once bought me a summer dress in chambray denim with a rope halter neck. When I opened it, I wasn’t sure at all. But that was eight years ago and I’ve never been on holiday without it. Alice For my 21st, Jess gave me a Tiffany heart necklace – this was the 1990s – and a red, silk Stella McCartney slip dress. That set the bar for gifting between us. She is my favourite person to buy for, which is partly about showing how much I love her, but also because I know her taste. Because I am confident I will choose things she likes, shopping is exciting. It helps that she is a magpie, rather than a minimalist, so she is always excited by a new set of salt and pepper shakers or another insane tasselled earring. She’s the only adult I know who gets as overexcited as I do about Christmas."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/dec/08/life-in-sex-davy-jones-david-cassidy-post-menopausal-woman","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-08T10:00:35Z","webTitle":"My life in sex: ‘I fantasise about Davy Jones, David Cassidy and David Essex’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/dec/08/life-in-sex-davy-jones-david-cassidy-post-menopausal-woman","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/dec/08/life-in-sex-davy-jones-david-cassidy-post-menopausal-woman","fields":{"headline":"My life in sex: ‘I fantasise about Davy Jones, David Cassidy and David Essex’","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Since 2010, my sex life has been 3D, retro and virtual. It involves Davy Jones of the Monkees, David Essex and David Cassidy, all as they were between 1971 and 1975. They arrive in my head, resplendent in flares and tank tops, gazing out through smoky, heavily lashed eyes and whispering in deep, dark tones that can only be detected by the ear of a teenage girl. I try to arrange my fantasy schedule so they don’t arrive at once. This isn’t always possible, and I am then presented with the option of a mix-and-match experience, or making them queue. We always start with a date. The cinema, a Chinese meal or a disco. If Mum and Dad are at bingo, we stay home and indulge in a Vesta Chow Mein and Bird’s Trifle. Although fiercely jealous, each David has learned to tolerate the pictures of the other Davids on my bedroom wall. Each is passionate, adoring, powerful, sensitive and generous. Our love-making is light yet intense, each David taking me to places only we have shared; our special places. Each thinks only of me, always. All songs are written for me alone, and in every photo shoot for Jackie magazine, he is looking down the camera just at me. Afterwards, we smoke a Player’s No 6 (without inhaling), and discuss plans for a honeymoon in Marbella. I am saving Mum’s Green Shield stamps for a canteen of cutlery. I sometimes worry that I am using them, that spending all this time with me will prevent them from meeting others.

It's the best job I've ever had","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"When I took on the main role of caring for my dad, I recognised I had become part of the “sandwich generation” but I didn’t imagine that stage in my life would lead to a new career. A GP practice manager for much of my early working life, I had taken a step back to raise my daughter. In 2003, Dad’s health deteriorated, with heart problems and Parkinson’s disease. My siblings helped and visited him when they could but I lived the closest and had more time, so it made sense for me to help out the most. I’d always thought of care as helping people who need to be taken to the toilet or helped into bed each evening. What I was doing was sitting and talking, going to the supermarket or helping with housework. What I didn’t see at that time was the truth in front of me, that I had actually been delivering relationship-led care and companionship. I feel privileged to have spent that time caring for Dad, and in many ways I got to know more about him over those five years than I might otherwise have done. It came completely naturally to me, but in my mind being a care worker was something very different, so after Dad passed away and I felt ready to get back to work, I discounted it. I had a strong CV after my time in the NHS and felt ready for a new role. I felt I had lots to offer, but I was being told different. I went for many interviews but none led to a job offer. Then the real “What’s the point?” moment came. I went for a job as a GP receptionist and, despite 12 years as a practice manager, was told I’d need to retrain in all areas of office work as I was classed as unskilled. My self-esteem and confidence hit rock bottom. I drifted along with a few cleaning jobs, feeling that was how the rest of my working life would pan out. I felt professionally bruised but my career watershed came when I saw an ad in the local paper looking for care givers to work with seniors. It reignited a spark I’d felt looking after Dad. It made me start to think seriously about a new career path in adult social care. I called and found that Home Instead Senior Care has a values-led recruitment approach: it is looking for people with compassion and empathy – the core character traits to do the job – rather than necessarily looking for previous experience. The fact that I didn’t have qualifications in care wasn’t held against me. Far from feeling like I was on the professional scrapheap, I could see a new future and, despite being 56, had a personal development plan too. I carried over the need to have a spirit of understanding from my healthcare career into the new role. It’s important to build a relationship with clients as everything hinges on that. Some people aren’t ready to accept they need extra help, so I take everything at a pace they’re happy with. I care for six clients, working four days a week. One is centenarian Peggy, who I see on Wednesdays. I help with the morning routine: getting out of bed, bathing, dressing then making breakfast. Peggy loves poetry and I read to her most weeks. Whether it’s Wordsworth, Keats or Pam Ayres, we will often say the words together. She’s remarkable. Everything I do is about giving people the confidence to carry on with what they love, but with the reassurance that someone is there. It may be as simple as standing outside the bathroom door while they bathe, but it’s encouraging them to do things they otherwise wouldn’t have the confidence to do – and it’s about building trust. The best thing about working in the care sector is really getting to know my clients: it’s wonderful to build that relationship and to hear and share in their life stories. The most surprising thing about caregiving with has been the support I’ve received. There are opportunities to progress further and full training is given for everything.This job is the best thing I’ve ever done. It’s given me back professional purpose and I’ve never done anything more rewarding. Join the Social Care Network for comment, analysis and job opportunities, direct to your inbox.

You would think that, after witnessing the monstrosities that were Andy the Talking Hedgehog, A Talking Cat!?! and Kevin Spacey’s Nine Lives, producers would run a giddy mile from such a flat-out dismal genre. And yet. Not only is there a new contender in town, but it might be the most inexplicable of them all. The film in question is Best Friend from Heaven and ... look, perhaps it’s better if we go through its trailer scene by scene. 1 Meet Gabe. He’s an adorable dog with a kind face. Better yet, his wonderful owner is about to get married. Honestly, it just feels as if nothing could ever possibly go wrong. Oh, no, wait. This film is called Best Friend from Heaven, isn’t it? Right, scrap all that. Someone is about to die. 2 Fortunately, it’s Gabe. We don’t see Gabe being hit by a car as he chases a squirrel into the middle of a busy road, but the look of abject horror on his owner’s face – combined with a sound effect so startlingly graphic that it’s bound to stop your children from sleeping for several weeks – suggests that this is what has happened. Really, it’s for the best. Would you want to see a film about a dog pining away to nothing because his owner was killed and his heart is broken? No, of course you wouldn’t. It’s much better if the dog dies. 3 Remember, though, this film is called Best Friend from Heaven, so Gabe doesn’t die. Instead, he becomes an angel, complete with glassy, taxidermy-style eyes, a mouth that opens and shuts as though it has been hooked up to a wire and a grizzled, old human voice that gives him the ability to communicate in a bored, distracted way, almost like the things he says are being read absent-mindedly from a sheet of paper for the first time without any kind of rehearsal. Anyway, Gabe, unhappy with his new life in heaven, escapes the vengeful clutches of the lord God and returns to Earth. 4 There, he discovers something truly terrible. His owner has been so bludgeoned by grief – and, hopefully, guilt at not keeping Gabe in a more secure environment – that she has called off the wedding. He tries to intervene, but he is invisible to them. As they hug, he pulls a face that makes it look a bit like he’s doing a ghost-dump on their lawn and remembers the message of Quantum Leap. If he can put things right and make his owner get married, perhaps he will come back to life. 5 Oh, incidentally, Gabe’s distracted old-man voice is performed by Kris Kristofferson. Who knows why. It may be that he hopes to use this film as a way to start marketing his music to children. It may be that he really likes crudely exploitative films with undefined spiritual messages. Perhaps he wants to make sure that people don’t talk about only Heaven’s Gate when he dies. Either way, here’s Kristofferson being a dog. Ta-dah. 6 Anyway, long story short, Gabe rounds up a team of local kooks, who organise a ramshackle wedding behind his grieving owner’s back and force through the marriage by some feat of cruel manipulation, which seems to give away the entire plot of the film. At least everyone is happy. And Gabe? Well, the final shot of the trailer is Gabe running back to heaven, so it seems he didn’t get his wish to came back to life. Yes, that’s the one thing you should take from Best Friend from Heaven, kids: death is for ever and you can’t escape its icy tendrils, no matter how hard you plead with God."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"books/2017/nov/25/jeffrey-eugenides-interview","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-25T12:00:23Z","webTitle":"Jeffrey Eugenides: ‘I’m not trying to compete with the outrageousness of Trump’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/nov/25/jeffrey-eugenides-interview","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2017/nov/25/jeffrey-eugenides-interview","fields":{"headline":"Jeffrey Eugenides: ‘I’m not trying to compete with the outrageousness of Trump’","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"In 2005, before Hurricane Katrina, or the subprime mortgage crisis, or the succession of the first black president by a reality TV star braggart, Jeffrey Eugenides wrote: “One’s country was like oneself, the more you learned about it, the more there was to be ashamed about.” That sentence constitutes the dark heart of a sly yet pathos-packed tale called “Great Experiment” in Fresh Complaint, his recently published first collection of short stories. Twelve years on, surely American national shame is greater than any personal shame? “Oh it’s gotta be equal,” Eugenides sighs. “We all have a slave history past,” and then he laughs sadly. “I think that kind of inventory is endless in both directions – personally and nationally. Right now, perhaps it’s easier to pay attention to the national side of things, but they kind of go hand in hand, don’t they? There are going to be personal blots that plague you as you try to figure out how to negotiate and navigate current events and meet your fellow citizen on the street. A nation is just a bunch of people, so all the problems that happen in the nation are personal, on some level.” He’s speaking in a library in a new building on the campus of Princeton University, where Eugenides, who is now 57, has taught for a decade. The building is not quite finished: with a proper sign yet to come, someone has scrawled “unisex” on a sheet of paper and taped it to the toilet door – a reminder of how much campus life, if not US life at large, has changed in the last 10 years. When Eugenides was on tour for his novel Middlesex, which won the Pulitzer prize in 2003 and remains the most beloved by his readers, he often had to explain what “intersex” meant. The book, which double-helixes ancient myth with cutting-edge science, is the story of Calliope, who’s raised as a girl and becomes a man, Cal. In interviews, Eugenides used the phrase “hermaphroditic imagination”, by which he meant a writer’s ability to inhabit both male and female perspectives. That hermaphroditic imagination is at play in the final, title story of Fresh Complaint, in which a middle-aged, white British professor and a teenage Indian-American girl are granted equal, compassionate weight. We live in a time of acute anxiety about who has a right to tell whose stories. Fresh Complaint is a sensitive, subtle and painful take on the sexual power dynamics between student and professor. None of that, however, would necessarily stop an aggrieved Twitter user excoriating a white, middle-aged American man for writing in the voice of a teenage girl of colour. “I became a fiction writer for maximum freedom of imagination,” Eugenides says, with calm conviction. “I think most writers feel that way. We don’t want to be limited. You know, internally, what you can and can’t do, for the most part. So when you’re searching around for different characters, sometimes you know, ‘I just can’t go there’ – you can feel it in your head, imagination stymied – and so you don’t do it. That’s the only thing that I respect. I don’t respect someone outside telling me what I’m able to do and what I’m not. Every writer I know, of every race and persuasion, has always told me the same thing. So the only question is, can you do it and will it ring true?” The stories in Fresh Complaint ring truest in their depictions of human failure. In “Great Experiment”, an intelligent and hitherto scrupulous poet is perturbed by the sudden wealth around him. Eugenides, who was living in Chicago when he wrote it, remembers wondering: “How are all these guys making all this money, why is everyone getting all this money, I’m not getting all this money!” He laughs. “And so, I started writing this story and made it about a poet who feels this is happening to him and he’s driven to a – it’s kind of a Breaking Bad before Breaking Bad.” Like his fictional poet, Eugenides started reading Alexis de Tocqueville’s prophetic Democracy in America, the classic early 19th-century study of the nation’s new government. “I knew something strange was going on in the country and I wanted to counterpose that to what the country had wanted to be and in a certain case was in its beginnings,” he says. “Now it seems to me that story is even more relevant because we’re in an even worse state and further from any sort of ideal.” As his character observes: “Victory was what counted, power, muscularity, doublespeak if necessary. You saw it in the way people drove, in the way they cut you off, gave you the finger, cursed. Women and men alike, showing rage and toughness.” The incumbent president may seem like a grotesque incarnation of this bullying aggression. The question now impelling and stymieing US fiction is how to respond to a world that, in its absurdity and horror, seems to have superseded reality. Eugenides points out that this feeling is not exclusive to the Trump era. He cites the 1961 essay Writing American Fiction in which a youngish Philip Roth sees Richard Nixon on TV as “a satiric literary creation” and admits to feeling a “professional envy”. “So he felt that back in the tame 60s!” says Eugenides. “It’s even more the case now.” Nonetheless, he does not, unlike Roth, feel, “in competition with events”. In fact, “sometimes I think that I don’t even want to stay abreast of what’s happening because if you take in the same nutrition as everyone else you’ll produce the same …” he hesitates, delicately, “… milk.” He laughs. “I’m going for ‘milk’.” He continues: “It’s not my main worry: trying to compete with the outrageousness of Trump with something outrageous of my own. Right now, I think we’re in need of a certain amount of calm and tranquillity, and that’s what I try to provide with writing. I’m more and more interested in clarity and thoughtfulness in fiction, rather than in spectacle or gimmickry. Just a voice that’s companionable and speaking to you on some reassuring level.” Eugenides, who was born in Detroit in 1960, grew up, “around rusted, rotting factories and that’s all there was”. He’s been pondering how his traditionally Democrat home state of Michigan fell to Trump in January. “If you grow up in the midwest and you see all of your cities falling apart, the industries moving off and you don’t think you’re getting ahead you might veer wildly in your votes.” He talks about the difficulty of maintaining an openness to other people’s experiences. “How do you react, in a country that’s so divided, politically? Do you demonise the other? Do you try and empathise and understand the other people? It calls for a level of empathy that is hard to maintain. Human beings don’t want to do it so much outside of their tribe. In order to move forward as a diverse society you have to be able to think of everybody as part of your tribe, and that’s just hard for human beings to do.” What about the events in Charlottesville this summer, though? Does he think empathy should be extended to white supremacists? “I think you have to be ready to oppose actions and belief systems, but maybe not oppose the people who have those belief systems, and maybe have the belief that there is some possibility of redemption, at least in enough of those people that then the country begins to pull together again.” It’s an ethically sound answer, the sort that Mitchell Grammaticus in The Marriage Plot, Eugenides’ third novel, might give. Mitchell travels to India to volunteer with Mother Teresa as part of a rigorous spiritual reckoning. Faced with having to deal with a sick man’s bedpan, and knowing he will “regret this moment for a long time, maybe for the rest of his life”, he runs, “up the steps to the bright, fallen world above”. As a young man, Eugenides also volunteered in Mother Teresa’s centre in Kolkata. Like Mitchell, he felt he failed. The words “bright fallen world above” seem to contain a perverse sort of redemption for Mitchell, a reconciliation to living in a fallible world, partially absolved by brightness. “Yeah I guess it’s that, but it’s also, gaudy things are ‘bright’,” he says, adding, “I’m not built for the sun.” And yet he’s just made a commitment to, well, sunniness. This announcement comes proudly. Fellow Princeton faculty member Joyce Carol Oates recently noted how cheerful he seemed. “And I said, ‘Yeah, I’ve decided I’m going to be cheerful from now on. I just decided.’ And she said: ‘Usually you’re so sombre.’ So I’ve had three days now of this vow of cheerfulness. I can imagine some kind of ‘moody’, maybe. But uniformly sombre? That seemed a bit strong. Maybe I’ve been in her novels as a sombre person and didn’t recognise myself!” For all the brio of his inventiveness and the originality of his ambition, there is a sombre current in his novels – not moodiness, but moral seriousness. In The Marriage Plot, Mitchell reads The Interior Castle by Saint Teresa of Ávila, a mystic 16th-century text in which the soul is compared to a crystal palace. Speaking about Middlesex in 2007, Eugenides said: “I saw the entire structure of the book in crystalline form inside my head. The elegance of this structure bewitched me. When I felt like giving up – and I did almost give up, many times – the thought of that crystal palace in the distance kept me plodding.” Does a novel, then, have the same profundity for him as a human soul? “I think there are correspondences. Saint Teresa talks about this palace made of crystal, but most of the time you’re outside the palace and you’re a slimy creature crawling through weeds trying to get into the palace and cleanse yourself and little by little trying to get to the centre of its radiance.” He pauses. “That’s what it feels like writing a novel. One would hope you’re purifying your soul as you’re purifying your work. That sounds a bit exalted. I don’t think writers are exemplars of behaviour, but I don’t know any other way to analyse my life, to see myself more clearly, make changes about my behaviour …” He brightens: “… become cheerful because I decide to – other than writing.” • Fresh Complaint by Jeffrey Eugenides is published by Fourth Estate.

Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stane is terrific. The Scots version of JK Rowling’s debut, to be published this Thursday by Itchy Coo, is the 80th language into which the novel has been translated. But what is the point? After all, anyone who can read the book in Scots will already be able to read it in English. This is not just a translation, though. Matthew Fitt, the translator, has applied a defibrillator to Rowling’s flatlined text and made it come alive. Take the introduction of Harry’s uncle, Mr Dursley. No longer is he the director of a firm that makes drills; he is, in fact, the “heidbummer” – a word which is not only funnier, but better conveys his professional smugness. When the Dursleys try to keep their nephew from his magical destiny by fleeing on a stormy sea, the journey is described thus: “Icy spindrift and rain creepit doon their craigies and a cranreuch wund whuppit their faces.” Some will recognise that word “cranreuch” – cold – from the Burns poem To a Mouse. Other Scots parents may simply be glad of the chance to read Harry Potter as a bedtime story without being bored into slumber themselves. Fitt has taken liberties with names. The sport of Quidditch is now Bizzumbaw, a “bizzum” being a broom (as well as a fine Scots insult) and “baw” being ball. The Sorting Hat becomes the Bletherin Bunnet. Albus Dumbledore is renamed Dumbiedykes – an in-joke for those who know that is an area of Edinburgh, the city where Rowling wrote the book. Dumbiedykes is one of the few characters brave enough to call Voldemort by name; most think it safer to refer to him as You-Ken-Wha. According to the 2011 census, there are more than 1.5 million Scots speakers. However, the question of whether it is a language or a dialect of English is sometimes hotly disputed, in part as a proxy for the independence question. For Fitt, who was belted at school for using Scots (not uncommon among those of his generation or older), the novel is a statement about the status of Scots that he hopes will boost the self-esteem of children: “If the way they speak is in a Harry Potter book, it must be OK.” The translation uses “standard Scots” – words and sounds used throughout Scotland, without regional variation. The exception is Hagrid, who is Dundonian. The classic illustration of the flattened vowels of Dundee is that natives say “peh” for “pie”, the totemic foodstuff of the city. “Unfortunately nae pehs appear in the book,” says Fitt. “But had there been, Hagrid would have been straight into them.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2017/nov/21/robert-mugabe-impeachment-proceedings-begin-in-zimbabwe-emmerson-mnangagwa","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-21T14:40:14Z","webTitle":"Impeachment proceedings against Mugabe begin in Zimbabwe","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/nov/21/robert-mugabe-impeachment-proceedings-begin-in-zimbabwe-emmerson-mnangagwa","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/nov/21/robert-mugabe-impeachment-proceedings-begin-in-zimbabwe-emmerson-mnangagwa","fields":{"headline":"Impeachment proceedings against Mugabe begin in Zimbabwe","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Zimbabwe’s parliament has begun impeachment proceedings against Robert Mugabe as it attempts to strip him of the presidency after 37 years in power. Shortly before legislators met, the man expected to succeed him broke more than a week of silence to add his voice to those calling for the ageing leader to step down. Emmerson Mnangagwa, until recently Mugabe’s vice-president and right hand man, urged the nonagenarian leader to “accept the will of the people”. Thousands of Zimbabweans turned up outside parliament to urge on MPs, chanting, dancing and waving placards in Africa Unity square. “Mugabe: today is the first day of the rest of your life,” read one. “MPs: You are our salvation,” said another. “We want the guy to go home and rest. We will be very angry if he does not get impeached. Mugabe cannot be part of any solution here,” said Earl Ndawana, a 37 year old graphic designer who had taken a day off from work to attend the rally.” He said that even at 75, Mnangagwa would be a welcome change from 93 year-old Mugabe. “He is young and energetic, at least compared to what we had.” The ruling Zanu-PF party, which at the weekend voted to make Mnangagwa its leader and demote Mugabe to a rank-and-file member, introduced the motion to impeach and the opposition seconded it. Parliament and senate then adjourned to a special session in a nearby conference centre, because both houses must meet together to remove a president from office and there is no chamber big enough in their usual base. When they moved between the two, the carnival of protestors followed, celebrating the coming downfall of a man who just a week ago seemed to wield absolute power, but now has party and government lined up against him. Mugabe has refused to resign six days after military seized power, but in the latest blow to his efforts to cling on to power, just a handful of ministers turned up for a cabinet meeting he called for Tuesday morning. Almost all his cabinet are also senior party members, and were ordered to stay away. “There are some sad moments given what the old man has done to transform the lives of the people of Zimbabwe but he should rest now,” said David Chapfika, Zanu-PF MP for Mutombo South. It was a line that matched the case for impeachment against Mugabe, which looks set to focus heavily on his age and the machinations of his wife Grace -- for “usurping constitutional power”, leaving a man who is still respected as a hero of the liberation struggle against colonial rule as much dignity as possible. Zimbabwe’s political and military establishment appears wary of formally forcing Mugabe from office at the barrel of a gun, even after the military effectively took over the country, because of the censure and sanctions a coup can trigger. The focus now is on attempts to remove him from power in a constitutional fashion, with the support of regional powers. Botswana’s president Ian Khama took to Twitter to issue an unconventional appeal to Mugabe to step down. “The people of Zimbabwe have for a long time been subjected to untold suffering as a result of poor governance under your leadership,” wrote Khama, whose own father Seretse Khama was a contemporary of Mugabe’s, and hero of the region’s struggle for independence for colonial rule. “I therefore reiterate my appeal to you to honourably step aside, if you really care for them, as you profess, and if you cannot find it in you to do so.” On Wednesday Zimbabwe is also expecting a delegation from the regional South African Development Mnangagwa also said he backed impeachment as an “ultimate expression of the will of the people outside an election.” He fled into exile earlier this month after being ousted from his position in government and Zanu-PF by a faction allied to Grace Mugabe and warned of plans to “eliminate me”. His supporters are widely believed to be behind the coup. He had spoken to Mugabe on the phone, and told him he needed to step down after huge demonstrations in Harare on Saturday and the party vote to remove him showed he no longer had a popular mandate. “He must now accept the will of the people and resign,” the statement said. Mnangagwa has been absent since the military takeover. In the written statement, which still gave no clue to his whereabouts. But in a sign that Zimbabwe’s political turmoil is far from settled and despite the many headlines hailing the end of Mugabe’s rule, Mnangagwa signalled that he would not yet be returning to Zimbabwe. “I will be returning home as soon as the right conditions for security and stability prevail,” he said. He also made what appeared to be an appeal to opposition politicians and their supporters, laying out his vision for a “new Zimbabwe” he said was a national, not party political, project. “In that new Zimbabwe it is important for everyone to join hands so that we rebuild this nation to its full glory, this is not a job for Zanu-PF alone but for all people of Zimbabwe,” the statement said. Mnangagwa may need that support in parliament. Zanu-PF has a majority it barely reaches the two-thirds majority needed to push the impeachment motion through, and some of its MPs have vanished or been arrested in the wake of the coup. Mugabe stunned the southern African country by failing to resign as expected in a televised speech on Sunday night. Instead, his rambling address offered no substantial concessions to the tens of thousands of people who have marched calling for his resignation, though it did exonerate the army commanders who led the military takeover last week. It is unclear how long the procedure to impeach the president might take but it is likely to last several days. If it is passed, Mugabe, who as president is also commander-in-chief of the armed forces, would then be reduced to the status of any other citizen. Grace Mugabe, 52, has not been seen since the takeover. Sources told the Guardian she was in her husband’s Harare residence when he was detained on Tuesday and had not moved since."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/nov/22/why-railway-signal-failure-so-common","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-22T11:30:18Z","webTitle":"Why is railway ‘signal failure’ so common now, when it was so rare in the 1950s? | Notes and queries","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/nov/22/why-railway-signal-failure-so-common","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/nov/22/why-railway-signal-failure-so-common","fields":{"headline":"Why is railway ‘signal failure’ so common now, when it was so rare in the 1950s?","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"When I was a trainspotter in the 50s and 60s, railway signals were mostly of the semaphore type operated by wires and men in signal boxes, and I don’t remember “signal failure” ever being a cause of disruption to services, whereas nowadays it is a daily occurrence.

Yet from poinsettias to potted Christmas trees, many of these festive favourites can be extremely hard to keep alive in the conditions of the average living room for just a few weeks, let alone year to year. There is, however, a really old-school, and often overlooked, seasonal houseplant that is made from much tougher stuff: the beautiful and exotic Christmas cactus (Schlumbergera truncata and S x buckleyi). These two species (which look so similar that they share a common name) hail from the cool mountains of southeastern Brazil, where they are pollinated by hummingbirds. Unusually for a cactus, they aren’t a desert plant, but have adapted to grow on the boughs of tall rainforest trees, festooning their branches with weeping foliage and dazzling flowers. This relatively cool-weather habitat is surprisingly similar to the conditions of our British living rooms, making them perfectly adapted to thrive in hanging baskets or trail over windowsills everywhere. But what does a cactus have to do with Christmas? Not a great deal, really. In fact, in their native habitat their winter-flowering period doesn’t even coincide with Christmas. However, fortunately for gardeners like me, their habit of bursting into the most spectacular of floral displays from November to January occurs just when I need it most. Even when the blooms have faded, their beautiful architectural form means they look great year-round, from an easy-growing, affordable, widely available species. All this on plants with holly-like foliage, without any of hint of prickles. Sounds like a good deal to me! Unlike other members of their family, Christmas cacti have adapted to be forest dwellers, so although they love bright light they prefer to be kept away from searing summer sunshine. How much is too much? Fortunately, the plants will tell you, as they start producing red pigments in their foliage as a chemical sunscreen if they aren’t happy. If you see this, simply move them a little further from the window. High in the forest canopy, the only water the plants receive is the little that sticks to branches, making them more drought tolerant than many houseplants. A good guide is to keep the soil just moist to the touch, but never wet feeling, using a free-draining growing media. It was once thought that careful control of watering and temperature was essential to initiate flowering, but research has shown that this isn’t the case. Plants will start to bloom as soon as the light levels start to dip in autumn. Aside from a liquid feed in the summer, that is all you’ll need to do for flowers year after year.

Now they’ve given the green light to Theresa May to double her offer to settle our obligations to the EU, to a rumoured £40bn. Meanwhile, tomorrow’s budget is likely to confirm that the health service is being starved of funds. But that’s not the end of the story. When the final Brexit bill comes in, it is likely to reach about £80bn – double the prime minister’s latest offer. Not that the government will come clean on this, as it is trying to head off a backlash by Tory backbenchers unhappy that even the £40bn agreed at yesterday’s Brexit cabinet subcommittee is too much. If they realised how much we are going to end up paying, they really would go “bananas” as one MP put it. The government is hoping to defuse opposition from within its own ranks by suggesting the money will come with strings attached: it will be conditional on the EU agreeing a good trade deal or, more realistically, at least agreeing to talk about a future trade deal. May’s new offer could be enough to break the deadlock in the talks at next month’s crucial summit – provided she doesn’t say it’s a “final offer” or add unrealistic conditions to it. After all, the other EU countries have said they will be prepared to move on to talking about our future relationship once “sufficient progress” has been made on the three key divorce issues: money, citizens’ rights and Ireland. Our government’s failure to come up with any practical solutions to the Irish question may yet keep the talks frozen. But, looking at the money issue alone, the EU could well decide that a £40bn offer amounts to sufficient progress, without accepting that that is the end of the matter. And that means the final bill is likely to rise. After all, the EU would come back to the money issue towards the end of the talks. Once we had sketched out the broad framework of our future relationship, and the transitional period to get there, it would push hard to get the extra £10-20bn it says we owe. Given that May would by then be desperate to clinch a deal, she would probably fold. But even that wouldn’t be the final bill, because the prime minister hasn’t been realistic about something else: the two-year transitional period she is asking for won’t be enough to nail down the details of a future free trade deal. All we will have by the time we quit the EU is a fairly flimsy document. Filling in the details, getting it ratified by all the other 27 countries and then implementing it could take up to five years, according to the Irish foreign minister. Even Gove and Johnson admitted that two years may not be long enough, in the letter they wrote to the prime minister last month calling on her to back a hard Brexit. They wrote: “We may still have a ‘no deal’ outcome at the end of the transition period.” The snag is that for each extra year of transition we will have to pay membership fees to the EU of about £8bn. So a realistic transitional period could cost us a further £20-30bn. Add it all together, and you get £80bn. Of course, we could avoid paying this last sum by not extending the transition beyond two years. But then the economy would fall off a cliff in March 2021, just before the next election. That would be like rolling out the red carpet to Downing Street for Jeremy Corbyn. When push comes to shove, the Tories would probably blink. It would, though, be much better if May fessed up to this all now so that the public could have an honest debate. If voters were told how much Brexit is really going to cost – and how much the loss of access to the EU’s vast single market is going to clobber the public finances, so we will struggle even harder to get cash for the NHS, schools, homes and vital infrastructure – they might decide they don’t want Brexit at all. • Hugo Dixon is chairman and editor-in-chief of InFacts"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"politics/2017/nov/21/immigration-minister-pledges-swift-processing-of-eu-citizens-status","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-21T15:20:40Z","webTitle":"Immigration minister pledges 'swift' processing of EU citizens' status","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/nov/21/immigration-minister-pledges-swift-processing-of-eu-citizens-status","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/nov/21/immigration-minister-pledges-swift-processing-of-eu-citizens-status","fields":{"headline":"Immigration minister pledges 'swift' processing of EU citizens' status","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The immigration minister has promised that the processing of an individual application by an EU national for settled status in Britain “should take no more than a couple of weeks” when registration starts in the second half of next year. The minister, Brandon Lewis, told the Commons home affairs select committee that an extra 1,200 UK visas and immigration staff were being recruited to process an expected 3.5m applications from EU nationals over two and a half years. He also told MPs on Tuesday that he was optimistic that an agreement could be struck by Christmas on the rights of EU citizens in the UK in the Brexit negotiations. However, he declined to comment on reports that the Brexit inner cabinet had decided on Monday that the European court of justice could continue to play a role in guaranteeing their rights during a two-year transition period. The Home Office minister did confirm that those refused “settled status” and classed as non-EU nationals in Britain illegally could have their bank accounts frozen and face deportation before the hearing of any appeal in British courts. The 3million group, representing EU nationals in Britain, immediately questioned Lewis’s claim that an agreement with the EU on “settled status” was likely before Christmas. “We wonder how. Major stumbling blocks still in place,” they tweeted, noting continued differences over the role of the ECJ, over family reunification rights that could affect thousands, and regarding clarification that they should not face “hostile environment measures”. Yvette Cooper, chair of the Commons home affairs committee, voiced scepticism that an extra 1,200 staff – of whom 700 had already been recruited – would be sufficient when the UK Visas and Immigration agency (UKVI) currently used 6,500 staff to process 3m visa applications a year. There was already a three-month delay in processing EU nationals’ applications for permanent residence documents, she said. The Home Office minister insisted, however, that the EU applications would be much more straightforward than the bulk of UKVI’s usual cases and would be dealt with by a new “simple and swift” system, with an online user portal similar to that used to renew driving licences. Lewis said that EU “settled status” applicants, subject to the outcome of the negotiations, would have to verify their identity, pass a criminality check and establish five years’ residence in the UK. The Home Office would use existing HMRC tax/DWP national insurance databases to verify applications. Applicants would not have to submit their passports to prove residence. The new system, which is being developed with groups of EU nationals, would be tested in the first half of next year and each application “should take a couple of weeks and not months” to process. Lewis said unlike other UKVI casework the system would be based on “a different cultural approach”, applicants being granted settled status. He said, however, that non-EU nationals and others who tried to “game the system” could find themselves being rejected and facing deportation before their legal appeals could be heard in the courts. The immigration minister was challenged by Cooper over the Home Office’s 10% error rate in revoking driving licences, and its refusal for new bank accounts for those wrongly identified as illegally in the country. He tried to reassure the MPs that when banks were required to do immigration checks on millions of existing bank accounts from January no one’s account would be frozen until a second check had been made with the Home Office. The banks will be required to carry out an automated sweep of their accounts against a Home Office database of people who are in the UK illegally. But Lewis confirmed that it was possible that somebody wrongly identified as an illegal immigrant could find their bank account frozen for up to 12 months while they appealed through the courts."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/nov/23/dining-on-your-own-people-watching-jay-rayner","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-23T12:00:01Z","webTitle":"What’s the best thing about dining on your own?

It’s a reminder that the film industry was founded by Ashkenazi Jews from the east coast who craved a taste of home: of pastrami on rye and matzo ball soup, food for colder weather and darker skies but to hell with that. If this is what these film people want to to eat, this is what they’ll have. After all, they write the script. And here it is 70 years on, doing the same thing it has always done. I am at Nate ’n Al for the smoked salmon and the “everything” bagel, but for something else too: the people-watching. The pleasures of eating alone are obvious. You get to eat what you want, how you want. It is one of adulthood’s great indulgences. But who admits to its other profound pleasure, the licence it gives you to spy on people? We reveal so very much of ourselves at the table. It is a vital bodily function we perform in public. Witness the man who carefully lifts the crisped skin off his roast chicken, pushing it to the side of his plate with disgust, or the woman who, faced by spare ribs, sets to work with a knife and fork. We immediately feel we know something about both of them, none of it attractive. And even if we can’t be sure of their stories, we can quietly invent them. In the booth next to mine at Nate ’n Al today is a young father with his small daughter filling in her colouring book. So he’s a divorced dad, and it’s his Sunday to take her out. No, hang on. Because here comes his wife with their younger child. But she attends only to the kids and the couple barely exchange glances. He pulls the wedding ring off the appropriate finger and puts it back on again, and repeatedly, like it’s something he’s done many times. So no, not a divorced dad’s Sunday. At least, not quite yet. On the other side of the aisle, there’s a party of three in their late 60s. A couple on one side of the table, a single man on the other. Once upon a time surely they were four? But she is no longer here, and they make a point to look after him as she would have wanted. So on a Sunday they are still at Nate ’n Al because certain traditions need observing. Just in front of me, a Jewish mamma is issuing instructions to the long suffering waitress as if the Meg Ryan diner scenes in When Harry Met Sally were less social satire than a guide for living. She wants the onions on one plate, and make sure they don’t burn the bagel, because haven’t you heard that burnt toast gives you cancer and God forgive the oncologists of Beverly Hills should get more business? And perhaps way over on the other side, out of my view, is a woman eating alone. Perhaps she looks up from her plate and sees a big man with too much hair and a beard. She watches the way he stares around the room and thinks “Poor sap, deep in his midlife crisis” and returns to her lunch. Is she right? Has she nailed it? That’s not for me to say. For the duration of lunch the solo diner gets to own these narratives. Because without them, eating alone would be nowhere near as fun."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"music/2017/nov/23/anna-ternheim-all-the-way-to-rio-review","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-23T20:40:11Z","webTitle":"Anna Ternheim: All the Way to Rio review – a wonderful, autumnal record","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/nov/23/anna-ternheim-all-the-way-to-rio-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2017/nov/23/anna-ternheim-all-the-way-to-rio-review","fields":{"headline":"Anna Ternheim: All the Way to Rio review – a wonderful, autumnal record","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Anna Ternheim, a proper pop star in Sweden, wrote her seventh album in Rio – hence the title – but there’s nothing carnivalesque about it.

Not in the strictly financial sense, though how much more threadbare core public services can become without collapsing and causing social mayhem the next few years will prove, if the government lasts. Even with faltering economic growth, public spending is to go on falling as a proportion of GDP. It’s bankrupt in ideas, in understanding, in preparedness to examine what has been happening to public services. Housing offers a glaring example. For all the bells and whistles in the budget, and some welcome augmentation of council powers, the government fails to make an obvious connexion. Building houses, allocating land, encouraging development, and policing the delinquency of private developers all imply an active and financially lubricated local government. Housing is and always will be about places, streets, brownfields – and public acceptance of schemes that will abut on their property or where they walk their dog. That’s what councillors do. Ace ideologue of the free market Oliver Letwin, of all people, can’t substitute. What is obvious now, as it was to Harold Macmillan 65 years ago, is that if you want big building, you give councils elbow room, meaning hugely expanded freedom to borrow, well beyond Hammond’s £44bn, which is spread over several years and includes loan guarantees and backup as much as frontline provision. Tory councils are these days as willing as Labour to gear up, and face down neighbourhood opponents. The Royal Town Planning Institute and National Planning Forum will shortly publish a study by Janice Morphet and Been Clifford detailing the many and imaginative ways in which English local authorities are already doing a lot of building, using local companies, sleight of hand and financial imagination. Just think what they could do if Hammond had said the national debt can surely sustain more productive investment and what is more remunerative in the long run than the construction of homes that people can afford. Early calculations suggest the number of affordable dwellings likely to be built from Hammond’s scheme will not rise to anything like the level needed. But accepting an expanded, “forward” role for councils means, for Tory ministers, swallowing 30 years of Thatcherite suspicion bordering on contempt of local government, even when it’s heavily coloured blue. Maybe if Nick Timothy had lasted at May’s side, things would have been different. But he didn’t and Hammond’s budget prove they are n0t. A few days before the budget, in a suspiciously hole-in-the-corner way, the Treasury published a report by Michael Barber. In many ways a valiant attempt by the Blairite stalwart to synthesise thinking about productivity and public value, it ends up as a mish-mash of ill-coordinated suggestions. It’s made all the less plausible by failing to address the perennial question of who manages the state: the Treasury (which lacks the skills and enthusiasm) or the Cabinet Office (which lacks financial clout and enforcement powers). But the problem exemplified once again in this budget, is that Tory ministers are still deeply uncertain about whether they even want to be running the public sector. Some including Liam Fox, Sajid Javid, and Michael Gove, have never disowned Thatcherite commitments to pare government back to bare essentials, to privatise and outsource to the max. Hammond weeps crocodile tears over his inability – thanks to an ideological commitment to austerity – to do much for public sector staff; that promise to meet the cost of a payrise for nurses was qualified. But underpinning his fiscal calculations is the deepest ambiguity, shared with Theresa May and the rest. They are not at all sure they want to be in charge of this thing, public services, whose values, culture and skills are so antithetical to their most cherished political beliefs.

When his on-off girlfriend (Ashlie Walker) walks out for good, he steals her friends’ mobiles – giving the film its footage of attention-seeking drunken antics and nastier behaviour never intended for Snapchat. Ben, like one of the lads from Made in Chelsea after inadvertently catching an episode of The Moral Maze on Radio 4, tells his psychotherapist that he wants to see “between the cracks” of people’s lives. The whole thing is an endurance test of amateurish improv and muddled plotting, with some pseudo-arty cutaways thrown in. No doubt the film-makers are sincere in wanting to say something about the digital age, toxic masculinity and the harmful impact of hypersexualising young women. But #Starvecrow left me feeling bored and annoyed."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"money/2017/dec/08/lets-move-to-kelso-roxburghshire-property-tom-dyckhoff","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-08T16:30:07Z","webTitle":"Let’s move to Kelso, Roxburghshire: this is a mighty fine town","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2017/dec/08/lets-move-to-kelso-roxburghshire-property-tom-dyckhoff","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2017/dec/08/lets-move-to-kelso-roxburghshire-property-tom-dyckhoff","fields":{"headline":"Let’s move to Kelso, Roxburghshire: this is a mighty fine town","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"What’s going for it? I’m a sucker for a bit of Romanesque architecture. Even the prospect of a half-ruined tower and a crumbled jamb is enough to drag me several score miles off my beaten track. I’m easily distracted. And so I come to Kelso. Like those in its neighbouring border market towns, Kelso’s abbey is a shadow of its 12th-century self, when it was the richest, mightiest monastery in the region. But even the fragments left behind still define the town, though the abbey has competition these days. This is a mighty fine town, a lovely little place squished where the rivers Tweed and Teviot say how d’you do. Every street is an architectural delight. The town hall has grand columns leaping over the cobbles on the Square. And the town has not one but two stately homes in tow. If you think Mellerstain House is fancy-pantsy, have a gawp at vast Floors Castle, possibly the turrety-est stately home in the nation, and definitely not a castle. Those battlements couldn’t withstand the big bad wolf, let alone marauding Northumbrians across the border. The case against Not cheap for hereabouts. Well connected? No trains, but there are several daily buses to Berwick-upon-Tweed (one hour) and Jedburgh and Hawick, plus a few to Edinburgh (two hours). Driving: half an hour to neighbours such as Melrose, Galashiels and Coldstream, 40 mins to the coast and Berwick, and more than an hour (depending on traffic) to central Edinburgh. Schools Primaries: quality indicators for Edenside and Sprouston are “good”; for Broomlands mostly “good”, Education Scotland says. Secondaries: those for Kelso High are “good” or “very good”.

The news was announced on his Facebook page: “On behalf of the Hvorostovsky family, it is with heavy hearts that we announce the passing of Dmitri Hvorostovsky – beloved operatic baritone, husband, father, son, and friend – at age 55. After a two-and-a-half-year battle with brain cancer, he died peacefully this morning, November 22, surrounded by family near his home in London, UK. May the warmth of his voice and his spirit always be with us.” Hvorostovsky was born in a tough industrial city in Siberia, telling an interviewer in 2002 that as a high school student, prison looked a more likely destination than the opera stage, with “drinking, drugs and fighting,” part of his adolescence. A teenage obsession with pop music also almost claimed the singer for a different world, and his hard drinking and wild behaviour continued into his 20s and early 30s. He came to international attention in 1989 when he beat Bryn Terfel to win the Cardiff Singer of the World title. With his prematurely white hair, dashing good looks and powerful stage presence, his heartthrob image was carefully cultivated and he amassed legions of fans. A career performing in all the major opera houses and concert halls followed, and he was hailed one of the world’s greatest baritones for the rich, expressive fluidity of his voice. His fame allowed him to bring the neglected and little known Russian song repertoire into western halls, most notably with the remarkable accompanist Ivari Ilja. In the opera house he was particularly feted for his performances of Verdi, and also his charismatic and provocative interpretation of Tchaikovksy’s antihero Eugene Onegin, a role he made his own. In 2006, Hvorostovsky was the soloist in the BBC’s Last Night of the Proms, and delighted the crowds with his glamorous take on The Toreador Song from Bizet’s Carmen. “Genuine stars are rare in the classical music world; Russian baritone Dmitri Hvorostovsky ranks among them,” wrote the Guardian’s Tim Ashley in 2003. The singer was diagnosed with a brain tumour in June 2015 and retired from the opera stage at the end of 2016. He lived in London with his wife and two children.

The crucial details will follow in supplementary estimates. First-time homebuyers In the budget’s biggest giveaway, stamp duty is to be abolished for first-time buyers on properties up to £300,000. This represents a cut for 80% of first-time buyers. And those spending between £300,000 and £500,000 on their first home will save £5,000 in stamp duty. The controversial help-to-buy scheme is also to be extended despite widespread concern that it contributes to ballooning house prices. The budget confirmed that an extra £10bn will go into the scheme to extend it to 2021, a measure previously announced in October. Young rail commuters The young persons railcard, currently available to under-27s, is to be extended. The “millennial card” will extend the 30% discount to those under 31. Further details will be announced after negotiations with rail companies. Landlords In a measure designed to please both Generation Rent and Tory-voting landlords, Hammond signalled that the government would explore tax breaks for landlords who offer longer-term secure tenancies. Andy Street and other directly elected mayors The Tory mayor for the West Midlands will get a £250m chunk of a new £1.7bn transforming cities fund. Street, who was elected in May in a Labour heartland, said he was delighted at confirmation of the deal. Most drinkers The chancellor caved in to lobbying from the Scotch Whisky Association to scrap a planned 3.9% tax increase on whisky. Duty rates on beer, cider, wine and other spirits will be also be frozen. White cider drinkers were not so fortunate, however. Mindful of their cheap price and high alcohol content, Hammond ordered a rise in duty for drinkers of K. “Merry Christmas!” he said as he announced the move, in a nod to Scrooge. Maths teachers Hammond joked that he wanted “more maths for everyone”. But he put some serious money behind it, pledging £27m to improve teaching of the subject in 3,000 schools. As part of the plan, schools get an extra £600 for every additional pupil who takes A-level or Core maths. Tax avoiders The budget disappointed fair tax campaigners by announcing only minor reforms to tackle avoidance. These included applying income tax to digital companies’ royalties relating to UK sales, designed to raise £200m. Will Snell, director of Tax Justice UK, said the budget wasted an opportunity to capitalise on public anger after the Paradise Papers revelations. Survivors of the Grenfell Tower fire Kensington and Chelsea council will get an extra £28m for mental health services, regeneration support for the surrounding areas and a new community space for the Grenfell United group. Hammond said: “Following the tragedy at Grenfell Tower, the government is determined to ensure that those affected receive the support they need.” Losers House builders Shares in house-building companies fell after Hammond failed to announce the ambitious programme the markets had anticipated. The chancellor said he planned to commit £44bn in capital funding, loans and guarantees to support the UK housing market. He claimed this would help deliver 300,000 new homes a year. And small building firms would get a share of £1.5bn for new homes. But planning reform was punted into the long grass again. Hammond announced a review by Oliver Letwin on how to close the gap between planning permissions being granted and houses being built. Universal credit claimants Those hoping for a pause to the chaotic rollout of universal credit will be disappointed. But claimants were thrown a bone in the form of a £1.5bn package to help “address concerns about the operation of the system”. From January, those who need it will be able to access up to a month’s worth of universal credit within five days via an interest-free advance. And to ease problems with rent arrears, from April those on housing benefit will continue to receive payments for the first two weeks of universal credit claims. Diesel car drivers Diesel drivers had been warned. People were once encouraged to buy diesel cars, but David King, the former chief scientific adviser, admitted it was wrong to cut duty on diesel vehicles after being hoodwinked by the car industry. So it was no surprise that Hammond raised excise duty on diesel vehicles. From next April, diesel vehicles that do not meet the latest standards will go up by one tax band. The chancellor said the money raised would fund a £220m clean air fund. But fuel duty for both petrol and diesel cars will be frozen. Lewis Hamilton and other private jet owners After the disclosure in the Paradise Papers that the F1 champion managed to avoid paying taxes on a private jet, Hammond announced that air passenger duty on those travelling by private jet would increase by £47. “Sorry, Lewis,” Hammond said as he announced the plan. But he did nothing to end the Isle of Man scheme that helped Hamilton avoid tax, which is subject to a review by HM Revenue and Customs. Smokers Smokers are always an easy target for chancellors. This time those rolling their own fags will be clobbered hardest. From 6pm on budget day, rates on all tobacco products will increase by 2% above inflation until the end of this parliament. Hand-rolling tobacco will increase by an additional 1%. Overlooked Social care recipients It was arguably the issue that did most to sink the Conservatives in the June election, and it was nowhere to be seen on budget day. The budget gives neither additional funding to social care nor any suggestion of change to the funding threshold.The Independent Age charity called it “a stark omission” and said there was a current funding gap of £1.3bn, and an estimated 1.2 million older people with an unmet care need. Teachers and pupils The Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, warned that schools in England would be “5% worse off by 2019”. The chancellor announced a £117m boost for maths, alongside plans to train 12,000 computer teachers, but the budget had no extra cash for core school spending. Kevin Courtney, joint leader of the National Education Union, said the government had “chosen to ignore the anger of parents and the clear evidence of the problems being created by real terms cuts to education”. Police officers Police cuts were arguably another key issue for the Conservatives during the election, especially after the terrorist attacks in Manchester and London, but the budget included no additional funding for the police in England and Wales. The mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, said it was now inevitable that police numbers would continue to fall and warned they could potentially be as low as 27,500 by 2021. “We are left with no choice but to scrap London’s strategic target for 32,000 police officers that has been in place since 2012,” he said. Mental health patients While the budget included £2.8bn of new funding for the NHS over three years, it failed to give any significant mention to mental health except to confirm a green paper will be published in December setting out the government’s plans to transform mental health services for children and young people."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2017/nov/22/in-a-lonely-place-review-humphrey-bogart-gloria-grahame-rerelease","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-22T15:42:40Z","webTitle":"In a Lonely Place review – Bogart still captivatingly cynical in noir classic","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/nov/22/in-a-lonely-place-review-humphrey-bogart-gloria-grahame-rerelease","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2017/nov/22/in-a-lonely-place-review-humphrey-bogart-gloria-grahame-rerelease","fields":{"headline":"In a Lonely Place review – Bogart still captivatingly cynical in noir classic","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Humphrey Bogart’s world-weariness and romanticism take on something brutal and misogynist in this 1950 noir masterpiece directed by Nicholas Ray – and it’s a marvellous performance by Gloria Grahame. This national rerelease is linked to the Grahame retrospective at BFI Southbank, in London. It is adapted from the hardboiled thriller by Dorothy B Hughes, changing her story and rehabilitating the male lead in one way, but in another, introducing a new strain of pessimism and defeat. Bogart is Dixon Steele, a boozy, depressive Hollywood screenwriter whose tendency to violence and self-hatred isn’t helped by the fact that he hasn’t had a hit in years. Like the directors, producers and actors he occasionally sees in bars, his best days were before the second world war. One night at a restaurant, his agent offers him a much-needed gig adapting some brainless bestseller and Dix shruggingly accepts. The wide-eyed hatcheck girl, Mildred (Martha Stewart), tells him she loves the book and, amused, Dix invites her back to his place to tell him what it’s all about. Having established his intentions are gentlemanly, Mildred agrees. Whatever Dix’s intentions may actually have been, they are blown out of the water when the pair of them run into his new neighbour as he is about to show Mildred across the threshold – on her way back to her own apartment. This is Laurel (Grahame), who is wryly amused by what she clearly sees as Dix’s clumsy, predatory designs on this poor girl. Dix is intensely chagrined, and somehow falls for the beautiful, elegant Laurel in that instant. And when that evening later takes a terrible turn for Mildred, Laurel saves Dix from police suspicion by giving him an entirely honest and accurate alibi. They begin to date, but his own propensity to violence scares her, and then she hears how he once broke his ex-girlfriend’s nose. Could Dix be the psychotic killer that the police are looking for, the one who murdered Mildred? Bogart was 50 when the picture was made, and Grahame was 27, and yet the age difference between them doesn’t seem as great because of Grahame’s remarkable confidence, maturity and charisma. She is midway between Mae West and Marilyn Monroe: stylish, sexy and self-possessed. Bogart’s performance is daring: it is precisely his cynicism and what-the-hell attitude to everything that has put him in the frame for the murder, and there is something sociopathic about the way he never quite drops this tone. He has a habit of making wasteful gestures of pseudo-remorse, sending flowers to the dead woman’s address, and cash to a young kid he beats up after a road-rage incident. When he comes to dinner with his old army buddy Brub (Frank Lovejoy), now a cop investigating the case, there is something very creepy in the way he imagines for their benefit how the killer would have behaved with his victim, using what he complacently announces is his imaginative and creative expertise: “I’ve killed dozens of people in pictures!” Bogart’s face loses all its ruined handsomeness as he becomes overexcited about the murder: he becomes wizened and rat-like and his crooked teeth protrude gruesomely. As befits a film about a screenwriter, the film is intriguingly self-aware. “A good love scene should be about something aside from love,” Dix tells Laurel. He says it just after he has to admit to having embarrassingly straightened out a grapefruit knife that was supposed to be curved. Could it be that we are supposed to catch an echo of James Cagney’s grapefruit-related violence from The Public Enemy (1931)? So maybe Dix didn’t do it, but this case is revealing other ways in which he is hopelessly guilty about everything else. A captivating noir classic."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"business/2017/nov/23/hammond-borrow-extra-90m-lower-productivity-forecast-obr","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-23T07:00:23Z","webTitle":"Hammond to borrow extra £90bn after lower productivity forecast","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/nov/23/hammond-borrow-extra-90m-lower-productivity-forecast-obr","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2017/nov/23/hammond-borrow-extra-90m-lower-productivity-forecast-obr","fields":{"headline":"Hammond to borrow extra £90bn after lower productivity forecast","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Philip Hammond must borrow an extra £90bn over the next five years after the Treasury’s independent forecaster downgraded productivity growth. The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) warned that the chancellor faced a long period of lower than expected wages growth that would dent tax receipts and push up borrowing. The cumulative effect over the life of the parliament would add £90.5bn to the UK’s debt pile and jeopardise Hammond’s target of balancing the government’s books by 2025, it said. The Treasury said that once the positive effects of an increase in employment and better than expected borrowing over the last year are taken into account, the net borrowing rise would be £35bn, putting the chancellor in a position to reach his target of creating a surplus in the middle of the next decade. But some analysts said the OBR’s revision failed to go far enough and it continued to overestimate the capacity of British businesses to invest in new equipment and processes to drive up productivity. They argued that the forecaster should have gone further and predicted that productivity growth – which measures the average output per hour worked – of almost zero over the last seven years would continue for another five years. Joanna Davies, a UK economist at Fathom Consulting, said the OBR’s new forecast that productivity would increase at a rate of 1.1% until 2022 – almost half the 2.1% average seen in the 30 years before 2007 – still looked ambitious. She said the prospects for GDP growth would suffer a severe knock-on effect from lower productivity and a rapidly ageing population. “Over the last five years, productivity growth has averaged just 0.3%,” she said. “Combined with UN projections for working-age population growth, the UK’s trend rate of overall economic growth is probably somewhere in the range 0.5%-1% – around half the 1.5% assumed by the OBR.” The OBR chair, Robert Chote, said GDP growth would not only be hit by lower productivity, but also a weaker than expected export sector that would fail to benefit significantly from the lower pound. Meanwhile, low wage growth would dampen consumer spending while Brexit uncertainty would deter businesses from investing or opening new offices and factories. Sir Charles Bean, one of the three OBR committee members who draw up the forecasts, said: “We think at some point productivity will improve. There are good grounds to believe that as the labour market tightens, businesses will need to invest.” He said the OBR committee did not subscribe to the “techno-pessimistic” view that robots and other intelligent machines were about to deskill the labour force and force down wages. He said it was more likely that investments in new machinery would enhance productivity. But the former deputy governor of the Bank of England admitted there was great uncertainty about how much businesses would invest to raise their workers’ productivity. “There is not a lot of science in measuring the path of productivity and others could take a different view,” he said. “We haven’t seen such a long period of low productivity growth since the 19th century, so we are in uncharted territory.” He added: “It’s not clear when the effects of government measures to enhance workers’ skills will take effect. Likewise infrastructure investments. Both of them can take a long time to take effect.” Howard Archer, an economic adviser to the forecasting group EY Item Club, said the OBR’s new figures “may now be overcautious”. He added: “It seems that the OBR may now be erring on the side of caution on UK productivity growth, having been repeatedly overoptimistic in recent years.” Samuel Tombs, the chief UK economist at consultancy Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the chancellor had been saved from his borrowing spiralling further by a switch in the classification of housing associations, which took their debt off government books. The Office for National Statistics recently said housing associations should be considered private bodies after the government passed an act of parliament relinquishing some control over their day-to-day running. Tombs said: “The chancellor would have been boxed into a corner, had the government not loosened its control over housing associations last week, enabling them to be reclassified as private bodies. This statistical deception, alongside other accounting adjustments, reduced borrowing by £5bn a year, or £24bn over the five years from 2017-18.” He said Hammond was only able to announce a series of measures – from boosting NHS funding to easing business rate rises – that cost £17bn over the next five years after housing associations were shifted off the government’s balance sheet. Victoria Clarke, a UK economist at banking group Investec, said downward revisions to GDP growth were “a natural consequence of the more realistic view of productivity trends”, and came despite the expected buoyancy of the global economy. She said: “On the back of this it looks doubtful, at best, that Hammond can achieve his broad objective of balancing the public finances as soon as possible in the ‘next’ parliament.” •This article was amended on 23 November 2017 to add a response from the Treasury in the third paragraph •Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2017/nov/22/mps-social-media-deny-vote-animals-are-not-sentient-protocol-uk-law","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-22T15:54:09Z","webTitle":"MPs hog social media as they deny voting animals are not sentient","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/nov/22/mps-social-media-deny-vote-animals-are-not-sentient-protocol-uk-law","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/nov/22/mps-social-media-deny-vote-animals-are-not-sentient-protocol-uk-law","fields":{"headline":"MPs hog social media as they deny voting animals are not sentient","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"MPs have been forced to deny that a Commons vote last week means animals are not recognised in the UK as sentient life forms. An amendment to the European Union (withdrawal bill to transfer the EU protocol on animal sentience into UK law was defeated by 313 votes to 295 on 15 November, and since then a row has developed as to what the vote meant in practice. Describing some of the reporting on the vote as “weird and dishonest”, Tory MP Zac Goldsmith tweeted a clarification that the vote had been about the correct legal procedure for ensuring animal welfare standards – not on the principle of whether animals are sentient. Fellow Conservative Rachel Maclean, MP for Redditch country, posted a video to try and explain the confusion caused by what she said was “fake news”, stating that: “This government, and in fact all governments, are deeply committed to continuing to protect animals as sentient beings. That law is already written into our own law.” Theresa May said at Wednesday’s PMQs: “We recognise and respect that animals are sentient beings, and should be treated accordingly.” Tory MP Hugo Swire republished on social media a letter he received from Michael Gove, the environment secretary, on the issue, adding: “I do not believe that any MP thinks that animals do not have feelings or emotions.” Nevertheless, the vote has triggered protests from animal rights groups, including multiple online petitions aimed at the House of Lords, UK parliament and Gove. Public figures including the presenter Sue Perkins have voiced strong criticism of MPs over the issue. Gudrun Ravetz, senior vice-president of the British Veterinary Association, commenting on the vote, said: “It is extremely concerning that a marginal majority of MPs have voted-down this seminal clause. This action undermines the government’s previous promises that the UK will continue to be known for our high standards of animal health and welfare post-Brexit.” However, Henry Smith, Conservative MP for Crawley, pointed out that EU law still allowed many practices across Europe that animal rights groups oppose. The amendment, proposed by the Green party co-leader Caroline Lucas, among others, had set out to specifically incorporate article 13 of title II of the Lisbon treaty into UK law. During debate on the amendment last Wednesday, Lucas pointed out that the origins of the clause began with the 1997 UK presidency of the EU and that from 1999 EU law had explicitly recognised that animals were sentient life forms. That protocol was subsequently included in the treaty. Lucas told the Commons: “The government have rightly and commendably committed to transferring all existing EU law on animal welfare into UK law under the bill, but because the text of the Lisbon treaty is not transferred by the bill, the wording of article 13 on animal sentience will not explicitly be incorporated into UK law.” She added: “The UK has no legal instrument other than article 13 of the Lisbon treaty to provide that animals are sentient beings.” Regardless of the failed amendment, the Animal Welfare Act 2006 remains on the statute book, which although it does not specifically mention sentience, contains law regrading animals in distress. Lucas was unimpressed by May’s intervention on the issue, tweeting:"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/nov/24/10-of-the-best-chocolate-advent-calendars","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-24T10:00:01Z","webTitle":"10 of the best chocolate advent calendars","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/nov/24/10-of-the-best-chocolate-advent-calendars","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/nov/24/10-of-the-best-chocolate-advent-calendars","fields":{"headline":"10 of the best chocolate advent calendars","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The seasonal treat-based countdown might these days have expanded into cosmetics and booze, but nothing beats 24 days of chocolate … This article contains affiliate links to products.

Norwegian composer/experimental guitarist Kim Myhr is a master of slow-morphing rhythms and sun-dappled textures that seem to glow from the inside. His electronics are mellow and inviting; his 12-string acoustic guitar has a loose, blissed-out twang. With just two long tracks (A and B on the vinyl release) that loop and shimmy around a single simple hook, You | Me has a 60s psych-folk vibe and something of the roving thrum of early Steve Reich or Terry Riley’s In C, or indeed Julius Eastman’s joyous Femenine. Three drummers – Ingar Zach, Hans Hulbækmo and The Necks’ Tony Buck – add spangling commentary and tranquil momentum and occasionally drift into sombre eddies.

You’ll find everything from grand ensembles to intimate solo confessionals, and this recording is best suited to the latter. That’s because conductor Pablo Heras-Casado has a tendency to over-shape the bigger stuff, to traffic-control the corners and smooth out the ride.

Consider the events of January 1907, for example, when Liverpool travelled to a frozen Roker Park and built themselves a comfy 4-1 half-time lead. Jack Parkinson, Sam Raybould and Jack Cox were scintillating in attack, coming at hosts Sunderland from all angles, at pace, “like a fleet of ships” according to the Liverpool Echo. But as the paper also pointed out, “a battle is never lost until it is won”, and Sunderland came back out for the second half in determined fashion. Liverpool started conceding rash fouls and penalty kicks, the not-yet-woke Manchester Guardian observing that Sunderland’s comeback was because of a “fatal departure on the part of Liverpool from the clean game, which is by no means necessarily tame and effeminate”. The end result was 5-5. It was the first time Liverpool had ever given up a three-goal lead. Oh Liverpool! Did something horrific take hold in the Liverpool psyche that day? Well, just consider the evidence. A mere 34,188 days later, Gérard Houllier’s side went three up against Southampton at the Dell, only for Matt Le Tissier to come on, waddle about a bit, yawn, scratch his arse and inspire his team, Marian Pahars et al, to an unlikely draw. Then, 14 years on, you’ve got Crystanbul. Oh Brendan! Oh Luis! So it’s happened three times at the very least. Probably more, if we nose through the record books further, but we have to send this thing out today, give us a break will you. Anyway, three’s enough. QED!!! And now this fiasco in Seville. Oh Jürgen! You’re going to have to address this problem at some point, you know. It’s like rising damp, it’s not just going to go away. Of course, pinpointing the exact root of such a structural problem is easier said than done. Both of Liverpool’s goalkeepers have soft potato patties for palms and marinated anchovies for fingers; the combined age of all the fit right-backs in the first-team squad is 13-and-three-quarters; and the most dependable central defender in Tuesday night’s XI was Dejan Lovren. Scary enough, although to be fair, Liverpool could replace poor, sweet, confused Alby Moreno with Giacinto Facchetti and Paolo Maldini doubling up, and they’d still concede goals on account of having covering midfielders so immobile they make Damien Hirst’s Mother and Child (Divided) look like Seabiscuit and Red Rum. With this point uppermost in mind, Jordan Henderson has today done a spot of fessing up, admitting that while the defence may be a creaking calamity, they shouldn’t be copping all the flak for the latest collapse, as the whole team were to blame. “I thought we defended well,” he began, brushing puddles of formaldehyde from his shoulders. “But we stopped playing, stopped getting the ball up to the front three. They were getting it back cheaply and it invites pressure.” The deflated Liverpool captain was left scrabbling around for positives. “On paper it is a good result, and we still have it in our own hands.” He might also consider that, in football, what goes around comes around, and Liverpool have been known to launch the odd thrilling three-goal comeback themselves. Manchester United in 1994, for example, or Milan in 2005. It’s a pattern that suggests another is well overdue, perhaps imminent.

Accomable was launched just over two years ago by childhood friends Srin Madipalli and Martyn Sibley – who both have spinal muscular atrophy – to make it easier for people to find accessible places to stay around the world. It lists properties that can cater for a range of disabilities, highlighting details such as step-free access, hoists, roll-in showers and shower chairs. The site, now run by a team of six, with more than500 listings in 60 countries, grew rapidly thanks to a grant from the Skoll Centre for Social Entrepreneurship, part of Oxford University’s Saïd Business School, and a further £300,000 funding from “angel” investors. Now, Accomable’s team and listings will be merged with Airbnb’s. In the coming months, the listings will be made available via the Airbnb site, and the team says it will now work towards improving the overall Airbnb experience for disabled travellers. Airbnb is also developing an “accessibility needs” checklist that allows hosts to be more descriptive about their home. In an open letter posted on its site, Madipalli reassured customers that the merger with a larger platform won’t mean accessibility becomes an “afterthought”. “Our decision to join Airbnb was one that we spent a long time considering,” he says. “Our work has allowed us to develop unrivalled expertise in the world of accessible travel, building a brand that disabled travellers can trust. We are convinced that joining Airbnb provides the best opportunity to take our dream and mission to a global level.” For accessible tourism expert and travel writer Carrie-Ann Lightley, it is significant to see accessible travel being taken seriously by a mainstream travel business though itremains just one aspect of the solution. “Airbnb’s investment in accessibility gives another option for disabled travellers, whose options are typically limited, and one I’m sure many will take up,” she says. “It shouldn’t overshadow the work of specialist operators though: many disabled travellers want and need a level of support that the mainstream industry still can’t cater for.” For Lightley, when it comes to travel, reliable information about facilities is the “single biggest barrier” disabled people face. “Armed with the right details, as a disabled traveller I can go anywhere, and make anything work,” she says. “Accommodation providers need to include good, detailed photographs of all rooms on their websites, as well as detailed accessibility guides.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"politics/2017/nov/22/kezia-dugdale-ill-donate-part-of-im-a-celebrity-fee-to-charity","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-22T10:49:32Z","webTitle":"Kezia Dugdale: I'll donate part of I'm a Celebrity fee to charity","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/nov/22/kezia-dugdale-ill-donate-part-of-im-a-celebrity-fee-to-charity","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/nov/22/kezia-dugdale-ill-donate-part-of-im-a-celebrity-fee-to-charity","fields":{"headline":"Kezia Dugdale: I'll donate part of I'm a Celebrity fee to charity","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The former Scottish Labour leader Kezia Dugdale has promised to donate part of her fee from appearing in I’m a Celebrity … Get Me Out of Here to a homeless charity as she defended her decision to appear in the show. Dugdale rejected complaints from her Labour colleagues at Holyrood that taking part in the ITV reality show was akin to taking a second job, but admitted she would be well paid for it. Speaking to show-business reporters in Australia for the first time since her participation provoked a backlash from other Labour MSPs, Dugdale insisted the show would allow her to connect with voters. She said she had set aside three weeks’ salary as an MSP for the Rock Trust homeless charity and not a motor neurone disease campaign as previously thought. Dugdale launched a @TeamKez Twitter feed on Wednesday morning, featuring a short video clip recorded before she left Edinburgh of her wearing a Rock Trust T-shirt, where she addressed her constituents, and by extension her Labour critics. She said in the film: “I appreciate that to quite a few of my constituents, this is quite a controversial move. I know there will be people upset about it, that will question my priorities.” Saying they deserved an explanation, she added: “First and foremost, I’m a Celebrity … Get Me Out of Here is a huge UK-wide television programme, with an audience into the millions. “I think it’s an amazing opportunity to talk to young people who watch this programme about politics, and – in particular – Labour values. The Daily Record, which employs her as a columnist, quoted her as saying: “I have a record of giving money to charity. This isn’t a second job, this is three weeks out of my work. I’ve given my salary away and I’m going to advocate the values of my party. I’ve been very clear.” The Sun reported that she added: “The minute I get back I am going to go straight from the airport into the parliament and vote. There are no major pieces of legislation that I am going to miss in the three weeks that I am here. I will be back in time to vote in the budget and I will face my constituents then.” Her decision to take part in I’m a Celebrity infuriated colleagues after the news leaked on Friday night, eclipsing the announcement 12 hours later that Richard Leonard had been elected her successor as Scottish Labour leader after she quit in August. It emerged she had not been given formal approval to appear on the show, which may involve her missing Holyrood votes. The Scottish Labour group opted not to sanction her on Tuesday but said Dugdale needed to give a full account of her decision after she returns. Dugdale confirmed she had delayed her arrival on the show, which began on Sunday night with 10 contestants, in an effort to avoid clashing with the Scottish Labour leadership announcement. But it leaked on Friday, two days before she flew out. She is due to arrive at the camp alongside the 12th contestant, radio DJ Iain Lee. This year’s show has endured further controversy after one of the first 10, the YouTube vlogger Jack Maynard, was forced to pull out on Tuesday after the Sun reported he had sent a series of allegedly racist, homophobic and derogatory tweets five years ago. Dugdale admitted she still did not know how much of her appearance fee would go to charity, the Sun reported. “There’s no doubt that I’m receiving a fee for this in return for being away for three weeks, so I’m not suggesting for a second that the sums involved are in any sense small,” she said. “I haven’t settled what portion will go to charity yet as there’s lots of things I have to do, like pay taxes,” she said. “I’ll do that on return, but I have already paid my salary in advance. Raising money for charity is part of the reason I’m doing this.” It is understood she was sent a hefty tax bill from HM Revenue and Customs after arranging last year to get her fee for her Record column sent directly to an MND charity. HMRC told her she was still liable to pay tax on that money, even if she did not receive it. That led her to remove a pledge on her Holyrood declarations of interest page to give all her outside earnings to charity. The Record reported she wanted a platform to reach a different audience, but also enjoy the challenges and lighthearted elements of the show. “There are lots of people who are critical of the decision I’ve taken to do this who will be hugely satisfied and will enjoy seeing me doing humiliating and difficult tasks,” she said. “This is ultimately a first-rate entertainment programme. In the world we live in just now, with Putin and Trump, we need a little bit of light relief in politics. That’s what I’ll be trying to provide.” She played down her prospects of winning the competition, pointing out she had not won any national elections as Scottish Labour leader. But she still planned a long political career. “I fully intend to finish this term as a member of the Scottish parliament and to stand again at the next election,” she said. “This is a phenomenal opportunity to speak to millions of people across the UK about the difference a Labour government could make and that is what I’m going to do.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2017/nov/26/brahms-an-english-requiem-review-bevan-farnsworth-choir-of-kings-college-london-fort-delphian","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-26T07:14:03Z","webTitle":"Brahms: An English Requiem CD review – an intimate chamber performance","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/nov/26/brahms-an-english-requiem-review-bevan-farnsworth-choir-of-kings-college-london-fort-delphian","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2017/nov/26/brahms-an-english-requiem-review-bevan-farnsworth-choir-of-kings-college-london-fort-delphian","fields":{"headline":"Brahms: An English Requiem CD review – an intimate chamber performance","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Brahms chose the text of his great German Requiem consciously in the vernacular of his country, so those who first introduced it to London decided to pay homage to his ideals and perform it in English, with Brahms’s own piano (four hands) accompaniment.

Revealed by a report by Quartz, Google’s Android system, which handles messaging services to ensure delivery of push notifications, began requesting the unique addresses of mobile phone masts (called Cell ID) at the beginning of 2017. The information was captured by the phone and routinely sent to Google by any modern Android device, even when location services were turned off and the sim card was removed. As a result Google could in theory track the location of the Android device and therefore the user, despite a reasonable expectation of privacy. A Google spokesperson said: “In January of this year, we began looking into using Cell ID codes as an additional signal to further improve the speed and performance of message delivery. “However, we never incorporated Cell ID into our network sync system, so that data was immediately discarded, and we updated it to no longer request Cell ID.” Google requested the Cell ID alongside what is called the mobile country code and mobile network code, which identify the country and mobile phone operator that the smartphone is using. That data is used to ensure the phone stays properly connected to Google’s Firebase Cloud Messaging system, which handles the delivery of messages and notifications to the smartphone. A persistent connection is required for the system to work, but instead of staying constantly connected, the phone pings Google’s servers at set intervals. The more pings, the greater the battery drain, so the data collected about the country and mobile networks is used to work out the the minimum number of pings required to stay connected without draining the battery – so called heartbeat analysis. The benefit of having the address of the mobile phone mast to ensure message service reliability is not clear, but through a process of triangulation – the same used to assist when a user is actively using location services – the position of the user can be revealed down to a roughly 400m radius at a minimum, and often much more accurately in urban areas. Google said that the data was never stored and that Cell ID requests would stop by the end of November, after an update to the messaging system. Location tracking via smartphones is a common practice used by all the major players, either locally on the device or remotely on a server and is used to provide many of the services expected of a modern phone. Beyond mapping services, location data is used for delivering the weather, localised news results, shopping services, augmented reality features and even things as mundane as the ability to pair two different wireless devices simply by colocation. But in most cases it is possible to prevent the location tracking systems from recording data, should services be disabled and privacy features enabled. That was not the case with the Cell ID collection, whether or not the data was stored by Google.

Riva plays a lovably scatty old lady called Marthe in this Tati-esque comedy from French writer-directors Dominique Abel and Fiona Gordon. The movie they have jointly devised, and in which they star, is a clever, funny and distinctly unworldly comedy with an insouciant line in visual humour. Fiona (Fiona Gordon) is a young goof from Canada who comes to Paris to visit her similarly away-with-the-fairies aunt Marthe (Riva). A mishap on the banks of, and then in, the Seine leads to an encounter with a romantic tramp called Dom (Dominique Abel). It’s a classic French entertainment that could have been produced almost any time in the last 60 years. There is a sophistication in its childlike guilelessness and also a cameo for veteran French comedy player Pierre Richard.

It’s another piece of information that will help anyone making a serious attempt to understand the game and that is an indisputably good thing in my book. The reaction on social media has been, um, interesting. Some trainers appear not to think very highly of punters, judging by responses to the effect that punters will be terribly disappointed when they learn that many (most?) wind ops do not improve a horse’s performance. Surely no one imagines that being told about wind ops is the same thing as getting the keys to the mint. It couldn’t possibly be that, even if wind ops worked all the time. Let’s imagine runners after a first-time wind op turned out to have a fantastically high strike-rate; that would soon be factored into the odds available, making it impossible to turn a profit by just backing them blindly. While trainers flatter themselves that their job is far too complex for us to understand, it seems that some of them have trouble comprehending how betting works. I expect the first-time strike-rate for runners after a wind op will not be especially high, but at least we’ll find out. There will be situations in which such a horse is attractive and many others in which he is not. Having the information improves the prospects of those punters prepared to do their homework and reduces the unknowable element in outcomes. Off the top of my head, I can think of two areas that will require more exploration. The first relates to the various types of wind ops, which probably differ as to their success rate and which may give an indication as to the gravity of that horse’s problem. Most punters are miles off the pace on this subject and have some learning to do. Of course, there would have been limited value in trying to understand the subject while wind ops were mostly undeclared and unknown. The second is enforcement. It’s all very well telling owners and trainers that they must declare when a wind operation has taken place, but what if they don’t? Will a racecourse vet, subjecting a horse to a quick examination, be able to tell that it has had an undeclared wind op at some point? If there are visual clues, do they fade over time? An unenforceable rule benefits no one, so let’s hope there’s a way to make everyone behave themselves. At Hexham, Celtic Flames (12.55) is my main interest at 4-1, making his chasing debut after three runs over hurdles this autumn. He’s done all right in a couple of handicap hurdles and appears to be headed in the right direction but I’m hoping that bigger obstacles make a big difference. It’s a couple of years since he won his only point in Ireland. Five lengths back in second was Accord (“no chance with easy winner”), who has since joined David Bridgwater and made a winning fences debut in a handicap last month. The mark he defied on that occasion was a full stone higher than the one Celtic Flames has now. Similar reasoning leads me to Same Circus (1.05) at Warwick. Donald McCain’s mare won her only point and now makes her fencing debut in a handicap, having had a recent run over hurdles to help her towards peak fitness. She’s come down 8lb for just three defeats in handicaps but needs to be a lot sharper than for her Carlisle run last month. The 12-1 is worth a risk, for me. At Chepstow, Grand Introduction (2.25) is bigger than I expected at 12-1, even allowing for his absence since February of last year. It’s pretty interesting to see a half-brother to No More Heroes (and a couple of other decent types) making his chasing debut from a mark of 108. It’s not impossible that the in-form Fergal O’Brien has got him ready to go, here. He looks the type to beat his handicap mark at some stage, anyway.

The standoff began two weeks ago after Hunt’s appearance on The Andrew Marr Show, when Hunt stated that the NHS had overseen “the biggest expansion of mental health provision in Europe”. Little, best known for his role as Anthony in the sitcom The Royle Family, accused the health secretary in a tweet of “knowingly lying” to the public about statistics and told Hunt to sue him if he was wrong. Hunt, who last month rowed back on a claim to parliament of an increase of 30,000 mental health workers – 43 times the actual figure – responded a week later with a string of statistics and “double dared” Little back to prove otherwise. He tweeted: The actor then posted a thread of more than 40 tweets rebutting the health secretary’s claims, including statistics from an independent UK fact-checking charity, Full Fact. That thread has been shared more than 15,000 times. The argument has since rolled on. Hunt on Monday replied with a series of 26 tweets of his own (although losing the chronology in the middle of the thread, making it difficult to follow). “Now I know you are a funny bloke and in politics a lot of insults are traded but the question is can you back up what is a very strong claim?” he asked Little, referring back to his “lying to the public” comment. “To fill the gap [in mental health staffing levels] we now have 8,000 MH nurses in training and have this Sept announced an increase in nurse training places overall by 25%.” Hunt also quoted from a New York Times article from July, which has been corrected three times after the former shadow minister for mental health, Luciana Berger, challenged its contents. Speaking to the Guardian, Berger, who is preparing for Tuesday’s health select committee on child and adolescent mental health, said: “The whole premise of that NYT article was wrong. It was based on a claim that the NHS ambition was for a third of the UK population to be treated [with talking therapies], when the real target is a third of people with a mental health condition. That’s a massive difference. The whole article misunderstood our system. “This ‘aren’t we marvellous’ line in response to a random NYT journalist’s glaring error is wrong. Simon Stevens [the health service chief] and Hunt have both referenced that article in select committee inquiries. And now Hunt has done it again in his tweets.” Berger also said Hunt had wrongly conflated community mental health nurses with hospital nurses. Little told the Guardian he felt moved to tweet Hunt after objecting to his use of figures. “I never intended to be in the middle of this debate but here I am. “It seems that Mr Hunt’s reaction to my accusations of cherrypicking statistics is to counter by … cherrypicking statistics.” Many have expressed surprise at Hunt’s willingness to debate with Little after his seeming reluctance to engage with NHS frontline staff, in particular junior doctors. In 2016, junior doctors protesting against a new contract slept outside Richmond House, then the Department of Health’s headquarters, in an effort to speak to Hunt. The health secretary took to entering and exiting the building by a back door. Rachel Clarke, a palliative care junior doctor and campaigner, said: “What on earth is Hunt doing spending time ‘double-daring’ an actor on Twitter when the NHS is approaching full winter crisis? Surely, when morale is rock bottom, he should be reaching out to patients and frontline staff, not members of The Royle Family? “[Hunt] has never dared debate with a junior doctor on television. He literally ran away from the only doctor he accidentally encountered in front of a film crew, scampering up a staircase to evade him.” Hunt and Little have since discussed meeting up to talk through the figures, with Hunt saying: “There may be a European country with bigger expansion plans but I have yet to find it. I am sure I don’t get everything right but on the basis of the evidence no reasonable person could describe the claim as ‘knowingly lying’ … I will happily meet you, fact-checkers and all.” “If he has nothing to hide, he would be happy to meet, right?” Little said to the Guardian. Channel 4 News anchor Krishnan Guru-Murthy on Wednesday invited both parties into the studio for a live debate. Reached for comment, he told the Guardian: “It is fascinating that Ralf Little has provoked a response from the health secretary on Twitter but to debate these things properly and in depth we need to get them together with health professionals, experts and patients.” The Department of Health declined to comment on the online argument. In Wednesday’s budget, Chancellor Philip Hammond announced a £2.8bn investment for the NHS in England over three years – short of the 4bn cash injection the health service chief, Simon Stevens, said is needed, and a capital expenditure of £10bn over the course of parliament."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2017/nov/23/battle-of-the-sexes-review-emma-stone-steve-carell-billie-jean-king-tennis","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-23T15:30:05Z","webTitle":"Battle of the Sexes review – Emma Stone aces it in tennis's biggest grudge match","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/nov/23/battle-of-the-sexes-review-emma-stone-steve-carell-billie-jean-king-tennis","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2017/nov/23/battle-of-the-sexes-review-emma-stone-steve-carell-billie-jean-king-tennis","fields":{"headline":"Battle of the Sexes review – Emma Stone aces it in tennis's biggest grudge match","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"This is a seductively enjoyable, smart and well-acted film based on the most deadly serious sporting contest of modern times: the Battle of the Sexes tennis match of 1973 in a packed Houston Astrodome. It stars Emma Stone and Steve Carell, respectively women’s No 1 Billie Jean King and fiftysomething ex-champ and self-proclaimed “male chauvinist pig” Bobby Riggs – fighting to prove that men are better at tennis and better, full stop. The film crucially faces the same challenge as the participants from real life: the challenge of tone. How unseriously should this match be taken? How strenuously should the attitude of casual jokiness be maintained? No one involved in this encounter could be certain of its outcome; neither side could be sure of avoiding humiliation, and thus everyone had a vested interest in keeping it light. Up to a point. But only one side was facing jokiness as a weapon, the same weapon of boorish condescension and toxic bantz that they faced outside the sporting arena every day of their lives. The movie displays the same gracious good humour as its heroine. In 1973, King was enraged by the fact that female players on the grand slam circuit were paid a tiny fraction of what the men got, despite pulling in the same number of paying customers. She formed the breakaway Women’s Tennis Association, and having duly punished King with excommunication from their club, the male tennis establishment was quietly scandalised to discover that, far from failing ignominiously, the women were finding support from the American public who rather liked them as rebels and pioneers. They got sponsorship and even some sympathetic press coverage. Then the sociopathically reckless has-been and Wimbledon veteran Riggs discovered that he was deeply irritated by King’s success, by his own absence from the limelight and by the uppity presumption of what were once known as “women’s libbers”. He challenged King to an exhibition prizefight – in roughly the same spirit that some men today will brayingly challenge you to name five funny women comedians – conceding his own age disadvantage to level the playing field. After some hesitation, King took him on. Sarah Silverman is entertainingly raucous as the women’s promoter Gladys Heldman. Stone has intelligence and candour as King. She is instantly sympathetic and humanly vulnerable; her address to the camera has a cartoony clarity and vigour, a distinctive kind of wide-eyed openness, accentuated by the trademark glasses. (This is surely history’s only premier sports event in which both players have worn glasses.) And her Billie Jean is sensual and vulnerable when she discovers that, despite being married, she is falling in love with a woman: LA hairdresser Marilyn Barnett – another unassumingly excellent performance from Andrea Riseborough. As for Carell, he is the only possible casting for Riggs: the humourless, belligerent guy thinking that he is the life and soul of the party, dressing up in silly costumes. It’s a variation on his David Brent manager Michael Scott from the American TV version of The Office or his weatherman Brick Tamland from Anchorman. And he is that certain kind of middle-aged guy who by wearing shorts makes his buttocks look unsexily gigantic, like barrage balloons. (Brad Pitt did the same thing, wearing unflattering jogging shorts as the fitness-mad General McMahon in the Netflix feature War Machine.) In real life, Riggs was supposed to have a skill in lobs and drop shots that would counter King’s hitting power. Yet in acting terms, it’s Stone who is subtly floating shots over the net, and comedy star Carell who is going for the double-fisted line readings and visual laughs. Screenwriter Simon Beaufoy creates a winning script, smoothly handled by directors Valerie Faris and Jonathan Dayton, although the movie is maybe a little rough on Margaret Court (Jessica McNamee), whose current reputation for reactionary politics has been backdated into the action to make her the obvious unsisterly baddie. And what remains of this argument now? Jimmy Connors won against Martina Navratilova in 1992, at a younger age than Riggs but with rule handicaps. John McEnroe grumbles away at the subject in the present day. But King’s point remains the same: meaningful equality is what she wanted. Nowadays, sport and sports careers are too disciplined and careful to allow for these wacky Barnumesque contests. But pay disparity remains, and not every workplace has access to the Houston Astrodome to put them to the test."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"uk-news/2017/nov/22/camelot-10000-pounds-a-month-for-life-lottery-prize-to-attract-young","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-22T09:19:47Z","webTitle":"Camelot mulls £10k-a-month-for life lottery prize to attract young","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/nov/22/camelot-10000-pounds-a-month-for-life-lottery-prize-to-attract-young","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2017/nov/22/camelot-10000-pounds-a-month-for-life-lottery-prize-to-attract-young","fields":{"headline":"Camelot mulls £10k-a-month-for life lottery prize to attract young","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The national lottery operator, Camelot, is considering introducing a prize of up to £10,000 a month for life in the hope of enticing a younger generation of players seeking financial security so they can afford to buy a home. As it revealed an overall drop in ticket sales, Camelot said it could shift its focus away from big jackpots towards an “annuity-style game”, in which the prize would continue to pay out until death. “We want to get new people into the game,” the Camelot chief executive, Nigel Railton, told the Daily Telegraph. “Our research tells us that more people these days want financial security. The younger generation are finding it difficult to get on the housing ladder and they want prizes that help with this.” Other planned changes include the introduction of a Tuesday Thunderball draw for players “who value smaller, more frequent wins”. The shift in focus comes at a time when increasing numbers of people in the UK find it harder to buy their first property, are struggling with rising private rents and battling a squeeze on finances driven by increasing inflation. Young people are the least likely demographic group to play the lottery. Nonetheless, last week a London estate agent caused controversy by suggesting that young people should stop buying tickets to help them afford a deposit. Camelot announced a 3.2% drop in overall ticket sales on last year’s first-half performance to £3.2bn for the six months to 23 September. This follows a fall in total ticket sales of 8.8% to £6.9bn for 2016-17, from a record £7.5bn the previous year. Railton said: “A fall in sales is never welcome but, as we announced in June, we did anticipate a further sales decline this year – so our performance over the half-year is in line with expectations.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"crosswords/quick/14838","type":"crossword","sectionId":"crosswords","sectionName":"Crosswords","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-27T00:00:08Z","webTitle":"Quick crossword No 14,838","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/quick/14838","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/crosswords/quick/14838","fields":{"headline":"Quick crossword No 14,838","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"uk-news/2017/nov/22/housing-budget-cut-growth-forecasts-philip-hammond","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-22T15:18:29Z","webTitle":"The real budget story is the sharp cut in growth forecasts | Larry Elliott","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/nov/22/housing-budget-cut-growth-forecasts-philip-hammond","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2017/nov/22/housing-budget-cut-growth-forecasts-philip-hammond","fields":{"headline":"Forget housing: the real budget story is the sharp cut in growth forecasts","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Forget the extra money for housing. Put to one side the package of support for the NHS. Ignore the willingness to throw money at sorting out universal credit. The real story from the budget was slower growth not just this year but every year up until 2022. This downgrade has been a long time in coming. Ever since it was founded, the independent Office for Budget Responsibility has wrongly predicted a pick-up in productivity growth and is now heartily sick of ending up with egg on its face. So it has now pencilled in productivity growth of just 1.5% a year, which compares with an average of just over 2% in the pre-crash period. Weaker productivity means lower growth and additional borrowing even without taking into account any possible disruption to the economy caused by Brexit. Philip Hammond could have responded to the OBR’s gloomier forecasts by hunkering down. Instead, he has done the opposite. He has decided to increase spending and borrowing to see the economy through what is expected to be a rocky period when the UK leaves the EU in 2019. The chancellor has managed to do this by once again pushing back the date by which Britain’s public finances will be back in the black. In the dim and distant days of 2010, George Osborne promised he could get on top of the UK’s budget deficit in one five-year parliamentary term. That soon became two parliaments and now, it would appear, the earliest date for budget balance will be the middle of the next decade. Hammond has also deployed some creative accountancy to deliver a fall in the national debt – the sum of all the UK’s budget deficits – as a share of economic output. In order to ensure the ratio falls in every year, the chancellor is planning to sell shares in RBS and take housing association debt off the government’s balance sheet. Even so, debt will remain at double its level before the financial crisis, rather too high for comfort were the UK to plunge back into recession over the coming years. It is worth noting that there has been a recession in every decade since the 1970s. As for the measures themselves, the cut in business rates was welcome, as was the increased generosity of the research and development tax credit. But the impact of abolishing stamp duty for first-time buyers, as the OBR noted, will give an added twist to house prices, the exact opposite of what is needed. But this, at root, was a budget framed by three interlocking factors: the political weakness of the government; the detrimental long-term impact of the financial crisis; and the imminence of Brexit. •Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"stage/2017/nov/23/bad-roads-review-love-sex-and-terror-in-violent-vignettes-from-ukraine","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-23T06:00:22Z","webTitle":"Bad Roads review – love, sex and terror in violent vignettes from Ukraine","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/nov/23/bad-roads-review-love-sex-and-terror-in-violent-vignettes-from-ukraine","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2017/nov/23/bad-roads-review-love-sex-and-terror-in-violent-vignettes-from-ukraine","fields":{"headline":"Bad Roads review – love, sex and terror in violent vignettes from Ukraine","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Theatre can sometimes jolt the memory. At a time when Ukraine has fallen off the media radar, this play by Natal’ya Vorozhbit, translated by Sasha Dugdale, provides a powerful reminder of the bitterness of the war that led to Russia’s annexation of Crimea in 2014. In particular, it makes the point that women attracted by the dubious glamour of the military can also become casualties of the conflict. The play consists of six vignettes of violence. The first is far and away the best. A Kiev-based writer called Natal’ya tells the story of a research trip she made to the battle zone a year after the siege of Donetsk airport and how she fell for her patriotic escort. It is good precisely because it is personal, moving and filled with a double guilt: that of the confidence-revealing storyteller and of a woman who found love in a region where men were blowing each other to bits with rocket launchers. Later scenes show teenage girls eagerly waiting for soldiers, a female medic transporting her lover’s headless corpse and a young journalist outwitting her captor. Vorozhbit overdoes the point that the soldiers, for all their supposed heroism in the fight against separatists, either prove useless in the sack or reliant on oral satisfaction. I’d have liked to hear more about the complex politics behind the pitched battles. But Vorozhbit, a beneficiary of the Royal Court’s international residency in 2005, captures the collateral damage suffered by women, and suggests that not all of Ukraine’s troubles can be pinned on the conflict. The final scene, which takes place prewar, shows a pair of farmers ruthlessly fleecing a luckless female traveller. The play’s title also has a double meaning. It is a metaphor for the rocky emotional paths taken by women in wartime and a reminder of the pitted surfaces that have disfigured the Ukrainian countryside since the communist era. Camilla Clarke’s design turns the Theatre Upstairs into a pine forest and Vicky Featherstone’s production is sharply acted. In the opening, confessional monologue Kate Dickie shows a capacity to engage with everyone in the audience. There is also impressive work by Ria Zmitrowicz as the captive journalist and Tadhg Murphy as her traumatised tormentor. Even if there is nothing startlingly original about the idea that war turns men into animals, in her relentless focus on conflict’s female victims, Vorozhbit shows herself to be a Ukrainian Sarah Kane. • At the Royal Court, London, until 23 December.

He plans to launch a homemade rocket in California as part of a bid to eventually prove that the Earth is flat. Hughes has spent $20,000 (£15,000) building the steam-powered rocket in his spare time, and will be livestreaming the launch over the internet. The self-described daredevil says he switched his focus to rockets after twice breaking his back doing stunt jumps in cars. “I don’t believe in science,” declared the 61-year-old. “I know about aerodynamics and fluid dynamics and how things move through the air. But that’s not science, that’s just a formula.” The rocket, which Hughes aims to reach an altitude of 1,800ft (550 metres) over California, will be launched from the back of a converted motorhome purchased from Craigslist. It is sponsored by a flat Earth research group, and Hughes plans a subsequent trip to try and observe the flatness of the Earth for himself. Speaking about the risks of the flight, Hughes said: “It’s scary as hell, but none of us are getting out of this world alive.” Hughes’ website describes him as “the only man to design, build and launch himself in a rocket” – he previously flew in his own rocket in 2014, as this footage shows. Hughes has stated that once he lands at the weekend, he intends to announce that he is running for the governorship of California. Flat Earth theory has seen a resurgence in recent years, fuelled by online message boards and some high-profile endorsements from celebrities. The Flat Earth Society, founded in 1956 and relaunched online in the 2000s, currently boasts of having over 500 members, although the group has splintered into two separate factions with competing websites. In the NBA, Boston Celtics’ Kyrie Irving made headlines for appearing to endorse the idea that the Earth is flat, and former basketball star Shaquille O’Neal surprised everyone in March by declaring the same. “I drive from Florida to California all the time, and it’s flat to me,” he said in a March podcast, before later retracting the claim saying he’d been joking. Irving has also recently distanced himself from the belief. But Hughes is not alone in his quest to reach the sky to test established science. Rapper BoB has made social media posts supporting the theory in the past, and is currently attempting to raise $1m to place “multiple weather balloons and satellites into space, for experimental exploration”. He has so far only managed to gather nearly $7,000 for the project."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2017/nov/22/peaky-blinders-recap-series-four-episode-two-heathens","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-22T22:00:12Z","webTitle":"Peaky Blinders recap – series four, episode two: Heathens","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/nov/22/peaky-blinders-recap-series-four-episode-two-heathens","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2017/nov/22/peaky-blinders-recap-series-four-episode-two-heathens","fields":{"headline":"Peaky Blinders recap – series four, episode two: Heathens","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"SPOILER ALERT: This blog is for those who are watching series four of Peaky Blinders. Don’t read on if you haven’t seen episode two. The move back to Small Heath has definitely done this show the power of good. The plotting and writing feel leaner and the life-and-death stakes are free of grand, overarching conspiracies. It helps, too, that Peaky Blinders has always nodded to the conventions of the western and those conventions lend themselves to this year’s plot with the Shelby clan penned back in their old haunts and enemies approaching on all sides. To be honest, if the whole thing doesn’t culminate in a showdown along the lines of Howard Hawks’s classic Rio Bravo or John Carpenter’s modern-day nod to the western, Attack on Precinct 13, then I shall feel obscurely let down. Our heroes If we know anything about Tommy Shelby, it’s that he’s a fantastic multi-tasker. This week, he managed to combine a funeral with a meet-and-greet session, throw a belated Christmas lunch, ensure that his own factory goes out on strike in order to camouflage the mayhem he has planned, sign a prize fighter and exchange fashion tips with Luca Changretta. Quite frankly, a lesser man would have collapsed in exhaustion – although the furious release of bullets at the episode’s end suggested that our Mr Shelby is not as in control as he’s pretending. Of course, a large part of the fun on Peaky Blinders is working out how much of Tommy’s actions happen through design and how much is a question of luck and quick reactions. The stand-off with Aberama Gold over Charlie’s yard was a classic quick-thinking Shelby manoeuvre (never try to out-bullshit a bullshitter) but there’s still the nagging feeling that he’s spinning one too many plates in the air, particularly where aspiring boxer Bonnie Gold is concerned. It’s rare that Arthur is the voice of reason but he had a point: why expand at the very moment when all the other business is under threat? Tommy’s other big problem remains Polly, who has always been more than a match for her nephew. This week she made that more than clear, handing out solid advice (with a little bit of welcome witchery on the side) while refusing to acknowledge his olive branch (her truculent “truce” was one of the episode’s funniest moments). Curly might say that everything will be OK because Polly is back (and Curly is rarely if ever wrong) but her desire to protect Michael at all cost coupled with the fact she feels freed from fear of God and fear of death, means that Tommy should probably watch his own family as closely as he’s monitoring the arrival of Italians in Birmingham. The bad guys We learned more about the sinisterly smiling Changretta as he indulged in a stand-off with Tommy at episode’s end. Yes, it remains a ludicrous trope for the bad guy to break in somewhere and, rather than shooting his opponent dead, spend his time explaining his motivation, but I am giving it a pass because even if Adrien Brody was incorrectly reading my tax returns, I would probably smile beatifically and say: “Yes, absolutely, I do owe that much.” Tommy was somewhat less bowled over by Changretta’s charms although he did take time to establish some ground rules (no civilians, no children, no police involvement) for the bloodshed to come. I must say I rather like the idea of a vendetta conducted under Marquess of Queensberry rules, not least because the actual boxing fight is likely to be conducted under anything but. In addition to Mr Changretta, we were also introduced to ruthless killer-for-hire Aberama Gold (Aidan Gillen channelling his ice-cold gangster John Boy Power in Love/Hate), who is nominally on the side of the Shelbys, although I would note that Johnny Dogs hates him, and like Curly, Johnny is a pretty good judge. Certainly, if I were Tommy, I’d be keen to make sure that that the proposed boxing match went off without a hair being harmed on young Bonnie Gold’s head. Aberama gives the impression of a man who would hunt you to the ends of the earth for vengeance and then spend long cold evenings extracting his price. Additional notes I was pleased to finally learn the In the Bleak Midwinter origin story, and thought there was a nice point made that Jeremiah did find God after the event. The episode’s title was Heathens – which, in addition to being the insult levelled by Johnny Dogs at Aberama, could also be seen as a commentary on Tommy’s (and now Polly’s) rejection of the notion of a God. Jack Rowan, who plays Bonnie, was a pretty good amateur boxer who fought 27 bouts and won 18. Will Linda tell Tommy about the possible danger Ada is in from the military intelligence police? Or is this something that could come back to hurt them later in the season? How much of what Michael said to his mother do you think he actually meant? It’s very dangerous to give a desperate person hope in that way. Interesting that Tommy said neither peace nor truce – does that mean he’s given himself permission to kill his own family if required? If so, I’d almost understand why: my favourite thing in the entire episode was Tommy’s face of great perseverance under deeply trying circumstances as his family bickered around him. Nice curse from Esme – “No peace for either of you ever”. Shame she’s gone on the road though as I’d have been interested in seeing her match Changretta’s Vendetta with her own. Hurrah for the brief return of May Carleton and her excellent eyebrows of deep disdain. Finally, poor unfairly ignored Devlin – he should join Frances in her newly established home for people who are rudely brushed away by Thomas Shelby while trying to impart important information. Anachronistic yet strangely right song of the week The best song of the episode came at its beginning when we were treated to a lovely, stripped-down version of The Mercy Seat by Nick Cave himself. Quote of the week “Without you, he falls apart and, without him, they’ll take us all. You’ve got to get us through this.” For the second week in a row, Michael sums up the key point of the episode, but will Polly listen or does she have her own agenda in mind? So what do you think?

The damning inspection report into Oakhill secure training centre, near Milton Keynes, was published on Tuesday as MPs heard that ministers had ordered G4S to set up an external inquiry into abuse allegations at Brook House, the immigration removal centre at Gatwick, which is also run by the private security firm. The joint report by the prison inspectors, with Ofsted and the Care Quality Commission, into Oakhill in September and October – when the centre was near capacity, with 75 boys aged 14 to 17 – finds “no evidence that staff can adequately care and control this volume of young people”. The report rates the youth prison as “inadequate” and says there has been an increase in fights and assaults since the last inspection in January; it records 330 assaults between March and August this year alone, with assaults against staff increasing, including against newly recruited staff, and some so serious they have led to people being taken to hospital. “One manager said that young people are carrying improvised weapons because they do not feel safe. This inhibits some staff from intervening because of the fear of a weapon, and this in turn reinforces the view of young people that staff cannot protect them, thereby continuing the cycle,” the report says. The inspectors say that many of the recommendations from their January inspection have not been met and the centre has deteriorated in most respects, including to do with safety, care, education, resettlement and the “effectiveness of leaders and managers”. They say that unacceptable behaviour, including swearing, intimidation and vandalism, is not being challenged by staff. Oakhill’s newly appointed interim director, Lisette Saunders, said: “We take these findings very seriously. In the report Ofsted recognised that senior managers at Oakhill know what is required to bring the centre up to acceptable standards. “This year the team at Oakhill has made a number of changes, restructuring the workforce to provide better support for young people and frontline staff, and greater management oversight and accountability. I look forward to building on this progress as the benefits take effect.” The inspection report was published as the Commons home affairs select committee questioned the immigration minister, Brandon Lewis, about Home Office oversight of the G4S-run Brook House immigration removal centre. BBC Panorama undercover filming disclosed staff “mocking, abusing and assaulting” detainees. The minister told MPs that the private security company had commissioned a review by the independent consultants Verita, after he met the company last week. The review will try to understand the “extent and root causes of the treatment of detainees” and examine the failure of whistleblowing procedures at the centre. The Home Office is considering whether or not to review the G4S contract at Brook House."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"community/2017/nov/21/join-the-conversation-the-best-comments-on-the-guardian-today","type":"article","sectionId":"community","sectionName":"Community","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-23T15:05:07Z","webTitle":"Your best comments on the Guardian today","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/community/2017/nov/21/join-the-conversation-the-best-comments-on-the-guardian-today","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/community/2017/nov/21/join-the-conversation-the-best-comments-on-the-guardian-today","fields":{"headline":"Your best comments on the Guardian today","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The best thing about dining alone, what it means to be a care worker and the spread of light pollution have provoked some of the most interesting reader discussion around the Guardian today.

The prospect of life outside the European Union will alter how we trade, move goods and people around and make our way in the world. For a long time these questions about the future have been neglected by national governments – left to the market, to globalisation, to Brussels. Now we need active change. To provide it, the government is launching its industrial strategy white paper, which will be published next Monday and heavily trailed during this week’s budget. In a welcome move, Theresa May has already outlined how the government plans to increase public and private R&amp;D investment by up to £80bn over the next 10 years. The prime minister also announced £1.7bn to improve transport links within city regions. This comes as the UK is in serious need of new thinking to address fundamental long-term economic challenges: poor productivity, unbalanced regional growth and a weak track record in translating knowledge creation into inclusive wealth creation. The impact of the financial collapse in 2008 and the recent decision to leave the EU have only exacerbated these deep-seated national problems. A long-term industrial strategy for the UK that includes proper investment in R&amp;D and connectivity is overdue. For the industrial strategy to make the most difference to people’s lives, it needs to take a comprehensive, regional approach. Simply investing in potentially successful industrial sectors – such as digital, advanced manufacturing and health technologies – will embed inequalities and fail to deliver inclusive growth. We need this because performance of the overall UK economy is held back by stark variations in productivity. London and south-east perform well above the national average, on a par with the most successful parts of Europe, while productivity everywhere else lags well behind. Sheffield and other former industrial powerhouses are among the least productive in the UK. This is partly down to a long-term failure to address industrial decline, which many areas outside the south-east faced in the 1970s and 1980s. Tax revenues from a supercharged financial sector in the City of London have fuelled public spending. Governments were able to ignore regional inequality – until Brexit.We need something now that goes beyond the old-fashioned, post-war regional strategies. It should explore what is really driving growth in cities and regions – including universities. It should reflect the fact that the success of our knowledge economy depends on closing the gaps between innovation and implementation. As an example, my own university, Sheffield Hallam, contributes half a billion pounds to its regional economy, working with more than 2,000 employers every year through research, innovation and graduate recruitment. We are investing £14m in building the Advanced Wellbeing Research Centre to deliver health innovation. It brings together academics, industry and the medical profession to create the most advanced research and development centre for physical activity in the world – and attracts jobs and investment. The centre will also generate health benefits for the entire population by helping people exercise more effectively. This is not exceptional: it’s what engaged universities do. With more targeted government support through the industrial strategy, we could achieve even more to help redress the productivity imbalance within our region. The changing world calls for imaginative responses that drive innovation, using research into real world problems to stimulate new developments that have a real impact. We know universities can drive prosperity, building successful economies based around teaching and research. The next step is to build on their potential to foster inclusive growth.

The actor and Oscar-winning director, who has faced repeated damaging allegations of racist and misogynistic behaviour, said: “Things got shaken up a little bit and there is a lot of light being thrown into places where there were shadows and that is kind of healthy. It’s painful, but I think pain is a precursor to change.” Gibson was speaking while promoting his latest film, Daddy’s Home 2, his first family comedy in more than a decade after he was convicted of driving under the influence. He pleaded no contest to a misdemeanour battery charge in 2011 against his former girlfriend and mother of his child, Oksana Grigorieva. In 2010, it was reported that tapes had been submitted to the courts of Gibson allegedly using racist language and threatening to kill Grigorieva. He is also alleged to have said she deserved a beating. In one of the most notorious incidents involving the actor and director, Gibson unleashed an antisemitic rant in 2006 against a police officer in Malibu, California, who had pulled him over for drunk driving. He accused Jews of being responsible for “all the wars in the world”. He was convicted of driving under the influence. His latest comments come after dozens of women alleged they had been sexually harassed or assaulted by Weinstein. Weinstein’s spokesperson said: “Any allegations of non-consensual sex are unequivocally denied.” They also come just days after the Old Vic theatre revealed that 20 men had come forward to claim they were harassed by House of Cards star Kevin Spacey when he was its artistic director. Spacey was also accused of making unwelcome sexual advances towards actor Anthony Rapp when he was only 14 years old. Spacey, who was 26 at the time, said he did not remember the incident but if it did happen it was likely “deeply inappropriate drunken behaviour” and said he was sincerely apologetic. Last year, Gibson spoke about his notorious 2006 comments about Jewish people, claiming he has “never discriminated against anyone”. He said: “It was an unfortunate incident. I was loaded and angry and arrested. I was recorded illegally by an unscrupulous police officer who was never prosecuted for that crime. And then it was made public by him for profit, and by members of – we’ll call it the press. So, not fair. I guess as who I am, I’m not allowed to have a nervous breakdown, ever.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"politics/2017/nov/21/brexit-iod-ups-pressure-on-may-with-march-transition-deal-deadline","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-21T13:08:59Z","webTitle":"Brexit: IoD ups pressure on May with call for transition deal by March","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/nov/21/brexit-iod-ups-pressure-on-may-with-march-transition-deal-deadline","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/nov/21/brexit-iod-ups-pressure-on-may-with-march-transition-deal-deadline","fields":{"headline":"Brexit: IoD ups pressure on May with call for transition deal by March","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Theresa May would need to secure a clear Brexit transition agreement by March if she wanted to avoid a “snowballing” number of companies activating contingency plans and even moving operations out of the UK, the Institute of Directors will warn. Stephen Martin, director general of the business group, is to issue the ultimatum to the government at the IoD annual dinner on Tuesday, saying “all we want for Christmas is progress on Brexit”. He will say the time would come soon when the IoD may have to advise all of its members to be ready for no deal and urged the government to stop this outcome. “We know from our recent surveys that over half of you are already in the process of contingency planning,” Martin will say. “The number of businesses who have actually implemented these plans is currently low, around one in 10, but this will snowball if we don’t find out soon what is going to happen in March 2019. “It’s clear that the government has a small window of opportunity between now and the end of the first quarter of next year to secure a firm political agreement on transition. If we don’t have this commitment by the end of March, then business will come under pressure to implement contingency plans, even perhaps as far as relocating operations.” He will say companies supported the idea of a transitional period after March 2019 to help the UK and rest of the EU adjust to Brexit, but they needed to know that cross-border trade would effectively remain unchanged. Martin will say that businesses do not want to move to World Trade Organisation rules as it would be a “huge drop down from where we are now” but may soon have to start planning for that possibility. “WTO is not the simple option, it would involve massive complexity to adjust our customs procedures, and we would lose not just our level of access to the single market, but also potentially all of the trade and investment agreements we have with other countries through the EU,” he will say. “It’s not desirable, but it is possible. The time may come soon when we have to advise all of our members to be ready for no deal. We plead with the government that it does not get to this stage.” Warnings by business groups have been intensifying in recent weeks amid worries that May’s improved offer of up to £40bn would not be enough to break the deadlock and allow the EU to move on to trade talks at the December council. Britain’s aerospace exporters warned parliament on Monday of a crippling £1.5bn-a-year headwind if ministers failed to agree urgent new customs and regulatory deals with the EU. And last month, five of the UK’s biggest business lobby groups, including the IoD, said that time was running out for the government to strike a transition deal before firms started to rein in spending plans as they finalised budgets for 2018. “We need agreement of transitional arrangements as soon as possible, as without urgent agreement many companies have serious decisions about investment and contingency plans to take at the start of 2018,” the business groups wrote. “Failure to agree a transition period of at least two years could have wide-reaching and damaging consequences for investment and trade, as firms review their investment plans and business strategies.” The CBI and British Chambers of Commerce were among the other signatories warning the government of the potentially dire consequences for the UK economy of failing to agree a transition period of at least two years with the EU. The bosses of the manufacturing trade body EEF and the Federation of Small Businesses also signed the letter on behalf of their members, who employ millions of UK workers."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2017/nov/21/autumn-budget-statement-2017-what-to-look-out-for-philip-hammond","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-21T18:22:07Z","webTitle":"What to look out for in Philip Hammond’s budget speech","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/nov/21/autumn-budget-statement-2017-what-to-look-out-for-philip-hammond","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2017/nov/21/autumn-budget-statement-2017-what-to-look-out-for-philip-hammond","fields":{"headline":"What to look out for in Philip Hammond’s budget speech","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"This is Philip Hammond’s first budget statement since the general election in June and the third since he became chancellor last year. In March he was cheered by his backbenchers after the UK avoided the recession predicted by many analysts following the Brexit vote last year. Employment was climbing and measures of consumer and business confidence, which plummeted after the referendum, had bounced back. But he was soon in deep trouble with his Tory colleagues for planning a one percentage point increase in national insurance on the self-employed and, in a humiliating U-turn, he was forced to ditch the whole idea. The election in June left Hammond further weakened. He needs to push through measures that improve the economy’s productivity to have any chance of meeting his pledge to eliminate the UK’s deficit by the mid-2020s, but is also facing pressing problems in public services, welfare provision and a housing market that has effectively locked a generation of young people out of home ownership. Economy What we know: The UK economy expanded by 1.7% in 2016 but registered just 0.5% growth in the first half of this year. The pace has improved since the summer largely due to improving growth rates in Europe and the US, but the outlook remains weak. What to look out for: The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) is expected to downgrade the 2% GDP growth it was expecting for 2017 back in March to about 1.5%. Growth expectations for the next four years are also likely to be lowered. There is a productivity crisis that the OBR has been understating and is about to include more realistic forecasts. That will trigger a reduction in the forecast for tax receipts, knocking the chancellor’s deficit reduction plan off course. Public spending What we know: In March the OBR expected the public finances to plunge further into the red this year and the budget deficit to worsen for the first time in seven years, but tax receipts have held up well and the deficit is on course to be at least £6bn smaller than forecast in March. What to look out for: Usually chancellors use an election victory to raise taxes and Hammond is unlikely to be an exception. But he will need to use stealth taxes and avoidance crackdowns to raise funds if he is to sidestep his cabinet critics. Public services What we know: The government’s 1% cap on public sector pay rises will be relaxed in the police and prison services. Prison workers are getting a 1.7% pay rise and police officers will get an additional 1% bonus. What to look out for: he head of the NHS, school heads and others want to relax the pay cap and spending more generally. It looks like Hammond will take a hard line, though he could promise to increase pay above 1% later in the parliament. Universal credit/welfare What we know: About 7% of tax credit claimants have moved to universal credit and, according to Labour MPs and food bank charities, the system is chaotic and causing extreme hardship. Lower payments for disabled people, who were already hit hard by the bedroom tax, are also a cause for concern among anti-poverty groups. A rise in inflation has also hit as many as 11m families who claim benefits and are at the beginning of a four-year income freeze. What to look out for: Hammond is expected to announce some easing of the rules for universal credit, possibly cutting the wait for the first payment from six weeks to four weeks. But he is not expected to offer more money to boost welfare payments. Housebuilding What we know: the private sector and housing associations built 220,000 new homes last year - up from 150,000 in 2015. Hammond wants to raise this figure to nearer 300,000, but says no single measure can achieve that aim. The communities secretary, Sajid Javid, wants local authority borrowing limits to be raised so local councils can get building. What to look out for: housing will play a big role in the budget. A raft of announcements is likely. A stamp duty cut to help first time buyers get on the property ladder will be criticised for being a gift to property developers. Hammond could also back a £7bn transport linkin the “brain belt” spanning Oxford, Cambridge and Milton Keynes that the national infrastructure commission said could create 1m new homes. Technology investment What we know: Hammond has already said he plans to provide £1bn of new spending for hi-tech projects, including £75m for research on artificial intelligence, £400m for electric car charging points and £100m to boost clean car sales. What to look out for: There will be talk of driverless cars being the future and Britain as a hub for technological developments. Any extra cash would be a surprise. Brexit What we know: Many Tory MPs have demanded Hammond set aside extra money to prepare for a no-deal Brexit. David Jones, a former Brexit minister, said at least £1bn should be allocated to recruit customs officers and border officials and develop IT systems. Until now Hammond has resisted all calls for setting aside money for leaving the European Union without a deal. What to look out for: Brexit is the elephant walking the Treasury’s oak-panelled corridors. Its impact is so colossal that most of the forecasts for the next five years will almost certainly be wrong: either because they will be much better or worse than the central outlook. Expect Hammond to ignore pleas for a hard Brexit plan. Pensions What we know: The former chancellor George Osborne pushed through a radical overhaul of private pensions, cutting the lifetime limit on pension savings of £1.25m to £1m from April 2016. Hammond would like to axe the triple lock – of increasing the state pension in line with highest percentage increase from average earnings, inflation or 2.5% – but was forced to retreat from that plan. What to look out for: there are unlikely to be changes to the state pension system. There is a chance Hammond might reduce the tax-free lump sum offered to private pension savers to 20% from 25%, which would bring the Treasury billions of pounds over the next 30 years. Personal tax What we know: Hammond is pledged to raise the personal income tax threshold to £12,500 by 2020, while the 40% higher tax rate is due to increase to £50,000. The 45p tax on incomes above £150,000 is expected to remain in place. What to look out for: Hammond may choose to freeze all tax thresholds from 2020-21, giving himself a £3.5bn present in the penultimate year of the parliament and £5bn in the final year. Transport What we know: Last month the Scottish government was given £3.6bn over five years from 2019/20 – an increase of £600m on the previous period – to upgrade its railways. HS2 is already under way, with much of the land already purchased. What to look out for: Hammond could flesh out details of a planned trans-Pennine railway and a “transforming cities fund” that involves £1.7bn of extra transport funding. The Tory mayor of the West Midlands region, Andy Street, will get £250m of the fund. The government aims to push total public and private expenditure in the sector to a£80bn over the next 10 years. Fuel duty What we know: Fuel-duty freezes for the past seven years have prevented tax rises of 18p per litre to pump prices. The exchequer would have been £20bn better off this year if the duty rises had gone ahead. What to look out for: Another freeze is almost certain as Tory backbenchers prevent the Treasury from imposing further costs on hard-pressed workers, but the chancellor could shift the balance, raising duty on diesel and cutting it on petrol. Tax avoidance What we know: Hammond is under pressure from Labour to tackle aggressive tax avoidance, following publication of the Paradise Papers earlier this month. They raised questions about the tax affairs of corporations and individuals, from Apple to Formula One star Lewis Hamilton. What to look out for: Hammond is keen to extend a crackdown on single person companies operating in the public sector to the private sector too. He suspects many only work for one employer for long periods and should therefore be employees. Business rates What we know: They bring in big money: £28bn last year, according to the OBR. A review that rebalanced higher payments to places with higher rentable values, primarily in London and the south-east, already has transition arrangements in place. What to look out for: The rebalancing is causing pain in Tory heartlands. Hammond could delay changes, but the exchequer would lose out if he didn’t also axe business rate cuts due for the north and west. Sin taxes What we know: A sugar tax starts next April on sugar-sweetened drinks. The Scotch Whisky Association has lobbied intensively for a 3.9% duty rise imposed in March to be reversed. What to look out for: The sugar tax will go ahead while duty increases on whisky, beer and cider will likely stay as they are or rise only gently. Wine drinkers and smokers will probably be punished again. Tax on wine in the UK has gone up by 57% since 2008. Insurance premiums What we know: Insurance premium tax – payable on general insurance policies such as home and car cover – has jumped from 6% to 12% in less than 18 months, costing every household about £200. What to expect: Another hike is probably unlikely, but another move towards the 20% VAT rate could be a Treasury target."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2017/nov/21/kezia-dugdale-partner-defends-decision-im-a-celebrity","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-21T15:35:41Z","webTitle":"Kezia Dugdale avoids Scottish Labour suspension over I'm a Celebrity trip","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/nov/21/kezia-dugdale-partner-defends-decision-im-a-celebrity","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/nov/21/kezia-dugdale-partner-defends-decision-im-a-celebrity","fields":{"headline":"Kezia Dugdale avoids Scottish Labour suspension over I'm a Celebrity trip","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The former Scottish Labour leader Kezia Dugdale has avoided being suspended by the party after she joined the cast of I’m a Celebrity … Get Me Out of Here without its approval. The Scottish Labour parliamentary group at Holyrood met to discuss her absence hours after Dugdale arrived in Australia to join 11 other contestants in the reality TV show. In a short statement, the group said it would not take any immediate action against her for flying out without getting formal approval to miss parliamentary sessions and votes. But the statement implied she could yet face some form of sanction. “In accordance with standard procedure, Kezia Dugdale will be interviewed on her return to parliament and have the opportunity to present her account of events,” the statement said. Dugdale’s partner, Jenny Gilruth, has defended her decision to appear on the show, saying she had delayed her arrival to try to avoid a clash with the election of her successor as party leader. Gilruth, a Scottish National party MSP, said those plans were sabotaged by a leak on Friday which meant news of Dugdale’s appearance on the show overshadowed Richard Leonard’s victory in the leadership vote. Gilruth told the Daily Record that Dugdale, a regional list MSP for the Lothians, had tried hard to avoid that happening and was upset by the impact the leak had had on the party, but also by the vitriolic attacks on her judgment. “The news that she was to be taking part was leaked many days before it was supposed to be known,” Gilruth said. “Indeed, she’s not even in there. Yet. I know Kez was upset about the way it affected Labour’s leadership result. And I know she was upset by some of the hurtful things written about her. How could she not be?” The row has also overshadowed a furore over the decision by Alex Salmond, the former SNP leader, to host a regular show on the Russian government-funded channel RT. The latest season of I’m a Celebrity … Get Me Out of Here!, filmed in New South Wales, Australia, started on Sunday night with 10 contestants. Dugdale is due to appear on set in the next day or two along with the 12th contestant, Iain Lee, a radio DJ. Dugdale has pledged to donate her MSP’s salary during her time in the jungle and a portion of her appearance fee to a motor neurone disease charity. The Record, for whom Dugdale is a columnist, reported that she was approached to take part in I’m a Celebrity after she resigned as Scottish Labour leader in August, but turned it down because it would involve her being named as a participant and flying to Australia before her successor had been named. She was then offered a shorter stint on the show to avoid a direct clash, and she accepted on the understanding there would be no publicity until after the leadership election result. It is understood from a source close to Dugdale that she told James Kelly, Scottish Labour’s business manager – the equivalent of a chief whip at Westminster – about the offer and sought his permission. Kelly said he could not give her permission since it was possible he would have been replaced as business manager by the new leader by the time she joined the other contestants. He suggested she seek permission from the two candidates, Leonard and Anas Sarwar. She told them she had a chance to earn money for charity on a foreign trip, but did not say it was a reality TV show. They said yes, the source said, but based on incomplete information. While Gilruth and some colleagues defended Dugdale’s decision, arguing she could reach a wider, younger audience than through conventional means and was entitled to have some fun, the SNP has used the row to attack her party. In her article defending Dugdale, Gilruth accused Labour of lacking perspective. “The Labour party have some challenges to face politically – it would be refreshing if that ‘real change’ started with a bit of human decency,” she said. Nicola Sturgeon, the SNP leader and first minister, appeared to support Dugdale’s decision on Sunday, tweeting that she was #TeamKez. But on Monday Sturgeon said she would not have been happy if an SNP MSP had done the same, and she lashed out at Labour. “It’s not something I would want to see an SNP MSP do,” she said. “MSPs are elected to represent their constituents. I think it’s important they do that. I am not sure I entirely understand what Kezia Dugdale thinks she will benefit from this. “I’m not sure there are many politicians who would choose to do what she is doing. That said, she is in the Scottish Labour party – they appear to be a nest of vipers, so perhaps getting away from that to the jungle, when you see it in that context, it’s easier to understand.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/nov/22/silvio-berlusconi-appeal-against-public-office-ban-reaches-echr","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-22T05:00:10Z","webTitle":"Silvio Berlusconi takes public office ban to human rights court","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/nov/22/silvio-berlusconi-appeal-against-public-office-ban-reaches-echr","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/nov/22/silvio-berlusconi-appeal-against-public-office-ban-reaches-echr","fields":{"headline":"Silvio Berlusconi takes public office ban to human rights court","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"An appeal against a ban on Silvio Berlusconi holding public office is to be heard by the European court of human rights, in a move that could potentially see Italy’s scandal-tainted former prime minister leading the country again. The hearing on Wednesday, six years after he was forced from office, follows his success at forging a winning coalition out of his centre-right Forza Italia and two far-right parties – the Northern League and Brothers of Italy – in regional elections in Sicily earlier this month. The outcome of the ballot on the southern Italian island was largely seen as a rehearsal for how things might play out in national elections, which must be held before May next year. It also marked the beginning of an authentic political comeback for the 81-year-old, despite being plagued by a tax fraud conviction, sex scandals and allegations of corruption. Considering the length of time it takes for the court to deliver a verdict, it is unlikely to come before the general elections. The current five-year term for the Italian government officially expires on 15 March, although the vote could be held as late as May. “I hope that the Strasbourg court will accept my appeal,” Berlusconi wrote on Twitter on Wednesday. “But my role in the next electoral campaign is clear regardless: I will be in the field looking to take the centre-right into government.” The billionaire, who was forced to resign from his third term as prime minister in 2011 over claims he paid for sex with an underage sex worker, has hired top lawyers from London’s Doughty Street Chambers to fight his case. He was ejected from parliament and banned from running for office for six years in 2013 due to his tax fraud conviction. “We’ll have just 30 minutes to set out our argument, the same goes for the government,” Andrea Saccucci, one of the lawyers who will represent Berlusconi in the Strasbourg court, told the Guardian. “It’s pretty standard, but this hearing will attract a lot of attention for obvious reasons.” In 2012, Berlusconi was given a four-year jail term for the tax fraud conviction, but this was later commuted to four hours community service a week at a home for people with dementia in Milan. A law known as the Severino decree, which ruled that anyone sentenced to two years or more in prison should be banned from office for at least six years, was passed after Berlusconi’s conviction. His lawyers will argue that Italy violated European legislation as the decree was applied retroactively, therefore landing Berlusconi with a harsher penalty than the one he would have got when the crime was committed. The tax fraud, related to the purchase of TV rights by his firm Mediaset, dates back to the 1990s. The team will argue that stripping Berlusconi of his democratic mandate was unfair given the support he retains in Italy, and that the move was open to political manipulation as it was decided by parliament. “This decision could not be reviewed by a court, there was no appeal, no remedy available,” Saccucci said. Many eminent jurists at the court are said to support Berlusconi’s case, as well as some respected scholars. Regardless of whether the ban is lifted, Berlusconi, currently experiencing a high in his 30-year rollercoaster of a political career, could still end up calling the shots in Italy’s next government. Although opinion polls position Forza Italia in third place – after the insurgent Five Star Movement and the centre-left Democratic party – the party has gained ground since his coalition’s Sicily victory. A recent change in electoral law allowing alliances to be formed before elections could see the same group replicate its success nationally, fending off the Eurosceptic 5Star Movement, which refuses to forge coalitions and which many voters are still wary of, and the Democratic party, which has been in crisis ever since leader Matteo Renzi was forced to quit as prime minister after his botched referendum on constitutional reform last December. “With Renzi’s star vanishing, Berlusconi has surprisingly emerged as the only pro-European, pro-markets, pro-stability politician around,” said Francesco Giavazzi, an economics professor at Milan’s Bocconi University. “I think the centre-right coalition is very likely to come out first, and maybe with enough votes even to form a government.” Giavazzi also pointed to Berlusconi’s many supporters, recalling Forza Italia winning 25% of the vote in the 2013 elections. “This is an ageing population, but many of those voters are still alive and kicking, so he has a strong core … there are also many who might think that Berlusconi is the best option for keeping the Five Star Movement out, even if they don’t like him.” Roberto D’Alimonte, a political science professor at Rome’s Luiss University, said that with or without the pending court ruling, Berlusconi was a kingmaker. “There’ll be no winner [in the elections], the winner will be Berlusconi. He is on the rise because he is liked, he has resources and because his rivals are weak and, in some cases, incompetent.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"}]}}
