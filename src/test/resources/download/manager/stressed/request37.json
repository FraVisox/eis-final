I bloody loved it' – restaurant review","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"• Indian Accent 16 Albemarle Street, London W1, 207-629-9802. Open Mon-Sat, noon-2pm, 5.30-10pm. Lunch £25/£30 for two/three courses, dinner £55/£65 for three/four courses, all plus drinks and service. Over the past 500 or so restaurants I’ve been to, I’ve developed a shorthand for places like Indian Accent: the scribble “OPM”, or Other People’s Money. As in, if you find yourself in Mayfair drubbing through someone else’s expense account, well, I cannot recommend Manish Mehrotra’s teensy-weensy blue cheese naan enough. His style of naan, smaller than a Farley’s rusk and thinner than a slice of Mother’s Pride, appears as an amuse-bouche with a Lilliputian pewter jug of curried coconut sipping sauce. Pinky in the air. Glug, glug. It is a cutting stereotype that all northern women love gravy, but at this, Mehrotra’s third opening (after New Delhi and New York), I drank curry sauce elegantly, as an aperitif, and I bloody loved it. But then, everything is elegant here. Indian Accent hammers home that New Delhi chefs can channel faff and frippery as much as our own home-grown Michelin star-chasers. An opening course of two Kashmiri morels is outstanding. They’re dusted with walnut powder and come perched on a parmesan papad (another teeny suggestion of seasoned dough). Only a wrong-headed person can’t enjoy an earthy morel, and this particular nutty, piquant, cheesy fungus singular mouthful is indeed a dream. Still, if you’ve turned up at Indian Accent expecting anything as wildly pedestrian as pilau rice, pakora or bhaji, you’ve made a wrong turn. Or, more accurately, you’d be better off over the road at the Sethi family’s Gymkhana (by God, I love that place), where for similar prices they’ll stuff you with venison keema naan, duck chettinad and wild muntjac biryani. Gymkhana is still fancy, but it’s the sort of fancy that requires a lie-down with one’s ankles raised afterwards. After four courses at Indian Accent, my stomach still felt decidedly light, though my head was heavy with explication. “Can I explain how the menu works?” I was asked as I sat down. I’ve long since learned there is no arguing with a front of house determined to unveil the mysteries of their menu. That it reads left to right. That dishes titled “main” are “larger and more filling”. And those puddings at the end? Well, they’re puddings. And so on. I endure this once. Then a second time from a different server. And a third when my guest, Will, appears. It’s one of those dinners where conversation jolts along, peppered with “Can I just?” interruptions. Spheres of frankly delicious aloo chat topped with a white pea mash arrive with a vocal autopsy. A bowl of moradabadi dal comes with an expansive story about the chef’s mother, but sadly also a miniscule cauliflower chur chur paratha: my Sindy doll had a bigger frock. Still, I must not fault restaurants for bombarding you with fact. Many guests adore it. Especially married couples of seven or more years who will take an ornate breakdown about a soy keema with quail egg and lime leaf butter pao over a tedious chat as to why the council has replaced their recycling bin. That soy keema, incidentally, is one of the greatest vegetarian offerings I’ve ever tasted. Whip off the quail egg, and I dare say they could make it vegan. This thing rocks with fenugreek and mustard seeds, and looks like meat, but tastes better. I could consume it daily. The ghee roast lamb with roomali roti is a riff on Cantonese duck pancakes, even down to the trimmed slices of cucumber. And you can swap the lamb for rajastani chakki, a meat substitute formed from fried atta dough and tossed in an onion gravy. We ate two puddings – one a triumph, the other simply puzzling. One was an adult-sized portion of Punjabi barfi treacle tart of golden syrup, crumbled chocolate sponge cake and cream on a pastry base with a generous scoop of vanilla bean ice-cream. But the meethe chawal sweet rice with almond milk and barberries was the hinterland between Trill budgie feed and pot-pourri. I suspect it simply didn’t match my western pre-notions of sweet rice on soft, melting puddings, but my rule of thumb is that anything that makes me gurn or swear when I eat it is just not for me. I spent OPM on Indian Accent and really rather liked it. But I will never, ever go back. Like many restaurateurs before them, I’m sure they’ll be over the moon.

The 2018 crop finds room for a solid 30 British nominees: from actors such as Gary Oldman, Sally Hawkins, Lesley Manville and Daniel Kaluuya to behind-the camera talent including the director Christopher Nolan, costume designer Jacqueline Durran (competing against herself for Darkest Hour and Beauty and the Beast), and cinematographer Roger Deakins (hoping to break his 13-film losing streak with Blade Runner 2049). Two very British films – Dunkirk and Darkest Hour – have made considerable headway, and there is the usual sprinkling of Brits attached to heavyweight Hollywood projects: producers, visual effects artists and the like. This year’s numbers are a little up on last year’s, when 24 British nominees attended, but well down on 2016’s, when there were 53 and The Danish Girl was arguably the highest-profile UK production at the Oscars. It cannot be a coincidence, however, that the two headline British films this year trade in nostalgia for second world war stiff upper lip: Nolan’s Dunkirk and the Churchill biopic Darkest Hour. Fionnuala Halligan, the chief critic for UK film industry magazine Screen, says their success is a reaction to “today’s more tangled moral mores”. “The heroics of Dunkirk and Darkest Hour give the idea of a time when things were more simple, when there was a single enemy that great men could attempt to defeat,” she said. The veteran producer Stephen Woolley, whose latest project, Colette, has just premiered successfully at the Sundance film festival, points out that “nostalgic British period movies have always been Oscar favourites – from Chariots of Fire to The King’s Speech to Atonement.” But the enduring presence of British craftspeople in the various technical categories is less of a testament to the popularity of individual films or actors than to the maintenance of a tradition that goes back at least to the 1940s. “It’s terrific that British actors seem to be all the rage in US movies,” says Woolley, “but that’s not necessarily an indication that the British film industry in is in good shape. Brits quite rightly have a phenomenal reputation for film crafts, which is why Star Wars, Game of Thrones, Harry Potter etc are all shot in the UK.” If there’s a specific point of excitement around British manifestation at the Oscars, it is the nomination of the Get Out lead Daniel Kaluuya as best actor – despite his Britishness initially appearing something of a handicap, after attracting negative comments from Samuel L Jackson for not being “an American brother”. Along with Timothée Chalamet, Kaluuya seems to represent the arrival of a new generation: not simply because of his age (Kaluuya is 28, Chalamet 22), but also because of the role it plays in the culture war that is still convulsing Hollywood. Ben Roberts, the director of the BFI Film Fund, said it “makes the unthinkable seem possible for others”. He added: “Daniel is not acting royalty, but it’s not a fluke either – he has been working hard in theatre, film and TV, so it is very exciting and inspiring.” Halligan, too, is full of praise: “He’s not an overnight success – there’s a lot of graft gone into that. The idea that up-and-coming British actors are all public school-educated is no longer the case: Daniel grew up on a council estate, like Callum Turner and John Boyega. That’s what Brits are famous for – hard work and craft.” The Academy Awards take place on 4 March in Los Angeles."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2018/jan/25/dutch-museum-row-reopens-debate-colonial-legacy-mauritshuis-hague","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-25T05:00:06Z","webTitle":"Dutch museum row reopens uneasy debate about colonial legacy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jan/25/dutch-museum-row-reopens-debate-colonial-legacy-mauritshuis-hague","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jan/25/dutch-museum-row-reopens-debate-colonial-legacy-mauritshuis-hague","fields":{"headline":"Dutch museum row reopens uneasy debate about colonial legacy","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"A debate over the Netherlands’ colonial heritage burst into the open this week after one of the country’s leading museums came under fire for removing a bust of its founder from its lobby. The Mauritshuis in The Hague, home to national treasures including Vermeer’s Girl With a Pearl Earring and Carel Fabritius’s The Goldfinch, said the decision was part of a reorganisation of its collection to reflect a “growing discussion in society” about the country’s slave-trading past. A cousin of the Prince of Orange, Count Johan Maurits van Nassau-Siegen was appointed governor of the Dutch colony in Brazil in 1636. He shipped slaves across from modern-day Ghana to work on the sugarcane plantations and built the Mauritshuis as a private residence using the fortune he earned from the trade. The prime minister, Mark Rutte, described the decision as “crazy” and warned against “judging the distant past through today’s eyes”. He later toned down his remarks after the museum’s director, Emilie Gordenker, explained in a TV interview that the bust, a composite-marble copy of an original sculpture, was no longer needed because the Mauritshuis had recently created a gallery dedicated to its founder, including an original bust. “This is about improving the way we tell the story so that we can share all aspects, positive and negative, with our visitors,” said Gordenker. “Once we’d done that there was really no need to have this plaster replica in between the toilets and the cash desk.” By then the debate had flared in political circles and on social media, reflecting growing unease and sensitivity about the Dutch colonial legacy. Antoinette Laan, an MP for Rutte’s conservative Liberal party (VVD), tabled questions in parliament asking if history was being “rubbed out”. “We are importing the American tendency to oversensitivity,” she said. The debate has echoes of the campaign in the US to remove statues of Confederate soldiers from public places, but in the Netherlands few people are calling for the statues to be taken down. Some historians and politicians have called for plaques on monuments to figures from the country’s “Golden Age” to reflect all aspects of their impact on history. Dienke Hondius, a historian at Amsterdam’s Vrije Universiteit, told RTL News that rather than being taken down, statues should be “left standing and put in context”. She cited the campaign in Barcelona to remove the statue of Christopher Columbus because of the association with imperial conquest and genocide. “The downside is you’re no longer confronted with this chapter in the city’s history, so it’s no longer debated,” said Hondius. “You don’t want that.” Political party Denk, which draws much of its support from minority ethnic groups, has called for streets, tunnels and bridges to be renamed and stripped of their associations with the Netherlands’ “inhuman colonial past”. In Amsterdam, a primary school named after the former Dutch East Indies governor Jan Pieterszoon Coen last week announced plans to remove the name of the man known as the “Butcher of Banda”. “We don’t want to be associated with him,” said the headteacher, Sylvia van den Akker. “He murdered a lot of people.” Coen’s conquest of the island of Banda in 1621 turned into a massacre in which 14,000 of the island’s 15,000 natives were killed. The council in his birthplace of Hoorn placed a new plaque under his statue five years ago acknowledging his bloody history. Last year, the Witte de With contemporary art centre in Rotterdam said it no longer wanted to bear the name of Vice-admiral De With, whose colonial escapades included burning 90,000 clove trees on Ambon to drive up commodity prices. Rotterdam city council agreed last October to place an explanatory plaque by a statue of the naval commander Piet Hein. Hein and De With are celebrated in Dutch history for plundering the Spanish silver fleet in 1628 in the run-up to independence from Spanish rule in 1648. Both were also pivotal in establishing Dutch colonial rule in the East and West Indies."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"small-business-network/2018/jan/29/business-made-simple-event-in-leeds","type":"article","sectionId":"small-business-network","sectionName":"Guardian Small Business Network","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-29T10:40:45Z","webTitle":"Business Made Simple event in Leeds","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/small-business-network/2018/jan/29/business-made-simple-event-in-leeds","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/small-business-network/2018/jan/29/business-made-simple-event-in-leeds","fields":{"headline":"Business Made Simple event in Leeds","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The Guardian Business Made Simple events series, to guide you and your business, is coming to Leeds with an expert masterclass and keynote address from Kavita Oberoi OBE on Wednesday 21 March, 6-9pm.

L’Oréal, which featured her in its advert, apparently wanted to promote an important message: hair care is for everyone, whether or not they choose to show their hair in public. I’m not sure who exactly thinks that women in hijab don’t care about their hair because they wear a headscarf in public. Maybe they let their hair dry and wither away into a hijab-shaped husk? Maybe in private they take off their hijab, only to reveal another hijab? But many thanks anyway to L’Oréal for wanting to show that some Muslim women have hair and engage in some form of follicle husbandry. It wouldn’t be the first time that women were told something obvious in order to sell beauty products via nauseating copy and a model whose looks are a genetic gift rather than a perfect blend of beauty-product success. And it wouldn’t be the first time a company co-opted a symbol of authenticity to sell. Last year, Pepsi was accused of trivialising the Black Lives Matter movement, because of its ad campaign featuring a generic street protest. Sooner or later we’ll be sold sanitary products by a telegenic refugee against the backdrop of a displaced persons’ camp. In fact, I had to Google that to make sure it hadn’t already happened. Khan’s tenure as Muslim-in-residence was, alas, short-lived. The inevitable historic tweets surfaced: in 2014, she made some ill-advised comments on Twitter about Israel and, following their discovery, L’Oréal and Khan parted ways. She stepped down from the campaign, saying in a statement: “Championing diversity is one of my passions, I don’t discriminate against anyone. I have chosen to delete [the tweets] as they do not represent the message of harmony that I stand for.” Live by diversity, die by diversity. And now we might never know what further secrets about hijabi women’s hair we might have learned via this groundbreaking campaign. Of course, this really isn’t about “empowerment”. I am yet to see a context in which that word is deployed where women aren’t being sold to. It’s about money. This isn’t news. No one is looking to L’Oréal for some deep intersectional thinking here. Wokeness sells, and there is a large Muslim market that advertisers are trying to tap into. But I am growing weary of the hijab fetish that is beginning to dominate popular marketing as a kind of default Muslim emoji. The one thing possibly more harmful than invisibility is simplistic or tokenistic representation. I am torn between acknowledging that in L’Oréal’s campaign there is a value for people who don’t see themselves represented in the mainstream media, and worrying that we have come to a point where edginess becomes the whole point – where Muslimness becomes collapsed into an image of an over-filtered, hot, bourgeois, fair-skinned hijabi woman, whose highlighter is “on fleek”. But I know griping about hijiabi models in advertising campaigns at a time when hijabs are being snatched off Muslim women’s heads in hate-crime incidents is not the hill anyone wants to die on. And the fact it annoys people such as Mail on Sunday columnist Peter Hitchens, who had an amusing conniption when H&amp;M used a hijabi model in 2015, suggests that there is a lack of visibility for hijab-wearing women, and that some people would like it to stay that way. But things are changing, and perhaps overcorrecting. Of the Muslim Girl website’s “18 Muslim women to watch in 2018”, the majority are in hijab. So are many of the women that the media chooses to elevate to political totem status – such as Munira Ahmed, who, wrapped in a stars-and-stripes hijab, became the face of the Trump resistance early last year. Perhaps that’s because it’s what the well-meaning liberal market wants. How are you to know that a woman is Muslim if she is not in a hijab? How are you to package her? It’s just capitalism going through its motions. Muslims wearing hijabs aren’t the bearers of some innate authenticity. And while there are positive aspects to the way they are being increasingly featured in the media, it can still be pointed out that this kind of exposure can promote stereotypes, rather than eradicate them. Professor Ted Cantle, who wrote a report on the race riots in northern England in 2001, revisited Blackburn in a report for Panorama this week to find it more divided and segregated than it had ever been. He is damning about official efforts to promote integration but says: “Nadiya Hussain in the Bake Off competition has probably done more for British Muslim relations than 10 years of government policy.” That is both a depressing and a rather encouraging observation. Hussain wasn’t shoehorned into public life. She didn’t win, or go on (despite the abuse she receives) to be a popular, well-loved public figure because she wore the hijab; it was incidental to her success. I appreciate that sometimes things don’t happen organically, and normalisation needs a helping hand. But the route there isn’t via an ever-more-exclusive obsession with images of people wearing hijabs, in order to reassure people that Muslims too can be attractive and have bodily functions. “Whether or not your hair is on display,” Amena Khan says in the ad, “doesn’t affect how much you care about it.’’ The irony is that if her hair had indeed been on display in the ad, no one, including L’Oréal, would have cared about it. In a trend that is the absolute opposite of “groundbreaking”, even modesty is being objectified. • Nesrine Malik writes a fortnightly column for the Guardian"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"film/2018/jan/24/burden-review-ku-klux-klan-drama-is-as-subtle-as-a-sledgehammer","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-24T16:48:48Z","webTitle":"Burden review – Ku Klux Klan drama is as subtle as a sledgehammer","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/jan/24/burden-review-ku-klux-klan-drama-is-as-subtle-as-a-sledgehammer","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/jan/24/burden-review-ku-klux-klan-drama-is-as-subtle-as-a-sledgehammer","fields":{"headline":"Burden review – Ku Klux Klan drama is as subtle as a sledgehammer","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"There’s been a great deal written about the film Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri, and how Sam Rockwell’s character’s path from violent racist to sympathetic good guy seems phony or unearned. There will be fewer complaints about Burden, based on the true story of a South Carolina Klansman who turned his back on bigotry in the 1990s. There is, however, a catch. This movie is about as subtle as a sledgehammer, with no shortage of cringeworthy moments and an uninteresting lead performance. When we first meet Garrett Hedlund’s Mike Burden he hardly comes across as a Mensa candidate, but clearly has a good heart. He works with a tight group at a repossession company, led by father figure Tom (Tom Wilkinson). They take their meals together, have a car in a local drag race and are reconstructing the old theater in the small downtown area of Laurens. When Mike has to take a television away from Judy, a struggling working mother with a deadbeat husband, he does what he’s not supposed to do and lets her hold on to the item. We see Mike as Judy does through her timid eyes beneath a giant mop of red hair (I’ll confess I didn’t recognize Andrea Riseborough until the final credits). Mike may be simple, prone to nervously swaying his head around like a goose when he talks, but he’s a kind soul, right? Well, maybe. Turns out that old theater is about to make its debut as something called The Redneck Store, which sells vulgar racist trinkets. In the back is the KKK Museum, glorifying the murderous American hate group. The main stretch of Burden is an exercise in cognitive dissonance. One moment Mike is the only man who has ever loved and supported Judy and her cute son Franklin. The next minute he’s using the N word, wearing white sheets and prepping for the inevitable violence that Tom’s shop will bring. Also in the mix is the local preacher, Reverend Kennedy (Forest Whitaker) whose uncle was lynched by the KKK. He’s ready to protest and publicize (and even bring down Reverend Jesse Jackson for a rally) but more than anything he’s prepped to pray. Reverend Kennedy is defiant, but devoted to non-violence. Then he gets his lucky break. Judy, now Mike’s girlfriend, is not pro-Klan (as the old saying goes, some of her best friends are black, but in this case it’s true) and she urges Mike to quit the group. After a skirmish that nearly turns deadly he does, and they soon learn the power the Klan has over a small town – they get booted from their home and lose their jobs. Penniless and hungry, the only one who will take them in is Reverend Kennedy. Mike’s long path to enlightenment starts out as one of necessity. He hates having to depend on a black man, but he realizes his ex-friends do not have his interests at heart. After a few drunken montages and flashes of memory, it looks like he’s about to come out the other side, he can still be triggered into his default antagonism. Riseborough and especially Whitaker both get room for some striking, emotional moments. Hedlund just gets to look gross and mumble. Director Andrew Heckler doesn’t have a natural way of staging scenes (peripheral characters chime in with lines as if it’s a high school play) and there’s no consistent visual sense. The main shtick is to make sure that all the white people look as dirty and grungy as possible. Poor people may not have much, but they do have showers. No one except the Reverend’s family looks like they’ve bathed in a month. (When Mike gives Judy his gross stained sweatshirt what’s meant to be romantic may actually make you hurl.) Burden does not have enough working for it to achieve escape velocity from that horrible fate: a movie that can be called “important”, but actually offers little entertainment value. A quick peek at Wikipedia shows that the uplifting ending didn’t quite go the way it’s shown in the movie, either. The good secondary performances aren’t enough to overcome what is ultimately guilt cinema, and that’s a burden to us all. Burden is showing at the Sundance film festival"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2018/feb/12/finlands-10-great-innovations","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-12T14:00:00Z","webTitle":"10 great Finnish innovations","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/feb/12/finlands-10-great-innovations","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/feb/12/finlands-10-great-innovations","fields":{"headline":"10 great Finnish innovations","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Maternity pack Finland’s “baby box” was introduced for poor mothers in 1938 and extended to all in 1949, when it held fabrics, a sewing kit, baby clothes, nappies and a mattress (the box itself doubled as a cot). The contents has changed over time (it now includes a duvet, quilted suit, bonnet, socks and gloves) but it remains hugely popular: 95% of mothers choose it over a cash alternative. Child day care Since the 1980s, Finnish parents of children under three have been able to choose between local authority daycare and a parental “home care allowance” of about €330 a month for the first child (plus a means-tested extra of up to €180). Half as many Finnish toddlers are in daycare as in other Nordic countries. Xylitol Finland began researching the natural sweetener Xylitol and its capacity to dramatically reduce dental plaque in the early 1970s and developed and launched a Xylitol chewing gum – arguably the world’s first health-improving food product – in 1975. Paternity leave Paternity leave was introduced in Finland in 1978. A parental allowance is now paid for 263 working days, with the first 105 paid to the mother and the remaining 158 to either the father or mother. Fathers are also entitled to a “father’s month” off under certain conditions; around 35% take it. National suicide prevention project Finland has halved its suicide rate from 30.3 per 100,000 in 1990 to 14.2 last year after introducing the world’s first national anti-suicide strategy in the late 1980s. Exhaustive research to understand the causes of hundreds of cases produced a nationwide preventive programme. Integrated health centres Finland’s unique all-inclusive, integrated, municipal healthcare centres, introduced in 1972, offer community preventative, diagnostic and curative care; a dental service; GP-level (non-surgical) hospital care; home nursing services; mental health care; rehabilitation and occupational healthcare and ambulance services. Principle of transparency Finland has had a freedom of information act, stating that everyone has a right not just to access government documents but to copy them, since 1766. Documents are public unless ruled otherwise. Restrictions to the general rule must be legislated by parliament, and refusal to make documents public can be challenged in the courts. Committee for the future A long history of coalitions has encouraged stable government with an eye for the long term and the collective interest. But the Finnish parliament is also unusual in having, for the past quarter century, a permanent committee for the future in which MPs study and report on major social challenges for the coming decades. Finnish free comprehensive education Finnish law guarantees a free, high-quality, nine-year basic education (to age 15) in municipal-run schools to every child, regardless of where they live or the wealth of their parents, declaring it an essential human right. Half then go to high school or polytechnic, and half into vocational education, which is also free – as is further and university education. All school teachers have at least a university master’s degree. Veikkaus The national state-owned gaming company has the exclusive right to operate all gaming and gambling in Finland (including online gambling on the country’s largest webstore), and the responsibility for mitigating gambling risks.

The essential novels of Ursula K Le Guin","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"A Wizard of Earthsea “From the towns in its high valleys and the ports on its dark narrow bays many a Gontishman has gone forth to serve the Lords of the Archipelago in their cities as wizard or mage, or, looking for adventure, to wander working magic from isle to isle of all Earthsea,” begins Ursula K Le Guin, in her ringingly clear register. One of her earliest works, this novel is set in the world of Earthsea, an archipelago of islands, and follows the coming of age of the young wizard, Ged, from the island of Gont. Ged is whisked away by a great mage, Ogion, and studies at a school for wizardry. (Sounds familiar? Le Guin told the Guardian that JK Rowling “could have been more generous” in acknowledging the 1968 novel.) While there, his pride tempts him into the summoning of a “shadow”, a beast that he will try to escape for the rest of the novel, and which thing of darkness he will only overcome by acknowledging as his own. There are more Earthsea novels and more adventures, including The Tombs of Atuan, The Farthest Shore, and Tehanu, all filled with Le Guin’s particular form of magic, which involves giving things their true names. And with water, and boats, and dragons, “thin-winged and spiny-backed”. Ostensibly stories for children, they are deeper and wiser than many adult novels. The Left Hand of Darkness Set in the Hainish universe, to which Le Guin would return in other novels, The Left Hand of Darkness tells of Genly Ai, an emissary to the planet of Winter, or Gethen, who is inviting its people to join the Ekumen, a coalition of planets. The Gethenians are “ambisexual” – mostly androgynous, when they enter the state of “kemmer” they can become either male or female in order to reproduce. Le Guin refers to every Gethenian as “he” – leading to sentences like: “The king was pregnant.” Winner of both the Hugo and the Nebula awards, it both forces a re-examination of gender in the reader and, later, becomes a helter-skelter adventure, as Genly is imprisoned and his Gethenian friend, Estraven, sets out to rescue him. For the critic Harold Bloom, the book meant “that Le Guin, more than Tolkien, has raised fantasy into high literature, for our time”. The Lathe of Heaven “I have had dreams … that affected the … non-dream world. The real world.” So says George Orr, a man whose dreams have the ability to change reality. His psychiatrist William Haber harnesses this power, using it in an unfortunately Monkey’s Paw-ish way: when George dreams of peace, aliens arrive on the moon to unite the world against them. Dreaming of an end to racism means everyone’s skin turns grey and the woman George loves, a black lawyer who is trying to save him from Haber’s clutches, disappears. “Never to have known a woman with brown skin, brown skin and wiry black hair cut very short so that the elegant line of the skull showed like the curve of a bronze vase – no, that was wrong. That was intolerable. That every soul on earth should have a body the colour of a battleship: no!” The Dispossessed Le Guin called this novel an “anarchist utopia”, a reaction to the Vietnam war. Originally “a very bad short story” according to Le Guin, “there was a book in it, and I knew it, but the book had to wait for me to learn what I was writing about and how to write about it. I needed to understand my own passionate opposition to the war that we were, endlessly it seemed, waging in Vietnam, and endlessly protesting at home,” she writes in an introduction. The action alternates between the twin worlds of Urras and Anarres. A century before, anarchist revolutionaries from Urras set up a new society in Anarres, and attempted to live without property. The two societies have developed with little contact ever since. But the physicist Shevek, who is working on a method of interstellar communication called the Principle of Simultaneity, is becoming disillusioned with the anarchist philosophy of Anarres and travels to Urras to find more freedom. According to a profile of Le Guin by the novelist Hari Kunzru, the book is still circulated in activist communities, with young anarchists approaching the author for advice. But Le Guin told Kunzru that the encounters made her “embarrassed and a bit guilty” because, since writing the book, she had concluded that the only way for an anarchist society to be fully implemented was “to be completely isolated from everybody else. Then it will probably all the same destroy itself from inside, because we are perverse creatures. But it was a lovely thing to follow through in a novel, as an intellectual framework for a book. Which is really what anarchism was to me, a way of thinking, a way of imagining, but not a belief.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/jan/25/hyperlocal-chefs-food-and-drink-restaurants-tony-naylor","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-25T06:00:08Z","webTitle":"Hyperlocal heroes: meet the chefs growing their own","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jan/25/hyperlocal-chefs-food-and-drink-restaurants-tony-naylor","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jan/25/hyperlocal-chefs-food-and-drink-restaurants-tony-naylor","fields":{"headline":"Hyperlocal heroes: meet the chefs growing their own","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"There are plenty of tools you might expect to see in a chef’s hand: a knife, a blender, a blowtorch. But Sam Buckley, the 34-year-old chef-owner at Stockport’s Where the Light Gets In, is standing in a small field in nearby Marple, holding a rake. It is January and so this patch of land, rented from the surrounding farm, is green but dormant. Its apple trees are bare, a frame of runner beans is brown and withered and, but for some chamomile shoots in the greenhouse, there is little sign that by summer this will be the primary source of fruit and vegetables for WTLGI (scored 10/10 by the then Guardian critic Marina O’Loughlin in 2017). “Look, Gerry, I’ve done a bit of work,” grins Buckley, as he poses over a vegetable bed for the Guardian photographer. “Did you have the rake the right way up?” deadpans Gerry Purslow, the 66-year-old beekeeper, grower and now Yoda to Buckley’s Luke Skywalker, who has agreed to help encourage his green fingers. This unlikely duo met through the unorthodox network of small suppliers Buckley has pieced together for WTLGI (“People who care about quality and respect the environment”). Buckley began using Purslow’s honey, then produce from the land the retiree tends as a hobby. Last summer, WTLGI was serving Purslow’s runner beans barbecued with herbs. “If I go to Morrisons, I can get it cheaper,” says Purslow. “But if I dig it out of the ground here, there’s definitely a taste difference.” Now, he and Buckley are firing ideas back and forth about biodynamic and Japanese “do-nothing” farming (“You want to get away from chemicals,” agrees Purslow, who used to work installing industrial chemical plants), and the feasibility of growing Italian cipollini onions in this soil. The plan is to grow precise amounts of rare, heritage ingredients, with Buckley spending time here on a daily basis, assisted by members of the WTLGI staff and Purslow directing their cultivation. “Gerry’s got a great kinship to nature,” says Buckley, admiringly. “I wouldn’t say I have one. I’ve never grown veg. But we’re trying to get closer to the supply chain, the root source and essence of what we do.” Despite the freezing rain and sodden ground around the River Goyt, Buckley is keen to forage something; Purslow is sceptical (“You could get me a meat pie from the shop”), but off we trot, as they enthuse about the wood-sorrel and ramsons that flourish here in summer. Eventually, we find some lichen which, dehydrated and covered in chocolate, is served as a snack at Noma, the Copenhagen restaurant (recently reopened within its own urban farm), whose philosophy of time and place – cooking using ingredients seasonally indigenous to that region – has probably done the most to influence Buckley and a new wave of what you might call hyperlocal UK restaurants. Venues whose chefs are increasingly growers, too. The concept of restaurants growing their own is not new. But those that do it, such as Askham Hall, Le Manoir or L’Enclume, have tended to be Michelin-starred or large country house venues with serious resources. This new crop of hyperlocal restaurants are smaller, DIY and cultivating their own supplies even in urban locations. The Dairy in Clapham, for instance, has its own rooftop allotment, while the success of London BBQ restaurant Pitt Cue has been underpinned by the farming prowess of co-founder Tom Adams. Adams has spent much of the last few years outside London raising mangalitza pigs, to get exactly the product he required. Pork so good it needs only simple treatment in the kitchen to create something exceptional. Ten years ago at the height of molecular gastronomy, chefs were amateur scientists. Now, says Buckley, they are “learning about nature and how food works”. Adams now runs Cornwall’s Coombeshead Farm, an almost entirely self-sufficient restaurant and guest house, which – with WTLGI, Ambleside’s Lake Road Kitchen and Sedbergh’s Three Hares – is at the forefront of this hyperlocal movement. Fellow travellers such as Somerset’s Ethicurean or Monmouthshire’s Whitebrook, which at the height of summer sources up to 90% of its produce from within 12 miles, work in a similar way. This whole approach will get a further boost this year when ex-Fera at Claridges chef Dan Cox opens a new restaurant at Cornwall’s Crocadon Farm. If the first 1990s wave of “local, seasonal” cooking quickly became a tokenistic nonsense (“Goosnargh chicken and Kenyan beans,” says Buckley), this latest generation of hyperlocal chefs are less dogmatic yet far more engaged, practically, in ensuring a sustainable farm-to-fork supply chain. Generally, they won’t deny themselves a small amount of citrus fruit or imported pasta (most source seafood outside their immediate region), but, equally, they are not relying on remote third-party catering suppliers to rubber-stamp their ethics. Instead, they are growing their own or collaborating closely with farmers; building bespoke localised and highly seasonal supplier networks; foraging and preserving; and streamlining ingredients in order to minimise waste without compromising on excitement and flavour. WTLGI occupies the handsome, high-ceilinged upper floor of a converted warehouse in Stockport town centre. The back wall of its kitchen – an open-plan affair that sits within the dining room – is lined with jars of preserves and experiments (fermenting celeriac; umeboshi-style pickled damsons; crispy ramson flowers), that help keep its dishes interesting through the lean winter months. Is it a difficult process? “It’s more interesting than making Yorkshire puddings,” shrugs Buckley, an ex-musician who, in his “hippyish” way, wants to make a difference. “The food system is broken. It’s completely wasteful that we can get avocados any time of year,” he says, relaying a tale about “local” Cheshire beef that has to first make a 180-mile round-trip to Coventry to be butchered. In contrast, WTLGI serves only one meat, mutton, reared in Malpas by a woman who, generally, does not sell to restaurants: “It’s about building a community, helping local businesses, cutting out miles of travel and it’s the best mutton I’ve tried.” Up at Sedbergh’s Three Hares (cafe by day, restaurant by night) chef-owner James Ratcliffe is working directly with farmers and paying £1-per-kilo over market rates to have beef cattle reared to his specifications: “Most farmers breed to a certain size and shape in a certain amount of time. But that doesn’t necessarily equal flavour. It’s learning about all that and rewiring the farmer to think about flavour. Something has to break in the system. The farmer needs a better price for their animals and the chef needs a better product.” WTLGI was designed to produce almost no waste. What few bits it cannot use (even kohlrabi scraps are dehydrated to make seasoning powders), go into compost. Working this way, with a limited number of ingredients imposes restrictions on the kitchen. WTLGI serves a no-choice tasting menu of dishes which are stark in their St John-like simplicity. That mutton is served with just soured onions and a kind of beetroot cream. “We work simply. We can’t do anything but. We spend all our time picking dandelions,” laughs Buckley. He is absolutely focused on blowing your mind with flavour, but he concedes: “We’ve had guests who were disappointed they didn’t get 15 things on the plate.” Ambleside’s Lake Road Kitchen uses only northern European ingredients, which effectively means almost entirely Cumbrian produce (no tomatoes, lemons, olive oil etc). But, says chef-owner and Noma alumni, James Cross: “An ingredient is more than one thing and this means we can focus on understanding the minutiae of individual products and presenting them in their most delicious forms. Rather than being a constraint, it has concentrated and distilled the cooking. We’re achieving liberation though limitation.” Cross grows many of Lake Road’s vegetables on a specially designed, high-density plot, which can be cost-effective. Lake Road saved £9,000 last year by growing its own oxalis. With tasting menus at £65/£90, it, like WTLGI (£75), remains an expensive restaurant, but there are venues practising a similar philosophy at lower price-points. Tom Hunt’s Bristol tapas restaurant, Poco, sources almost exclusively within a 50-mile-radius, working with several Bristol community growing projects: “Bristol’s a political space and that shows in the food,” says Hunt. He promotes zero-waste “root-to-fruit” vegetable cookery (WTLGI and Lake Road do something similar), which by using the roots, leaves, flowers and skins, as well as the more obviously edible parts, can reduce the cost of using pricier local, sustainable vegetables. In his consultancy work, Hunt tries to persuade large catering companies of its efficacy: “It takes a new way of thinking and applying that to menus. But Poco works to standard industry food costs. And it isn’t just about thrift. The root-to-fruit philosophy is about all of the benefits that come through holistically supporting a good food system.” Likewise, by jettisoning much of fine dining’s excess, WTLGI shows what is possible. “Foremost, we want people to have a good time,” says Buckley, “but by doing something positive and not feeling we’re putting a dent in the world.” This year Buckley will, literally, be getting his hands dirty in that fight. Or Gerry Purslow will not be happy."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"sport/2018/jan/24/larry-nassar-sentenced-sexual-abuse-gymnastics","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-25T09:12:15Z","webTitle":"Larry Nassar's 'death warrant': sexual abuser jailed for up to 175 years","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/jan/24/larry-nassar-sentenced-sexual-abuse-gymnastics","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/jan/24/larry-nassar-sentenced-sexual-abuse-gymnastics","fields":{"headline":"Larry Nassar's 'death warrant': sexual abuser jailed for up to 175 years","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The former USA Gymnastics team doctor Larry Nassar has been sentenced to between 40 and 175 years in prison for abusing athletes in his care. Judge Rosemarie Aquilina reached her decision after a sentence hearing that heard from dozens of women and girls, including the Olympic champions Aly Raisman and McKayla Maroney. Nassar had already admitted in November to molesting seven girls in his care under the guise of treatment. But a total of 156 girls and women came forward to speak at the seven-day sentencing hearing, saying they had also suffered abuse at his hands, with two dozen more submitting private letters to the court. Late on Wednesday, the president of Michigan State University, where Nassar also treated athletes, said she was tendering her resignation. Lou Anna Simon had faced a barrage of criticism for not doing enough to halt the abuse by the doctor, including a scathing front-page editorial by the independent student newspaper that cast “Simon, her appointees and cheerleaders” as “enablers”. “As tragedies are politicized, blame is inevitable. As president, it is only natural that I am the focus of this anger,” Simon said in her resignation letter. Judge Aquilina told Nassar Wednesday: “It is my honor to sentence you because, sir, you do not deserve to walk outside of a prison ever again. Anywhere you walk, destruction would occur to those most vulnerable.” She added: “I just signed your death warrant.” Aquilina said the sentence reflected not only the seven counts to which Nassar pleaded guilty, but also the survivors who came forward during the sentencing hearing “because the depth of all of your crimes have cut into the core of this community”. “The breadth and ripple of this defendant’s abuse and destruction is infinite,” the prosecuting attorney Angela Povilaitis said in her closing remarks. “Nassar used his prestige to gain [his victims’] trust and to exploit them, leaving many of them emotionally shattered by a man they not only trusted but loved. In competitive gymnastics, he found the perfect place for his master manipulation.” The disgraced physician gave a brief statement before Aquilina handed down the sentence, acknowledging the “pain, trauma and emotional destruction” experienced by his victims. “Your words these past several days have had a significant emotional effect on myself and have shaken me to my core,” he said. “I will carry your words with me for the rest of my days.” “Sir, I hope that’s true,” the judge said after Nassar concluded. Aquilina read portions of the six-page, single-spaced letter Nassar wrote to the judge last week in which he said it was too difficult for him to listen to the victim impact statements, citing it as proof that “you have still not owned what you did”. “Would you like to withdraw your plea?” the judge asked. “No, your honor,” he said. “Because you’re guilty, aren’t you, sir?” “I accept my plea.” Rachael Denhollander, one of three survivors to speak on Wednesday, was “absolutely” satisfied with the sentence on a day she wasn’t sure would ever come when she became the first of Nassar’s victims to come forward publicly in September 2016. “The number of sexual assault victims Larry had was plain to me,” she said. “Whether or not anyone would feel safe to come forward, that was the wild card.” After Aquilina delivered the sentence, the US Olympic Committee called on the directors of USA Gymnastics to resign. “The purpose of this message is to tell all of Nassar’s victims and survivors, directly, how incredibly sorry we are,” the USOC chief executive, Scott Blackmun, wrote in an open letter. “We have said it in other contexts, but we have not been direct enough with you ... The Olympic family is among those that have failed you.” Those who confronted Nassar in the Michigan courtroom included household names such as Raisman and Maroney but most of those he abused never reached the elite level. The first witness in court when the hearing started last week was Kyle Stephens, who told the court she was abused by Nassar, a family friend, between the ages of six and 12. “Perhaps you have figured it out by now, but little girls don’t stay little for ever,” Stephens said. “They grow into strong women that destroy your world.” Simone Biles, one of the stars of the Rio Olympics, said she had also been abused by the 54-year-old although she chose not to appear in court. “Most of you know me as a happy, giggly, and energetic girl,” the four-times Olympic gold medalist wrote on Twitter last week. “But lately I’ve felt a bit broken and the more I try to shut off the voice in my head the louder it screams. I am not afraid to tell my story anymore.” Michigan State University, USA Gymnastics and the USOC have all been named as co-defendants in civil suits that appear headed to trial, with allegations that officials knew about Nassar’s abuse. One of the most vocal critics of the organisations that allegedly enabled Nassar has been Raisman. “Adult after adult protected you,” Raisman, who won gold medals at the 2012 and 2016 Olympics, said when she appeared in court last week. “How do you sleep at night? You are the person they had ‘take the lead on athlete care’.” “I will not rest until every last trace of the influence you had on this sport has been destroyed like the cancer it is.” Raisman also told ESPN that USA Gymnastics “told [her] to be quiet” when she first told the organisation she had been abused by Nassar. On Monday, three USA Gymnastics board members resigned over the scandal. Raisman took the USOC to task for taking credit for the resignations. “For the past week, survivors came forward to courageously face a perpetrator of evil and to share their painful stories,” Raisman wrote on Twitter. “Many of them, myself included, claim the USOC is also at fault. Was the USOC there to ‘focus on supporting the brave survivors’? No. Did they issue any statement then? Crickets …”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"books/2018/jan/24/ursula-k-le-guin-margaret-atwood-tribute","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-24T13:47:37Z","webTitle":"Ursula K Le Guin, by Margaret Atwood: ‘One of the literary greats of the 20th century’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jan/24/ursula-k-le-guin-margaret-atwood-tribute","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/jan/24/ursula-k-le-guin-margaret-atwood-tribute","fields":{"headline":"Ursula K Le Guin, by Margaret Atwood: ‘One of the literary greats of the 20th century’","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"I am very sad that Ursula K Le Guin has died. Not only was she one of the literary greats of the 20th century – her books are many and widely read and beloved, her awards are many and deserved – but her sane, committed, annoyed, humorous, wise and always intelligent voice is much needed now. Right before she died, I was reading her new book, No Time to Spare, a collection of trenchant, funny, lyrical essays about everything from cats to the nature of belief, to the overuse of the word “fuck”, to the fact that old age is indeed for sissies – and talking to her in my head. What if, I was saying – what if I write a piece about The Left Hand of Darkness, published by you in 1969? What if I say it’s a book to which time has now caught up? Consider: the planet of Gethen is divided. In one of its societies, the king is crazy. Cabals and personal feuds abound. You’re in the powerful inner circle one day, an outcast the next. In the other society, an oppressive bureaucracy prevails and a secret committee knows what’s best. If judged a danger to the general good you’re deemed persona non grata and exiled to a prison enclave, with no trial or right of reply. What do you think, Ursula? I asked her in my head. Were you predicting anything? Not exactly, she answered. It’s a thought experiment. But then, so is our society. In all her work, Le Guin was always asking the same urgent question: what sort of world do you want to live in? Her own choice would have been gender equal, racially equal, economically fair and self-governing, but that was not on offer. It would also have contained mutually enjoyable sex and good food: there was a better chance of that. Le Guin was born in 1929: a child in the depression, a teenager in the second world war, then at college right after the war, in that moment that seemed so filled with the spirit of renewal. She went to Radcliffe, a liminal space then: it was Harvard but not really, its women allowed some participation but not full access. She would have strolled past the dining hall, where – she would have been told – the male students used to pelt with buns any female who dared to show her face. (Once she became a writer – a science fiction writer, among other things – the men defending that particular tree house continued the exclusionary bun-pelting. She took note, and was not amused.) After Radcliffe she went to graduate school, studying French and Italian literature. She was taught to think, as they used to say, like a man: widely, curiously, rigorously. But after she married and left academia, she found herself in a society that treated her and all women – from a legal point of view – like an irresponsible 13-year-old. For those who’d been taught they were grownups, this was like trying to seal a volcano inside a tin can. It was this generation of American women that fuelled much of the second wave feminism of the late 1960s and 70s, which was when that particular tin can exploded. This was a time of high energy for Le Guin the writer. But political thought and activity was just one facet of this astonishingly talented woman’s multifaceted life and work. The Earthsea trilogy, for instance, is a memorable exploration of the relationship between life and death: without the darkness, no light; and mortality allows all that is alive to be. The darkness includes the hidden and less pleasant sides of our selves – our fears, our pride, our envy. Ged, its hero, must face his shadow self before it devours him. Only then will he become whole. In the process, he must contend with the wisdom of dragons: ambiguous and not our wisdom, but wisdom nonetheless. Recently, not long before Le Guin died, I found myself talking with a much younger woman who was mourning the loss of a friend. “Read the Earthsea trilogy,” I suggested. “It will help.” She did, and it did. Now I will take my own advice, and meet with Ursula again in her own thought experiment, and say Hail and Farewell, and thank you. It’s time for some dragon wisdom."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"games/2018/jan/26/the-inpatient-review-atmospheric-virtual-reality-chiller","type":"article","sectionId":"games","sectionName":"Games","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-26T09:00:42Z","webTitle":"The Inpatient review – atmospheric virtual-reality chiller","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2018/jan/26/the-inpatient-review-atmospheric-virtual-reality-chiller","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/games/2018/jan/26/the-inpatient-review-atmospheric-virtual-reality-chiller","fields":{"headline":"The Inpatient review – atmospheric virtual-reality chiller","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"PlayStation 4, Supermassive Games/Sony (PS VR headset required) It is a familiar horror movie setup: someone wakes to find themselves trapped in an asylum, with no memory of their past and a creepy doctor looming over them. But no matter how many times you’ve seen this on the big screen, it is very different when you’re the one strapped in the chair. The Inpatient is a virtual reality thriller, which acts as a distant prequel to the 2015 horror adventure, Until Dawn. Having put on the required PlayStation VR headset, you find yourself in the gothic darkness of Blackwood Pines sanatorium, where ostensibly kindly Dr Bragg is administering some sort of treatment to retrieve your memories. But all is not as it seems in this shadowy old building, and when you’re thrown back into your locked room, a new cellmate starts to give you clues about a terrible local tragedy and your part in it. At first, The inpatient is an extremely tense and atmospheric thrill-ride. Simple interactions with nearby objects bring up memory sequences, while branching conversations with staff and your increasingly erratic roomie decide the course of the narrative. The action is intercut with genuinely unsettling nightmare sequences jammed with jump scares, weird noises and scuttling beasts. But as soon as you escape the cell, the tension collapses and the game becomes a laboured wander through endless corridors, wards and offices, with a set of wooden and unconvincing characters. What started out as a bleak tale of psychological stress becomes a haunted-house fairground ride without the ghosts or shocks. This is a shame, because the incredible character models and scenic detail ensure you’re truly immersed in the world, and the way the game plays with memory, space and reality is truly involving. But the whole thing peters out, and it’s not helped by some extremely stilted dialogue and, at times, poorly explained and implemented controls. The Inpatient is an encouraging signpost to where interactive VR drama might be heading. Too bad that, this time, it’s nowhere interesting. Yet even though the last act lets it down, the sense of place is astonishing at times and there are some genuinely great moments of immersion. It’s a game PlayStation VR players should experience. • The Inpatient is out now."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/feb/03/berwick-upon-tweed-fishermans-cottage-childrens-book-illustrator","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-03T11:00:20Z","webTitle":"'It’s like a child’s drawing of a house': a fisherman's cottage in Berwick-upon-Tweed","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/feb/03/berwick-upon-tweed-fishermans-cottage-childrens-book-illustrator","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/feb/03/berwick-upon-tweed-fishermans-cottage-childrens-book-illustrator","fields":{"headline":"'It’s like a child’s drawing of a house': a fisherman's cottage in Berwick-upon-Tweed","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Helen Stephens and her partner, Gerry Turley, may be from Darlington and Glasgow respectively, but after 17 years in London, they had forgotten how cold the north-east of England can get. It didn’t help that they arrived in Berwick-upon-Tweed in 2010, a few months before the worst winter the town had suffered in years. “The snow was so deep, it took us half an hour to walk 100 yards to the beach,” Stephens says. “When the wind whipped off the North Sea, we felt as if we were on the edge of the Earth.” Stephens joined a knitting group to get to know people; they told her to buy sturdy boots, woolly jumpers and waterproofs. Their house was as uninsulated as they were. Turley and Stephens slept with hats on. They hung thick curtains and thermal blinds over the doors, and installed a stove in the living room. “It completely changed the atmosphere” she says. “It warms every room.” All the fireplaces had been boarded over and the couple are now gradually opening them up. Built in the 1850s, the house was previously divided into four rooms, each inhabited by a fishing family. It was converted in the 1960s. “It’s like a child’s drawing of a house,” Stephens says. “A door in the middle and a window in each corner.” It was constructed with small rooms and windows to preserve the heat: “We have to buy small furniture – vintage pieces are usually more compact.” In the living room, the walls are filled with artwork by the couple and their friends. A fireside rug is from eBay: “We bring so much sand into the house, light-coloured carpets just wouldn’t work,” Stephens says. She and Turley are both illustrators and share a studio downstairs. Meetings with publishers are usually conducted over Skype. But when Stephens wants to work undisturbed, away from a screen, she heads upstairs to an artfully messy desk in their bedroom. “It’s a sanctuary: emails can’t ping and I can’t hear the phone or the doorbell,” she says. A few months after they moved in, Stephens experienced her first haar, or fog, rolling in from the sea. “They fill the town with a shimmery, silvery mist,” she says. “I got an image in my head of a bright yellow lion walking into town. It wouldn’t leave my mind, so I had to get it down on paper.” It became her picture book How To Hide A Lion, set in Berwick – the first of many. Turley was similarly inspired: when a sperm whale was found beached locally, he drew it, and it led to a series of whales screenprinted on to found sea charts. “He likes to draw seabirds and skulls, so he collects dead ones such as gannets and puffins, and keeps them in the freezer.” The town shares this beachcomber mentality. “After a storm, everyone heads to the mouth of the river Tweed to collect driftwood,” Stephens says. “People with bags, saws, little carts and trolleys all collect kindling and logs for their fires.” An outdoor toilet in the garden is used in summer, but in winter it’s used for storing coal. A wild cockerel roams the garden, often coming into the kitchen and leaving footprints over the chequered floor. “It’s been here for years and lives in all the gardens on our street,” Stephens says. “But it particularly likes us, as we work from home and keep it company. We daren’t give it a name or it might start to feel too at home.” Does Berwick lack anything? “I miss the summer warmth of a big city, where you can feel the heat coming off the bricks.” At first, they also missed having a creative community, but that has since followed them. “Soon after we moved here, Alan Martin, creator of Tank Girl, moved across the road. He looked interesting, so we decided to make him our friend, whether he liked it or not. Berwick-upon-Tweed has a surprisingly large amount of writers and illustrators. It’s affordable, and I think people head up to the Edinburgh festival, see Berwick from the train and wonder what it would be like to live here. It has an attraction for creative people.” Turley and Stephens get their “city top-ups” from visiting Edinburgh and Glasgow, but most of the time they enjoy the emptiness. “We walk on the beach with our dog every day, whatever the weather. It gets rid of the cabin fever that can set in working from home, and puts the world in perspective.” turleyandstephens.bigcartel.com"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jan/24/vladimir-putin-ghoutta-syria-starving","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-24T15:44:33Z","webTitle":"An appeal to Vladimir Putin: please let sick children out of Ghouta | David Nott and Hamish de Bretton-Gordon","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jan/24/vladimir-putin-ghoutta-syria-starving","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/jan/24/vladimir-putin-ghoutta-syria-starving","fields":{"headline":"An appeal to Vladimir Putin: please let sick children out of Ghouta","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"World leaders are meeting this week at the World Economic Forum in Davos. When they’ve finished counting their money, perhaps they could spare a moment to discuss the children of Syria. These innocents have been bombed, gassed and starved for four years in Ghouta and elsewhere, and it is time for even the sternest of leaders to search their souls for some humanity. The children bear no blame for this dreadful civil war, and they are our only hope for a better Syria. As directors of Doctors Under Fire and advisers to the Union of Syrian Medical Charities (UOSSM), we and others persuaded the Russian government and the Syrian regime to allow nine children with curable cancer and 20 others out of Ghouta over Christmas; they will now live, but there are many others who might not. We also managed to do the same for 500 children in Aleppo on 16 December. We understand that the Russians, and in particular the foreign secretary, Sergei Lavrov, intervened directly with President Assad to make the evacuations of children happen. A few people have described our requests as appeasement of the Assad regime, but we have witnessed enough terror in the war zones of the world over the last 30 years to see things differently. This is pragmatic humanity. We want to give hope to a generation so completely let down by their own and global leaders. Since 1 January, we have been in discussions with the Russians about the release of another 125 children from Ghouta who need life-saving medical treatment. We gave a list of these children, with their ailments, to the Russian embassy in London last week for onward transmission to Moscow, which promised to take up the cause with Damascus. Interviewed by the BBC last Friday, the Russian ambassador to the EU said that these children would be allowed out of Ghouta for medical care, but nothing as yet has happened. Meanwhile, there has been continuous bombardment, at least three strikes with chlorine gas and and hundreds killed in Ghouta alone since the beginning of the year. We are told that up to 75% of the children in Ghouta are likely to have PTSD and a whole generation is missing its education. These children are the future of Syria, but time is running out to give them a future worth contemplating. The world, the UN and the five permanent members of the UN security council in particular seem to be standing by and watching in silence, unable or unwilling to get involved. Last Thursday the Foreign Office minister Alistair Burt told us that there is little the UK can do until a ceasefire is achieved, but the British government has at least already promised £1bn in aid to Syria. Other wealthy nations need to follow suit. Feeding and rebuilding Syria will be a gargantuan task. We appeal to President Putin, who undoubtedly is able to influence Assad, to show some humanity, provide a tiny ray of hope and let these very ill children out of Ghouta. The Geneva peace talks need to resume as soon as possible, but it almost feels as if the UN mechanism is running out of steam over Syria. If the security council’s permanent five, especially Russia, get behind the peace process, there is just a chance it could work. If a ceasefire can be put in place, there is enough money swilling around Davos to feed and rebuild Syria, and enough people like us two to make it happen. The slaughter of the children of Ghouta – and Syria’s 500,000 dead, 11 million displaced and 4 million refugees – is a disgrace to all, on all sides of this conflict, and to the world leaders who sit on their hands. President Putin, you have a chance to right this wrong. President Trump, President Macron, Prime Minister May and others, you have a chance to give the children of Syria a future. For the sake of humanity, use your influence, power and wealth at Davos to make it happen. • David Nott and Hamish de Bretton-Gordon are directors of Doctors Under Fire and advisers to the Union of Syrian Medical Charities."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"football/2018/jan/24/leeds-united-football-club-crest-shirt-club","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-24T14:12:09Z","webTitle":"Leeds United's new crest has irked fans.

Well: why not practise on your dogs first? That’s right: anti-vaxxing for animals. An accoutrement as chi-chi as any doggie waistcoat, is now a thing. Cats are not immune either, with various websites now alleging the dangers of pet immunisation. “An American Veterinary paper says that up to 22,000 cats develop cancer at the site of vaccination every year in the USA,” says doglistener.co.uk. “Sixty-six per cent of all sick dogs start being sick within three months of vaccination,” declares Dogs Naturally Magazine. All claim vaccination can cause a range of diseases to take hold, among them autoimmune haemolytic anaemia, thyroid disease, arthritis and parvovirus. The hardcore ape the human anti-vaxxers: yes, vaccines can make your dog autistic. Others argue proportionality. They point to over-vaccination – the annual shots, when most vaccines are designed to last seven years. US anti-vax vet figurehead Dr John Robb was put on probation in 2015 by the State Board of Veterinary Medicine in Connecticut, for reducing the dosage in rabies vaccinations for small dogs. “You’re telling me that if there’s a law that would force me to kill my patient, I would have to do it?” he raged. But “immunologists say vaccines are not dose-dependent, that you need enough antigens to stimulate the immune system”, says California vet Dr Lisa Boyer. “It’s not a weight-versus-dose question. My seven-year-old and I get the same vaccine.” For those hard-of-sarcasm, the UK’s independent Veterinary Products Committee (VPC) reviewed all UK dog and cat vaccines between 1999 and 2002. They concluded that although adverse events do occasionally follow vaccination, the “overall risk/benefit analysis strongly supports their continued use”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"culture/2018/jan/27/ive-gone-full-witch-the-fire-and-fury-of-tv-satirist-samantha-bee","type":"article","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-27T07:00:43Z","webTitle":"'I’ve gone full witch': the fire and fury of TV satirist Samantha Bee","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2018/jan/27/ive-gone-full-witch-the-fire-and-fury-of-tv-satirist-samantha-bee","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/2018/jan/27/ive-gone-full-witch-the-fire-and-fury-of-tv-satirist-samantha-bee","fields":{"headline":"'I’ve gone full witch': the fire and fury of TV satirist Samantha Bee","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Samantha Bee is recounting how she landed her first major job in TV on the seminal US late-night news parody, The Daily Show With Jon Stewart. “They were having trouble finding a woman who they thought was funny,” she says – and she’s being deadly serious. This was 2003, and Bee, then 34 years old, was part of a female sketch comedy troupe in her native Toronto. Their audiences sometimes barely reached double figures. “I was at the point of giving it all up; I was done with being impoverished,” she recalls. Then producers from The Daily Show arrived in the city to scope the Canadian comedy scene. “Even as I was auditioning for them, I thought it was ridiculous,” Bee admits. “Really? In all of America, you can’t find a woman that you think is funny? You have come to another country to find one?” Fast-forward 15 years and, far from having given it all up, the 48-year-old comedian is at the helm of her very own giant-slaying late-night show, Full Frontal With Samantha Bee. Since its launch in February 2016, her weekly show, with its excoriating, unfiltered, firmly feminist take on politics and current affairs – like Joan Rivers crossed with Armando Iannucci – has won an Emmy and earned multiple further nominations. Last spring, Bee was named one of Time magazine’s 100 Most Influential People in the World. No demographic is safe from the biting wit of Bee, who is as quick to call out hypocrisy from white, liberal America (for example on voter turnout, she asked: “How many times do we expect black people to build our country for us?”) as she is to eviscerate cornerstones of the right, such as Fox News (“A nightmare factory powered by white resentment and relentless misinformation ... making family Thanksgivings unbearable for 20 years.”) During the presidential election, she gave Hillary Clinton anything but an easy ride, too, calling her “a barely contained cluster of frustration”, and likening Bernie Sanders to Doc Brown from Back to the Future: “the elderly lunatic whose well-intentioned meddling screws things up for everyone”. Despite being the face of political satire in the age of identity politics, Bee is not wholly comfortable with my labelling the show “liberal”. “I guess that’s how people would characterise it,” she says, in her office in midtown Manhattan, after some hemming and hawing. “But on a personal note, I’m a much more complicated human being than just a liberal or a conservative.” The show does have a necessarily strong point of view, though: hers. “You can’t make a show like this by committee,” she reasons. “I care a lot about people who are committed fans of the show, but I don’t really make the show for other people.” Off-air, Bee is more composed and contained than her potty-mouthed, sarcastic on-screen persona, who machine-guns creative, colourful insults that would make Malcolm Tucker proud, in passionate, impressively slick seven-minute monologues. It is hard to imagine the thoughtful and considered woman sitting behind her large, busy desk today calling Rupert Murdoch a “sentient liver spot”. “That’s the loudest, most unfiltered version of me that exists,” she says. “In my private life, I’m not like that at all. I don’t kick doors in and walk into meetings wowing everybody with my Entertainment Personality. It’s a wonderful 21-minute catharsis, once a week, but I don’t need to be that person in my day-to-day life.” Her 65-strong team of writers, producers, technicians and graphic designers is notable for its diversity: half of the staff are female and a third are non-white. “It’s not like we have solved the world’s diversity problem, but we do think about it all the time,” she says. “When we need to hire people, we think: let’s try to find a woman for this.” Bee has stormed her way into what had been a televisual late-night gentlemen’s club (“Why there aren’t more female comedians? Maybe it’s because every time a woman opens her mouth to tell a joke, someone tries to put their dick in it,” she once suggested), outgunning the likes of Jimmy Fallon, Jimmy Kimmel, Stephen Colbert, John Oliver and James Corden, in both the ratings and her relentless condemnation of Trump (“The Fyre festival of presidents”; “The thrice-married, foul-mouthed tit judge ... who thinks Corinthians is a type of car upholstery”; “A crotch-fondling slab of rancid meatloaf”). “I imagine a fan might call it joyful rage,” says executive producer Miles Kahn, when asked to characterise the show’s savage tone. “Whereas someone who is not a fan of the show would just call it ‘Shrill lady yelling at me’. We don’t have to steep ourselves in fake irony. That’s a great way to do satire, too, but we just call out the thing that we want to say in a way that is funny and cathartic.” The nature of the news cycle over the past 12 months must also present a punishing challenge. A week has never felt such a long time in politics. “It’s insanely fast. We have whiplash every single day, and we definitely all have stomach cancer,” she says, reaching for the oversized bottle of antacid tablets beside her computer and giving it a rattle. “We’re all just one big peptic ulcer.” Despite the pressures of the job, Bee is making efforts to occasionally disconnect. “I do have to know what’s happening, it’s my job,” she shrugs. “But my children [she has three, all under 12, with her husband, fellow writer and producer Jason Jones] are always telling me to get off my phone.” Even more helpfully, on the night of the presidential election, she resigned from participating in social media. She has not checked Facebook since, and she switched off her notifications on Twitter, a deliberate move to dodge the trolls. “It has made the most profound difference,” she says, earnestly. “The amount of hatred and anger just wore me down.” Bee’s smart, savvy brand of humour would likely have flourished in any political climate, but Full Frontal is manna for many in an unprecedented moment of freshly revealed misogyny. “I’m leaning so hard into feminism that I’ve gone full witch,” she says. One of the most prominent topics over the past few months has, of course, been the dramatic downfall of countless prominent men in positions of power. “Some woman could just do a show exclusively and only about that, four nights a week, and that would be just fine,” Bee observes. When she does riff on the topic in the show, she says: “If you don’t want to tune into your partner’s feelings throughout sex maybe you shouldn’t be fucking a person at all. May I suggest a coin purse or a Ziploc bag full of grape jelly?” She also agrees that, horrific though the nature and extent of the allegations are, a fire has been lit under many women (and men) too. “I definitely feel an excitement in the air, I feel this drumbeat that is unique,” she nods. “I would not have predicted what happened in the presidential election; I would not have predicted the turnout at the Women’s March. And I do feel that in the midst of all of this garbage, a phoenix is rising from these ashes. “I think there are so many stories left to be told,” she says. “This is just the tip of the flag on top of the iceberg. This is so far from being over.” Episodes of Full Frontal with Samantha Bee are online at samanthabee.com"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/jan/27/stephen-bush-can-i-cook-like-andy-warhol","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-27T13:00:50Z","webTitle":"Can I cook like ...

Andy Warhol?","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Andy Warhol loved food, which isn’t to say that he loved good eating. He loved what he painted: Campbell’s soup, hamburgers, Coca-Cola and fast food of all types. (Also speed, but the Guardian refused to pay for that.) I start my dinner with a tin of Campbell’s cream of tomato soup, the only time anything resembling a vegetable crosses a plate in the whole meal. I have always been agnostic about soups: with the exception of the very best, what tends to happen is that the first sip one enjoys, the second sip confirms your good opinion, and the third, fourth, fifth, sixth and through to the final sips are increasingly boring. This is no exception. I follow that with hamburgers, which I make myself. Warhol’s relationship with food was bound up with the poverty of his childhood: he ate luxuriously, often in restaurants, but harboured terrible guilt about the waste, handing out leftovers to homeless people or his employees. Simply ordering an expensive burger to my house feels contrary to the spirit of the exercise, so I decide to make my own, using really classy mince. Happily, this exactly emulates the Warhol model of “eating a lot while wrestling with an overpowering sense of guilt”, as the burgers I make are functional but not spectacular. With every bite, I feel acutely aware of better uses I could have put the mince to. Dessert is an effective punishment: a bar of chocolate between two pieces of bread, which Warhol used to call “cake”. He once wrote that he was kidding himself when he went “through the motions of cooking protein: all I ever really want is sugar”. In that spirit, I went for the sweetest, heaviest-in-additives loaf of white bread I could find. My filling? A Galaxy bar. My first thought as I bite into it is: yuck. My second thought is that Warhol really was the luckiest man alive, seeing as he survived well into his sixth decade despite being shot, living largely off grease and amphetamines, and rounding it off with a trip on the Diabetes Express. I decide not to take a second bite. An artist might need to suffer to create, but I think I’ll stick with fruit and vegetables in the future. Stylist: Stephanie Iles.

Thriving, striving or just about surviving, the RSA/Populus survey of more than 2,000 workers, found that while about 30% of respondents said they lived comfortably, 40% said their finances were permanently precarious. The remaining 30% said they were not managing to get by. “Economic insecurity now stretches right throughout our labour market, including within jobs that appear safe on the surface,” said Brhmie Balaram, the author of the report and a senior researcher at the RSA. According to the report, 32% of the UK’s workers have less than £500 in savings and 41% have less than £1,000. Almost 30% are concerned about their level of debt while 43% of workers do not have anyone in their household they could depend on to support them financially in the event of hardship. Fewer than half of employees (44%) feel they have progressed in their careers over the last five years; only 40% feel they have good opportunities to progress in future. “From retail workers to warehouse operatives, and from care workers to cleaners, we are beginning to uncover the hidden millions who are chronically broke year in, year out,” said Balaram. “The real danger for this group of workers is a childcare bill unpaid and yet another rent rise around the corner.” UK labour market statistics released on Wednesday showed employment reaching a record high last year. But, the RSA report makes clear, wider economic trends suggest workers are worse off as real wages fall and in-work poverty rises. The RSA report identifies what it calls Britain’s “new class structure”. It also launched an online tool that lets people explore which “class” they fall into. The chronically precarious: the reliably broke, people in this group are typically on a steady contract albeit with low pay. 60% have less than £1,000 saved and they have low job satisfaction and little autonomy at work. Typical job: full-time sales assistant. The acutely precarious: usually broke but with significant income “yoyo-ing”. Work is often low-paid but, unlike the chronically precarious, irregular. This is a young group and 45% have a degree. Typical job: zero-hours hospitality. The flexi-workers: love their job, even if it doesn’t pay well: 83% are satisfied at work but 59% earn less than £21,000 a year. High levels of savings: many are redundant “second careerers”. They value autonomy above security. Typical job: freelance photographer. The steady-staters: feel well treated (90%) and well paid (69%), even if work is a means to an end. But they have low savings, and rely on work for income so are vulnerable to a shock. Their routine jobs are at high risk of automation. Typical job: public sector administrator. The idealists: mid-earning, passionate and often millennials (50% under 35), 70% think they make a positive contribution to society at work. They are most likely to rely on others, such as parents, for income. They are urbane and 25% have more than £10,000 saved. Typical job: charity employee. The strivers: these have regular jobs with high income and high savings, but worry the link between hard work and fair pay has broken: 73% are stressed but only 20% think their pay reflects their efforts. Typical job: middle manager. The high-flyers: the wealthiest group: 55% have more than £10,000 in savings. They are successful at adapting to automation, and the most likely group to value new technology. They report high job security, high autonomy and high fulfilment. Typical job: director of an IT services business. There are now nearly 1 million people on zero-hour contracts and 1.7 million in temporary work. A record 4.8 million are self-employed, while there are an estimated 1.1 million people in Britain’s gig economy, which – in just five years – will equal the number of workers in NHS England. “Despite the differences between the seven segments persuasively described in this report we can clearly see how many people are impacted by common problems,” said Matthew Taylor, the chief executive of the RSA, who recently carried out an employment review for Theresa May. “Precarious work is a theme, as is a lack of autonomy or control at work (both issues underline the call for good work in the review I undertook for government last year).” The report calls for new rights, responsibilities and a modern social contract based on support for people as they navigate changes to the cost of living, technology, and Britain’s international competitiveness. It says the government must explore universal childcare; pay for the self-employed to take maternity or paternity leave; devolve the “national living wage” to councils, and pioneer personal budgets for reskilling as the age of automation looms."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"environment/2018/jan/23/minerals-council-steps-up-coal-advocacy-despite-bhp-call-for-neutrality","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-23T05:44:48Z","webTitle":"Minerals Council steps up coal advocacy despite BHP call for neutrality","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jan/23/minerals-council-steps-up-coal-advocacy-despite-bhp-call-for-neutrality","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/jan/23/minerals-council-steps-up-coal-advocacy-despite-bhp-call-for-neutrality","fields":{"headline":"Minerals Council steps up coal advocacy despite BHP call for neutrality","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The Minerals Council of Australia has stepped up its advocacy for coal power in spite of its biggest member, BHP, saying it will leave the group unless it shifts its stance to become technology-neutral. On Tuesday the MCA publicised a report by the Coal Industry Advisory Board that called for governments to commit similar resources to carbon capture and storage as they do to renewable energy. The report was written by representatives of some of the world’s biggest coalminers, including Anglo American, Glencore and Peabody, as well as by Peter Morris of the MCA. In a section directly aimed at Australia, the report called for a public campaign to promote carbon capture and storage, and for governments to support so-called “high-efficiency low-emissions coal” (HELE) among other technologies. “It makes economic sense for there to be an international commitment to CCS that rivals the scale of commitment that countries have made to renewables,” the report said. In December a report from the Australian National Audit office sharply criticised the federal government’s investments in carbon capture and storage. It found that despite a commitment of more than $2bn, little had been achieved. In a media release linking to the Coal Industry Advisory Board report, Greg Evans from the MCA said: “CCS is important if Australia is to help contribute to global emissions reduction goals at the lowest possible cost. It will also help decarbonise energy-intensive industries that depend on the continued use of fossil fuels.” Earlier this month the MCA announced it would continue its TV advertisements promoting coal power, and has since sent out a media release promoting HELE coal. Following a move by its own shareholders, BHP agreed to review its membership of industry and business groups such as the Minerals Council. That review, published in December, concluded that unless the MCA adapted its advocacy activities within a year, it would cancel its almost $2m yearly membership, which makes up about 17% of the MCA’s revenue from memberships. Specifically, the review said the MCA must stop prioritising the affordability and reliability of energy over emissions goals. It also noted that although the MCA regularly said it supported a “technology neutral and market based approach,” it actually advocated policies that gave preferential treatment to coal. Brynn O’Brien, the executive director of Australian Centre for Corporate Responsibility, which led the shareholder action, said the Minerals Council appeared to be ignoring BHP’s ultimatum. “In terms of the pattern, it just seems as though the Minerals Council is back to its old tricks of coal advocacy and this does not represent a technology-neutral approach, and it therefore conflicts with BHP’s request of them,” O’Brien said. However, BHP is itself a supporter of CCS globally, funding a number of CCS-related projects, and so may not be hostile to the MCA’s advocacy on CCS. In the same review of the groups to which it belongs, BHP found an even stronger list of material differences between its positions and those held by the US Chamber of Commerce on climate and energy, including the chamber’s views that keeping global warming under 2C is unachievable and that the Paris Agreement is ineffectual. But BHP said it would request further information from the group before it quit its membership. When reviewing its membership of the World Coal Association, BHP made a preliminary decision to quit the body, but would seek a response from the WCA before making a final determination. In a response to questions about whether the advocacy on these issues marked a continuation of earlier positions or a shift along the lines requested by BHP, a spokesman for the MCA said: “The MCA’s longstanding policy supports energy market solutions that will reduce emissions, improve supply reliability and minimise costs for business and households.” Counter to the claims made by BHP in its review, the spokesperson said: “The MCA has always advocated and will continue to advocate for a level playing field based on sound science and technology neutrality.” In its review, BHP noted that the MCA had called for government funding of a coal power plant and for the government to set emissions intensity thresholds in climate policy relative to technology-specific factors, in order to accommodate coal generation.

A spokesman for Woolworths said the company would cease selling the product from the end of June. “We can confirm that we’ll cease the sale of Confidor in Woolworths supermarkets and we’re currently working with the supplier around this decision,” the spokesman said. “We expect the product will no longer be on our shelves from the end of June this year.” Yates Confidor is a neonicotinoid, a class of pesticides used widely for more than a decade. Neonicotinoids represent about a quarter of the multibillion dollar international pesticide market but have been repeatedly linked to serious harm in bees in lab-based studies. The chemical was once seen as having an environmental advantage to other chemicals because the product is applied to seeds, which reduced spraying. But numerous studies in Europe have found that the chemicals end up in the nectar and pollen that bees feed on, and may damage the survival of honeybee colonies. Contamination from the pesticides has also been found in honey, and the European Union has banned its use on flowering crops. Last year the British environment secretary, Michael Gove, backed a total ban on the pesticides in fields across Europe. Gove said the “weight of evidence now shows the risks neonicotinoids pose to our environment, particularly to the bees and other pollinators which play such a key part in our £100bn food industry, is greater than previously understood”. But Australian regulators remain unmoved. In 2013, the Australian government undertook a review of neonicotinoids and the health of honey bees, which found that “the introduction of the neonicotinoids has led to an overall reduction in the risks to the agricultural environment from the application of insecticides”. This month the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority said that it was “not planning to review the use of neonicotinoids” because Australia’s honey bee populations are not in decline. “There have been a number of studies discussed in the media that have found chemical residues present in honey and suggest a link between the use of neonicotinoids and declining health of honey bees,” the authority said. “Unlike some other countries, Australian honey bee populations are not in decline and Australia has robust regulatory and surveillance measures to monitor this issue.” Last week the hardware chain Bunnings announced it would pull the product. The Independent Hardware Group – which owns Mitre 10 and Home Timber and Hardware – also recently said it would stop selling products containing neonicotinoids by the end of this year. In a statement Yates said the company was “working with retailers to meet consumer needs with contact insecticides, both chemical and natural, from within our range”. “It is worth noting that neonicotinoid products have been used in Australian gardens for over 20 years and there has been no reduction in the Australian bee population over that time,” the company said in the statement. “The current scientific opinion is that where bee populations have declined in other countries, it is likely to be caused by multiple interacting factors, including the varroa destructor mite, which is not present in Australia. “Neonicotinoid-based products are approved for use in Australia by the relevant regulator – the Australian Pest and Veterinary Medicines Authority – who continue to monitor the latest science in regards to this issue. “To date, they have found no data to substantiate the claim that these products are harmful to bees, when correctly used.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2018/jan/23/well-live-longer-but-suffer-more-ill-health-by-2035-says-study","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-23T07:06:22Z","webTitle":"We'll live longer but suffer more ill-health by 2035, says study","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jan/23/well-live-longer-but-suffer-more-ill-health-by-2035-says-study","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/jan/23/well-live-longer-but-suffer-more-ill-health-by-2035-says-study","fields":{"headline":"We'll live longer but suffer more ill-health by 2035, says study","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The number of older people who have at least four different medical conditions is set to double by 2035, in a trend that will put huge extra strain on the NHS, researchers warn. Diseases such as cancer, diabetes, dementia and depression will become far more common as more and more over-65s develop them in their later years, a study at Newcastle University published on Tuesday found. One in three of those diagnosed with four long-term conditions will have dementia, depression or some form of cognitive impairment, according to academics in the university’s Institute for Ageing. They predict that over the next 20 years there will be “a massive expansion in the number of people suffering from multiple diseases, known as multi-morbidity”. Those years will see a 179.4% increase in the number of people of pension age being diagnosed with cancer, a 118% rise in those who have diabetes and a big jump, too, in cases of arthritis. “In the population over the age of 85 years all diseases, apart from dementia and depression, will more than double in absolute numbers between 2015 and 2035”, say the researchers. The trend will mean that men and women will suffer from four or more diseases for two-thirds of the extra life expectancy that people can look forward to gaining by 2035 – another 3.6 years for men and 2.9 years for women – the authors estimate. “These findings have enormous implications for how we should consider the structure and resources for the NHS in the future,” said Carol Jagger, professor of epidemiology of ageing at the institute, who led the study. “Multi-morbidity increases the likelihood of hospital admission and a longer stay, along with a higher rate of readmission, and these factors will continue to contribute to crisis in the NHS”. A large part of the increase in the number of people with four or more medical problems will come from an expected sharp rise in coming years in the number of people living until at least 85, which Jeremy Hunt, the health secretary, has warned will increase the NHS’s workload. Jagger and her team also identified another age group whose health outlook is also very gloomy. “More worryingly, our model shows that future young-old adults, aged 65 to 74 years, are more likely to have two or three diseases than in the past. This is due to their higher prevalence of obesity and physical inactivity, which are risk factors for multiple diseases,” added Jagger. The research, part of the MODEM project, has been jointly funded by the Economic and Social Research Council and the NHS’s research arm, the National Institute for Health Research. Caroline Abrahams, the charity director at Age UK, said: “This research absolutely underlines the importance of getting our health and care services right for older people. The increase in longevity over recent years has been a major achievement, but it also means we need to shift our focus to helping people to stay as well and independent as possible for as long as possible. “As we get older, our health and care needs tend to overlap and become more complex. A more compassionate and intelligent approach to caring for older people must be a priority for us all.” A spokesperson for NHS England said: “This study is further evidence of the need to integrate care, in the way the NHS is now beginning to do, so as to better support the growing number of older people with multiple health problems.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/jan/23/chris-jordan-the-spin-ipl-auction","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-23T11:06:00Z","webTitle":"Chris Jordan relishing most lucrative and unpredictable IPL yet | The Spin","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/jan/23/chris-jordan-the-spin-ipl-auction","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/jan/23/chris-jordan-the-spin-ipl-auction","fields":{"headline":"Chris Jordan relishing most lucrative and unpredictable IPL yet","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"With the salary cap up by 20%, 578 players up for grabs and no team having retained more than three members of their last squads, this weekend’s Indian Premier League auction is destined to be a tale of high drama and even higher numbers. Outside India there will surely be nowhere with more people showing more interest in the event than Perth, where the Australia and England teams will be playing their final one-day international and the tourists’ ranks will be further swelled by the arrival of those members of their Twenty20 squad not already involved in the ODI series. A few hours’ flight due north of Perth Chris Jordan is preparing for the auction in Bali. On Saturday he was in the Northern Districts Knights team that beat Central Districts Stags in the final of New Zealand’s Super Smash Twenty20, leaving him a few days to refresh before the drama to come. Last year Jordan was snapped up by Sunrisers Hyderabad, after a 2016 season in which he joined Royal Challengers Bangalore – the eventual runners-up – as a replacement for the injured Mitchell Starc. “You set your base price and then you just hope to get picked up, really,” he says of his auction experience. “Everyone’s different. Some people like to watch it throughout, others just like to hear the result at the end. I’m probably more one of the latter group but I’ll end up watching it this weekend. Last time I didn’t see any of it. I just got a message from my agent at the end saying that I’d been picked up, well done, congratulations. “This time a lot of us are in the auction so I’m sure everyone will follow it. I don’t think you can hide away from it. It will be interesting. I hope everyone does get picked up. It can only be good for English cricket and for our team going forward if our players go out there, because when you do go to the IPL you can really move your game on in a short space of time. “You play under immense pressure every game, in front of 80,000 screaming people and, if you can deal with that, it hardens you to that kind of environment and allows you to deal with pressure later in your career. “Whether you watch the auction or you try to ignore it, it can’t really affect the end result. You just wait to see how it all unfolds and try not to have too many expectations. Things could go one way or they could go the other. This auction is obviously a big one. It will be interesting because not many players have been retained, so a lot of big players have gone back into the pool. It’ll be really interesting to see how the teams put together their strategies and who they see as their key players. “I just hope to be involved in what I think is a brilliant tournament and one which improves players over a very short space in time, just due to the level of players that you interact with on a day-to-day basis. When I went to RCB I was playing with Chris Gayle, Virat Kohli, AB de Villiers and coached by Daniel Vettori and I just picked up so much knowledge. “At Sunrisers we had Shikhar Dhawan, Kane Williamson, Bhuvneshwar Kumar and David Warner, and we were well drilled and well coached by Tom Moody. I learned a lot there off different guys. There was some very good camaraderie between players and everyone there wanted to learn and improve and express themselves on the field of play.” Jordan will arrive in Australia refreshed by his brief visit to Bali but also re-energised by his first experience of New Zealand’s Super Smash. He joined the Knights mid-season and they proceeded to win six of their seven remaining games – there was also a washout – losing only to Central Stags, on whom they got revenge in a one-sided final. Stags chose to bat first but on a slow pitch scored only 99, Knights knocking off the runs for the loss of one wicket in less than nine overs. “Going to New Zealand was a bit of an unknown,” Jordan says. “I’d never played in the tournament but it was actually a good experience, playing in different conditions and on those small grounds. There was a good bunch of guys, well chosen and well coached by Gareth Hopkins, who created a very relaxing environment and just allowed people to go out and play. We lost my second game but then we got on a real good run right after that. “The final was a complete performance, our best bowling performance of the tournament and real clinical with the bat. It was on our home ground and we’d all watched the ODI that New Zealand played against Pakistan on the same wicket last week. It was good to see how that game played, and we went with lots of cross-seamers and then Anton Devcich came into the game and put the icing on the cake.” This is an extract taken from The Spin, the Guardian’s weekly cricket email.

Not many, I’d wager. But that’s exactly what we’ve got, after Kyle Edmund made light of any pressure he might have been feeling to see off the third seeded Grigor Dimitrov in four sets. What a performance from the 23-year-old. Sure, Dimitrov wasn’t on top form and his service game continues to be of concern, but that’s not to take anything away from Edmund’s performance. Rafael Nadal or Marin Cilic await. Thanks for joining me. Here’s Kevin Mitchell’s full match report: In his on-court interview, Edmund is as understated – and likeable – as ever. “Just held my nerve in the final game and prayed that last ball was out.” On his newfound fame and the attention from media in the absence of Andy Murray: “You just take it in your stride and embrace it.” Fourth set: Dimitrov 4-6, 6-3, 3-6, 4-6 Edmund* (* denotes server): What a result! Edmund downs the third seed to to reach the semi-finals! With the pressure on, it looked like showing on Edmund when he double faults at 15-15. But he recover and an ace brings up match point. Dimitrov then cracks, hitting a long ball – which he challenges, unsuccessfully – and Edmund celebrates! A star is born. Fourth set: Dimitrov* 4-6, 6-3, 3-6, 4-5 Edmund (* denotes server): Edmund whips a forehand down the line on the first point – a statement of intent if there ever was one – before at 15-30 a HUGE line call review comes out in favour of Edmund by a matter of millimetres. Drama! Dimitrov says the first break point but on the second he hits into the net and (please excuse the caps) EDMUND WILL SERVE FOR A PLACE IN THE SEMIS! Fourth set: Dimitrov 4-6, 6-3, 3-6, 4-4 Edmund* (* denotes server): This isn’t easy for Edmund, by any stretch, but a big second serve on game point is enough for him to hold. Perhaps tiredness is beginning to become a factor. Still, he’s potentially just two games away from a place in the semi-finals. Fourth set: Dimitrov* 4-6, 6-3, 3-6, 4-3 Edmund (* denotes server): Edmund unleashes his forehand once more to take a 30-15 lead and he looks good on his way to another break point opportunity. But the chance goes begging when he can only find the net on a return. Dimitrov goes on to seal the game with an ace – that’s some clutch tennis from the third seed. Fourth set: Dimitrov 4-6, 6-3, 3-6, 3-3 Edmund* (* denotes server): Tension! This game is a hugely important one – for both players – and it’s Dimitrov who initially takes the bull by its horns. He’s 30-0 up before he takes a tumble and Edmund eventually punishes him. Still, the Bulgarian brings up two break points and on the first one Edmund hits wide and we’re back on serve! Tremendous stuff on Rod Laver Arena! Fourth set: Dimitrov* 4-6, 6-3, 3-6, 2-3 Edmund (* denotes server): A lovely forehand winner from Edmund puts him in the ascendancy early on this game and when Dimitrov finds the net on a pretty regulation forehand a few points later, Edmund has a chance to break! And another unforced error from the Bulgarian does Edmund’s work for him! Wow. Fourth set: Dimitrov 4-6, 6-3, 3-6, 2-2 Edmund* (* denotes server): Edmund’s forehand comes to the, um, fore this game as the Briton holds again. He’s not showing any signs of the pressure getting to him. Yet. Fourth set: Dimitrov* 4-6, 6-3, 3-6, 2-1 Edmund (* denotes server): Dimitrov holds to love. Here’s more on that story about Zverev: Fourth set: Dimitrov 4-6, 6-3, 3-6, 1-1 Edmund* (* denotes server): This is getting interesting. Dimitrov needs to step up, but whether he will be able to do so very much depends on how Edmund can handle the pressure he is under now. He’s managed it OK so far, and he holds serve with ball in hand for the first time this fourth set. Fourth set: Dimitrov* 4-6, 6-3, 3-6, 1-0 Edmund (* denotes server): That was clutch from Edmond at the end of the third set. Dimitrov responds immediately under pressure with a comfortable hold, but it’s up to the third seed now to step up and take this match by the scruff of its neck. Third set: Dimitrov 4-6, 6-3, 3-6 Edmund* (* denotes server): Edmund allows himself a fist-clench after a superb forehand winner down the line that levels things up at 30-all. A Dimitrov net cord then lands favourably for the Briton and a booming serve later, he has the third set in the bag! The 23-year-old is a set away from the Australian Open semi-finals! Third set: Dimitrov* 4-6, 6-3, 3-5 Edmund (* denotes server): Edmund gets a glimpse of an opening as he goes 30-0 up before that glimpse becomes a wide-eyed stare a point later when he brings up two break points. He finds the net on the first but on the second Dimitrov double faults to gift Edmund a crucial break as the clock ticks over the two-hour mark! Third set: Dimitrov 4-6, 6-3, 3-4 Edmund* (* denotes server): Whatever Grigor can do, Kyle can do too – he also serves out to love Meanwhile, some news from elsewhere: German Mischa Zverev has been fined $56,165 for his performance against Hyeon Chung in the first round. Zverev retired just 48 minutes into the match when trailing the Korean 6-2, 4-1 and cited illness, but tournament officials were apparently unimpressed by that excuse and have dished out what is a record fine for a grand slam. Third set: Dimitrov* 4-6, 6-3, 3-3 Edmund (* denotes server): A love service game for the Bulgarian third seed! He’s serving at 83% on first serve this set, a marked improvement from the opener. Third set: Dimitrov 4-6, 6-3, 2-3 Edmund* (* denotes server): Edmund eases to a held service game, but just one little speedbump along the way. He closes with an ace and noses ahead once again this third set. Third set: Dimitrov* 4-6, 6-3, 2-2 Edmund (* denotes server): Edmund again shows soft hands at the net before he monsters a crosscourt forehand soon after. Two contrasting shots, both executed perfectly, and he has a break point for his efforts. But Dimitrov saves it thanks to some sterling defensive work and then he goes on to hold. Another opportunity missed for Edmund. Third set: Dimitrov 4-6, 6-3, 1-2 Edmund* (* denotes server): Dimitrov gets the crowd on their feet as he slides to reach an Edmund dink over the net, legs nearly in a splits position, and win the point. Superb athleticism from the Bulgarian but it counts for nought this game as Edmund puts himself into a winning position and then runs around a forehand to fire a winner on game point. Third set: Dimitrov* 4-6, 6-3, 1-1 Edmund (* denotes server): Dimitrov aces to seal the next game and we’re on serve this third set. You just feel the Bulgarian has a lot more in his locker that is yet to come out today. The question is whether he can find it. Third set: Dimitrov 4-6, 6-3, 0-1 Edmund* (* denotes server): Edmund gets himself out of difficulty early in the third, saving a break point before holding his serve. He did well to dodge that bullet. Second set: Dimitrov* 4-6, 6-3 Edmund (* denotes server): The rally of the match! Some huge hitting from both players ends with Edmund pulling back to 30-30 but Dimitrov soon has set point which he takes, thanks to a big serve! He draws level at 1-1 after taking 43 minutes to secure the set. Second set: Dimitrov 4-6, 5-3 Edmund* (* denotes server): Oof, that’s nice from Edmund to go 40-0 up – he glides into the net and with a deft touch gets the ball over. It’s not so pretty a bit later though, as he double faults for a second time this match, but no matter – he still goes on to hold, smashing at the net to secure the game. Second set: Dimitrov* 4-6, 5-2 Edmund (* denotes server): Dimitrov kicks off with a double fault and follows that a point later with another! A third (third!) then puts him in dire trouble but Edmund can’t capitalise on the break point. Deary me, he’s not making it easy for himself, is he? Eventually, he digs himself out of trouble to hold though. And Edmund may well be kicking himself for not taking advantage there. The Briton will now serve to stay in this set. Second set: Dimitrov 4-6, 4-2 Edmund* (* denotes server): Edmund shows some lovely soft hands at the net to take a 30-15 lead and he follows that with a decent serve that Dimitrov can’t return. “Looking good, Kyle” is a shout from the crowd and largely he is. He holds. Second set: Dimitrov* 4-6, 4-1 Edmund (* denotes server): Dimitrov opens up a three-game lead again with a no-frills service game, and the third seed remains on course to level the match up at one-set apiece. Second set: Dimitrov 4-6, 3-1 Edmund* (* denotes server): Dimitrov’s service game may not be firing on all cylinders, but his ground attack is. A superb return of serve at 30-30 gives him a chance to break again, but Edmund manoeuvres his opponent around the court, moves to the net and smashes to negate the threat. After a second deuce, it’s Dimitrov’s turn to force Edmund around the court. Lovely to watch, when he’s playing like that. After a total of four deuces, Edmund finally holds and he’s still in this set. Second set: Dimitrov* 4-6, 3-0 Edmund (* denotes server): Once again, Dimitrov’s service game falters and he finds himself starring at three break points soon after the commencement of this game. But the Bulgarian shows remarkable resilience, first to pull back to deuce, and then to win the game, a forehand crosscourt winner sealing the hold. Second set: Dimitrov 4-6, 2-0 Edmund* (* denotes server): You’ve got to like Edmund, there’s no ego in his game at all. He delays his serve after losing the ball in the sun, and is quick to say “sorry, sorry” in that most British of ways to his opponent. Anyway, that regret intensifies as he is broken in his first service game this second set. Dimitrov is fighting for everything. Second set: Dimitrov* 4-6, 1-0 Edmund (* denotes server): Dimitrov’s serve doesn’t let him down here. He wins it to love, an ace capping off an encouraging game for the Bulgarian. First set: Dimitrov 4-6 Edmund* (* denotes server): Edmund takes a one-set lead! He takes his time getting there after the first point doesn’t go to plan – he’s sluggish in recovery before he shanks a shot at the net, and that seems to set the tone for this game. He goes on to face a total of three break points – all of which are saved thanks to big serves – before he turns the tables on Dimitrov and brings up a set point. It’s wasted, but another chance soon presents itself and this time he takes it! First set: Dimitrov* 4-5 Edmund (* denotes server): A third double fault here for Dimitrov as his serve continues to perturb. Those problems see him fall to two break points... Edmund’s forehand looks like it has sealed the deal, but it’s called out and Hawkeye later confirms that to be the case. The break does indeed soon follow though as he unleashes a booming forehand winner! And the unseeded Briton will now serve for the first set. First set: Dimitrov 4-4 Edmund* (* denotes server): Another ace, Edmund’s fourth so far today, puts him 30-0 up and in command of this game. A fantastic Dimitrov forehand winner a point later keeps him in with a sniff, but that sniff is soon blown into a metaphorical handkerchief and when the Bulgarian is unable to return a third Edmund smash, another service game is held. Perhaps it’s too soon to be thinking about what happens after this match, but Rafa Nadal or Marin Cilic await today’s winner. No easy games at this level etc etc. First set: Dimitrov* 4-3 Edmund (* denotes server): Dimitrov holds serve again to hit the front for the first time, but he could do with upping his first serve percentage up a bit – after six games, it stands at 62%. And here’s another stat for you: Dimitrov has hit just three winners, to Edmund’s eight so far. First set: Dimitrov 3-3 Edmund* (* denotes server): Edmund’s serve lets him down with a double fault on game point, allowing Dimitrov back into things at deuce. The Briton then hits one into the tramlines, and he’s facing his first break point of the match. He goes for a near identical shot, and again he’s off target! Back on serve! Having mentioned Dimitrov’s outfit, I suppose it would be remiss of me not to analyse Edmund’s – he’s sporting the same colours (pink and black), but with a half-half shirt, diagonally split down the front. First set: Dimitrov* 2-3 Edmund (* denotes server): This is much better from Dimitrov, much more confident serving. He stays on Edmund’s coattails this opening set with a no-nonsense game, won to love. “I don’t usually follow the tennis, but...” writes in Alex Coe. “I was lucky enough to be in the stands for Edmund v Dimitrov in the Brisbane International and until that ankle roll Edmund was on course for a win – bigger more reliable first serve and a good hard return. Mind you it wasn’t 40 degrees that night….” He’s handled the heat OK thus far in Melbourne, mind. First set: Dimitrov 1-3 Edmund* (* denotes server): Edmund continues to impress, confirming his break with a game that he seals with a superlative forehand that lands just in, and with Dimitrov nowhere near it. First set: Dimitrov* 1-2 Edmund (* denotes server): Dimitrov double faults again but he regains his composure, finishing off the game with a devastating backhand winner. The third seed is on the board. Tim Henman is in the stands! It’s all about Edmania today though. First set: Dimitrov 0-2 Edmund* (* denotes server): Jim Courier on the telly is suggesting Dimitrov might be suffering from an ankle injury. There’s no real visible sign of that though; either way, Edmund doesn’t care. He fires up his serve, pings down an ace, and holds to love. Dimitrov, in case he didn’t already believe it, has a fight on his hands today. First set: Dimitrov* 0-1 Edmund (* denotes server): OK, here we go then! Dimitrov, in his liquorice allsort outfit, serves first up. It’s not at all plain sailing though as Edmund gets to an early break point – Dimitrov saves it – and then the Bulgarian double faults. A second break points follows and this time he’s long on a regulation forehand and Edmund breaks! Here’s the inevitable TV interview with Edmund standing on the steps of the double decker London bus stationed on the Melbourne Park grounds because, you know, he’s British. He seems cool and composed. “I’ve just been going one match at a time,” he says. “Every match has been a real battle for me and I’ve been able to come through some tight ones.” The chaps are on court, with the preceding women’s quarter-final having wrapped up in double-quick time. Rising star Elise Mertens dropped just three games to see off the fourth seed, Elina Svitolina, and ensure another women’s seed is tossed the scrapheap. The draw remains wide open. “I’m without words,” said the Belgian. “I don’t know what to say. I gave it all today. It was a little stressy at the end but I played my game today and it went well. On Svitolina: “She’s a great mover and a really strong player. I knew it was going to be tough I tried to play aggressive and come to the net a bit more.” Mertens plays second seed Caroline Wozniacki or Spanish veteran Carla Suarez Navarro, who meet later on tonight, in the semis on Thursday. Hello and welcome once again. We’re approaching the pointy end of the tournament but as pointy as that may be, among the usual suspects there are a number of surprise names still left in the mix. Last night, a new hero was born at Melbourne Park as Korea’s Hyeon Chung downed his idol Novak Djokovic to book his place in the last eight, where he will face the equally unheralded American Tennys Sandgren, who has managed to play some incredible tennis of his own in between denying he is an alt-right sympathiser. And then there is Kyle Edmund. The world No49, reluctantly carrying the expectations of a nation in the absence of Andy Murray this year, has been, frankly, a revelation on his way to a debut grand slam quarter-final. Having so far accounted for Kevin Anderson, Denis Istomin, Nikoloz Basilashvili and Andreas Seppi – including five-setters against Anderson and Seppi – he now faces his biggest test yet in the form of the third seed, Grigor Dimitrov. Dimitrov, chasing his first grand slam title and arguably as well-placed to do so this year as he ever has been, has played some stupendous tennis at times this tournament, not least during his last-16 match against Nick Kyrgios. The Australian played some electric tennis himself that night, and that Dimitrov prevailed in a four-set classic speaks volumes about his current level. It promises to be an intriguing match-up.

In a tweet posted on Monday, Manning attempted to calm a storm of criticism that erupted after she was spotted at the Saturday event, dubbed “A Night for Freedom”, in New York. She insisted that her decision to turn up at the celebration of Donald Trump’s first year in the White House was an act of intelligence gathering designed to thwart what she called “fascists/alt-right”. “I took an opportunity to gather intel on them b/c the ideology they peddle threatens everybody,” the tweet said. Whether Manning has said enough to staunch the critical questions on social media remains to be seen. Her tweet made no mention of a photograph that was posted over the weekend that shows her crouching and smiling as part of a group shot that includes far-right activists and conspiracy theorists. The Guardian has confirmed that the photograph is genuine. Alongside Manning in the group photo were Jack Posobiec who, like Cernovich, was a prime mover of the “Pizzagate” conspiracy theory that wrongly accused senior Democratic figures of running a child sex ring. Also present was Cassandra Fairbanks, a former Bernie Sanders supporter who switched sides and has become a forceful advocate for Trump. Fairbanks, who now works for the Gateway Pundit, a site that regularly disseminates rightwing conspiracy theories, would not comment on the photograph or her connection, if any, to Manning. But she did tell the Guardian that she was “very pleased that everyone treated [Manning] respectfully” at the Cernovich pro-Trump event. On Manning herself, Fairbanks added: “Her being brave enough to go to an event attended by many who oppose what she did and show her face without any fear could certainly be considered an act of protest.” Any link between Manning and Fairbanks is especially fraught as Fairbanks has been a leading cheerleader for the WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, even after he was accused by US intelligence agencies of acting as a conduit for Democratic emails hacked by the Russian government. Manning leaked her vast trove of state secrets in 2010 to WikiLeaks, but since then has disassociated herself from Assange. In her first interview since declaring that she was running for the US Senate seat in her home state of Maryland last week, Manning told the Guardian that she had not been in touch with Assange since the leak. An associate of Manning’s told the Guardian that her appearance in the group photograph was all part of her same efforts to “gather intel” on the alt-right. In her tweet, she said: “Fascists/alt-right deserve no platform. We stand opposed to them.” As a further plot twist, the activist and co-chair of the 2017 Women’s March, Linda Sarsour, confirmed to the Guardian that she had received a call from Manning in which the former soldier expressed “extreme regret” over her decision to attend Cernovich’s party and “admitted it was very bad judgment”, as first reported by BuzzFeed. Cernovich is a leading member of the so-called “Deplorables” who celebrate their support for Trump by appropriating Hillary Clinton’s description of his base as a “basket of deplorables”. After his party on Saturday he tweeted: “Yes, I literally shook hands with Chelsea Manning.” Several supporters of Manning expressed disappointment. One trans woman posting under the handle “Muffin” said: “What were you thinking putting yourself in the position you did? Do you understand how the situation reads to the people who agree with you and trusted you?” Other prominent commentators leapt to Manning’s defense. Glenn Greenwald, the Intercept columnist, said it was legitimate to ask questions but not to suggest that she was politically alligned with the alt-right."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/jan/22/canada-climate-science-faces-looming-crisis","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-22T22:20:20Z","webTitle":"Canadian climate science faces crisis that may be felt globally, scientists warn","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jan/22/canada-climate-science-faces-looming-crisis","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jan/22/canada-climate-science-faces-looming-crisis","fields":{"headline":"Canadian climate science faces crisis that may be felt globally, scientists warn","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Canadian climate science is facing a looming crisis whose repercussions could be felt far beyond the country’s borders, hundreds of scientists have warned, after the Canadian government failed to renew the country’s only dedicated funding program for climate and atmospheric research. In an open letter addressed to Justin Trudeau, more than 250 scientists from 22 countries highlight their concern over the imminent end of the C$35m Climate Change and Atmospheric Research program. Launched in 2012, the program funded seven research networks that explored issues such as the impact of aerosols, changing sea ice and snow cover, as well as atmospheric temperatures in the high Arctic. Much of the research emerging from the program was focused on Canada’s Arctic, yielding data sets that were used around the world by scientists seeking to better understand climate change and its impacts. The government’s decision came as a surprise to many in Canada, said Dan Weaver of Evidence For Democracy, the research advocacy group who published the letter on Monday. “The government has taken great effort to engage with policies around climate and climate education, green energy and a lot of these great things,” he said. “But somehow along the way, the support for the atmospheric science – the underlying science of the issue – has been overlooked.” Scientists in Canada first sounded the alarm last spring after noticing that the 2017 federal budget did not include funding for the program. Amid public outcry the government said it would extend funding for one of the program’s projects; a one-of-a-kind research lab located some 1,100 km from the North Pole. While the Polar Environment Atmospheric Research Laboratory now has funding until the fall of 2019, the six remaining projects are bracing for their funding to dry up in March. The loss of these projects will be felt globally, says the letter. Canada’s scientists are uniquely positioned to research the Arctic, arguably the world’s most critical region when it comes to quantifying how and why the climate is changing, said signatory Gloria Manney, a senior research scientist at the Northwest Research Associates in the US. “Continuous, stable funding support for Canadian atmospheric and climate science is thus crucial to advancing understanding of our planet.” As the Trump administration seeks to devalue climate science, Canada’s commitment to climate research is needed now more than ever, said signatory Benjamin D Santer, a senior climate researcher at the US Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories. “The world is looking to Canada for political leadership that the United States is currently unable to provide,” he said. While Trudeau government’s stated support for climate science and the Paris climate agreement has been encouraging, “such support cannot be limited to fine-sounding words”, he said. “It must be backed by a real commitment to preserve and sustain the unique climate measurement, climate monitoring, and climate modeling capabilities that Canada possesses.” In response to the letter, Canada’s minister of science pointed to the additional C$70m her government had set aside for climate research in the last budget, adding to the C$37m provided annually by federal research granting councils. “We are doing more to combat climate change than any Canadian federal government in history,” Kirsty Duncan said in a statement. “Our government will continue to support and invest in the actions necessary to address climate change.” Weaver welcomed these efforts, but he said they should be paired with long term funding for research. “If Canada isn’t contributing this key piece of the puzzle, no one else can,” he said. “The Trudeau government is taking concrete actions on climate and science in a variety of ways, but it’s missing a critical piece,” he said. “And that’s what this is all about – ensuring that this gap is filled in some way or another.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/jan/22/alexis-sanchez-piano-video-goes-viral-but-is-the-new-united-signing-playing","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-22T20:26:10Z","webTitle":"Alexis Sánchez at the piano in Manchester United video – but is it their new star playing?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jan/22/alexis-sanchez-piano-video-goes-viral-but-is-the-new-united-signing-playing","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/jan/22/alexis-sanchez-piano-video-goes-viral-but-is-the-new-united-signing-playing","fields":{"headline":"Alexis Sánchez at the piano in Manchester United video – but is it their new star playing?","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Manchester United finally confirmed the arrival of Alexis Sánchez on Monday in unusual fashion – with a video purportedly showing the Chilean forward playing ‘Glory Glory Man United’ on the piano. The club confirmed the deal in a tweet headed: “Ladies and gentlemen, please take your seats. Introducing #Alexis7… #GGMU #MUFC” and tagging the player in. The 30-second video attached appears to show Sánchez playing the piano in his full kit, before walking down the Old Trafford tunnel and surveying the pitch. Behind-the-scenes clips, and this video from 2014, suggest that it is indeed Sánchez himself playing the famous Manchester United ditty. The video has already been watched 3.5m times and retweeted 115,000 times. Some commenters suggested that the announcement was delayed in order for Sánchez to learn the song on piano. The clip was posted on Twitter at the same time as a more understated message from Arsenal, confirming that Sánchez had left the club and midfielder Henrikh Mkhitaryan had joined them in a swap deal. Manchester City, who pulled out of a deal for Sánchez last week, announced Kevin De Bruyne’s contract extension at the same time. Fourth-tier Yeovil Town, meanwhile, had a welcome message of their own for Sánchez: It’s not the first time United have gone above and beyond to unveil a signing. Paul Pogba’s arrival in the summer of 2016 was marked by an Adidas-created collaboration with Stormzy which featured the midfielder dancing. Romelu Lukaku, who joined from Everton last summer, was announced in rather more makeshift fashion. United’s effort is symbolic of football clubs’ battle to create ever more innovative and outlandish ways to announce their signings. Some are good, like Liverpool’s nod to the impatient Twitter masses. Some, like Antonio Rüdiger’s announcement at Chelsea, maybe seemed better at the storyboard stage. Aston Villa felt the full force of a Twitter backlash after posting this imaginary WhatsApp group chat to announce the arrival of John Terry, while nobody was quite sure if this Besiktas video was supposed to be tongue-in-cheek or not. Finally, a couple of personal favourites – Roma go through some ideas with Aleksandar Kolarov and Southampton announce the deal everyone was waiting for."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"us-news/2018/jan/22/ruth-bader-ginsburg-metoo-movement-its-about-time","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-22T19:33:06Z","webTitle":"Ruth Bader Ginsburg on #MeToo movement: 'It's about time'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jan/22/ruth-bader-ginsburg-metoo-movement-its-about-time","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/jan/22/ruth-bader-ginsburg-metoo-movement-its-about-time","fields":{"headline":"Ruth Bader Ginsburg on #MeToo movement: 'It's about time'","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Ruth Bader Ginsburg has spent a lifetime fighting for gender equality, but in an interview over the weekend the 84-year-old supreme court justice made clear she sees the fight as unfinished business. When asked at the Sundance Film Festival for her thoughts on the nascent #MeToo movement, she was unequivocal with her praise: “It’s about time,” Ginsburg told her interviewer. “For so long women were silent, thinking there was nothing you could do about it, but now the law is on the side of women, or men, who encounter harassment and that’s a good thing.” “Every woman of my vintage knows what sexual harassment is, although we didn’t have a name for it,” she said in a wide-ranging interview ahead of the Sundance premiere of RBG, a documentary film about her life. Ginsburg didn’t shy away from the personal, telling NPR’s Nina Totenberg she too had been subject to such behavior as a student at Cornell preparing for a chemistry test in the 1950s. “My instructor said … ‘I’ll give you a practice exam,’” Ginsburg recalled. The next day she was alarmed when the practice exam ended up being identical to the real test. “I knew exactly what he wanted in return,” she said. “And that’s just one of many examples.” Back then, the set of available options for women on the receiving end of sexual harassment was limited. The consensus at the time, Ginsburg said, was “get past it” and “boys will be boys”. But that didn’t sit well with the future women’s rights lawyer who went straight to the instructor’s office post exam. “‘How dare you? How dare you do this?’” she recalled demanding of the instructor. “And that was the end of it,” she said. But it was not the last sexist treatment Ginsburg would experience coming up through America’s educational and legal systems. As a young law professor at Rutgers, Ginsburg recalled learning that she had been required to take a much greater salary cut than a male colleague with an equivalent degree of experience. But when she asked the dean about the disparity she was told, “Ruth, he has a wife and two children to support. You have a husband with a good-paying job in New York.” It was the same year the Equal Pay Act passed, said Ginsburg, and “that was the answer I got”. She did not accept it as the final word, instead teaming up with other female academics at Rutgers to file an Equal Pay Act complaint, which the university eventually settled. Later in life – when she found her work as a teacher and litigator helping to found the ACLU Women’s Rights Project was continually interrupted by calls from her son’s school – she handled the situation directly. “The child was what his teachers called ‘hyperactive’ and I called ‘lively’,” Ginsburg said, but what bothered her more was the school’s apparent impression that she was her son’s sole parent. And so one day, after staying up all night working on a brief, Ginsburg relieved them of the misapprehension. “This child has two parents. Please alternate calls. It’s his father’s turn,” she said. Her husband Martin – who died in 2010 and who she has called the first man who “cared that I had a brain” – was sent to deal with things that day. After that, the calls from her son’s school dropped off. “The reason was they had to think long and hard before asking a man to take time out of his work day to come to the school,” she said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2018/jan/22/cometh-the-hour-cometh-henry-bolton-prime-minister","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-22T19:13:06Z","webTitle":"Cometh the hour, cometh Henry Bolton, prime minister  | John Crace","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jan/22/cometh-the-hour-cometh-henry-bolton-prime-minister","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/jan/22/cometh-the-hour-cometh-henry-bolton-prime-minister","fields":{"headline":"Cometh the hour, cometh Henry Bolton, prime minister","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"One by one, the resignations had come. People no one had ever heard of, quitting jobs that no one knew existed. By mid-afternoon, more than half the Ukip frontbench team had done a bunk in protest at Henry Bolton’s continued leadership of the party. At least, that was a best guess figure; it was hard to keep an exact tally of who had gone and when, since a few members had to reannounce their resignations as no one had noticed when they had done so the first time around last week. All the while, Bolton remained holed up in a Folkestone hotel room. Just around the corner from his apartment. No one was going to take him alive. Bolton was genuinely perplexed. His only crime had been to fall in love with a woman half his age with racist views, who had happened to join a party that attracted racists of which he was leader. What could possibly be more normal than that? Now, if he had copped off with someone in her 50s who supported immigration and was pro-EU, that would have been a story. People were just jealous of his pulling power. The Ukip leader paced his room, counting down the minutes until his 4pm press conference at the back entrance of the hotel. He’d left it that late in the day because he had wanted to catch the opening rounds of the World Indoor Bowls Championships on BBC2. Unmissable. It was just sheer bad luck that one match had been such a nailbiter that he’d absent-mindedly wandered out the front of the hotel by mistake. By which time, the Ukip press office had already released a statement saying he’d be staying on as leader. Undaunted – largely because he had no idea the news was already out – Bolton fought his way past the dustbins and headed down the potholed drive towards where the press were assembled. “Yesterday, the Ukip national executive committee ... ” he began. “Excuse me, Mr Bolton,” shouted one reporter. “We can’t hear you. Would you mind stepping forward several paces to where the microphones are, please?” What had started as Alan Partridge was rapidly turning into both Fawlty and Blackadder. As if suspecting a cunning plan, Bolton nervously inched his way towards the cameras and started reading out his statement for a second time. It wasn’t him that was the problem, it was the party’s NEC, he insisted. A bunch of small-minded prudes who were now suffering from buyers’ regret at having chosen a leader with such powerful animal magnetism just a few months earlier. “I respect the next steps in the constitutional process and will therefore not be resigning as party leader,” he said. “I repeat, I shall not be resigning as party leader.” That repetition was as much for his own benefit as anyone else’s. He sounded as if he couldn’t quite believe what he was saying himself. Far from quitting, he was proposing to put himself forward as the man who could unite all the leave campaigns. Step aside, Theresa May. Cometh the hour, cometh the man. Henry was putting himself forward as prime minister. The statement lasted just a few minutes, after which Bolton scuttled back indoors, muttering “No comment” while being pursued by reporters who had been gifted unexpected gold dust. Some even wondered if Bolton hadn’t been a fifth columnist all along who had set out to destroy Ukip from within. But that was to miss the point. This was a party hellbent on presenting its death throes as award-winning entertainment. Nothing more, nothing less. There was no great conspiracy. As so often in the past with Ukip, the whole thing had just been a bit of a cock-up. Only in Bolton’s case, the cock-up had been literal."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/jan/24/us-and-uk-retreat-from-globalism-eroding-international-order-penny-wong-says","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-23T17:01:07Z","webTitle":"US and UK retreat from globalism 'eroding international order', Penny Wong says","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/jan/24/us-and-uk-retreat-from-globalism-eroding-international-order-penny-wong-says","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/jan/24/us-and-uk-retreat-from-globalism-eroding-international-order-penny-wong-says","fields":{"headline":"US and UK retreat from globalism 'eroding international order', Penny Wong says","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Brexit and Donald Trump’s withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership are part of a broader retreat from globalism that is eroding the rules-based international order, Penny Wong will say in a speech on Wednesday. The Australian senator and the Labor opposition’s foreign affairs spokeswoman will also question whether China’s Belt and Road Initiative will enhance stability, in her speech at Singapore’s Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy. Wong says there is “no disputing the international rules-based order is under its greatest period of stress since the end of the second world war” and blames the “breakdown in the global order” for inequality, the re-emergence of nationalism and racism, and refugee flows causing ethnic tension. Britain’s decision to leave the EU was not just a symptom of economic and social malaise but a “clear rejection of the European rule-making system”, she says. “Similarly, the Trump administration’s reassessment of the global strategic engagement of the US is not simply a reaction to massive cost pressures.” The decision to walk away from the TPP was “a rejection of the economic globalisation that has become such a distinguishing feature of the international rules-based order”. “That is serious enough in itself. But perhaps more serious is the ongoing reappraisal of the way that the US sees itself in the conduct of global affairs.” Wong references Trump’s national security strategy, which calls for a rethink of the assumption that “engagement with rivals and their inclusion in international institutions and global commerce would turn them into benign actors and trustworthy partners”. Wong says the precise implications for south-east Asia of the US reappraisal were “quite unclear”. Addressing the rise of China, Wong notes that the country is now the No 1 trading partner of the Association of South-East Asian Nations members collectively, as well as Australia individually. China’s Belt and Road Initiative is a “game-changer”, she says, describing it as “an expression of strategic power, linking a new community of nations as both contributors to and beneficiaries of China’s remarkable growth”. BRI is a “fundamental change in the way that strategic business is done”, Wong says, and she questions whether it could achieve its “long-term economic and political realignment” in a way that “ensures that it is beneficial and constructive, and that it enhances prosperity, stability and security”. “This is a tricky question, given how little any of us really knows about the BRI, its detailed purposes and its operating rules.” Wong says China and the US will continue to “be both rule makers and rule takers” in the international order. Citing the South China Sea dispute, Wong says it is not reasonable for nations “dissatisfied with the current order to change the rules unilaterally, to impose their will rather than reach a negotiated position that meets the needs of all parties”. She suggests Asean should “put more energy and imagination into addressing the economic and security issues” and use a neutral forum to engage China, Japan, Russia and the US, including through the Asean regional forum and the East Asia Summit. In January Australia’s international development minister, Concetta Fierravanti-Wells, criticised China for building “white elephant” infrastructure projects in Pacific nations. The foreign affairs minster, Julie Bishop, attempted to walk back criticism of China’s aid program after Beijing labelled the intervention “nothing but irresponsible”. On his visit to Japan last week, Malcolm Turnbull called the US commitment to the region “as strong as it ever has been”. “You saw that from President Trump’s extended visit to the region just late last year,” he said. “They’re a vital part of the foundation, the security foundation, which has enabled all of this prosperity in the region, over 40 or more years. “I’m very confident that that will continue long into the future and President Trump has been absolutely unequivocal about his commitment to it.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2018/jan/23/johnson-johnson-withdraws-pelvic-vaginal-mesh-device-from-australian-market","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-23T04:14:55Z","webTitle":"Johnson & Johnson withdraws pelvic mesh device from Australian market","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jan/23/johnson-johnson-withdraws-pelvic-vaginal-mesh-device-from-australian-market","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/jan/23/johnson-johnson-withdraws-pelvic-vaginal-mesh-device-from-australian-market","fields":{"headline":"Johnson & Johnson withdraws pelvic mesh device from Australian market","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Pharmaceutical giant Johnson &amp; Johnson has withdrawn from the Australian market its supply of the vaginal mesh device that is the subject of a class action before the federal court. On Tuesday a spokeswoman for Australia’s medical devices regulator, the Therapeutic Goods Administration, confirmed to Guardian Australia that the mid-urethral vaginal sling devices, used to treat stress urinary incontinence in women, were no longer being imported. The devices are produced by the Johnson &amp; Johnson company Ethicon and no longer appear on the Australian Therapeutic Goods Register, which is a list of products that can be lawfully supplied in Australia. The TGA has not responded to questions about whether the removal of the products from the register also means that products already on hospital shelves cannot be used by surgeons. The TGA asked all manufacturers of transvaginal sling and mesh devices to update the “instructions for use” on transvaginal mesh and tape products before 17 January to include information about possible adverse events such as severe chronic pain, groin pain and bladder perforation. According to the TGA, Johnson &amp; Johnson did not meet this deadline and withdrew the supply of their mid-urethral sling devices to enable them to consider their options. A list of pharmaceutical companies that have met the new requirements has been made public. The president of the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, Professor Steve Robson, told Guardian Australia he had written to all members to alert them to the development. It was his understanding that Johnson &amp; Johnson slings already on hospital shelves could still be used but new supplies could not be imported. Robson said he did not have “exact figures”, but the Johnson &amp; Johnson devices were probably the most widely used by surgeons to treat incontinence. “What I have heard is once the stock on the shelf is gone that’s it, and many hospitals, if not most, are looking at other options including other brands of urethral tape, which are still available,” Robson said. “The feedback is some places are exploring transition arrangements so women can be offered other similar products. What I also wrote to our members yesterday was that it is clear mid-urethral tapes are the most appropriate response to incontinence which has not responded to other clinical treatment. We recirculated a Cochrane review that shows that mid-urethral tapes are the most appropriate treatment when used appropriately, and are very safe. “In fact, I think it’s regrettable it won’t be available for a while, but there are other similar products.” The Johnson &amp; Johnson/Ethicon implant became the subject of a class action run by Shine Lawyers in 2017, with 700 Australian women alleging that faulty pelvic mesh implants caused them debilitating pain. Similar class actions involving thousands of women are also under way in the UK and US. More than 100,000 transvaginal mesh lawsuits have been filed in the US, the largest number against Johnson &amp; Johnson, the manufacturer of the most commonly used meshes. Shine Lawyers alleges Johnson &amp; Johnson failed to properly test the devices and played down their risk to both surgeons and patients. A Senate inquiry has examined whether any financial or other incentives have been provided to medical practitioners to use or promote transvaginal mesh implants; the lack of data available on how many procedures were performed; and the type and incidence of health problems woman have experienced. The class action is due to return to the federal court in Sydney on Monday. Johnson &amp; Johnson has been contacted for comment."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"law/2018/jan/22/stay-silent-during-and-attackers-may-assume-consent-warns-dpp","type":"article","sectionId":"law","sectionName":"Law","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-22T23:55:15Z","webTitle":"Stay silent during rape and attackers may assume consent, warns DPP","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2018/jan/22/stay-silent-during-and-attackers-may-assume-consent-warns-dpp","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/law/2018/jan/22/stay-silent-during-and-attackers-may-assume-consent-warns-dpp","fields":{"headline":"Stay silent during rape and attackers may assume consent, warns DPP","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Rape victims have been warned by the director of public prosecutions that if they stayed silent during the assault their attackers may have assumed consent was given and therefore could escape being charged. Alison Saunders’ comments come in the wake of the collapse of a series of rape prosecutions. Her implication that silence or apparent acquiescence can amount to consent is likely to prove controversial among those who monitor sexual assaults. In an interview with the Evening Standard newspaper, Saunders said that the Crown Prosecution Service never assumed that “if someone says they’ve been raped or just wants to shout rape then that’s enough” to prove a case. “We look at two stages,” she said. “The capacity to consent. Also, it’s the second limb which prosecutors apply: did the suspect have a reasonable belief in consent? “So in some of the cases, you can see why even though the complainant may think they were raped, there was a reasonable belief that they had consented, either through silence or through other actions or whatever. “We are there not just to be able to prosecute cases where there has been an offence, but also not to prosecute cases where there isn’t sufficient evidence … There are high stakes here and I understand entirely if I think about whether that happened to me or anybody I knew, it would be devastating. We want to get it right. Prosecutors feel this, they know they are dealing with people’s lives.” Saunders’ comments appear to be a response partially to recent allegations that the CPS has been too eager charge male suspects in rape investigations. Her statement, however, follows the collapse of at least four recent rape prosecutions after it emerged that police had failed to find or disclose crucial evidence from mobile phones which cast doubt on the complainant’s version of events. In the case of Samson Makele, the CPS offered no evidence when it emerged that images from the defendant’s phone of him in bed cuddling his alleged victim had not been disclosed to his defence lawyers. Such cases raise the somewhat different issue of whether the police and CPS have sufficient resources to examine the vast quantities of data now associated with many sexual offences cases. The Metropolitan police is already conducting an urgent review of similar problems after another rape case was halted in Croydon in December under similar circumstances when phone messages between the man and woman cast doubt on the prosecution’s version of events."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/postcolonial-blog/2018/jan/23/australia-days-barbecue-stopper-is-the-same-every-year","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-23T04:09:36Z","webTitle":"Australia Day's barbecue stopper is the same every year | Paul Daley","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/postcolonial-blog/2018/jan/23/australia-days-barbecue-stopper-is-the-same-every-year","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/postcolonial-blog/2018/jan/23/australia-days-barbecue-stopper-is-the-same-every-year","fields":{"headline":"Australia Day's barbecue stopper is the same every year","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Irrespective of whether the politicians shift Australia’s annual orgy of self-congratulation from 26 January, it will always thrive for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, and those who support betterment of their rights, as a national day of mourning.

It doesn’t matter that significant voices in establishment media cast the predictable “debate” around every recent 26 January as “new” or “fresh”, and Indigenous opposition to celebration as symbolism divorced from the historic struggle for rights to land and housing, education, and better economic and health outcomes. Symbolism, meanwhile, that stems from the government – most notably the offer of the sketchiest of constitutional recognition – is portrayed as weightier, more worthy. It matters even less that federal government and opposition members, too gormless to challenge party dictates, cynically attribute the fashion for such apparently novel dissent over 26 January to a third party, the Greens, eager as they are to kickstart the adversarial parliamentary year and gasp political oxygen in the dying she’ll-be-right days of our summer catatonia. No. None of that matters because, whether or not we celebrate Australian nationhood and culture on 26 January (I firmly believe the Aboriginal and non-Indigenous momentum for change is now close to irresistible), its organised commemoration as a national day of mourning first happened 80 years ago. As Guardian Australia’s Calla Wahlquist succinctly points out, “Opposition to celebrating on 26 January originated in the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community in the late 19th century. The first formal protest was the national day of mourning in Sydney in 1938, 54 years before the Australian Greens were founded.” By 1938, 26 January had already long been a day black-marked into Indigenous consciousness. It remains a touchstone for the darkest elements of memorised, written, sung, danced and painted Indigenous history, from the countless massacres and orchestrated poisonings, to the chain gangs, the stolen children, and for the continuing deaths in custody, the incarcerations and poverty that shame Australia. For a comprehensive history of the day of mourning, it’s worth consulting the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies. It recounts how, on 26 January 1938, 150 years after Arthur Phillip’s first fleet disembarked its first few prisoners and soldiers, the Aborigines Progressive Association mounted a silent protest to coincide with sesquicentenary celebrations. They waited as the official parade passed and during a recreation of the fleet’s arrival (it was historically flawed) involving blackfellas from outside Sydney who were imprisoned overnight. The National Museum of Australia recounts, “Aboriginal people living in Sydney refused to take part so organisers brought in men from Menindee, in western New South Wales, and kept them locked up at the Redfern Police Barracks stables until the re-enactment took place.” Such attempted agency-denying coercion has, of course, been both a characteristic and a shamefully ugly legacy of the British colonial/Indigenous interface in Australia.” The 100 or so Indigenous protesters, all wearing formal black attire, marched silently from the town hall to Australian Hall in nearby Elizabeth Street, where they passed a resolution that “this being the 150th Anniversary of the Whiteman’s seizure of our country HEREBY MAKE PROTEST against the callous treatment of our people by the whitemen during the past 150 years ...” Association founding member Jack Patten said, “On this day the white people are rejoicing, but we, as Aborigines, have no reason to rejoice on Australia’s 150th birthday. Our purpose in meeting today is to bring home to the white people of Australia the frightful conditions in which the native Aborigines of this continent live. “This land belonged to our forefathers 150 years ago, but today we are pushed further and further into the background. The Aborigines Progressive Association has been formed to put before the white people the fact that Aborigines throughout Australia are literally being starved to death. We refuse to be pushed into the background. We have decided to make ourselves heard.” The white commemoration of the first fleet arrival on 26 January has a significant official tradition. It stretches back to at least 1818 when Lachlan Macquarie – a hero governor to some contemporary Australian leaders for his supposed enlightenment, who was in fact a ruthless killer of the Indigenes of New South Wales – declared a public holiday for foundation day. The day has only been consistently celebrated in all states and territories since 1994. Each year now the Invasion Day protest crowds in the capital cities grow bigger and bigger, proportionate perhaps to the absurdity of some who defend 26 January as a unifying celebration of nationhood. This year there are some notable contributors, including the prime minister himself, Malcolm Turnbull, “disappointed by those who want to change the date of Australia Day”. He said, “A free country debates its history, it does not deny it.” This I find surprising, coming from a leader whose genuine engagement with Indigenous people and their issues has been at best passing, dismissive and condescending, and whose minister for Indigenous affairs, Nigel Scullion, has a demonstrated a cloth ear for Aboriginal voices. The government has only recently slapped down the request out of Uluru for formal historical truth telling as a means of progressing conciliation between Aboriginal and non-Indigenous Australia. What hope for meaningful discussions, then, about the legacies of colonial violence and oppression? Yes, the simmering truth that burns at the heart of Australian nationhood and sovereignty is disturbing and difficult to confront. It’s a real barbecue stopper in fact – one that serves to ensure 26 January can never be a socially unifying date on our calendar."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/jan/26/geoffrey-robertson-human-rights-lawyer-made-officer-of-order-of-australia","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-25T13:01:17Z","webTitle":"Geoffrey Robertson: human rights lawyer made officer of Order of Australia","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/jan/26/geoffrey-robertson-human-rights-lawyer-made-officer-of-order-of-australia","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/jan/26/geoffrey-robertson-human-rights-lawyer-made-officer-of-order-of-australia","fields":{"headline":"Geoffrey Robertson: human rights lawyer made officer of Order of Australia","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"He’s been a frequent critic of Australia’s refugee policy, warning Australia risks being seen as “mean and miserable”; he’s defended our highest profile fugitive, Julian Assange, and lived for the bulk of his life outside the country. Now Geoffrey Robertson QC, human rights lawyer and civil rights advocate, has been made an officer of the Order of Australia. The UK-based barrister was recognised for his “distinguished service to the law and the legal profession as an international human rights lawyer and advocate for global civil liberties”. He was also recognised for his contribution to legal education as an academic and publisher. Born in Australia, the 71-year old Robertson is a regular visitor. In the 1980s he was host of the popular ABC television program Hypotheticals, in which prominent people were asked to respond to moral dilemmas and outline what they would do. Robertson grew up in Eastwood and studied law at Sydney University before winning a Rhodes scholarship to Oxford where he was awarded a bachelor of civil law. Early in his career he forged a reputation for defending artists, writers and publications against Britain’s strict laws against indecency. Many of the cases were brought by Christian campaigner Mary Whitehouse. He has also acted in prominent libel cases, including defending the Guardian against conservative MP Neil Hamilton, who was accused of taking cash for questions in parliament. Robertson was threatened by terrorists for representing Salman Rushdie, whose novel the Satanic Verses was labelled hate speech by Muslims in Britain and prompted a fatwa from Iran’s Ayatollah Khomeini. In 2010 Robertson unsuccessfully defended Julian Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks, in extradition proceedings in the UK. Assange took refuge in the Ecuadorian embassy in London and remains there. Closer to home, Robertson took on the cause of Aboriginal Tasmanians who were seeking to recover 15 sets of bones from London’s Natural History Museum. He accused the museum of “genetic prospecting”. In 2015 Robertson and Amal Clooney, who has rooms in Doughty Chambers which Robertson founded, represented Armenia at the European Court of Human Rights over claims of genocide. Robertson is also a prolific author. He has written about legal issues, famous cases and some controversial subjects. In The Case of the Pope, Robertson claims Pope Benedict XVI is guilty of protecting paedophiles because the church swore the victims to secrecy and moved perpetrators in Catholic sex abuse cases to other positions where they had access to children while knowing the perpetrators were likely to reoffend. In 1990, Robertson married the author Kathy Lette, and they lived together in London with their children until their separation in 2017."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"travel/2018/jan/26/czech-republic-bohemia-magical-britannia-tv-series-location","type":"article","sectionId":"travel","sectionName":"Travel","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-26T06:30:38Z","webTitle":"The Czech Republic’s Bohemian Paradise: as magical as it sounds","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2018/jan/26/czech-republic-bohemia-magical-britannia-tv-series-location","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/travel/2018/jan/26/czech-republic-bohemia-magical-britannia-tv-series-location","fields":{"headline":"The Czech Republic’s Bohemian Paradise: as magical as it sounds","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Sitting in contemplative silence atop an enormous sandstone rock, I hear the first whoops in the distance. My initial reaction is to wonder who dares destroy this peace and tranquillity? Is it leftover warlords from Jez Butterworth’s new blockbuster TV drama Brittania? Scenes from the series (which aired for the first time on Sky Atlantic last week) were filmed in this monstrous natural playground. Then I realise that the noise is coming my way, leaping up the great boulders, climbing flights of stone steps, squeezing through shoulder-width crevices and spiralling around stone towers. The acoustics are so strange in this forested amphitheatre of stone monoliths that I can soon hear muttering: “This is incredible! I love it!” Then I see him: no woad-washed warrior, but a young man in a bright orange down jacket with a smile so wide I’m astonished he’s got it through the tighter spaces. Eventually he climbs my stone tower, panting a bit. “I’m so annoyed,” he says. “I’ve spent a week touring museums and town squares and now they bring me here and say I have two hours! This is a wonder of the world! I want a week here.” His name is Nils. He’s a Dutch student on a whirlwind coach tour of the Czech Republic and I know how he feels. Despite its name, Bohemian Paradise is not a well-known destination – though Brittania may change that. Even so, the camera can barely cope with its labyrinthine beauty. I’m in an area called Prachovské Skály (Prachov Rocks), the most visible and best-known section. I have been walking through similar scenery for four days. At the start, a footpath from the small town of Turnov, a central European settlement that is both ancient and modern, smart and dilapidated, led me into countryside, climbing a wooded ridge with a little rock tower, wind-worn and curvaceous, no taller than a London bus. That, however, was a mere canape before the main feast. Now the forest is deep and silent, peopled only by red squirrels and deer. To my left I notice the ground seems to slide away between beech trees in leaf-littered curves. Investigating, I find a deep canyon guarded by sandstone bluffs where I lose myself, briefly, in a natural maze. The magic has started. On a side diversion I discover an area where a local artist has carved slightly spooky figures into the rock: mythical giants on mossy steeds looming from under the forest’s feet. Approaching the hamlet of Hrubá Skála, I notice a steep side path leading into a narrow cleft between cliffs. An hour later, totally disoriented by steep staircases winding through clefts barely a rucksack wide, I emerge from a slot canyon with a laugh of delight. I’m right opposite my hotel. I am so excited that instead of checking in, I head back and spend another hour exploring. Day two is a circuit that begins with a long, slow descent into deep forest with mysterious cliffs among the trees. It feels like I’m immersed in a fairytale. Rain falls. I reach Kost Castle, a dark forbidding place where I’m disappointed to be told the torture chamber is closed today. But the castle proves sufficiently fascinating without the addition of thumb screws. Towards sunset, on the way back to Hrubá Skála, I start following some animal tracks, forgetting to unwind a string behind me. I reach the rounded edge of a deep canyon, retrace my steps, then spot a movement. I freeze. All massive horns and woolly chestnut coats, a whole party of mouflon (feral sheep) stroll into view, before they spot me and charge away. I have lost both my bearings and any semblance of a path. I get the map and compass out and decide to head east. I drop down a long soft slope of dry leaves into a gully, then pop out opposite the hotel. How was that possible? The receptionist swears that mouflon are extremely rare and never seen nearby. Who am I to disagree? After another day of quiet forest walking, I head for Prachovské Skály, the pièce de résistance. The gorges were made more visitor-friendly a century ago with an intricate network of steps and passages, plus a few iron balustrades to stop ladies in long skirts from tripping and falling. I can see why the TV location scouts loved it here. It’s a place to spend days on hide-and-seek, to bring a sketchbook. Too soon, I reach the baroque masterpiece that is the town of Jičín. It has chequerboard paving and long colonnades around a magnificent market square – but also cars and people. Like Nils the Dutchman, I’m aghast. Four days was all too short a time to spend in paradise. Way to go Packages The trip was provided by On Foot Holidays, whose four-night walking tour of Bohemian Paradise costs from £435pp, including B&amp;B, route notes and luggage transfers, but not flights. Extensions (to Prague for example) can be added. Flights Wizz Air flies from Luton to Prague six days a week (and daily from 26 March) from £41 return. Best time to go April to October. Early spring can be cold, but by late April the spring flowers start. May and June are arguably the best months, but high summer is still good as much of the walk is shaded by trees. Most castles and other attractions are closed on Monday so time your visit carefully. Exchange rate £1= 28.9 koruna (CZK). A simple lunch in a village restaurant will cost about 100-150 CZK. Beer is very good and very cheap – a half-litre glass is about 25 CZK.

In a speech to the Victorian Fabian society on Monday, Butler warned that Labor was at best “treading water”, with membership slipping and a decreased capacity to organise mass campaigns. Labor’s federal climate change spokesman, a member of the left faction, called for democratic reforms to allow party members to vote for important positions including state leaders, Senate candidates and vacancies. Butler said that after two years as president the changes he championed in 2015 had been “blocked by factional leaders at the national conference and various state conferences”. “I’m sorry to say that ours remains a party that gives ordinary members fewer rights than any other Labor or social democratic party I can think of,” he said. Butler said that members must be allowed to vote for Senate and Legislative Council candidates, positions which “remain a last bastion of backroom dealing by self-appointed factional warlords” in some states. Similarly, casual vacancies should not be filled by “highly centralised factional processes”. In this term of parliament Senate vacancies have been filled by Bill Shorten’s preferred candidate Kimberley Kitching in Victoria, and in New South Wales the way has been cleared for the former premier Kristina Keneally to take a vacancy. Butler singled out a proposed factional realignment in Victoria which would have given a new bloc control over a new federal lower house seat as an example of “backroom buffoonery [that] does not reflect a healthy party organisation” because the location and makeup of the seat had not yet been determined. Butler said the party organisation “is certainly not dying [but] the most generous description I can think of is that we’re treading water”. He said the party’s membership of 50,000 had “disturbingly” declined by more than 6% since its peak in 2015 and in a country of 25 million people it could not “credibly claim to be a mass-membership party”. “We need to be honest that the party itself is no longer capable of organising a substantial on-the-ground campaign, beyond elections,” he said. Labor had played only a supporting role to the unions’ 2007 Your Rights at Work campaign and “can’t compare in scale to the organising capacity today of groups like GetUp”. Labor has consistently led Malcolm Turnbull’s Coalition government in the polls since it was narrowly re-elected in July 2016, but Butler noted that large leads for Kevin Rudd and Mark Latham in 2007 and 2004 shrank or disappeared by election day. “Now, there are reasons for all of those shifts in the numbers,” he said. “But they all point to a danger of complacency about any election, including the next one.” Butler also warned that the party’s Senate vote had dropped below 30% for the first since 1903 as the Greens, the Nick Xenophon Team and One Nation won an increasing share. He called for creation of a new category of “registered supporters” who would be allowed to vote alongside members in important party ballots. He said that would reflect the way many people chose to take part in progressive politics and would make the party more representative. Comparing the ALP with its British counterpart, he noted Labour had grown to be the largest political party in Europe off the back of a reform agenda and was “probably about 11 times as big” as the ALP . Responding to the view that Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour had moved too far to the left, Butler said the ALP caucus had a 50% say in the election of its federal leader, meaning a leftward shift was not an “unavoidable” consequence of reforms. Moderate voices would have to “organise better” than their British counterparts. The “orthodox view that reform equals Corbyn equals electoral oblivion” had been challenged by the 2017 result in which Labour increased its primary vote by 10% and deprived Theresa May of a majority. Defending his record at a doorstop on Tuesday, Shorten said party membership had increased under his leadership from 42,000 to 56,000. He added that Butler was “right that we’ve got to keep pushing to involve people”. Shorten said “the Labor party needs to do better” and he was “keen to do more” but to restore faith in democracy the party should be talking about “issues that everyday Australians are concerned with” such as the cost of living."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"global/2018/jan/30/us-crumbling-infrastructure-trump-state-of-union-address","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-30T06:00:12Z","webTitle":"'One big pothole’: will Trump fix America’s decaying infrastructure?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2018/jan/30/us-crumbling-infrastructure-trump-state-of-union-address","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global/2018/jan/30/us-crumbling-infrastructure-trump-state-of-union-address","fields":{"headline":"'One big pothole’: will Trump fix America’s decaying infrastructure?","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"She remembers first crossing the bridge as a girl in the 1950s. “My mother was scared to death because they had little metal balustrades you could see right through and it looked like you could crash over the edge,” Maria Estevez says. “They were scary. My mum would close her eyes when we crossed the bridge.” Today the metal fencing has been replaced by concrete Jersey barriers but little else has changed on the Governor Harry W Nice Memorial Bridge since it opened in 1940, two years after President Franklin Roosevelt broke ground. Back then it was expected to carry 136,000 vehicles a year from southern Maryland to Virginia, but by 1964 traffic had reached 3.2m vehicles; today it stands at 6.5m. The 1.7-mile truss bridge cannot cope. It remains very narrow – just one worn, somewhat bumpy lane in either direction – and has an unnervingly steep climb and descent at its centre to allow tall boats to traverse the Potomac river. Tailbacks of four miles are common during the summer. “We all have a love-hate relationship with the bridge because of the back-ups,” added Estevez, 73, a secretary. “I have waited for two hours on a Friday night.” There are plans for a $765m replacement – with two lanes in each direction and a bicycle and pedestrian path – to open in 2023. Until then, the Harry W Nice bridge will remain one more New Deal relic in a country where, if all structurally deficient bridges were laid end to end, they would stretch halfway from New York to Los Angeles. Airports, bridges, dams, levees, pipes, railways, roads and waterworks last year earned a D+ grade on the American Society of Civil Engineers’ infrastructure report card. The “shining city upon a hill” is rotting from within. It is a story of Washington paralysis and the dogma of low taxes, of structural bias around class and race, of a private-sector, car-centred philosophy triumphing over state-subsidised public transport. It is also about waning American power, a retreat from the mid-20th-century idealism that built transcontinental railways, state highways and electrical grids that were the envy of the world. The failure to think big is something that Donald Trump, the self-declared “builder president”, is promising to fix. Trump says a long-awaited programme will be trailed in his first State of the Union address on Tuesday, with the full plan to be released a week or two later. He told a gathering of city mayors at the White House on Wednesday: “We’re also working to rebuild our crumbling infrastructure by stimulating a $1tn investment, and that will actually, probably, end up being about $1.7tn.” But the administration is expected to ask Congress for only $200bn in federal spending on infrastructure in the hope of encouraging state, city and private financing to provide the rest. The bill is also likely to curtail environmental reviews and community consultation, make it easier to build highways and allow for more road tolls. None of this is likely to please Democrats. It will also probably be greeted with a shrug in cities such as Baltimore, the biggest city in Maryland, 80 miles north of the Harry W Nice Memorial Bridge. To drive along North Avenue, a main thoroughfare running from east to west, is to run the gauntlet of divots and humps left by heavy buses and trucks pounding the asphalt in the summer heat. The road is a craggy patchwork where pipes have been dug up but then not properly repaved and where the outlines of long unused streetcar tracks are re-emerging. Street kerbs are cracked or collapsed while traffic lights dangle from overhead cables and sway in the wind. In 2014, East 26th Street collapsed in heavy rain, washing away cars. The 101-year-old Hanover Street Bridge is notoriously riddled with potholes. Trains linking New York and Washington are forced to slow down when they pass through the major bottleneck underneath the city that is the Baltimore and Potomac tunnel, which opened in 1873. And with water pipes more than a century old, Baltimore was ill prepared for a cold snap in early January. When resident Becca Cornfeld, 40, tried to take a shower, the tap was empty and she went outside to find water gushing. She called the city and a plumber but went nearly a week without water. In the meantime, Cornfeld, her husband and two children, 10 and seven, were forced to shower at their neighbours’ house or at the local YMCA. Eventually they had to pay $2,200 for new mains. Baltimore’s water system is “failing”, she said. “It’s an old city. I don’t think this is an unusual circumstance. I don’t think we were alone that week.” When Cornfeld, a social worker, tried calling the city helpline, she joined a queue behind more than 20 people already on hold. “It was clearly a widespread issue during the cold in that the city is in no way prepared for this – which is strange.” By 12 January, the Baltimore Sun newspaper reported, the city had a backlog of 132 broken mains, 1,243 customers complaining of no water, and 2,017 reports of water leaks. Several schools were forced to close, especially after parents tweeted photos of pupils huddled in classrooms wearing winter coats because the heating had broken down. Stewart Watson, an artist whose son was among those sent home, said: “They couldn’t think, let alone learn anything, so the school was shut down.” Watson, 49, recalled how a sinkhole on her street and a water mains breakage took the city’s overstretched utility services 10 days to fix. “We’re in a system where we don’t deal with stuff when it’s broken,” she added. “We don’t upgrade things until it’s a problem.” This majority African American, staunchly Democratic city feels increasingly neglected by the Trump administration, the Republican Congress and Maryland’s Republican governor, Larry Hogan. In 2015 Hogan cancelled the $2.9bn red line underground railway project, which would have served low-income black communities and created thousands of jobs in the city, and diverted the funds to road projects in largely white, rural parts of the state. As Baltimore’s crime rate soars, sucking up half a billion dollars for policing that otherwise might be spent on infrastructure, and its population declines, the city is caught in a downward spiral. Michael Olesker, an author and former Baltimore Sun columnist, said: “There are neighbourhoods that are just falling apart. We are hungry for some kind of federal assistance. We’ve got roads and bridges and tracks that are in serious disrepair. You drive over potholes that are the size of lunar craters. “Now with Donald Trump in the White House it looks like we’re going to get less help than we’re accustomed to. Our worry now is: are we going to become a third world city as we get less help from the federal government?” Liz Cornish, executive director of Bikemore, an organisation advocating livable streets in Baltimore, said: “What you experience is probably one of the most beautiful historic cities in America coupled with decades and decades of disinvestment. A lot of it was rooted in American racism. When Washington DC put in its Metro system there was supposed to be an equivalent in Baltimore; ultimately a decision was made on the federal level to fund one and not the other.” America took a wrong turn half a century ago, Cornish believes, by favouring cars and “big oil” over public buses, trains and trams. “The idea of public transportation wasn’t classist then,” she said. “But Americans came to believe the car was king and the system of highways leveled neighbourhoods, particularly historic communities of immigrants and African Americans. “The thing that would change people’s lives in Baltimore is high-quality, affordable public transportation. It changes neighbourhoods so car ownership is not a necessity. We estimate it costs $8,500 a year to maintain a car so if you had the opportunity to have a walkable neighbourhood or to take public transportation, that would make a big difference to each individual’s life.” Baltimore is far from alone. The American Society of Civil Engineers gave the country’s roads a D grade, finding they are “often crowded, frequently in poor condition, chronically underfunded, and are becoming more dangerous”. More than two out of every five miles of urban interstates are congested and traffic delays cost the country $160bn in wasted time and fuel in 2014. The report also found that nearly one in 10 bridges is structurally deficient, with an average of 188m trips across a structurally deficient bridge each day. Ray LaHood, who served as Barack Obama’s transportation secretary from 2009 until 2013, describes America as “one big pothole” and compares its infrastructure to “some third world countries”. He said: “The problem is Congress is not willing to come up with the billions of dollars that is necessary to fix up America’s infrastructure. So my feeling is if America is really going to make progress there has to be very, very strong leadership from the White House. “If you look at the train systems in Europe and Asia, it’s some of the best infrastructure anywhere in the world because the national government has provided the leadership and the funding to make it a model for the world, and that has not happened in America. So many people are counting on President Trump and the White House to put forth not only a bold plan but a bold funding plan to pay for America’s crumbling infrastructure.” City mayors, state governors, congressional Democrats and Republicans, business leaders and trade unions have been demanding such a plan for decades only to run into the gridlock that has come to characterise Capitol Hill. Conservatives, in particular, have an aversion to big government that militates against investment in big projects or public transport. As a result, America spends significantly less of a share of its GDP on infrastructure than half a century ago; its contribution to water infrastructure capital spending dropped from 63% in 1977 to 9% in 2014. That year John Boehner, then the House speaker, admitted: “We’ve got to find a funding mechanism to fund our infrastructure needs. And so the hunt has been under way for the last year and half to find a funding source. I wish I could report we’ve found it, but we haven’t.” It did not used to be this way. In 1956 President Dwight Eisenhower signed the Federal-Aid Highway Act, ushering in what has been called the greatest public works project in history. Half of the interstate system was open by the end of 1966 and it was essentially complete by the 1980s. It is now 46,876 miles long. Eisenhower said: “More than any single action by the government since the end of the war, this one would change the face of America.” The federal government paid 90% of the cost with the help of a gas tax; states paid the other 10%. By contrast, Trump is proposing to providing grants to cover up to 20% of a project’s costs, according to a White House document leaked this week, leaving states, localities and private investors to find the other 80%. Part of the explanation is that the gas tax has not been raised since 1993, when Bill Clinton was still in the White House. It remains the principal funder of infrastructure yet is ever more inadequate to keep up with inflation or the growing to do list. Steve Davis, spokesman for the policy organisation Transportation for America, said: “Everybody wants greater investment in infrastructure and nobody wants to pay for it. According to the leaders in charge, there’s never been a good time to increase the gas tax. They see it as political suicide. According to our research, most people don’t know what the gas tax is.” Anti-tax conservatives have opposed it for ideological reasons and because it is seen as a vote-loser in their rural strongholds, while some on the left warn that a higher gas tax will penalise those with older, less fuel-efficient cars, especially where public transport options are limited. LaHood, who spent 14 years in Congress, has recommended an increase in the gas tax of 10 cents a gallon linked to the cost of living. He noted: “Twenty-five states on their own in the last three years have raised their own gas tax and not one politician has been thrown out of office. And these are very conservative states. My point to Congress is: you should not be afraid to raise the gas tax because the American people know that their infrastructure is crumbling. All they have to do is ride on a train, ride on the roadways and cross these bridges that are structurally deficient and know that America’s infrastructure needs repair.” LaHood, now a co-chair of the bipartisan coalition Building America’s Future, added: “You know one time a year ago President Trump talked about raising the gas tax and, in the discussions I’ve had with the people in the Trump administration, they tell me there’s a huge debate going on within the administration about the funding.” Philip Howard, a lawyer who has taken part in infrastructure advisory discussions at the White House, said infrastructure has been held back by the ineffectiveness of American politics. “For a first world nation, we are in pathetic shape,” he said. “Just look out of the window when you’re on a train: it’s 19th-century infrastructure; it’s like taking a tour of the industrial age. “As a society, we’ve effectively been disinvesting in what makes society work well. We’ve been living off the infrastructure built by our grandparents and great-grandparents. The Republicans have the pledge of no new taxes when in fact it does not grow on trees. The Republicans have been unwilling to fund it.” Howard, an advocate of government simplification, welcomed Trump’s plans to streamline procedures so that no project takes more than two years to get the go-ahead. “The processes by which we give permits for infrastructure are so slow and balkanised so that they double the cost through delays and other things.” Come Tuesday’s State of the Union address, Howard will be among millions listening to find out if Trump can stop the decay and recapture something of the mid-20th-century vision that saw America put faith in government, reshape its landscape and ultimately send a man to the moon. To find out if he can build bridges as well as walls."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"fashion/2018/jan/22/ralph-russo-unveils-a-fairytale-for-paris-fashion-week","type":"article","sectionId":"fashion","sectionName":"Fashion","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-22T19:57:26Z","webTitle":"Ralph & Russo unveils a fairytale for Paris fashion week","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2018/jan/22/ralph-russo-unveils-a-fairytale-for-paris-fashion-week","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/fashion/2018/jan/22/ralph-russo-unveils-a-fairytale-for-paris-fashion-week","fields":{"headline":"Ralph & Russo unveils a fairytale for Paris fashion week","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The aesthetic of Ralph &amp; Russo, the only extant British haute couture house, can be summed up as dresses in which to marry a prince. So while Kylie Minogue sat front row between the supermodels Karlie Kloss and Natalia Vodianova, and despite the actors Lupita Nyong’o, Tracee Ellis Ross and Allison Williams wearing the label on the red carpet at the Screen Actors Guild on Sunday evening, the most significant name currently linked with the brand belonged to a certain Meghan Markle, who was nowhere to be seen. Perhaps Markle, who sparked rumours of a Ralph &amp; Russo wedding dress when she chose the brand for her official engagement photo, is one of the brand’s 1.7 million social media followers. If so, she will have seen the show’s finale, an off-white duchess satin gown with a draped bodice, long train encrusted with leaves of Swarovski crystals and lace veil embroidered with silk petals. Ralph &amp; Russo is sole heir to the grand British couture tradition of Hardy Amies and Norman Hartnell. The designers Tamara Ralph and Michael Russo moved from their native Australia to London, where the business has been one of British fashion’s biggest success stories since it opened in 2007. They now employ more than 400 people, with a townhouse in Mayfair for client fittings and a large atelier where the embroidery department alone is 30-strong. Angelina Jolie wore a Ralph &amp; Russo suit to Buckingham Palace when she was presented with her honorary damehood by the Queen. Its many devoted clients desire fairytale, so that was exactly what the Paris show delivered: dreamy fantasies in frothy mint organza, blush pink silk gazar and ice blue Chantilly lace, and bombshell gowns in black velvet and metallic satin. There is no pandering to practical details at Ralph &amp; Russo. Sleeves are largely absent, unless made from fine-spun silk fringing, and the few coats to be found are fashioned from ostrich feathers, or sheer tulle. At Christian Dior, spiritual home of modern designer feminism, the mood took a surreal turn – literally towards surrealism. It is 18 months (a lifetime in fashion) since Maria Grazia Chiuri made her debut as Dior’s first ever female designer with those We Should All Be Feminists T-shirts, in which her early adoption of activist-chic has boosted Dior’s profile among consumers, and its profits. Above a black-and-white chequered catwalk which nodded to Man Ray’s chessboard, outsize plastercasts of disembodied noses and eyes paid lip service to Magritte and Dali. Having used the feminist art critic Linda Nochlin’s essay title, Why Have There Been No Great Women Artists? as a T-shirt slogan last year, Grazia Chiuri has dug deeper into the question with consecutive collections inspired by female Surrealist artists – first Lucy Schwob, and now Leonor Fini, an Argentinian painter who held her first Paris exhibition in Dior’s atelier in the 1930s. This show’s looks were given names like Vertigo, Psychose, Illusion, but while Fini and the surrealists set the mood music, the silhouette was distinctively that which Grazia Chiuri has established for Dior. A slim balletic torso with the simple, functional elegance of a leotard gives way to a soft, A-line midi-length hem. The shape was consistent through daywear (long belted coats) and separates (simple, sheer blouse and skirt) and into eveningwear (a lingerie-styled gown.) Details borrowed from the Schiaparelli playbook: British milliner Stephen Jones added veils dotted with sparkling flies; miniature birdcages hung from ears; and black fishnet stockings were worn over, rather than under, strappy gold sandals."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"stage/2018/jan/24/mikhail-durnenkov-russia-the-war-has-not-yet-started","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-24T10:30:02Z","webTitle":"Mikhail Durnenkov: the Russian writer capturing the everyday dread of modern life","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/jan/24/mikhail-durnenkov-russia-the-war-has-not-yet-started","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2018/jan/24/mikhail-durnenkov-russia-the-war-has-not-yet-started","fields":{"headline":"Mikhail Durnenkov: the Russian writer capturing the everyday dread of modern life","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"If you want to understand modern Russia – or modern life in general – consider Mikhail Durnenkov’s The War Has Not Yet Started. Crackling with wit and anxiety, casual in how it portrays horror, the play evokes the same kind of dread I experience when I read Donald Trump’s tweets – whether they threaten war with North Korea or taunt the courts and the free press. It’s the same cold feeling you get in the pit of your stomach when you ask yourself, “Who’s flying this plane?” and no obvious or comforting answer is forthcoming. On the surface, the 12 parables that make up the play are distinctly Russian, focusing on everything from the angry debate over the value of street protests to the constant threat of terror attacks, from Russia’s undeclared war with Ukraine to the awful psychological effects of propaganda on state television. Yet Durnenkov’s characters are also universal in their shimmering frailties and their tendency to betray one another and, ultimately, themselves. The fabric that holds society and family together is shown by Durnenkov to be gossamer and close to ripping. It’s not just a country on the brink of war here; it’s every individual, and the violent spark can arise from any random interaction. The characters are like pieces of flint, striking against each other, getting closer and closer to a point of no return. Durnenkov was born in the Amur region of Russia and moved to the manufacturing city of Tolyatti in 1995. He studied engineering and had various jobs – including security guard and television journalist – before turning to acting, and eventually, writing plays. In his early work, Durnenkov was terrifically funny and effortlessly captured the vernacular of modern, urban-dwelling Russians. He and his older brother, Vyacheslav, are a staple of the Russian theatre scene. We’ve crossed paths often, and members of my family have collaborated with both Durnenkovs. One of my favourite early plays of Mikhail’s is The Blue Plumber, which recalls his days of working as a plumber and features everything from rich profanity to haikus and meditations on labour. Although I am familiar with most of Durnenkov’s well-known plays, such as The Simple Way to Give Up Smoking and Junk, I have to admit that The War Has Not Yet Started caught me off-guard. I’m used to his offhand, nearly weightless language, but I am not quite used to the manic sense of dread his newer work evoked in me. It was written about the feelings one has in the lead-up to a great and terrible war. So how does he see Russia’s future? “In a historical sense, we’re still going around in circles,” he says. “We jump from one circle to the next suddenly, with a push, when the possibilities of the previous circle are completely exhausted. I still see a reserve of stability in the system we’re spinning in. But maybe this stability is deceptive and the system has rotted from the inside out?” The symbols of that rot are evident in the play whenever it zeroes in on the particulars of daily life: lights flicker, news channels hypnotise us with vividly elaborate lies, online shopping offers a brief escape from the aggression slowly building in society. For Durnenkov, political change is welcome yet foreboding. “I don’t want to spend my life on the sisyphean task of living in a totalitarian system,” he told me. “But a change, a revolution and so on, scares me. Because I have a child, and I’m scared for him, if not for myself.” The Russian theatre world has never been particularly immune from the grinding mechanisms of power, but this fact is especially clear today, with popular theatre director Kirill Serebrennikov accused of fraud alongside his colleagues, all of them facing the possibility of lengthy sentences in a case that many believe is meant to intimidate the whole of the artistic community. In its own roundabout, chillingly mundane and bureaucratised manner, power in Russia continually sends artists (and most everyone else) a message: that nobody is safe, you can be yanked out of your normal existence at any moment, so it’s best not get too comfortable. This situation, coupled with the constant threat of armed conflict, is exhausting, and in Durnenkov’s work the exhaustion weighs on people so heavily that it compresses them into pared-down, extreme versions of themselves. Today, in societies grappling with newfound uncertainty – whether in the guise of Brexit or the election of an erratic demagogue to the office of president – the intensity of the characters’ existence will be painfully familiar. The drivers of uncertainty may be political, but, as Durnenkov shows us, what matters most are the chambers of darkness within us that burst open under pressure exerted by current events. When it feels as if you can’t change the world, all that matters is what you do with your inner darkness. “I’ll remember why we shouldn’t kill him. It’s some … really simple word. It means … It’s a concept … Please, give me a bit of time, and I’ll remember it,” an abused wife tells a lover who is hellbent on getting rid of her awful husband. Will she remember? Will the husband die anyway? Should he die? The dilemma faced by Durnenkov’s character is ultimately one that audience members will have to resolve alone, in quiet moments of contemplation, when they are forced to face themselves. The War Has Not Yet Started is at Southwark Playhouse, London, until 10 February.

It was a wonderfully intelligent performance, which carefully probed the deeper resonances of a work that some still perceive as flippant. Aimard dazzled with his dexterity in the outer movements, but the strikingly weighty tone he adopted for the adagio exposed a streak of dark, troubling melancholy beneath the wistful surface poise. Heras-Casado, meanwhile, was alert to every emotional and stylistic shift, from jazzy sleaze to neo-classical elegance and rigour. His understanding of the ambiguities in Ravel’s music became even more apparent in his outstanding interpretation of Ma Mère L’Oye. Fairytales depend on menace as well as magic, and here we were aware of the incipient sense of danger that lurks beneath Ravel’s depictions of Petit Poucet, lost in the forest, and the insistent if tender attentions paid to Beauty by the Beast. The concert also marked the start of this year’s Debussy centenary with performances of Prélude à l’Après-midi d’un Faune and La Mer. Faune was beautiful, if on the cool side. La Mer, however, was magnificent, the mystery and awe of the opening immaculately judged, the final Dialogue du Vent et de la Mer by turns thrillingly turbulent and majestic. The playing was ravishing throughout. • On Radio 3 on 5 February, then on BBC iPlayer for 30 days."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"environment/2018/jan/24/uk-opposes-strong-eu-recycling-targets-despite-plastics-pledge","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-24T06:01:22Z","webTitle":"UK opposes strong EU recycling targets despite plastics pledge","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jan/24/uk-opposes-strong-eu-recycling-targets-despite-plastics-pledge","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/jan/24/uk-opposes-strong-eu-recycling-targets-despite-plastics-pledge","fields":{"headline":"UK opposes strong EU recycling targets despite plastics pledge","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The UK government is opposing strong new recycling targets across the EU despite its recent pledge to develop “ambitious new future targets and milestones”, confidential documents have revealed. A 25-year environment plan was launched earlier in January by the prime minister, Theresa May, who particularly focused on cutting plastic pollution. The plan, aimed partly at wooing younger voters, says “recycling plastics is critical”. A target to recycle 65% of urban waste by 2035 was agreed by the European council and parliament in December and now awaits a vote of approval by member states. But the UK’s opposition is revealed in a record of a subsequent briefing for EU ambassadors, obtained by Greenpeace’s Unearthed team and seen by the Guardian. “The UK cannot support a binding target of 65% for 2035,” said the record, compiled by officials from one member state and confirmed by others. Furthermore, the UK said its opposition meant it would not support the overall waste agreement. The recycling target had already been watered down from the 70% by 2030 initially sought by the European parliament. The UK’s own environment officials estimated that meeting ambitious recycling targets would bring benefits totalling billions of pounds, according to a July 2017 internal presentation, also obtained by Greenpeace. It suggested a 65% target by 2030 would save almost £10bn over a decade in waste sector, greenhouse gas and social costs. “This Conservative government must be judged on what they do, not on what they say,” said Sue Hayman, shadow environment secretary. “It comes as no surprise that the government are trying to scupper progress on recycling behind the scenes. “Recycling rates have stagnated on this government’s watch and we are way behind meeting our national targets. [Environment secretary] Michael Gove needs to clarify the government’s position on this matter without delay.” The UK is currently set to miss its existing target of 50% recycling by 2020, with the recycling rate stalled at 44% over the last few years, though it was just 11% in 2000. Louise Edge, at Greenpeace UK, said: “It seems the government has been vocally backing ambitious recycling targets in Westminster while quietly opposing them in Brussels. If Gove wants to avoid accusations of hypocrisy, he should make sure his department speaks with one voice on both sides of the Channel.” A spokesman for the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) said: “The government will make a decision on its vote following close scrutiny of the proposals, which are still provisional.” “Our recycling rates are rising, less waste is now sent to landfill and separate food waste collections are increasing, but as set out in the Clean Growth strategy and 25-year environment plan, we are working with industry to improve the nation’s recycling rates further,” he said. Officials said it was too early to tell to what extent the UK will be required to implement new recycling targets, but that leaving the EU gives an opportunity to strengthen environmental standards. The government argues that recycling targets must be achievable and reflect the environmental impact of different materials. Environment minister Thérèse Coffey said in October that binding recycling targets based on weight alone could lead to “perverse outcomes”, with, for example, heavy garden waste prioritised over plastic. However, Dr Dominic Hogg, chairman of Eunomia environmental consultancy, said unless ministers had a good, detailed alternative plan, opposing the EU target looked like “kicking the issue into the long grass”. The internal presentation from Defra said the UK could meet a 55% target with the existing recycling system, but that “very high targets would likely require significant changes to households’ behaviour and businesses operations”. Hogg said if such changes were needed, they should be implemented. He said the decision by China to stop taking foreign waste was another factor: “Hopefully it is a bit of a wake-up call for us. It’s another good reason to change what we are doing reasonably profoundly.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2018/jan/28/sheku-kanneh-mason-inspiration-cd-review-les-talens-lyriques-alceste-van-mechelen-clerambault","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-28T08:00:13Z","webTitle":"Home listening: Sheku Kanneh-Mason, French baroque and Private Passions","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/jan/28/sheku-kanneh-mason-inspiration-cd-review-les-talens-lyriques-alceste-van-mechelen-clerambault","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/jan/28/sheku-kanneh-mason-inspiration-cd-review-les-talens-lyriques-alceste-van-mechelen-clerambault","fields":{"headline":"Home listening: Sheku Kanneh-Mason, French baroque and Private Passions","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"• Every generation needs inspiring role models for entering the world of classical music.

Nicholas Hytner’s Bridge theatre will announce on Wednesday that it has secured the first stage rights for the 2016 novel. My Name is Lucy Barton is about a difficult reunion between a daughter living in Manhattan and her mother, who makes her first ever plane trip from rural Illinois to be at her side. The adaptation by Rona Munro takes the form of a monologue, and will be directed by Richard Eyre, who revealed Strout had met Linney and said were her book to be dramatised “there would be nobody better than Laura”. Linney is a hugely respected actor of stage, TV and film. She has recently starred in the Netflix’s crime drama Ozark, and has been nominated for an Oscar three times and has won three Emmys. For some, she will always be remembered as Mary Ann Singleton in the TV adaptations of Armistead Maupin’s Tales of the City. Eyre directed Linney in the 2002 Broadway revival of The Crucible and has known her for 25 years. “There is something very plausible about Laura,” he said. “She is self-effacing and has a brilliant knack of playing ordinary people and gifting them with extraordinary qualities. “The perfect example of this is her performance in Ozark … there’s nothing phoney about her. Everything she does is unimpeachably honest.” It was Hytner who first came up with the idea of putting the novel on stage and Eyre was already a fan. He said it was an “extraordinary” and “wonderfully eloquent” novel, adding that its themes of loneliness, alienation and class may have more resonate more in the class-obsessed UK than the US. My Name is Lucy Barton will have a three-week run at the 900-seat theatre, which Hytner and Nick Starr set up after they left the National Theatre. Promising “bold, popular” theatre, the purposed-built venue near City Hall opened last October with a new Richard Bean and Clive Coleman play Young Marx followed by a new production of Julius Caesar, starring Ben Whishaw, Michelle Fairley and David Morrissey, and has its opening night next week. • My Name is Lucy Barton is at the Bridge Theatre, London, 2-23 June."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2018/jan/27/saturdays-best-tv-darcey-bussell-dance-beyond-boundaries-all-together-now","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-27T06:00:42Z","webTitle":"Saturday’s best TV: Darcey Bussell: Dance Beyond Boundaries; All Together Now","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/jan/27/saturdays-best-tv-darcey-bussell-dance-beyond-boundaries-all-together-now","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2018/jan/27/saturdays-best-tv-darcey-bussell-dance-beyond-boundaries-all-together-now","fields":{"headline":"Saturday’s best TV: Darcey Bussell: Dance Beyond Boundaries; All Together Now","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Darcey Bussell: Dance Beyond Boundaries 10pm, BBC Two Ballerina Darcey Bussell is the Strictly Come Dancing judge who’s always said that tap was her first love.

Specialists at King’s College hospital in London say giving further intensive care treatment to Isaiah Haastrup is “futile” and not in his best interests. They say the infant is profoundly brain-damaged, cannot move or breathe without assistance, is connected to a ventilation machine, may be experiencing pain and demonstrates no “purposeful” responses. His mother, Takesha Thomas, said Isaiah “definitely has an emotional connection to me”. She told the high court in London that she seen him responding slowly through eye opening when she read to him, when she cuddled him and bathed him. “When I call his name, I say: ‘Isaiah it’s mummy,’ he will also give me a response by opening his eyes,” she said. Thomas and Isaiah’s father, Lanre Haastrup, a lawyer, both 36, from London, want life support treatment to continue in the hope they can bring Isaiah home, where he would require 24-hour intensive care. The court had heard he had “catastrophic” brain damage owing to oxygen deprivation at birth. Asked by her barrister, Ian Wise QC, about doctors who believed Isaiah’s quality of life was so poor that life support should be withdrawn, Thomas told the family court hearing: “I don’t know how they come to that conclusion. I see a child that is injured. He needs love. He needs care, and I have it and can give it. “For them [the doctors] to say it’s so poor it’s not worth living, that’s not right. That’s not their decision to make.” Thomas said she did not agree with medical specialists who said her son was unresponsive. “I’ve learned how he responds and the way he responds.” She added: “I am a good mother, and I can offer him love and with the right training I can help Isaiah in whatever way that I can”. Speaking of her Christian faith, Thomas said it was God’s decision who lived and died. “I think everybody deserves the chance to live.” Asked by her lawyer whether he son had a life worth preserving, she said: “Yes, I do,.” Doctors and nurses only came to assess Isaiah “for two minutes and then they are gone”, she said. “I spend a lot more time with him.” Thomas said the medics dismissed her. There was “mistrust” between the parents and hospital staff, the judge heard. “The more I say to them that I have seen Isaiah open his eyes, they will dismiss it and say it’s not. They are trying to say I’m not right,” Thomas said. Cross-examined by Isaiah’s father, who is representing himself, Thomas said she had seen Isaiah move his head, blink, move his thumb and she could tell he really enjoyed being rocked and being in a baby bouncer. She agreed their son was brain-damaged, but said: “One of the things I live by is if you give a child love it will thrive.” She also believed Isaiah cried, as his tongue quivered. However, an expert medical witness said there was often “a mismatch between what parents perceive and what carers perceive to be purposeful responses.” During his examination of Isaiah, he “did not see any objective evidence that he is aware”. Movement did not equal purposeful response, and jaw-clenching and muscle-stiffening could be due to severe dystonia, which caused painful cramps, he said. The “wealth of evidence” from the medical experts treating Isaiah concurred with his own opinion that there was “no purposeful responses evident to us when we have examined him”.

But turning the tide will require a herculean effort. The US shale gas boom means that the price of feedstock for the plastic industry has plummeted. Major chemical corporations have invested $180bn in new production facilities to come on stream in the next 10 years, increasing global output by 40%. If we don’t want it to flow our way, we need to stand firm. I’ve just returned from Penzance, designated the UK’s first plastic-free town by Surfers Against Sewage. This weekend it hosted residents from Aberporth, west Wales, with aspirations to follow suit; shop and cafe owners discussed the best solutions for denting the UK’s annual 3.7m-tonne plastic habit (2.2m of that being packaging). It was an impressive display of what we might refer to as the Dunkirk spirit. Certainly some of the solutions now on the table are redolent of wartime frugality. Some date back even further. By the end of the year, we may be taking our energy drinks in amphoras. For now, here are some of the nostalgia-tinted front-runners in the charge to go plastic-free. Glass milk bottles The first deliveries of milk in glass bottles took place at the end of the 19th century, driven by a rather literal desire for transparency: the customer could see straight away that their milk contained no flotsam or jetsam. But even now we take that as a given, there is plenty to love eco-wise about glass milk bottles. Once rinsed and returned to the doorstep by the consumer, they are collected as part of the morning delivery, taken to a local bottling plant and sanitised, ready to go again. Each glass bottle is used an average of 13 times before being recycled. The triumph here is in the speed of the turnaround. The plastics industry might argue that PET and HDPE – common types of plastic for milk containers – can be collected and successfully recycled into food-grade material. But in practice plastic recycling often falls short. Since China’s new recycling laws came into effect at the start of the year, much foreign waste is being refused. In the UK, domestic capacity for recycling is tiny. According to Diary UK, doorstep deliveries have risen to near to a million a day, up from 800,000 two years ago. This could be the biggest comeback since Lazarus. Laundry soap The last time laundry soap was hot was in the 1920s. Popped into the script of serial radio dramas, it would be liberally referenced by a character (female of course), and lo, the soap opera was born. A revival would spell the end for the moulded mixed-plastic bottles and tubs that laundry detergent relies on. As Rinso is more likely to be found in a museum than a supermarket, try Sapindus soap nuts, produced by a shrub related to the lychee. The real enthusiast can buy a 5kg sack, which should keep you going for a while. Copper surfaces In the war against plastic, we’ll soon have picked the low-hanging fruits. But when it comes to the serious stuff, like hospital apparatus and infrastructure, we may need a total material shift. So here’s one that was prized by the Aztecs: copper. Medical researchers working on infection reduction report copper to be hugely effective at killing superbugs. In one study, six items in hospital wards, including surfaces and fittings, were swapped from plastic to copper. There was a 58% reduction in hospital-acquired infections. Water fountains Michael Gove and Sadiq Khan have been among those to signal their commitment to water fountains in the fight against single-use plastic water bottles (Britons use 7.7bn a year, and fewer than half are recycled). They are an old idea, but don’t necessarily expect them to be in Victorian repro style when they finally arrive. The next-generation water fountains are hands-free bottle-filling stations, ergonomically fashioned to fit water bottles and with sensors that automatically stop the flow of water when the bottle is full. Can’t wait! Cloth nappies Every day, 8m disposable nappies are shovelled into the UK’s landfill. That is where – whatever it says on the pack – they will fester for hundreds of years. Some claim to be biodegradable – but that requires oxygen, and there’s not much of that under the ground. The words “cloth nappy” conjure visions of terry squares and oversized pins. But today’s nappy systems offer an assortment of washable and reusable options, made from materials such as bamboo and hemp. There are also “nappy libraries”, which save you the initial outlay, and collection services. About 2.7kg of raw materials are used in a full-time set of reusable nappies, as opposed to 120kg if a child is in disposables.

Exiled from his country for 30 years, he was also a powerful singer and songwriter and an angry political voice, using his music and live performances to attack the apartheid regime that had banished him from his homeland. Even when he had returned to the country of his birth under the leadership of Nelson Mandela, after having lived and worked in the US and in Botswana, Masekela continued to comment fearlessly on political events in South Africa and around the world, enjoying his status as an international celebrity, playing for presidents and royalty and concert audiences, and often collaborating with other musical greats. He was born in Kwa-Guqa township, Witbank, a coal mining settlement near Johannesburg. His father, Thomas, was a health inspector and sculptor, and his mother, Pauline (nee Bowers), was a social worker, officially classified as “coloured” in apartheid-era South Africa as she had a Scottish father. Hugh was one of four children in a politically conscious family; his younger sister, Barbara, would eventually become head of the African National Congress’s department of arts and culture. The children were raised by their grandmother, Johanna, and Hugh was always surrounded by music. At the age of four he was a pageboy at the wedding of his Aunt Lily, and was fascinated by the celebrity wedding band, the Jazz Maniacs, and their trumpeter Drakes Mbau. Hugh was given his own instrument when he was 14. He was then a pupil at St Peter’s, a remarkable secondary school for black children that became a centre for opponents of apartheid before being closed by the authorities. The staff included Oliver Tambo, later leader of the ANC, and Trevor Huddleston, later Archbishop Huddleston, president of the British Anti-Apartheid Movement. The young Masekela was always in trouble. “I was one of the worst delinquents”, he once told me, “always fighting with the teachers or going into town stealing.” He was sent to see Huddleston because “you’d be sent to him when everything else had failed”. Masekela had wanted a trumpet, he said, after seeing the 1950 film Young Man With a Horn, and recalled that he told the priest: “If I can get a trumpet I won’t bother anyone one any more.” Huddleston managed to raise £15 (“a lot of money in those days”) to buy the instrument, found a black Salvation Army trumpeter to teach Masekela, “and then he sat outside the school making hideous noises”. Other pupils naturally wanted instruments as well, and the Huddleston Jazz Band was born. They wore black trousers and grey silk shirts, and played American rather than African music. Along with Masekela, the band featured the trombonist Jonas Gwangwa, who would also become a star. Huddleston continued to help Masekela even after the priest had left the school and South Africa. In 1956, when he was in the US publicising his book Naught for Your Comfort, he told Masekela’s story to a journalist, who suggested that it might interest Louis Armstrong, the best known trumpeter of the day. Armstrong was fascinated and handed Huddleston one of his horns to give to Masekela. “I sent it straight to South Africa, and I have a wonderful picture of Hugh jumping for joy,” said Huddleston. Masekela’s skills as a trumpeter increased and so did his fame. In the 1950s he played at fundraising events for the ANC in the years before it was banned, with Mandela among those who came to watch. He explored South African styles and avidly followed developments in the American jazz scene as he developed his distinctive Afro-jazz sound. He joined Abdullah Ibrahim (then known as Dollar Brand) and Gwangwa in the Jazz Epistles, who in 1959 recorded the first album by a South African jazz band, Jazz Epistle Verse 1. In the same year he teamed up with Gwangwa and others in the band for the adventurous hit musical King Kong. Billed as an “all-African jazz opera” its story of a boxer had an all-black cast and starred the country’s finest female singer, Miriam Makeba. Such an extraordinary flowering of black culture could not last long in the apartheid era. Makeba left the country and her citizenship was revoked because she had taken part in the anti-apartheid film Come Back Africa. In 1960, the year of the Sharpeville massacre and the banning of the ANC, Masekela also left. He was lucky to get out, he said, for his angry opposition to apartheid had already come to the attention of the authorities. He travelled first to London, where he was disappointed by the jazz scene, and then to New York, where, like Makeba, he was helped by the musician and activist Harry Belafonte. Masekela enrolled at the Manhattan School of Music and immersed himself in the city’s jazz scene, watching Miles Davis, John Coltrane and Thelonious Monk. He was advised by Dizzy Gillespie and Armstrong to develop his own, African style, and in 1963 released his debut album, Trumpet Africaine. In 1964 he married Makeba. Masekela’s angry political stance was not altered by his move to the US. He claimed that the South Africans passed information about him to the Americans, and that his phone was tapped in New York. He began to identify with the black power movement, and in 1966 played at the Watts festival on the anniversary of the riots in that black Los Angeles neighbourhood. In 1967, now living in California and having divorced Makeba after only two years of marriage, he played at the Monterey festival alongside Janis Joplin and the Who. The following year he released the single Grazing in the Grass, an instrumental produced by his friend Stewart Levine that became a massive hit, topping the US charts for three weeks. Masekela was awarded a gold disc, an extraordinary achievement for an African artist in the US. He became a celebrity with a house in Malibu and was befriended by stars including Peter Fonda and Dennis Hopper, but his record company found him increasingly hard to handle. The cover of his Emancipation of Masekela album (1966) showed him dressed like Abraham Lincoln and was boycotted by distributors in the American south. Later, he followed his easygoing hit single with a furious, experimental set that included songs about Vietnam and the plight of migrant workers in South Africa. His house was raided by the police and he was put on probation, avoiding a prison sentence on drug charges only because they had had no proper search warrant. Promoters and universities cancelled his bookings, but he continued to record powerful albums, collaborating with Gwangwa and another fine South African musician, Dudu Pukwana. After 12 years in exile he decided to go back to Africa to explore the music of countries he had never visited. He travelled across west Africa, from Guinea, where Makeba had moved with her new husband, Stokely Carmichael, and then to Zaire (now the Democratic Republic of the Congo). In 1973 he spent time in Kinshasa, meeting such musicians as the guitarist Franco, and went on to Liberia, Ghana, and Nigeria, where he stayed for a month with Fela Kuti. The rebellious Kuti introduced him to the Ghanaian band Hedzoleh Soundz, with whom he recorded and later toured in the US. He returned to Africa with Levine in 1974, when they put together the Zaire 74 concerts that preceded the Rumble in the Jungle boxing match in Kinshasa between Muhammad Ali and George Foreman. Angry disputes with the promoter Don King meant that the historic recordings of the African artists involved, including Franco and Makeba, were released only in 2017. Masekela kept travelling, but in 1980 he settled in Botswana, across the border from South Africa, where he lived for more than four years. A mobile studio was shipped to him from California and he recorded the album Technobush, which included the bestselling Don’t Go Lose It Baby. In 1986 he founded the Botswana International School of Music. By now he was rebuilding his following in the west, helped by growing interest in “world music” and African styles. In 1987 he and Makeba joined Paul Simon on the world tour promoting Simon’s massively successful album Graceland, which had been partly recorded with black musicians in South Africa, despite a UN cultural boycott. Masekela said he was backing Simon because Graceland was giving black South Africans global exposure. Other musicians disagreed, and when the Graceland tour reached London, protesters outside the Royal Albert Hall included Jerry Dammers and Billy Bragg. Inside, Masekela performed his rousing anti-apartheid anthem Bring Him Back Home (Nelson Mandela) and his song about migrant workers, Stimela. The following year he and Makeba again shared a stage in London – this time at the Nelson Mandela 70th Birthday Tribute at Wembley Stadium, an event that honoured the jailed South African leader and was broadcast to 67 countries. Masekela and Makeba performed Soweto Blues, which mourned the deaths of the many children killed by police during the 1976 Soweto uprising. Mandela was released in 1990, and with the ending of apartheid Masekela was able to return to South Africa after an absence of 30 years. Rather than retire, he threw himself into a series of new recordings and projects, and began to achieve the deserved status of an international celebrity. In 1996 he played for President Mandela and the Queen during Mandela’s state visit to Britain. He responded by dancing in the royal box. In 2010 he was the opening performer in the globally transmitted concert that kicked off the football World Cup finals in South Africa, and in 2012 he was reunited with Simon for a world tour celebrating the 25th anniversary of the Graceland project. This time there were no protests. Later that year he co-created the Songs of Migration jazz musical, which explored the music of South Africa, Nigeria and the American South and was staged around the world. Having issued more than 40 albums across his career, his final one was No Borders, in 2016. Among his many awards was South Africa’s highest, the Order of Ikhamanga. Masekela’s second marriage, to Chris Calloway, daughter of the jazz artist Cab Calloway, ended in divorce, as did his marriages to Jabu Mbatha and Elinam Cofie. He is survived by his son, Selema (also known as Sal), and daughter, Pula Twala, from other relationships, and by his sisters, Elaine and Barbara. • Hugh Ramapolo Masekela, musician and activist, born 4 April 1939; died 23 January 2018"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"technology/2018/feb/05/whatsapp-deleting-year-what-i-learned","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-05T07:00:19Z","webTitle":"I deleted WhatsApp for a year and here's what I learned","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/feb/05/whatsapp-deleting-year-what-i-learned","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2018/feb/05/whatsapp-deleting-year-what-i-learned","fields":{"headline":"I deleted WhatsApp for a year and here's what I learned","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"At the end of 2016, I sent a message to all my contacts: “After 31 December, I will not use WhatsApp any more. Instead, I will use Threema and Signal.” On New Year’s Eve, I closed my WhatsApp account and deleted the app from my phone. A few clicks later, I’d left all my family, friend and work groups, the school groups of my children and all my individual contacts. During the first minutes of 2017, I saw my friends typing on their phones while mine remained unusually silent. Suddenly I was not available anymore. It felt strange, uncomfortable, daring and good. My initial reasoning for such a drastic step had little to do with mindfulness or the want of being disconnected. I had installed WhatsApp in 2012 only because all my friends had it. By the end of 2016, the ubiquitous chat app started to send me annoying periodical reminders that it would stop working because the operating system of my beloved Nokia phone was no longer supported. The notifications made me wonder whether I should be using non-Facebook-owned alternatives and stop spending so much time on convenient but seldom meaningful chats. My defiance turned into a social experiment: I bought a smarter phone but uninstalled the application that, Facebook says, “one billion people around the world use … every day to stay in touch with their family and friends.” App-stinence My app-stinence had a promising start. Good friends sent text messages during New Years Day, called or responded to my calls. Instead of typing and recording messages, I returned to having actual conversations on the phone. My family and closest friends even installed one of the new non-Facebook messaging apps I had suggested, but suddenly I went from having 70 contacts to just 11 on my list. At the beginning, I often felt isolated and as if I had abandoned friends. Some contacts ebbed away, while I had to withstand the odd awkward look of disbelief and discontent from others when I explained that I did not use WhatsApp. After a few weeks, I noticed that I checked my phone less, did not scroll through my contact list to look for updated profile photos or send messages to people low on the conversation list just to say hello. I began to read more. But I also learned what it meant to miss out and not to be part of groups anymore. When I met friends, I needed to be updated about earlier group exchanges. I had to continually ask my wife about discussions in our kids’ school groups. She became understandably annoyed when forced to scroll through 94 new messages about the next birthday party or unexpected drama in the kindergarden of our two toddlers. No alternative In the ensuing discussions over the past year, it became more difficult than I thought to defend my step in terms of privacy and data stinginess. Those sympathetic with my decision often said that for work and social reasons they had no alternative. A colleague pointed out that he had no Facebook account, so the matching between accounts for advertising purposes was not possible. I knew that in Europe Facebook had been asked to “pause” the data sharing from WhatsApp. “But what happens with the data of up to one billion people that has been matched and shared already?” I asked. Facebook has not been obliged to delete this data. That we do not know precisely how this data is used to nudge and influence us without us noticing, worried me. “Anyways, I have nothing to hide,” several friends told me, hardly concealing their annoyance. The main question that I started to ask then was: why do we trust private companies more than we trust our governments? Our default position is to mistrust strangers and governments, but we trust convenient services without really knowing anything about them. We trust that private companies use our data to “improve our lives”, but we hardly reflect on where our lives are taken. Facebook paid $19bn for a company that has encrypted the contents of messages since 2016 and does not advertise. Clearly there is value in information about our habits and contacts, not just the content of our conversations. Companies create personal profiles with our data, but these profiles are about who we are, not about who we want to be. During the last year I realised how little we know and how little we care. We do not regard our data as a scarce and valuable commodity. Data seems like time; we just assume it is there. Over coffee I asked a friend: “If you had only one piece of personal data left to spend, how would you spend it?” He laughed, paused and then his phone whistled. I asked Tinder for my data.

The best known exponents, DAM, are still angry and active (their new single – a treatment of Jerusalem – begins with the Blake/Parry anthem and veers off into a furious rap reaction to US president Donald Trump’s policies) but the band likely to have more crossover appeal in the UK are their label colleagues 47Soul. Formed in Jordan five years ago, with members from Palestine and Jordan, they specialise in a style they call shamstep, a cheerfully wide-screen fusion of electronic hip-hop and traditional dabke dance music, mixed in with a dash of reggae, with sturdy melodies and chanting vocals from the four singers. They play synthesisers, drum machines, guitars and Arabic percussion, and are impressive live performers, as they proved at 2016’s Womad. This is high-energy music with a message that’s delivered in both Arabic and English. For the last two years, they have been living in London, and their first full-length album is a reflection on problems in the UK as well as the Middle East. Balfron Promise (Cooking Vinyl) refers in part to the Balfour Declaration, just over a century ago, and also to the Balfron Tower in Tower Hamlets, where they once lived, and from where longstanding tenants were evicted as the block was gentrified. So the theme of the driving, half-spoken Moved Around or the angry and chanting Mo Light is that of homelessness, on both a national and local level. But it’s delivered with confidence and good humour. The most unlikely song, Locked Up Shop, describes “getting a haircut before the riot starts”. Also out this month Kabantu are a Manchester acoustic quintet with an ambitious global range. Of the People (Humanati Records) includes songs from South Africa, India, Brazil, Bulgaria, Texas and Israel, inventively reworked by Katie Foster on violin, South African cellist Abel Selaocoe, and guitarist Ben Sayah, backed by double bass and percussion. They all sing as well as they play, switching from scat to powerful harmony work on Malaika. The African-Caribbean celebrity trio of Lokua Kanza, Gerald Toto and Richard Bona, AKA Toto Bona Lokua, are also impressive harmony singers, and their long-awaited reunion album Bondeko (No Format!) is a pleasantly classy, laid-back affair but would have been helped by more memorable songs. • The headline of this article was amended on 26 January 2018 because 47Soul’s album is called Balfron Promise, not Balfran Promise as an earlier version said, due to an error added in the editing process."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"politics/2018/jan/23/may-slaps-down-boris-johnson-over-nhs-funding-demands","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-23T19:40:03Z","webTitle":"Ministers rebuke Boris Johnson over NHS funding demands","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jan/23/may-slaps-down-boris-johnson-over-nhs-funding-demands","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/jan/23/may-slaps-down-boris-johnson-over-nhs-funding-demands","fields":{"headline":"Ministers rebuke Boris Johnson over NHS funding demands","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Boris Johnson has been accused by senior Conservative colleagues of playing into the hands of political opponents during a tetchy cabinet session that also brought a rebuke from Theresa May. The prime minister and almost all of her senior ministers took it in turns to stress the importance of keeping the high-level discussions confidential after being irritated by a series of pre-briefed news articles. Allies of Johnson were widely quoted revealing his plans to use the cabinet meeting to demand £100m extra a week, or £5bn a year, for the NHS after Brexit. Amber Rudd, the home secretary, took the most direct approach as she stressed the importance of trust between those seated at the cabinet table, according to one person present. “I’m talking to you, foreign secretary,” she reportedly said. May introduced the session with a similar warning. “The prime minister and a large number of cabinet ministers made the point that cabinet discussions should take place in private,” her official spokesman said, in comments widely seen as a telling-off of the foreign secretary. One source claimed that Johnson was admonished indirectly by almost all cabinet ministers who contributed to the health discussion, with the notable exception of his Vote Leave colleague Michael Gove. A number are said to have argued that such pre-briefing would simply hand political advantage to Labour, and that the Tories should not throw out funding figures before making clear where the money would come from. Even the leave campaigner Chris Grayling, who backed Johnson’s call for a Brexit dividend to be spent on the NHS, suggested it would be more politically astute to make such arguments closer to the next election. However, Johnson – who argued that extra funding would help the Tories take on Labour in a future election – was backed up by Gove. And while the foreign secretary was criticised for making his demands public in advance, sources said his argument for money to be diverted from the EU to the NHS received support from several figures. The prime minister’s spokesman said May raised the issue in her opening comments. “Regarding the future and how any return of the EU contribution would be spent, the prime minister reminded cabinet that the government has consistently said we will spend money on our priorities such as housing, schools and the NHS,” he said. May told her team she was working with Philip Hammond, the chancellor, and Jeremy Hunt, the health and social care secretary, to ensure continued investment in the NHS, but she also stressed that the government had given the NHS an additional £6bn in the budget “only a few weeks ago”. Her spokesman highlighted efficiency reviews in the NHS and plans to integrate social care and health, and pointed to the next government spending round. That will take place in 2018 but will only issue funding for 2020 and beyond. He said no cabinet member raised “any specific number” in relation to NHS funding, despite a widespread suggestion that Johnson would demand the figure of £100m a week more. The foreign secretary is said to be frustrated by a claim that key aides to May had argued Labour was too far ahead on the NHS to make it worth prioritising. He is also keen to fulfil the promises he made as a leading figure in the Vote Leave campaign. Johnson first ramped up pressure on May over the issue in a Guardian interview this month in which he said the campaign’s claim that Brexit could free up £350m a week for the NHS was an underestimate, and argued it was important to spend large chunks of that sum on health services. A friend of the foreign secretary was quoted on Politics Home website as suggesting the decision to brief reporters before the cabinet meeting came from a staff member after Johnson raised the issue excitedly in the office. They said the minister felt “very, very strongly about the suggestions he lied about the £350m stuff” but added that he had been given a hard time at cabinet. They suggested Johnson had messed up but would now move on. While cabinet members expressed their frustration at the meeting, Hammond hit back in Brussels before a meeting of finance ministers, stressing that Johnson was the foreign secretary rather than someone involved in health policy. “I gave the health secretary [Jeremy Hunt] an extra £6bn in the recent budget and we will look at departmental allocations again at the spending review when that takes place,” Hammond told reporters. The cabinet discussion came after a winter update on the NHS led by May and then Hunt at which the group discussed the “significant pressure [of] the worst flu outbreak in a number of years”. They heard that flu admissions in the first week of 2018 were approaching double the number seen in 2010-11 during the swine flu epidemic. The government claims to have made the “most extensive preparations ever” for the winter period, and ministers heard that improvements to the 111 phoneline had diverted an estimated 2.3 million people from A&amp;E while an extra 1 million had been given flu vaccinations. Hunt, who was among those stressing the importance of private conversations, later appeared to back Johnson’s call for extra NHS spending as he gave evidence to the House of Commons’ health select committee. Asked whether he supported Johnson’s demands for an extra £100m a week for health, he said: “I don’t think any health secretary is ever going to not support potential extra resources for his or her department.” He added: “Let’s say that there’s a Brexit debate and there’s an NHS debate and just occasionally those two debates come together.” However, pressed on where the money would come from for a “Brexit dividend” for the NHS, Hunt said: “I think that is a question for the foreign secretary.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2018/jan/24/nearly-half-of-uk-14-year-olds-have-tried-alcohol-figures-show","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-24T06:30:23Z","webTitle":"Nearly half of UK 14-year-olds have tried alcohol, figures show","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jan/24/nearly-half-of-uk-14-year-olds-have-tried-alcohol-figures-show","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/jan/24/nearly-half-of-uk-14-year-olds-have-tried-alcohol-figures-show","fields":{"headline":"Nearly half of UK 14-year-olds have tried alcohol, figures show","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Almost half of children in the UK have tried alcohol by the age of 14, while nearly 20% have had a run-in with the police, new figures have revealed. The research also found that among 14-year-olds, 17% of boys and 8% of girls had gambled in the previous four weeks, 17% had tried a cigarette at some point, and more than one in 10 admitted to binge drinking on at least one occasion – defined as consuming five or more alcoholic drinks in one sitting. Experts say the findings will help in the design of interventions to prevent youths adopting risky behaviours, adding that the study highlights the need to tackle the issues of drink, drugs and smoking with primary school children. “If things become a behavioural pattern and established at [a] young age, it might be difficult to shift later on,” said Dr Aase Villadsen, a co-author of the research from University College London. The results, which have not yet been published in a peer-reviewed journal, come from the Millennium Cohort Study – research that has been following about 19,500 people from birth, with interviews and assessments carried out every few years. The latest findings, from surveys conducted in 2015 and early 2016, focus on various behaviours at age 14, with more than 11,000 teens quizzed. While 14% of girls and 20% of boys had tried alcohol at age of 11, the latest findings show that overall almost half of teenagers had tried alcohol by age 14. When it came to smoking, the team found that around 3% of 14-year olds said they regularly lit up, while 6% had taken recreational drugs. The researchers add that regular smoking appears to be linked the age at which individuals take their first puff, noting that 25% of those who smoked by age 11 were regular smokers by 14, compared to 15% of those who tried it for the first time between 12 and 14. Once factors including parental education and occupation were taken into account, boys were slightly more likely to have dabbled with smoking, alcohol or drugs, or to have participated in binge-drinking. The figures come just a few months after data released in November by the NHS showed that 24% of 11-15-year-olds had tried recreational drugs at least once, while 19% had tried smoking. The latest study also found that by that age of 14, just over 41% of boys had shoved, hit, punched or slapped someone – almost twice the rate of girls. In addition, 12% of boys and 9% of girls said they had engaged in sexual contact by the age of 14, with such experiences – as well as drinking, smoking and drug-taking – more common among teens who had been through puberty, were gay or bisexual, had single parents, or parents who drank or took drugs. But Villadsen said factors behind the trends were complex, noting that children of the most educated parents were more likely to have carried out physical assault. “There weren’t really strong socio-economic factors driving this – it seems to be that kids from across the spectrum are engaging in [risky behaviours],” she said. “The stage where they are in adolescence, or puberty, that is a massive driver –it is related to all of these things.” While rates of various behaviours differed across England, Wales and Scotland, the researchers say this appears to be largely down to different demographics, with white teens more likely than those from ethnic minorities to engage in risky behaviours. However, even when such factors were taken into account, some places stood out. “There is something about the youth in Northern Ireland that makes them slightly more well-behaved,” said Villadsen. “We are not really sure what is going on there.” But the study has limitations, including that it is based on self-reporting by the teenagers. Dr Michelle Taylor of Bristol University, who was not involved in the study, said “This highly important research from a modern cohort shows that despite efforts to reduce adolescent substance use and risky behaviours over the past decade, teenagers are still choosing to partake in these behaviours at high rates.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2018/jan/23/gas-field-earthquakes-put-netherlands-biggest-firms-on-extraction-notice","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-23T15:48:45Z","webTitle":"Gas field earthquakes put Netherlands’ biggest firms on extraction notice","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jan/23/gas-field-earthquakes-put-netherlands-biggest-firms-on-extraction-notice","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/jan/23/gas-field-earthquakes-put-netherlands-biggest-firms-on-extraction-notice","fields":{"headline":"Gas field earthquakes put Netherlands’ biggest firms on extraction notice","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Two hundred of the Netherlands’ biggest companies have been told by their government to stop sourcing fuel from a major Dutch gas field within four years following a series of increasingly significant earthquakes. Extraction from the Groningen field, one of Europe’s richest sources of gas, is operated in a joint venture between Royal Dutch Shell and ExxonMobil, but has been capped in recent years by ministers due to seismic activity in the area. Following a quake two weeks ago which registered at 3.4 on the Richter scale - the second-strongest recorded above the gas fields and the biggest in five years - the country’s minister for economic affairs, Eric Wiebes, put major corporations on notice this week. Wiebes told the firms that the “phasing out” of Groningen gas was unavoidable and that they needed to make a transition to alternative energy sources by 2022. “My ministry will be in touch with you shortly to talk about the issue and reach a joint decision,” the minister wrote to the firms. “In the coming period, the government wants to phase out this consumption more quickly, so that by 2022 no industrial large-scale users using Groningen gas will in principle be measured.” Ben Samuel, of the energy data firm, ICIS, said the impact on the UK would be limited, as the country did not use the low calorific gas produced in Groningen. However, he said that a shortening of supply on the continent had the potential to increase prices. “Everyone is waiting to see what the impact will be and the final decision in terms of reduction,” he said. When the Groningen field was discovered in 1959 it was at the time the largest natural gas field in the world. Extraction has been reduced since 2014 due to damage inflicted on local homes and businesses. According to a lawsuit being pursued by 3,500 victims, an estimated 100,000 houses in Groningen have together lost an estimated €1bn in value due to seismic activity. In April, a Dutch court instructed the public prosecutor to investigate the joint venture over its alleged failure to carry out risk assessments after 1993, at which point the connection between earthquakes and gas extraction had been discovered."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2018/jan/23/nhs-patients-having-to-be-sectioned-to-get-help-says-regulator","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-23T15:30:59Z","webTitle":"NHS patients having to be sectioned to get help, says regulator","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jan/23/nhs-patients-having-to-be-sectioned-to-get-help-says-regulator","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/jan/23/nhs-patients-having-to-be-sectioned-to-get-help-says-regulator","fields":{"headline":"NHS patients having to be sectioned to get help, says regulator","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"A lack of mental health services in England means a growing number of patients are having to be sectioned to get help, according to the NHS care regulator. A review by the Care Quality Commission found that the rise in the number of detentions under the Mental Health Act was due partly to the fact that the healthcare system was “under considerable strain”. The number of patients sectioned has increased by 40% between 2005-06 and 2015-16, from 45,484 to 63,622. The CQC noted that unavailability of community care support was leading to high numbers of detentions, and demand for beds also meant patients tended not to be admitted on a voluntary basis. Dr Paul Lelliott, the lead for mental health at the Care Quality Commission, said: “Some of the factors at play in the rising rates of detention, both nationally and locally, are also signs of a healthcare system under considerable strain. Detentions under the act can be influenced by gaps in support and provision in the system.” He added: “This includes limited hospital bed availability, which means that people cannot easily be admitted as voluntary patients early in the course of their illness.” The CQC also noted other issues that had led to the rise in the number of detentions, including population growth, better national reporting and increased awareness of mental health problems. Prof Wendy Burn, president of the Royal College of Psychiatrists, said: “The [CQC] report is further evidence that declining access to community services is leading to more people reaching mental health crises and highlights the limitations of relying on legislative change to reduce rates of detention under the Mental Health Act.” Vicki Nash, the head of policy and campaigns at the mental health charity Mind, said: “Ultimately this report confirms what we hear every day about the state of NHS mental health services. Many people are not getting the right care when they ask for help and, as a result, are more likely to become more unwell, reach crisis point and need to be detained under the act.” People are detained under the Mental Health Act to make sure they get treatment, care and support from hospitals. Although this is in the person’s best interests, it is often against their wishes and the law is supposed to be used only when other options have been considered. Barbara Keeley, the shadow minister for mental health, said: “It’s time the Tories faced up to the damage they have done to mental health services and immediately invest in and ringfence mental health budgets, as Labour has pledged.” An NHS England spokesperson said: “There is no one-size-fits-all answer as to why the number of detentions appear to be rising, although the recent shift to use of the mental health services data set will help bring fresh insights. We will continue to work with partners like the CQC to examine and address some of the complex issues at play to ensure people get the best possible care, in the right place, at the right time. “To this end we are investing in and improving the crisis care pathway to provide earlier intervention and alternatives to admissions as one important component of wider work to improve people’s access to and experience of acute mental health care, including plans to eliminate out of area placements for adults in acute settings.” A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: “This report makes clear there are a range of factors which are leading to an increase in the numbers detained. We want to ensure the Act works better for patients and their families –that’s why we commissioned an independent review, which is due to report in autumn. Of course, there is always more to do, which is why we are investing an additional £1bn by 2020/21.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"culture/2018/jan/27/fame-toxic-for-relationship-when-comedy-double-acts-go-sour","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-27T10:00:47Z","webTitle":"'Fame proved toxic for the relationship': when comedy double acts split","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2018/jan/27/fame-toxic-for-relationship-when-comedy-double-acts-go-sour","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/2018/jan/27/fame-toxic-for-relationship-when-comedy-double-acts-go-sour","fields":{"headline":"'Fame proved toxic for the relationship': when comedy double acts split","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"In 1978, the year before the film 10 made a Hollywood star of Dudley Moore, the comedian appeared alongside his long-standing double-act partner, Peter Cook, on the Saturday-night chatshow Parkinson. “Do you find some difficulty working together?” asked Michael Parkinson, the host. “Tremendous difficulty,” said Moore, with a smile. “There are storms,” said Cook. “There have to be. There are tensions. We weep a lot.” “It’s like a marriage,” said Moore. “How is it like a marriage?” asked Parkinson, cross-legged and slouched on his swivel chair. Finally, from Cook, the kicker: “We’re getting divorced.” At the time, Cook and Moore, who performed in the satirical group Beyond the Fringe before becoming a formal double act, were at the height of their fame. If Cook’s drinking had already curdled into alcoholism, the disease was yet to blunt his talent. Later that evening, Parkinson asked another of his guests, the boxer John Conteh, whether it was true that he avoided sex before a fight. As Conteh squirmed, Cook delivered a comeback of extravagant brilliance. “I wouldn’t ask you if you have sex before a show,” he said to Parkinson. A beat, then: “I can see that you have.” Nevertheless, Cook’s quip about divorce soon proved true. Moore’s subsequent success in America (by 1982, he had won an Oscar nomination for his role as an alcoholic millionaire in Arthur) all but ended the partnership. When the pair reunited to record new material as their sweary alter egos, Derek and Clive, jealousies boiled over. Under the flimsy cover of character, Cook would issue barbed remarks about Moore’s new career. At one point, Moore fled the recording booth. During a rendition of the pair’s well-known “Mother” sketch, Cook drowned out Moore’s attempts to be heard on tape by shouting: “Why don’t you shut your fucking face and die!” The comedy double act is one of the most delicate of all creative collaborations. In the writers’ room, a comedian must trust their partner with an unproven joke, and in doing so risk that most mortifying of all feedback: the absence of a laugh. On stage, the stakes are equivalent to those faced by a troupe of trapeze artists: a mistimed catch will leave one partner hanging, the other tumbling. Success and longevity rely not only on timing and compatibility, then, but also on trust. And there are few places where trust is as fragile as in the double act, with fused identities and jostled egos. *** Shortly after Richard Herring auditioned for the Oxford Revue with a song titled My Penis Can Sing, he met Stewart Lee in the corridor outside. The attraction was immediate. “We had a similar sense of humour – a common sensibility,” Herring recalls backstage at the Leicester Square theatre, in London. “Also, we thought what everyone else was doing was rubbish. We may have even decided right there and then to write some sketches together.” The pair began by drawing up agreed lines on the kind of material they wouldn’t perform (no pillorying celebrities, no parodying TV). They would write alone, before swapping their material for the other to amend. After university, where both men performed for a while in a septuple act called the Seven Raymonds (“As if seven Raymonds had met and, like the Two Ronnies, decided to perform together,” says Herring), the pair moved to London as flatmates, writing together for Radio 4 programmes such as Week Ending and On The Hour. In the evenings, Lee began to find success as a solo standup comic. “It was weird, because sometimes we’d have a conversation and then Stewart would turn that conversation into a very successful piece of standup,” Herring recalls. “And I’d sort of be at the back going, ‘Yeah, that’s my idea…’” The two comedians became Lee and Herring after they were commissioned to create a radio programme, Fist Of Fun. The issue of whose name should come first in the billing immediately came up. “Our producer, Sarah Smith, said, ‘It should be Herring and Lee, it sounds better,’” recalls Herring. “I said I didn’t care, but he wanted to be first. He said: ‘It has to be Lee and Herring.’” Herring now hosts a weekly podcast series, in which he routinely plays the role of the jilted, failing performer; there are near constant references to life in the shadow of Lee’s success. It’s a comic exaggeration, but those feelings of insecurity in the double act came early. “Because Stewart got sort of successful with the live stuff and I wasn’t, there was an imbalance,” he says. “He felt he’d done lots of standup and was occasionally a bit snooty about performing together. I would say: ‘Look, I’ve done exactly the same amount of being a double act as you have. We’re equally experienced with this.’” If this early episode revealed a flicker of resentment, it would be years before it blossomed into a physical confrontation, in the pair’s office. “Stew was trying to write something, and he was never good with computers, and something on the computer went wrong,” Herring recalls. “I tried to help him, and he told me to get away. So I just kind of kicked his chair. All of his resentments for me, or whatever, came to the fore and he went for me. I hit my head on a table. I think we tried to hit each other but failed. That night, before a gig, I said backstage: ‘We’ve had one fight in 10 years – that’s fine.’” For Herring, the moment represented an explosion of mutual feelings of mounting frustration. “It’s an odd relationship,” he says. “You’re so close, because you’ve worked so hard together to create something. But you’re also stuck together on tour so at some point you inevitably want to go off in different directions.” There’s a risk, too, that partners in a double act begin to believe the onstage characters they play, and the dynamic of that relationship – the Derek and Clive effect. “I think, as it progressed, Stew felt like the double act was a bit beneath him; he certainly was drawn to the autonomy of standup. He probably didn’t, ultimately, want to be in a double act. But I’d really put all my eggs in that basket.” In the early days following their split, Herring says he suffered by comparison with his former partner. “I started doing standup just as Stewart became the most successful standup in the country, or at least the most feted,” he says. “People would say that I was doing Stew’s jokes, which was unfair.” It hurt, Herring says, that no one suggested there could have been any pollination in the other direction. He recalls one tweeted barb that clearly stuck: “Can you believe Richard Herring was ever in a double act with Stewart Lee? It’s like Lenny Bruce being with Les Dennis.” For Herring, then, the shtick that Lee is the successful one is, like so much of comedy, a way to process emotion. It’s also, on some deep level, an acknowledgement of the curious melancholy to the former double-act performer. “I think I’ve mentioned Stew in pretty much every standup show I do,” he says. “While he does occasionally mention me, he’s sort of wiped that part of his career away. But the supposed bitterness I have? That is the joke. Ultimately, it’s like a marriage in that you divorce, it’s painful, and then, eventually, none of that stuff really matters. You reach a point where you’re pleased if the other one’s doing well.” During the past five years, Lee has appeared on Herring’s podcast twice. *** Examining the end of a double act has the same unsavoury, voyeuristic feel as poring over the details of a divorce, the he-said-she-saids. Splits often represent a painful moment from which all parties involved wish to move on (Cook’s wife Lin fought hard to keep the tapes of her husband and Moore’s gruelling bickering out of the public domain). Few double acts speak openly about why their partnerships failed. As in marriages, some partners naturally drift apart. In others, seeds of resentment, perhaps planted in the January of a partnership, bloom into an autumn reckoning, one that’s often delivered in dramatic cliche: the hurled plate, the slammed door, the night spent in the poky spare room. Occasionally, the cause of death is nothing more than the corrosive effects of celebrity. Success arrived quickly for Rob Newman and David Baddiel, the first double act to sell out British arenas. The pair met as students at Cambridge, but only became friends later, during an open writing session for a Radio 4 comedy. After a stint writing radio sketches, the pair were asked by a BBC commissioner to join with another double act, Steve Punt and Hugh Dennis, to launch a new comedy programme. The Mary Whitehouse Experience proved a success with Radio 1 listeners, and Newman and Baddiel – or Baddiel and Newman, as they were originally billed – began touring as a double act, interspersing sketches with their individual standup routines. For some duos, the daily pressures of writing and performing together build trust and synergy. For others, they create irreconcilable rifts. “Fame proved toxic for the relationship,” Baddiel tells me. “I sensed that Rob, who is prodigiously talented – a dangerous and charismatic performer – had an anxiety or paranoia about being misrepresented by fame. And all the anxieties and insecurities a person might have are magnified by success.” Baddiel believes that Newman, who was strikingly handsome, feared people saw him as the poster boy of the outfit, and Baddiel, the bookish, bespectacled partner, as the intellectual force. “It wasn’t true. We were a symbiotic partnership – we wrote all our double-act material together.” The pair began to argue over whose name would come first in the billing, or how they would stand during photoshoots. Newman insisted they were interviewed separately. Baddiel was then reported as saying that he thought his partner was going mad. In November 1993, close to the end of their revealingly titled final tour, Newman And Baddiel Live And In Pieces, the pair were being driven in an expensive car from Glasgow to Leicester. Tensions between the two were untenably high. “He was incredibly angry about stuff I’d said in the press and just shouted at me for the entire journey,” Baddiel recalls. “I remember thinking that it was a bit like when you see footage of people being beaten up, and they just curl into a ball because they don’t know how to respond.” For three days after the altercation, the men spoke only on stage. For a while, Newman and Baddiel kept their feud off stage. Then, shortly before they performed their climactic gig, conflict became uncontainable. “We were at De Montfort Hall, and during my standup section of the show I tried a new joke,” says Baddiel. “It was about the IRA not being allowed to speak in their own voices on the TV. At that time I wasn’t watching Rob’s standup section.” As Baddiel moved to walk off stage, he saw Newman coming out from the wings, dressed as Jarvis, an aristocratic sex predator character. “The first thing he said to me in three or four days was: ‘You cunt, you knew I did a joke about that and you’ve tried to ruin it.’” In turn, Baddiel went into Newman’s dressing room during the interval and shouted obscenities at him for 20 minutes. “That’s the point I knew it was over. We had been friends but the double act destroyed that friendship.” *** The number of male double acts that have split far outnumbers their female counterparts. When Dawn French, who worked with Jennifer Saunders in a double act for two decades, appeared on Herring’s podcast last year, the conversation inevitably turned to the subject of broken creative partnerships. “Isn’t it just the men that fall out?” asked French. “But aren’t you competitive?” says Herring, gently pressing. “I suppose I was a bit surprised at how much success she had on her own – that was a cocktail of strange emotions,” she said, before admitting that, after Saunders won an award for her sitcom Absolutely Fabulous, French sent her friend a bouquet of flowers with a card that read: “Congratulations, you cunt.” “She’s like a sister, where you’re delighted and jealous, but good jealous,” French continued. “I have that kind of envy that is also pride and delight at the same time.” The American comedian Corinne Fisher, who works alongside Krystyna Hutchinson in the double act Sorry About Last Night, and on Guys We Fucked: The Anti Slut-Shaming Podcast, says she finds women just as difficult to work with as men “but in different ways”. Nevertheless, she says, gender plays a role in the potential longevity of a double act: “I think I’ll tolerate more bullshit from women than men, if we’re being quite honest.” Fisher was an agent at Liebman Entertainment when the New York management company hired Hutchinson as an intern and the pair became close. One evening, Fisher watched her friend perform at an open mic standup show. “I had been watching the American comedy–folk duo Garfunkel &amp; Oates’ progress, and it seemed like comedy was just more fun with a friend,” says Fisher. “So I Facebook messaged her the idea of working together in a duo and she was immediately onboard.” The pair established firm boundaries from the off, including the rule that they only discuss work matters over email, never text. “Sometimes Sorry About Last Night feels more like a marriage than my seven-year relationship with my boyfriend,” says Hutchinson. “We’ve had to learn how to talk directly to each other when one of us is upset or annoyed or frustrated,” says Fisher. It’s this communication that, Hutchinson says, distinguishes many male double acts from their female counterparts. “Principally there are more male double-act divorces because the number of men in comedy outweighs the number of women,” she says. “But in my experience, women are better communicators, too. Nowadays we can resolve a conflict quickly, and I’ve learned not to take things so personally.” Nevertheless, both find it difficult to deal with the loss of individual identity that has come with double-act success. “People don’t seem to understand that we’re not identical twins who sleep in bunk beds,” says Fisher. “We’re often considered as interchangeable within the comedy community. People we’ve known for years call us by the other’s name.” To keep from being subsumed by one another, Fisher says that it’s crucial to keep an open working relationship, as it were. “For us to continue to work together, it is imperative we also work with other people.” *** For the comedy writer Graham Linehan, who started out writing sitcoms in a partnership with Arthur Mathews, a clear hierarchy is crucial to a happy double act, even if the power dynamic switches between specific projects. Linehan met Mathews when he joined the Dublin magazine Hot Press as a music journalist. Mathews worked in the magazine’s art department, and made an immediate impression on Linehan. “A group of us were coming down some stairs and Arthur fell down them just to get a laugh,” he recalls. “He did it really slowly and with this confused look on his face. It was spectacularly funny. I immediately felt a jolt of something very close to love.” When the pair began writing sketches for a local comedy act, The Joshua Trio, Linehan’s admiration for his partner, who is nine years his senior, dictated the way in which the pair worked. “We never quarrelled because I was intimidated by Arthur, so I’d never say: ‘I don’t like this.’ I’d just take something he’d written and say: ‘I love it, but just let me try one thing.’ The rule became: as long as what I wrote was funnier, Arthur was fine with it. He had no ego in the face of humour.” Linehan and Mathews moved to London and, while renting an apartment from Griff Rhys Jones, who was in the double act Smith and Jones at the time, they wrote the sitcom Father Ted. As well as their friendship, Linehan believes the pairing worked because of the ways the writers complemented one another. “Subconsciously, I think we both knew that there were aspects in the other person that we didn’t have,” he says. “For example, I am terrified of the blank page. I worry and obsess over structure. Has this been done before? Then I’d turn around and he’d written three pages. I needed someone like that. Then I brought the structural stuff a bit more, and loved taking the stuff he did and seeing if I could think of set-ups and payoffs. It was beautiful, a lovely working relationship. When it ended, I had to learn how to write on my own.” The end of the working relationship followed a shift in the dynamic, perhaps due to a maturing on Linehan’s part. The pair wrote a pilot for Hippies, a BBC2 sitcom set in the late 60s and starring Simon Pegg and Sally Phillips. “I just could not relax about it,” says Linehan. “I didn’t like the idea and didn’t know what we were trying to say. I wasn’t sleeping.” Mathews, sensing Linehan’s reservations, suggested that he write the series alone. Linehan soon began writing another sitcom, Black Books, about a cranky, sotted secondhand bookseller. When the pair tried to collaborate again, the recipe no longer worked. “The structure that we’d built had disappeared,” he says. “Now I had confidence, so I was much more likely to say: ‘I don’t like this.’ We’d lost the dynamic and couldn’t pick it up again.” The greatest pressures are exerted on a comedy partnership in the writers’ room. After the collapse of his partnership with Rob Newman, David Baddiel met Frank Skinner on the comedy circuit. Skinner, who had recently split from his wife and had nowhere to live, moved in with Baddiel. When the opportunity arose for Baddiel to make a TV series based on fantasy football, he talked to Skinner, with whom he would spend hours watching football. “We thought: let’s build a show around our home life,” he says. In the writers’ room, the friendship was immediately tested. “When Frank and I first started writing together, he suggested a joke and, unusually, I said, ‘That’s not funny.’ He got really pissed off. I knew it was hurtful – possibly the worst thing to say to a comedian – but in a double act you must be able to say when you think something’s not funny. It’s very difficult to negotiate.” Greater than the risk of a bruised ego is the threat that credit for your work will be taken away, or at least redistributed. “With all double acts there is often a tension over whose idea something was,” says Baddiel. “But you have to make a commitment that it doesn’t matter who said what first. Even if an idea is principally thought of as being by ‘Partner A’, by the time it’s being performed, ‘Partner B’ will have brought all kinds of elements to the piece. Territorial disputes are what double acts flounder on more than anything else.” Whether due to rifts cleaved in the writers’ room, or secret ambitions, often one member of a double act begins to work on side projects. When someone is lured away by a career in Hollywood (Joe Cornish, who worked with Adam Buxton as Adam and Joe), or a hosting gig on TV, the jilted comic can feel a triple death: of a partnership, a brand, even a future. In 2006, Andy Zaltzman and John Oliver, who were at the time writing their third Edinburgh show together, travelled to London to audition for a role on Jon Stewart’s The Daily Show. Only Oliver, however, was called to a second audition. “When they offered him the job, unfathomably, John chose to go and work on the world’s leading satirical TV show rather than speak to 30 people in a tiny room in Edinburgh,” Zaltzman tells me over a Diet Pepsi in a London pub. After the swift departure of Oliver, who now presents HBO’s primetime political talkshow Last Week Tonight, Zaltzman was left to write and, two weeks later, perform the Edinburgh show alone. “It was difficult because I had nothing to replace this wonderful working relationship and friendship,” Zaltzman says. The year after Oliver left for America, Zaltzman “bumbled along” performing political standup. Then they were offered the opportunity to record a weekly topical podcast, the Bugle. Oliver agreed to rejoin the double act (albeit via a telephone line) as co-host. “It worked well straight away,” says Zaltzman. “There hadn’t been any great falling out, so in that sense it was easy for us to work together again.” The podcast, a satirical take on the week’s news, ran from 2007 to 2014 without a break. It then had a hiatus while Oliver focused on launching his new TV show; he soon found that the show was taking up too much of his time, and the Bugle came to an end in 2015. Then in 2016, Zaltzman relaunched it without Oliver, instead partnering with a roster of comedians including Nish Kumar and Hari Kondabolu. “To lose [Oliver] after having worked so closely for years left a void,” says Zaltzman. “But my frustration was not with his success. I like to think I haven’t become a bitter, twisted, resentment-fuelled showbiz cliche. But maybe there is a residual awkwardness about the different paths we’ve taken.” Is the double act in terminal crisis? Certainly the past two decades rattle with defunct partnerships, even if some of the friendships have endured: Skinner and Baddiel, French and Saunders, Fry and Laurie, Adam and Joe. “There aren’t really any true double acts these days,” Vic Reeves wrote in the Sun, following the news that comedians Matt Lucas and David Walliams had parted ways after 20 years. Culturally, it may be that the traditional double act, which in its wholesome artifice suited British audiences in the 60s and 70s, is less relevant in this new confessional, individualistic age. Curiously, this trend may have reunited at least one pair of comedic divorcees. Baddiel’s latest show, My Family, which he wrote and starred in as a solo performer, offers a celebration of his childhood and the lives of his characterful parents that is transgressive in its honesty. “It’s the truest stuff that I have ever done, which is something to do with not being in double acts any more,” he tells me. “It’s difficult to be wholly yourself in a double act, because you are beholden to the other person.” Last year, perhaps responding to Baddiel’s public display of vulnerability, his former partner, Newman, sent a public message over Twitter requesting two tickets to the show. Baddiel says the pair have since become friends again. Evidently, the spark that originally forged a pairing can, occasionally, survive somewhere in the rubble. “Finding a person who complements you is so precious,” says Linehan. “You have to keep hold of it however you can. When you’re young, you don’t see this; ego, fear and money all get in the way. I love it when I see a partnership that is still going, with people who are clearly still friends.

After an intervening year that has seen the rise of #MeToo, Scotland’s first minister may feel a need to insert a feminist caveat or two as she gives the address on Thursday at a Burns supper hosted by the SNP’s Govan branch, after Liz Lochhead recently called Burns “Weinsteinian” and “a sex pest”, and prompted a controversy that has raged in the Scottish press for the past fortnight. Ahead of her talk on Burns and Women next week, Lochhead, the poet, playwright and former makar previewed her speech, in which she calls Burns a “sex pest” and drew attention to a 1788 letter to a friend in which he bragged of giving his lover Jean Armour a “thundering scalade [a military attack breaching defences] that electrified the very marrow of her bones”, and said he “fucked her until she rejoiced”. For Lochhead, this “disgraceful sexual boast … seemed very like a rape of his heavily pregnant girlfriend. It’s very, very Weinsteinian.” After her comments were aired on the BBC, Lochhead received support from Robert Crawford, whose biography of Burns quotes the letter, and who argued in the Herald that “what he presents as ... exclamations of pleasure may well have been cries of pain”. Burns did have “his Weinstein moments”, Crawford agreed, and “feminists are right to subject [him] to scrutiny” when he comes across as “an 18th-century buck showing off [to] his male cronies”. Also in Lochhead’s camp is the author and critic Stuart Kelly, who on Burns’s birthday last year highlighted the bragging letter in a Guardian article that questioned “why we all raise a glass ... to the boor-bard of Scotland”. “There is an image of Burns,” Kelly wrote, “a bit of a rascal, a bit roguish, a naughty roister-doisterer – who nevertheless produced some of the greatest love poetry in our language … But here’s another r-word. Rapist.” However, Lochhead has been criticised by Burns scholars such as Gerard Carruthers, who said there was “no good evidence” that the national icon was a rapist and complained of an approach that “refracts everything through our 21st-century presentism, essentially judging history by the ephemeral journalistic stories of today”. Wilson Ogilvie similarly argued that “Burns was not lily-white in his attitudes towards women”, but – given the “huge differences” between his world and Weinstein’s – “Miss Lochhead has gone a bit over the top” in comparing them. Catherine Czerkawska, author of a novel about Armour as well as a Burns expert, told the Scotsman comparisons between the poet and film producer were “invidious” and said “to label the events described in the letter as rape is to oversimplify a relationship of great complexity”. Lochhead herself, ironically, found herself defending Burns during his 250th anniversary festivities in 2009, when she responded to charges that he was “a racist, misogynist drunk” – and hence no role model for Scots – by calling such arguments “complete rubbish. It’s not relevant to his poetry, it’s not the point. We don’t look to him for a way to live our lives … Of course I wouldn’t look to him as a feminist role model, but he’s not a role model, he’s a great poet.” In an overlooked part of her recent remarks, Lochhead made the same point again, though rather more mutedly. Does the fact that Burns was a sex pest “mean he isn’t worth reading?” she asked, answering that “it’s not really relevant”. Arguing that an author’s attitude to and behaviour towards women is irrelevant is questionable, though, when he’s best known for love poems – and when politicians are holding up his “values” as admirable as well as his verse."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"sport/2018/jan/23/mike-brown-rugby-world-cup-2019-england","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-23T12:33:32Z","webTitle":"Mike Brown: ‘The World Cup – I’m absolutely desperate to be there’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/jan/23/mike-brown-rugby-world-cup-2019-england","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/jan/23/mike-brown-rugby-world-cup-2019-england","fields":{"headline":"Mike Brown: ‘The World Cup – I’m absolutely desperate to be there’","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"As Mike Brown considers the perfect finale to his long England career on a beautiful winter’s morning all that is missing is some suitable mood music. A dazzling sun is shining directly through the windows behind him, creating a halo effect of pure golden Brown. There is also much talk of him “hanging around” as England’s No 15. At this rate the Stranglers will be requesting royalty payments. The 32-year-old Brown, however, is not about to wallow in punk nostalgia. What drives England’s oldest current squad member is the belief there is more he can still achieve even after 64 caps for his country. Give or take the blurred vision which may reduce his pre-Six Nations training involvement in Portugal this week, he has seldom been more motivated, even after over a decade of Test rugby. Partly it is because he has to be. Eddie Jones will be taking no passengers, let alone fading 34-year-old full-backs, to next year’s World Cup. Bath’s Anthony Watson played for the Lions at full-back last summer and Elliot Daly, when fit, will be another contender. Brown may be less easy on the neutral eye but, in his favour, no one is keener to be in Japan in 2019. “There’s always that next thing to drive you on,” he murmurs. “For me it’s the World Cup. I’m absolutely desperate to be there.” The most recent threat to this single-minded attitude has not been injury but the arrival last autumn of his first child, a son called Jax. He and his wife Eliza, the daughter of the former England footballer Tony Woodcock, now share their house with a pocket whirlwind. “He’s active, I’ll tell you that. You see some babies who have all the milk and just want to chill. He’s literally non-stop. You can’t put him down. I don’t think he gets it from me. My wife’s the one who’s always active, up and about and having to do something. I’m going to blame it on her.” Do not make the mistake, either way, of assuming Brown’s competitive edge has been mislaid somewhere beneath the cot. Not only is there “an extra person I now want to impress” but his desire to keep going at the highest level has intensified. If he could give one piece of advice to his teenaged self growing up on the Hampshire-Wiltshire border it would be not to worry what others think. “I still sometimes think: ‘What are they thinking about me? Is this the right decision?’ Especially after the 2015 World Cup I was overthinking things. It’s easier to just back yourself and go for it. If it’s the wrong decision we’ll fix it afterwards. This season I’ve become much more decisive and I’ve been playing better. It’s made me enjoy my rugby more than I was for the couple of years before.” Part of his longevity, he now reckons, is the result of being a late developer who scarcely touched weights before he was 18. He might still be playing fly-half had Mike Marchant, his coach at Peter Symonds College in Winchester and father of his now-Harlequins team-mate Joe Marchant, not moved him to full-back. “I did it kicking and screaming, trust me. You can guess what I would have been like. I’d played fly-half for ages and I still wanted to play there. Once I got into it [full-back], though, I loved it.” It also did him no lasting harm to be a comprehensive schoolboy irked at being beaten to representative selection by his public school peers. He subsequently received a no-frills rugby education in the Quins academy under Tony Russ and Collin Osborne which he still feels gave him a hunger lacking in some cosseted modern professionals. “I’m not going to sit here and say I’ve had it tougher than everyone else or all that sort of ‘Back in my day’ nonsense. But, yes, it was tough when we first joined up with Quins. That was the way they wanted it and we were told in no uncertain terms it would be like that. “They gave us jobs to do, we were all on a rota. We’d be washing the rugby balls after our sessions so they’d look brand new the next day, or cleaning the gym. We’d always start at midday when the first team left. We never really got to see them but we had to clean up after them. I’m not saying it’s the right or wrong way but it made me want it even more, seeing the first team guys driving out of the car park as we were arriving. Our training sessions would involve doing full-on smash in the five-metre channel. There was no hiding place. It definitely toughened up a lot of us.” Which is another way of telling his would-be successors they will not be casually waved through by the “old-timer” who has shared in 23 wins in 27 Six Nations games for England. “Once you get on to the training field it’s ‘on’, isn’t it? I’m here for a reason, Eddie backs me and he’s the only voice I’ve got to listen to. If he thinks I can still do a job that’s the only advice I need.” And the odds on England fans finding no more heroes this year? Remote, according to their most senior pro: “ Teams like beating England but we’ll make sure we’re fully prepared. There’s so much more room for improvement … there is another level in this team.” Mike Brown is a Land Rover ambassador.

We shall doubtless have trouble there again.” So wrote Lord Curzon, then viceroy, in 1904. The British were by then a little weary of the burdens of empire; they were having trouble with the tribespeople of the Frontier, who seemed uninterested in the sort of governance the colonialists wished for them. The smugly racist Curzon blamed it on the “fanaticism and turbulence” that “ferment in the blood” of the Pashtun. The neocolonialists of today cannot explain things away so easily. As Steve Coll documents in Directorate S, the current war has for ever altered the fates of all three countries involved – the US, Afghanistan and Pakistan – and, after 15 years, there is no end to the “trouble” in sight. Directorate S, from which the book gets its title, lies buried deep in the bureaucracy of the ISI (Inter-Services Intelligence), Pakistan’s spy agency. Ensconced thus, the directorate works to “enlarge Pakistan’s sphere of influence in Afghanistan”. It goes about this task, Coll explains, by supplying, arming, training and generally seeking to legitimise the Taliban, the AK-47 toting terrorists who took over Afghanistan in 1992, stringing up decapitated corpses in town squares and shoving women into the confines of their homes. Nobody paid much attention then, and perhaps never would have, had the Taliban not become host to Osama bin Laden. Bin Laden, the architect and financier of the 9/11 attacks, was the US’s most obvious target, and in order to get him, sights had to be set on Afghanistan. The scene Coll paints is riveting. In a house on the outskirts of Kandahar, the Taliban leader Mullah Mohammed Omar picks his toes while then-ISI chief Mahmud Ahmed tries to convince him to give up Bin Laden. It doesn’t happen, and neither Ahmed’s entreaties to the Americans (“I implore you not to fire a shot in anger”) nor his warnings (a strike will produce thousands of frustrated young Muslim men) nor his alternatives (reasoning with them will work better to get rid of terrorism) have any effect. The Americans ignore the lessons of history. George W Bush declares that the time for negotiating is over. It is a tragic moment, not least because we know of the perfidy and pain to come. In the pages of Directorate S, the sequel to Coll’s Pulitzer prize-winning Ghost Wars, the story is delivered with a literary prowess that has been absent in previous western accounts of America’s longest running war. The dance of blame, with the US swaying at one moment towards Pakistan and the next towards Afghanistan, is a choreography familiar to CIA chiefs, US presidents and writers who have tackled the subject. Coll refuses to follow this tired tune, and the result is masterful. Directorate S takes readers deep into the malevolent intrigues of spycraft with its cast of colourful characters: there is the Dunhill smoking spy chief Ashfaq Kayani; the fitness-obsessed, water-guzzling General David Petraeus; special envoy Richard Holbrooke, who calls his diplomacy “jazz improvisation”; not to mention such Taliban commanders as Omar, who makes off over the Pakistan border on a motorbike. The latter’s escape, Coll astutely notes, was a “lost opportunity”; had he been caught, it could have changed everything. The more notorious missed opportunity is the escape of Bin Laden from the Tora Bora cave complex a few months later. Coll recounts that, too, with fascinating details. For instance, just as General Tommy Franks is setting up a plan to get Bin Laden, a demanding Donald Rumsfeld calls and asks to see within the week war plans for the invasion of Iraq. For the Americans, it seems, Afghanistan was both a constant and an afterthought. Directorate S provides telling background descriptions with just as much skill. When US soldiers run into an abandoned school for al-Qaida suicide bombers, they find that “the recruits studied in concrete rooms” the walls of which “were painted with murals of the afterlife”, in one “channels of milk and honey” and in another “paintings of virgin girls”. At the CIA, the Counter-Terrorism Center analysts hunt terrorists huddled over “low-grade industrial carpeting, cookie-cutter Government cubicles” in large rooms that are “poorly lit and smell sour”. In an attempt at relief, “someone had mounted fake windows looking out on beaches and palm trees”. Fantasy, it seems, is the fuel of both endeavours. Then there are the absurdities: the supposedly indelible ink that washed off when Afghans went to vote in their first postwar election; the drone operators who hope dogs jump off the trucks at which they are about to fire missiles; and the mass of blunders that has killed 140,000 people but that US Isaf (International Security Assistance Force) commanders still describe as “a war to give people a chance”. In the 15-year story that Directorate S tells, Afghanistan has been built a bit and bombed a lot, the Taliban have been fought with and then courted, the Pakistanis embraced then abandoned. What the British tried to document in Curzon’s day the Americans refused to learn; there is indeed trouble on the Frontier again, and in Directorate S we have the definitive account of it. • Directorate S is published by Allen Lane.

Talking at the Davos world economic forum, UBS Chairman Axel Weber, said that bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies were speculative, risky and “not an investment we would advise”. “Retail clients, who don’t fully understand these products, should be protected from going into these products, because if there is a retail client affected in the future, the question will be again who was the bank that sold them these products and then banks will be blamed again for what has happened,” Weber told CNBC. UBS’s comments echo those recently made by billionaire investor Warren Buffett, who said he would never invest in cryptocurrency despite bitcoin’s nearly 2,000% rise in 2017. Consultancy Ernst &amp; Young also warned Monday that so-called initial coin offerings (ICOs), which offer cryptocurrency tokens to raise funds, were at risk of cybercrime. Of the 372 ICOs analysed, raising a total of $3.7bn, roughly $400m had been stolen by hackers, who were taking up to $1.5m in ICO proceeds per month. The warnings of theft from ICOs come as the chair of the US Securities and Exchange Commission, Jay Clayton, said the agency had seen “disturbing” evidence that investors in ICOs had been counselled that they did not need to comply with federal securities law. “I have instructed the SEC staff to be on high alert for approaches to ICOs that may be contrary to the spirit of our securities laws and the professional obligations of the US securities bar,” Clayton said. The statements of governments around the globe suggesting regulation is on the horizon have led to the vast cryptocurrency price fluctuations that have seen bitcoin halve in value since its high of just under $20,000 in December. Bitcoin trading was down approximately 12% over the last 24 hours, trading at around $10,400 on Tuesday morning on the Bitstamp exchange, following news that South Korea – the world’s third-largest cryptocurrency market – would implement its planned ban on use of anonymous bank accounts in cryptocurrency trading from 30 January. South Korean Financial Services Commission vice chair Kim Yong-beom said that the new measures will prevent those residing outside South Korea who do not have local bank accounts and minors younger than 19 from buying or selling bitcoins and other digital currencies. The move forms part of the country’s action to curb cryptocurrency trading, including the raiding of local exchanges over money laundering, with the government looking at a potential ban on trading. Local investors remain bullish, however, with one South Korean trader identified only as Ahn telling Reuters that “everyone knew this was coming, as the government already said they will enforce the real-name system before. “Rather, I can see this as a chance to go in, not out. I don’t see any reason to take my money out” Beyond simple trading, the hype in cryptocurrency and blockchain technology has also caused concern, as companies seek to take advantage of investor buzz. Firms including camera-maker Kodak, fintech firm LongFin, power firm Digital Power, tobacco company Rich Cigars, tiny US drinks firm Long Island Iced Tea Corp and many other smaller companies have all seen their share price rocket through pivots towards cryptocurrencies or blockchain technology. The SEC said it would begin scrutinising public companies that change their name or business model in a bid to capitalise upon the hype surrounding blockchain technology. “The SEC is looking closely at the disclosures of public companies that shift their business models to capitalise on the perceived promise of distributed ledger technology and whether the disclosures comply with the securities laws, particularly in the case of an offering,” said Chairman Jay Clayton on Monday. The yo-yoing in value of bitcoin, ethereum and ripple, among other cryptocurrencies has led economists to warn that the cryptocurrency bubble could be bursting. “When it will fully burst is anyone’s guess and prices could yet rise again, before they fall further ahead,” Capital Economics warned in a recent research note. “Triggers for the bubble to burst could be a further crackdown by regulators or a major hacking attempt.” Bitcoin’s fluctuations are too much for even ransomware cybercriminals"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"science/2018/jan/24/mixing-herbal-remedies-and-conventional-drugs-could-be-harmful","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-24T06:00:23Z","webTitle":"Mixing herbal remedies and conventional drugs 'could be harmful'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/jan/24/mixing-herbal-remedies-and-conventional-drugs-could-be-harmful","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2018/jan/24/mixing-herbal-remedies-and-conventional-drugs-could-be-harmful","fields":{"headline":"Mixing herbal remedies and conventional drugs 'could be harmful'","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Herbal remedies such as St John’s wort, ginseng and ginkgo biloba could have harmful interactions with conventional drugs, scientists have warned. In an extensive review of the medical literature, the team uncovered dozens of cases in which alternative treatments appeared to have altered the effects of prescription medication, either diluting it, making it more potent or causing potentially dangerous side effects. The paper turned up examples of patients who had suffered serious problems after taking herbal medicines alongside drugs including antidepressants and medication for HIV, epilepsy, heartdisease. Edzard Ernst, emeritus professor of complementary medicine at the University of Exeter, said the findings highlighted that natural ingredients could still have potentially potent biological effects. “They might cause harm to many patients who use herbal treatments,” he said. “It is therefore important that consumers are warned of the danger and think twice before self-medicating with herbal remedies.” Charles Awortwe, of the University of Stellenbosch in Tygerberg, South Africa, and first author of the paper, said his team was prompted to investigate because of the wide-spread use of herbal medicines alongside prescription drugs. He and colleagues scoured the medical literature to identify previous instances of patients suffering apparent adverse reactions. The analysis, published in the British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology, included 49 case reports and two previous observational studies, which detailed 15 cases of adverse drug reactions. They then analysed the cases, to work out whether the problems were likely to have been caused by an interaction, based on the pharmacological properties of the active ingredients. They concluded that herbal medicines had probably played a role in nearly 60% of cases. In one case report, a 55-year-old man died of a seizure while swimming. The autopsy concluded that ginkgo biloba supplements that the man was taking – to boost cognitive function – may have inhibited the effects of his anti-seizure medication. Several cases documented patients with heart problems who were on warfarin or statins, who appeared to suffer complications linked to sage, flaxseed, St John’s wort and green tea. The majority of patients were diagnosed with cardiovascular diseases, cancer, and kidney transplants. Recent studies have shown it is possible for some active ingredients in herbal medicines to affect drug metabolism, speeding up the rate at which other medicines are broken down in the liver and reducing their effectiveness. Previous research has suggested that St John’s wort, an over-the-counter herbal remedy for depression, could interact with a large number of medicines. It is thought to increase side effects of antidepressants and there is evidence it could reduce the effectiveness of drugs including warfarin, statins, antihistamines, birth control and HIV medication. “If you are taking herbal remedies you should disclose it to your clinician,” said Awortwe. “A potential interaction and its consequences can be very detrimental to the health of the patient.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/jan/22/larry-nassar-trial-usa-gymnastics-abuse-case","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-22T17:35:56Z","webTitle":"Larry Nassar survivor: mother billed for sessions at which I was abused","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/jan/22/larry-nassar-trial-usa-gymnastics-abuse-case","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/jan/22/larry-nassar-trial-usa-gymnastics-abuse-case","fields":{"headline":"Larry Nassar survivor: mother billed for sessions at which I was abused","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The sentence hearing for the former USA Gymnastics team doctor Larry Nassar has heard one survivor’s mother is still being billed for sessions at which she was sexually abused. Nassar spent nearly 30 years with the USA Gymnastics program as well as treating athletes at Michigan State University. He faces up to 125 years in jail after admitting sexually abusing women and girls in his care. Many statements from victims and their attorneys at the hearing, which has stretched into a second week, have centered on the fact that USA Gymnastics and Michigan State allegedly enabled Nassar’s abuse for as long as two decades. On Monday, 15-year-old Emma Ann Miller said she was treated by Nassar as recently as August 2016, meaning she is “possibly the last child he will ever assault”. She added that Michigan State had continued to send bills to her mother. “My mom is still getting billed for appointments where I was sexually assaulted,” she said in her statement. A Michigan State spokesperson told Associated Press that Miller’s complaint was being looked into but insisted: “I can tell you that patients of former MSU physician Larry Nassar will not be billed.” More than 100 women have come forward to say Nassar abused them. The survivors include one woman who was six when she says Nassar molested her, as well as Olympic champions Simone Biles, Aly Raisman, Gabby Douglas and McKayla Maroney. “Adult after adult protected you,” Raisman, who won gold medals at the 2012 and 2016 Olympics, said when she appeared in court last week. “How do you sleep at night? You are the person they had ‘take the lead on athlete care’. I cringe to think your influence remains in the policies they [USA Gymnastics] claim will make athletes safe. “I will not rest until every last trace of the influence you had on this sport has been destroyed like the cancer it is.” Michigan State, USA Gymnastics and the United States Olympic Committee, have all been named as co-defendants in civil suits that appear headed to trial, with allegations that officials knew about Nassar’s abuse. On Monday, USA Gymnastics said three board members have decided to resign over the scandal. USA Gymnastics president Kerry Perry said: “USA Gymnastics thanks Paul Parilla, Jay Binder and Bitsy Kelley for their many years of service to this organisation. We support their decisions to resign at this time. We believe this step will allow us to more effectively move forward in implementing change within our organisation.” Michigan State may well face action from Miller. She said she intended to pursue the university through court. “Are you listening, MSU? I’m 15 years old and I’m not afraid of you, nor will I ever be,” Miller said. “At 15, I shouldn’t know the inside of a courtroom, but I’m going to become real comfortable in one. So should you. I didn’t choose this circumstance. Nassar made that choice for us: your 20-year child-molesting employee. This is a burden at 15 I shouldn’t have to bear. But believe me MSU, bear I will.” Nassar was the target of derision last week when he told the judge that it was too difficult for him to listen to the victim impact statements. “You may find it harsh that you are here listening, but nothing is as harsh as what your victims endured for thousands of hours at your hands,” said Aquilina. Nassar had already been sentenced to 60 years in prison in a separate case, regarding child abuse images."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"society/2018/jan/23/carillion-prisons-terrible-state-andrea-albutt-prison-governors-chief","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-23T14:00:03Z","webTitle":"Andrea Albutt: ‘Carillion has left our prisons in a terrible state’ | Erwin James","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jan/23/carillion-prisons-terrible-state-andrea-albutt-prison-governors-chief","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/jan/23/carillion-prisons-terrible-state-andrea-albutt-prison-governors-chief","fields":{"headline":"Andrea Albutt: ‘Carillion has left our prisons in a terrible state’","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Andrea Albutt, the president of the Prison Governors Association, is angry. The former army nurse, who joined the prison service as a young hospital officer in 1990, announced last week that despair was “running through the veins” of her organisation. With the highest rates of self-harm, suicide, drug use and violence ever seen and the recent scathing prison inspection reports on HMPs Liverpool and Nottingham, the prison system has arguably reached the lowest point in its history. The collapse of Carillion, the construction company responsible for prison maintenance contracts, has only added to its woes. “It’s a big deal,” says Albutt. “Governors have had to run prisons with not-fit-for-purpose contracts which failed to deliver the promised service. These contracts have failed in their entirety, leaving accommodation and maintenance in a far worse state than when governors owned their own works departments. “We desperately need a reintroduction of the prison works department. I can then say to my works guys, ‘the seg’s [segregation unit] in a mess, needs work, B wing needs new windows’. I, as the governor, the boss, tell them – and then they crack on with it. With an external contract, governors are not empowered to do that. Too much senior management time has been spent trying to deal with these contracts instead of strategically managing prisons.” Since taking over the £200m maintenance and cleaning contracts for the prison service, agreed by the then justice secretary, Chris Grayling, in 2014, Carillion has been continually criticised by the Prisons Inspectorate and Independent Monitoring Boards (IMBs) for its failure to carry out contracted works. In its latest annual report, the Independent Monitoring Board for Dartmoor prison said that Carillion’s contract was “an ongoing source of frustration”, calling it cumbersome and expensive. It is clear from talking to her that Albutt cares a great deal about our prisons. But, I say, why should decent, law-abiding citizens care? If prisoners are living in cells with no windows, infested with rats and cockroaches, many would say, so what? They shouldn’t have committed the crime. “We disempower people when they go to prison,” she says, “so we have to care for them. If we don’t do the best we can for them, what hope is there? You have to remember that prison could happen to anyone – a member of your family, a friend, a loved one. I know how I’d want anyone in my family treated, if, God forbid, it happened to them. “It’s a well-coined phrase – but there but for the grace of God go any of us, really. None of us knows what might be waiting in life, and you have to remember that most people in prison will be released.” The main source of her frustration is the constant change at the top at the Ministry of Justice. This is where she gets particularly animated. “In seven and a half years, we have had six secretaries of state, which has left prison governors punch-drunk with change,” she says. “We have endured constant interference from ministers who have little or no knowledge of the complexities of prisons, and who leave our service in a disastrously worse state than they found it. “So, we had David Lidington for six months and he didn’t do anything. It just feels like they do not care about our prisons. They chop and change secretaries of state without a thought. Ministers don’t know prisons, their special advisers don’t know prisons. They might visit them occasionally, but they haven’t a real clue about how to run one safely and effectively. Even civil servants busy writing policy – they also might have visited a prison, but they don’t know prison.” Albutt certainly knows about prisons. She joined the prison service in the first place, she says, “just to pay the mortgage,” but it soon turned into her vocation. She spent seven years patrolling prison landings, including HMP Woodhill, a Category A prison holding some of the most dangerous prisoners in the country, before being promoted to management. “As one of the first women into Brixton, I quickly saw that it was a brutal place – and I was just shocked at some of the things I saw,” she recalls. “As a nurse in the army I’d seen tragedy, but the violence of prison was something else.” Initially her male colleagues were “terrible” she says. “I don’t know if they felt threatened by women entering their male environment, undermining their perceived macho culture.” In contrast, she says male prisoners were generally quite protective of her and her female colleagues. “I have to say, though, that there were times in that first six months when treatment by male colleagues was so bad, I thought about getting out. But I stuck it out and I’m glad I did. In that respect, it’s a different world in prison these days.” What’s her advice to the new justice secretary, David Gauke? “The one positive thing is that the path we’re on now, started by Michael Gove and then carried on by Liz Truss, is helping us make, possibly – and I emphasise possibly – some inroads into the decline. I don’t know David Gauke at all; we had a brief conversation on the phone, but I just hope that he doesn’t decide to go down a completely different path. “We lost 7,000 staff and apparently we’re getting 2,500 back. But that still leaves us with 1,500 vacancies, so in fact we need closer to 4,000. I was talking to a colleague last week, and I think they are wondering in the MoJ why things aren’t improving. Well, if you had new officers who were experienced and confident you might get some improvement. But if you’ve got brand new officers going into a place like Liverpool, it’s going to take a while for them to get confident, to acclimatise and to make a difference,” she says. “A failing prison takes forever to turn around. To get back to where we were 10 years ago is going to take years. That’s something I’m determined to get through to ministers.” She also wants a public inquiry into government policy in the prison service over the past decade. “It’s highly unlikely we’ll get one,” she admits. “We have the Grenfell inquiry and rightly so. But if you think of the number of people who have killed themselves in prison in recent years [2,022 since 1990], so many people have died in our care in prison. We need to look and find out why.” Curriculum vitae Age: 51. Family: Married, three stepsons, one grandson. Lives: Gower, Wales. Education: St Leonard’s, Durham.

That is about the only happy element of the story Bahn, who works at a hospital in California, went on to tell on This Won’t Hurt a Bit, a medical podcast, about a man who arrived at hospital carrying a plastic bag. Inside the bag, wrapped around the cardboard tube of a toilet roll, was a 1.7-metre (5ft 6in) tapeworm. Bahn measured it once he had unravelled it on the hospital floor. The patient had complained of abdominal pain. During a bout of bloody diarrhoea, reports Bahn, “he says: ‘I look down and I look like there’s a piece of intestine hanging out of me.’ What’s racing through his mind is he thinks he’s dying … He grabs it and he pulls on it and it keeps coming out. ‘What is this long piece of entrail?’ And he picks it up and looks at it and what does it do?” There is a dramatic pause to enhance the horror. “It starts moving.” Bahn said that the tapeworm had probably come from the patient’s daily intake of salmon sashimi. “He told me he was freaked out, but I guess when you think you’re dying because your entrails are shooting out your bottom and you find out it’s not you, but something else, that’s probably a good thing.” The story has attracted attention all over the world, as these things tend to do, says Peter Olson, a tapeworm expert and a researcher at the Natural History Museum’s life sciences department, “because they’re gross”. The worm, he says, was “almost certainly something called the broad fish tapeworm ... salmon is one of the main ways you would pick it up, if you don’t cook the meat.” The life of the broad fish tapeworm involves more than one host. “A typical life cycle might include a bear that feeds on salmon, then defecates back into the river. The larvae would be passed into the environment and, in the case of an aquatic life cycle like this, it would be eaten by something like a copepod, a little crustacean. When that copepod is eaten by a fish, it would transform into a larval tapeworm and that’s what is being transmitted to a human in this case. That would go to the intestine and grow into this giant worm.” The tapeworm is a monstrous and impressive creation. It has a segmented body, with male and female reproductive organs in each segment, so it is capable of self-fertilisation. It does not have a head as such – its “head” is only useful for holding on to its host’s gut, rather than for “eating” (it absorbs nutrients through its skin). In many cases, you would not know you were infected. You might spot bits of tapeworm segment in your stool – small, pale, rice-like bits – or experience stomach pain or vomiting. Of the more than 10,000 known species of tapeworm, only a small number can infect humans. The type of tapeworm you might pick up from sushi or undercooked fish is deeply unpleasant, but relatively harmless – although it may cause gastric symptoms and allergic reactions. In rare cases, it can obstruct the intestine (a worm can reach a length of 15 metres or even 25 metres, according to one scientific paper). It is fairly easily treated with the type of worming tablets given to pets. In those cases, Olson says chillingly, the human is the “final host”. But it is when we are the “intermediate host” that tapeworms can cause significant damage. “The problem is that the larvae don’t grow in the intestine, they move to other parts of the body and in particular to the central nervous system,” says Olson. They can cause cysts in the body, such as in the brain, causing seizures and headaches. In some cases, they can be fatal. The transmission is far more likely to come from faecal contamination, rather than eating undercooked meat, he says. “It’s a huge problem in places such as Central America, where there is a large pork industry and amount of pig farming; the worse the sanitation conditions, the more likely there is to be transmission,” says Olsen. Tapeworm infection is thought to be a cause of up to one-third of cases of epilepsy in the region. The fox tapeworm, transmitted from fox faeces, is another variety of damaging parasite. However, although it can be found in Europe, it is not found in the UK. People can get it by ingesting it unwittingly. “A child, therefore, might be more likely to end up with those sorts of things.” Could you pick it up from pets? “Again, only through faecal contamination.” Olson recalls a case where a man was thought to have been infected with a parasite by a dog. However, he had HIV and his immune system was weakened. The tapeworm infection “wouldn’t have survived in him if he wasn’t immunocompromised. In most cases, we don’t share the same parasites [as a dog]. But the dog can bring faecal contamination in from the outside.” Another horrible case involved a patient who had HIV and was thought to have cancer. However, biopsies from tumours found that they were not human cancer cells, but cells from a cancerous tapeworm (he died before he could be treated). He had been infected with Hymenolepsis nana, a common tapeworm thought to affect up to 75 million people at any one time. An infection with this parasite is easily treated, but this case highlights the severe problems it can cause, particularly in areas of the developing world where there are high rates of HIV. These are among the cases that have affected many of the world’s poorest people. Such illnesses could be eradicated with investment in sanitation, education and drug administration – the World Health Organization has added tapeworm infections to its list of major neglected tropical diseases. These are not the rare, horrific-but-fascinating stories of California sushi-eaters becoming host to a parasitic worm. However, doctors have warned that contracting diseases in this way is a risk of which we should become more aware. A case report in the British Medical Journal last March told of a 32-year-old man in Portugal who was admitted to hospital with severe abdominal pain; an endoscopy revealed a parasitic worm was attached to his gut wall and it was removed. It is thought he ingested the parasite while eating sushi. “Owing to changes in food habits, anisakiasis [disease caused by worms from fish, causing symptoms such as pain, vomiting and diarrhoea] is a growing disease in western countries, which should be suspected in patients with a history of ingestion of raw or uncooked fish,” wrote the researchers. In the UK, EU food hygiene legislation requires fish that is to be eaten raw or cooked lightly be frozen first (although some farmed fish is exempt), since cooking fully or freezing kills any parasites. Tapeworms from fish probably cause more economic damage, says Olson, than human damage. “If you have contaminated meat, you can’t sell it. If you’re farming salmon and lots end up with the parasite, you’ve got a lot of meat you can’t sell. In terms of humans getting this parasite, it’s not a killer. It’s just a gruesome thought.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jan/23/davos-capitalism-corbynites","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-23T06:00:01Z","webTitle":"Even at Davos, capitalism’s critics are now centre stage | Rafael Behr","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jan/23/davos-capitalism-corbynites","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/jan/23/davos-capitalism-corbynites","fields":{"headline":"Even at Davos, capitalism’s critics are now centre stage","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"A Swiss mountain retreat for global business elites is not the obvious place to meet sworn enemies of capitalism. It is more the kind of place to hang out with aspiring European finance ministers. That John McDonnell happens to be both of those things makes him one of the more exotic guests at the World Economic Forum in Davos this week. McDonnell’s attendance is less surprising than it would have been a few years ago. When the shadow chancellor and his friend Jeremy Corbyn were rebellious Labour backbenchers, they had no time for oligarchic Alpine jamborees. (Plus they weren’t invited.) That old scorn might not have been forgotten, but the prospect of real power – not anticipated by either man before last year’s election – imposes new nuances of tone. According to a spokesman, McDonnell travels to Switzerland “to explain Labour’s vision for an alternative economic approach to replace the current model of capitalism”. From a man who once itched for socialist revolution, that sounds like tempered zeal. Those in Labour’s top team leave audiences in no doubt of their dislike of markets and the private sector, but the closer they get to high office, the more coy they are on the question of how much of either should be allowed. Is capitalism to be mended or ended? To the terror of Conservatives, Corbyn is good at sounding moderate on this point. Attacks on the Labour leader as a terrorist-sympathising Bolshevik have not destroyed the target. A common interpretation of that failure in Tory circles is that younger generations are complacent about the benefits of the market, therefore easily seduced by the sirens of anti-capitalism. In this view, harrowing reminders of atrocities committed by Stalin and Mao might jolt naive Corbynites out of their ruinous utopian reverie. Millennials do lack both memories of communist dictatorship and affection for Theresa May’s government. That doesn’t mean the former condition causes the latter. And there are plenty of older Labour supporters who remember the cold war without voting on that basis. A more useful way to look at the British left’s relationship with capitalism is as a kind of generalised cultural scepticism. Call it “capiscepticism”. This is the strong sense that the status quo is unjust, without adherence to any specific doctrine for replacement. The capisceptic view of capitalism is analogous to the pre-Brexit Eurosceptic attitude to the EU – convinced it is bad but unfocused on the consequences of abandoning it. The distinction between loose cultural distaste and readiness for ideological destruction only became clear when a ballot forced the choice. To develop the analogy further, capiscepticism’s relationship to hardline Marxism is rather like the relationship between Euroscepticism and Ukip-style xenophobic nationalism. There is overlap. But there are also adherents of the former view who despise the latter. They are offended when critics lump them together. Just as remainers did their cause no favours by depicting every leaver as a Farage-fancying maniac, today’s defenders of free markets are wrong to treat capisceptic voters as hollow-eyed, Lenin-loving cultists. It is true there are enough hammers and sickles on display at Corbyn rallies to make a liberal heart sink. But the banners are mostly in the hands of older sectarian stalwarts. Doubtless their inclusion will harm Labour over time, just as May was unwise to splice chunks of Ukip’s political DNA into the Tory genome. But well-thumbed editions of the Little Red Book don’t begin to describe the wider sensibility that Corbyn has tapped into. The modern capisceptic combines a lifestyle immersed in capitalism with a view of Britain’s economy as an engine of unfairness. I have met them in unexpected places: advertising, banking, the civil service. Many struggle to imagine Corbyn as prime minister, while thinking he has a point. They feel the insanity of a dysfunctional housing market. They resent bonuses for bosses who fail. They see different rules for the rich. That doesn’t make them Soviet revivalists. Capisceptics might also be queasy about the control that vast corporations have acquired over every aspect of our lives, while struggling to imagine life without those companies’ services. This outlook can be satirised as the incoherent babble of a spoilt generation – the cortado-quaffing, iPhone-toting social justice warrior who shares memes about Facebook tyranny via Facebook. Highlighting the hypocrisies of capitalism’s critics as they enjoy its material bounty is sport for smug conservatives. More thoughtful Tories grapple with the new mood in earnest, but their efforts are hobbled by disbelief that the case for capitalism needs making at all. May had a dig at unscrupulous bosses over the weekend but in terms so laden with apologia for private enterprise, it was hard to discern the point she was making. The vagueness of capisceptic politics also needs interrogating before it becomes an ethos of government. A lesson from Brexit is that it is easier to pile up grievances against a system than to map out alternatives. Once the despised object was rejected by ballot box, the impulse to reject turned out to be the only thing the sceptics had in common. Satisfying them all with a replacement is proving impossible. And, as pro-Europeans discovered, scepticism is a slippery opponent. It feeds on unfocused discontent and mistrust of authority without demanding commitment to specific policies. When it takes root in a culture it is not easily refuted by politicians telling the sceptics that things aren’t as bad as they look, or that opposition remedies would be worse. Corbyn’s back catalogue overflows with criticism of capitalism, but he hasn’t pledged to do away with it. Whether that is the ultimate goal, kept under wraps for fear of alarming voters, is a question he ducks. When he is accused of alignment with extremes, his supporters don’t recognise the charge in themselves and they don’t see evidence for it in the leader’s recent speeches. They hear denunciation of austerity, neoliberalism, excessive privatisation and corporate greed, all of which can be understood as symptoms of a system in need of repair, or as synonyms for a system that must be completely destroyed. The scale of Corbyn’s radicalism – whether he intends reform or revolution, a tilt to continental social democracy or something more extreme – changes in the eye of the beholder. There is no majority in Britain for full-blown anti-capitalism, but it does feel as if we are living through a wider capisceptic moment. In opposition the difference can be blurred. But not in government. It would be useful before the next election to know where Labour really stands. • Rafael Behr is a Guardian columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"politics/2018/jan/22/henry-bolton-refuses-to-quit-as-ukip-leader-amid-mass-resignations","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-22T21:07:38Z","webTitle":"Henry Bolton: I won't quit as Ukip leader – and may get back with Marney","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jan/22/henry-bolton-refuses-to-quit-as-ukip-leader-amid-mass-resignations","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/jan/22/henry-bolton-refuses-to-quit-as-ukip-leader-amid-mass-resignations","fields":{"headline":"Henry Bolton: I won't quit as Ukip leader – and may get back with Marney","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Henry Bolton has refused to quit as Ukip leader and signalled he may rekindle his romance with a young activist who sent racist text messages, despite mass resignations from the party’s senior team over his handling of the affair. The Ukip leader insisted he wanted to stay in post to “drain the swamp” within the party, even though at least 15 of his spokespeople have now quit their jobs in protest at his behaviour. Pressure on Bolton has intensified since Ukip’s national executive unanimously voted for him to step down on Sunday, following his relationship with Jo Marney, a 25-year-old found to have sent racist messages. Bolton claimed to have ended the three-week romance but was subsequently photographed having dinner with Marney and admitted they were still in contact. A string of senior party figures resigned and called for him to go on Monday, but Bolton called a defiant press conference outside a Folkestone hotel, declaring he would be remaining in post. He offered no comment on the resignation of more than half of his frontbench and will now face a vote of the membership to be convened within the next four weeks. “I respect the next steps in the constitutional process and will therefore not be resigning as party leader. I repeat, I shall not be resigning as party leader,” he said. He said the Ukip national executive was “unfit for purpose” and he would therefore be proposing a new party constitution with a reformed ruling body for the party. “In a single phrase, it is time to ‘drain the swamp’,” he said, echoing an earlier tweet from Marney. He later told an LBC radio phone-in hosted by the former Ukip leader Nigel Farage that there were still “strong feelings” between him and Marney. He said their romantic relationship was “off, certainly at the moment” but added that “who knows what the future holds?” Farage sounded less than impressed with his successor’s handling of the job, suggesting it had been “pretty stupid” for him to be photographed with Marney. But he said it was right for him to hold out for a vote of Ukip members, just four months after being elected to the post. Five of Bolton’s frontbench said they were not standing down at present, including Jim Carver, an assistant deputy leader, who told the Guardian he was involved in efforts to resolve the situation. Another four are yet to comment publicly. However, the Ukip leader lost 10 portfolio holders on Monday, with spokespeople for work and pensions, culture, London, education, local government, trade, justice and environment, as well as the deputy leader and another assistant deputy leader quitting during the course of the day. That added to five resignations from the spokesmen for immigration, Brexit, sport, Treasury and disabilities over the last couple of weeks. The spokespeople who stepped down were adamant in their message that Bolton should go. Margot Parker, the deputy leader who led a wave of resignations on Monday, told BBC Radio Northampton: “It would be quicker and cleaner if he came to the conclusion he could go sooner rather than later. This is taking time away from doing the job. This puts the party in a limbo situation.” Gerard Batten, one of the most longstanding Ukip officials to quit, said Bolton was irrational and “sticking like muck to a blanket”. And he made it clear that he and colleagues would be ready to come back to their roles as soon as the leader quit. If Bolton does resign, Ukip will be forced to search for its fifth leader in just two years. It was previously plunged into chaos in autumn 2016 when Diane James succeeded Nigel Farage but survived just 18 days in the job before resigning. Paul Nuttall took over from her but resigned after a disastrous general election result for the party when it took less than 2% of the vote. Bolton, 54, was elected in September after a tight seven-way race. But his problems began after it emerged he had begun a relationship with Marney, a Ukip activist, over Christmas. He was then forced to end the liaison after reports that she sent offensive messages on social media, which included racist terms about Meghan Markle, Prince Harry’s fiancee. Bolton’s relationship with Marney brought an end to his marriage to his wife, Tatiana, with whom he has two children. They live in Vienna, where she supports the family – his Ukip role is unpaid – through a job with the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe. If Bolton clings on until the extraordinary general meeting, it spells four more weeks of lurid headlines and negative coverage for a party already slumping in the polls and low on cash. Adding to the sense of existential threat hanging over a party already seeking a new purpose since the EU referendum, it has emerged that Farage is in talks about a new political movement with Arron Banks, the millionaire who was formerly Ukip’s main financier."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/jan/22/philadelphia-eagles-new-england-patriots-odds-super-bowl","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-22T16:18:56Z","webTitle":"Eagles big underdogs for Super Bowl but aim to beat 'pretty boy' Brady","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/jan/22/philadelphia-eagles-new-england-patriots-odds-super-bowl","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/jan/22/philadelphia-eagles-new-england-patriots-odds-super-bowl","fields":{"headline":"Eagles big underdogs for Super Bowl but aim to beat 'pretty boy' Brady","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The Philadelphia Eagles, who have been unfancied throughout their playoff run this season, will be in a familiar position going into Super Bowl LII. They start as -5.5-point underdogs against the New England Patriots for the game on 4 February – that’s the biggest spread by Las Vegas bookmakers since the Arizona Cardinals faced the Pittsburgh Steelers in 2009. The Cardinals lost that game but the Eagles players cared little for history or bookmakers after crushing the Minnesota Vikings in Sunday’s NFC Championship game. “I know [we’re underdogs],” Eagles tackle Lane Johnson said after the game. “Hey, Tom Brady. Pretty boy Tom Brady. He’s the best quarterback of all time, so, nothing I’d like to do more than dethrone that guy.” Many expected the Eagles to fold after they lost their starting quarterback, Carson Wentz, towards the end of the regular season. But his back-up, Nick Foles, was excellent on Sunday – he threw for three touchdowns as the Vikings were dispatched with ease. “I just think you’ve got to keep going at it,” Foles said. “And we all believe in each other. I’m blessed to have amazing team-mates, amazing coaches. Everyone here that’s a part of the Philadelphia Eagles organization is first class.” The last time the Eagles reached the Super Bowl, in the 2004 season, they also faced the Patriots. The game ended in a 24-21 victory for New England but Johnson said he hopes things will be different this time around. “For what they did to us in 2004, to get payback, there would be nothing sweeter than that,” Johnson said. “I remember watching that game when I was 14 years old. I was hoping the Eagles would win. Just coming up short, you could feel the pain, and you could also feel the passion of what this city wants. And we’re here, so it’s right at our fingertips.” Earlier on Sunday, workers in Philadelphia had greased light poles to avoid celebrating Eagles fans climbing up them. That didn’t stop wild scenes in the city as the team clinched their Super Bowl place. There were no reports of serious incidents of misbehavior, although one fan had a very painful meeting with a pillar as he ran besides a train."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"politics/2018/jan/22/the-case-against-and-for-private-finance-initiatives","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-22T17:10:25Z","webTitle":"Was the EU to blame for the switch to PFI? | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jan/22/the-case-against-and-for-private-finance-initiatives","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/jan/22/the-case-against-and-for-private-finance-initiatives","fields":{"headline":"Was the EU to blame for the switch to PFI?","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"George Monbiot (Opinion, 17 January) asserts that the PFI bosses fleeced us all. Twenty years ago there were exceptions. Oxfordshire county council and many other councils recognised its deceptive creative accounting and avoided using PFI. Central government does not distinguish between irresponsible borrowing for revenue and responsible borrowing for capital. Both are in the public spending borrowing requirement (PSBR) which central government wished to present as low (a high PSBR leads to austerity to reduce it), so it restricted local government’s borrowing and used PFI to disguise its own borrowing. Councils saw PFI as wasteful, so financed new care homes by setting up charitable trusts which were allowed to borrow, schools by selling playing fields for housing, and similar devices. So we avoided being fleeced by PFI and got value for money in our building projects. Dermot Roaf Hon alderman, Oxfordshire county council • The drastic 40% cut to local government since 2010 is one factor in the many problems facing our public services. The onslaught on local education authorities (LEAs) is a major motive for expanding academy trusts (Failing academy trusts ‘stripping’ school assets, committee says, 18 January). The pressure to use PFI funding has hit schools, stripped of LEA support, as well as hospitals and universities. The attack on local government financing is ideological and austerity-inspired. Yet, like PFI, it is ultimately counter-productive, increasing costs, and decreasing quality of service. Sheila Cross Newby Wiske, North Yorkshire • May I suggest that George Monbiot could have expanded his paragraph about the origins and development of PFI to emphasise that the increasing use of such projects by successive governments was mainly to disguise necessary capital spending by keeping it off the UK national accounts. While we have all been fleeced, not all of us have been taken in by this sleight of hand on apparent reductions in tax and spend over the last 25 years. However, it is perhaps the prime example of a majority of voters being seduced by promises of Scandinavian standards at American tax rates. What hope that such impossible realities may feed into a more informed discussion about Brexit in 2018? Hugh Whatley Bristol • I am surprised that Larry Elliott (Opinion, 18 January) does not link John Major initiating PFI projects with his ratification of the Maastricht treaty which imposed limits on public spending in 1992. The treaty effectively outlawed public borrowing on major infrastructure projects, allowing the City of London to successfully lobby the government to introduce PFI. Ted Watson Brighton • There is certainly a case to be made against the PFI deals we have – both Larry Elliott and the substance of your front page article (18 January) reporting on the National Audit Office’s investigations make good points. But your headline on the online version of that story (Taxpayers to foot £200bn bill) takes no account of what we get for our money (hospitals, schools and services), nor of the fact that a large chunk of the headline figure would have to be paid anyway. It then ignores the fact that the actual value of the cash to be paid over the next 25 years erodes with inflation. To make matters worse, you compare it to the cost of financing the NHS for 20 months, without pointing out that one of the reasons for the PFI bill is that it is financing the hospitals and services of the NHS. Stephen Wilcox Amersham, Buckinghamshire • Though Larry Elliott makes a number of good points, it is a pity that he seems to accept without question the argument that taxpayers get a good deal by getting the private sector to provide services more cheaply. As a union official with a significant amount of experience in dealing with companies delivering public services under PFI deals, we find that any savings are almost exclusively at the expense of the workers on the contracts, with cuts to pay, terms and conditions and pensions. Though Elliott concedes that the services delivered by these badly paid and unmotivated staff are almost always worse, he neglects to mention that when the additional costs associated with higher in-work benefits for workers who previously didn’t need them are factored in, even the modest claims of savings made disappear. As such, PFI represents nothing more than the latest in a long line of government initiatives whereby refuse collectors, hospital porters and school dinner ladies are seeing their hard-earned wages redistributed as corporate profits and executive bonuses. As policies go, I can think of few quite as regressive. Andy Prendergast Senior organiser, GMB • A feature of PFI is the ability of companies to “flip” their assets by moving or selling them to investors based in tax havens so the UK government will still have to pay leasing costs to overseas firms that bought Carillion assets, or risk being sued. Far from being deterred by Carillion’s demise, the international financial community is keen to invest in public-private partnerships being promoted by the World Bank to fund what the G20 refers to as the “infrastructure gap”: massive projects to facilitate the extraction of oil, gas and minerals from the global south. It is estimated that $50tn to $70tn will have to be raised by 2030 for this purpose, hence the re-engineering of infrastructure finance to make it more attractive to institutional investors by the inclusion of state guarantees and the ability to securitise and package the lending portfolios for trading. In the context of a global derivatives trade that is already worth $1.2 quadrillion, the potential for financial meltdown in this mega-PFI scheme will be apparent.

In a blogpost, Facebook product manager Samidh Chakrabarti says that “at its best, [social media] allows us to express ourselves and take action. At its worst, it allows people to spread misinformation and corrode democracy. “I wish I could guarantee that the positives are destined to outweigh the negatives, but I can’t,” Chakrabarti adds. Chakrabarti’s post catalogues situations in which Facebook has been accused of aiding or empowering opponents of democracy, admitting the site was initially “far too slow to recognise how bad actors were abusing our platform.” On Facebook’s use as an “information weapon” by Russian state actors during the 2016 US Presidential election, he says: “Russian interference worked in part by promoting inauthentic Pages, so we’re working to make politics on Facebook more transparent. “We’re making it possible to visit an advertiser’s Page and see the ads they’re currently running. We’ll soon also require organisations running election-related ads to confirm their identities so we can show viewers of their ads who exactly paid for them. Finally, we’ll archive electoral ads and make them searchable to enhance accountability,” Chakrabarti said. “It’s abhorrent to us that a nation-state used our platform to wage a cyberwar intended to divide society,” he added. On fighting “False News” on the site, Chakrabarti cited the enrolment of third-party fact-checkers, and the creation of “trust indicators” to “help people sharpen their social media literacy”. Chakrabarti lists Facebook’s attempts to counter numerous other accusations commonly laid at its feed, including that it “creates echo chambers where people only see viewpoints they agree with”, puts women off commenting on politics online and enables harassment of politicians and citizens. In response, he says, Facebook is “hiring over 10,000 more people this year to work on safety and security”, but warns that it is hard to that sort of moderation “at a global scale … since it is hard for machines to understand the cultural nuances of political intimidation.” Facebook is trying to fight the creation of echo chambers online with a feature called “related articles” that shows people other articles about the stories news they’re reading. Chakrabarti’s post is part of Facebook’s “Hard Questions” outreach effort, in which the site directly addresses some of the most damaging allegations levied at it. A previous post in the series looked at whether social media presents a mental health risk – and concluded it only did if users didn’t post enough. In a post also published by Facebook, Harvard Law School professor Cass Sunstein, argued that social media platforms are “very much a work in progress” acknowledging problems with polarisation and the echo chamber effect. But he states that they “are not merely good” for democracy, “they are terrific”. The admissions of failure to act by the social network come after Mark Zuckerberg announced in January that his personal goal for 2018 was to “fix” Facebook, acknowledging that the site makes “too many errors enforcing our policies and preventing misuse of our tools”. Facebook has been directly blamed for damage to the democratic process in a number of countries beyond just the US. In October, it trialled a move to remove news content from the news feed in six smaller nations around the world, including Guatemala, Cambodia and Slovakia. The trial was criticised as “downright Orwellian” by one of the publishers who saw more than two thirds of their readers disappear. “The Facebook explore tab killed 66% of our traffic. Just destroyed it … years of really hard work were just swept away,” said Dina Fernandez, a journalist and member of the editorial board at Guatemalan news site Soy502, at the time. “I’m worried about the impact of Facebook on democracy.” As the trial went on, reports from a number of the nations involved suggested that some of Fernandez’s fears may have been accurate. The New York Times reported that Cambodia, Slovakia, Bolivia and Sri Lanka all saw massive reductions in the amount of trusted news content shared on the site – with little corresponding reduction in low-quality, politically inflammatory memes that still spread like wildfire across the network. In January, Facebook announced a similar change to that trialled in the smaller nations would be rolled out worldwide, acting to deprioritise news in general on the site, a move that has been called bad for democracy.

A panel discussion organised by the Jewish Leadership Council was due to be held on Wednesday at Amnesty International’s UK headquarters. But the human rights organisation pulled the event on Friday, saying it was not appropriate for it to host supporters of Israeli settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem. The panel was to discuss the role of the UN human rights council in Israel, and included a speaker from UN Watch, an organisation that is highly critical of UN policies on Israel’s 50-year occupation of Palestinian territories and claims the global body is biased against Israel. According to the JLC, Amnesty originally agreed to take part in the debate as well hosting the event. It withdrew from the panel several months ago but agreed it could still take place at its London offices. On Friday Amnesty wrote to the JLC saying it was “currently campaigning for all governments around the world to ban the import of goods produced in the illegal Israeli settlements. We do not, therefore, think it appropriate for Amnesty International to host an event by those actively supporting such settlements.” Settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem are illegal under international law, and many diplomats believe they are a serious impediment to establishment of a Palestinian state. The EU has said produce from the settlements should be clearly labelled to allow consumers to make informed choices about whether or not buy them. A grassroots campaign to boycott Israeli settlement produce has gained momentum in recent years. The JLC, an umbrella body of 32 Jewish organisations, says it has no position on settlements, although it opposes the boycott campaign and its member organisations have a “range of opinions”. Its chief executive, Simon Johnson, said: “We support the state of Israel and strongly advocate for a two-state solution.” Johnson addressed a rally in London 13 months ago against UK support for a UN resolution condemning Israeli settlements. He told protesters the UN was attempting to “delegitimise” Israel’s claim to holy sites in East Jerusalem and the West Bank. Jonathan Goldstein, the JLC’s chairman, said Amnesty’s decision was disgraceful. “By withdrawing their offer to host an event on the role of the UN human rights council, it is clear that Amnesty International UK’s claim ‘to protect freedom of expression’ is only on their terms,” he said. “We have long argued that aggressive criticism of Israeli government policy creates an environment where antisemitism thrives, and it is highly regrettable that on this occasion Amnesty International UK’s decision has targeted the Jewish community.” Kerry Moscogiuri, of Amnesty International UK, said: “We reserve the right to withhold permission for our building to be used by organisations whose work runs directly counter to our own. “The presence of UN Watch is of significant concern and they have been active in the promotion of the event. We have partners and colleagues – both Israeli and Palestinian – working on the ground and this does put some of their working relationships at risk.” The JLC said it would announce a new venue for the debate in due course."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2018/jan/22/uk-firms-report-robust-confidence-levels-for-2018","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-22T18:30:28Z","webTitle":"UK firms report 'robust confidence levels' for 2018","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jan/22/uk-firms-report-robust-confidence-levels-for-2018","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/jan/22/uk-firms-report-robust-confidence-levels-for-2018","fields":{"headline":"UK firms report 'robust confidence levels' for 2018","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Nine out of 10 business leaders in Britain are upbeat about the growth prospects for their companies over the coming year despite uncertainty about the impact of Brexit, the consultancy firm PwC has reported. In its annual survey of chief executives to mark the start of the World Economic Forum in Davos, PwC found that optimism about the health of the global economy was boosting confidence. The report said 36% of business leaders expected the global economy to strengthen in 2018, more than double the 17% who forecast an improvement during 2017 in last year’s survey. Almost 200 UK executives were questioned as part of PwC’s survey of the business mood in 85 countries, with 88% saying they were optimistic about their organisation’s growth prospects for the next 12 months, broadly in line with the global figure of 87%. Kevin Ellis, the chairman and senior partner of PwC, said: “Robust confidence levels among UK CEOs points to resilience in uncertain times, but this is tempered by a big dose of realism about the challenges ahead. Brexit uncertainty, regulation, availability of skills and cyber are key concerns but business leaders remain confident they can navigate through them.” The report shows that UK boardrooms are braced for robots and artificial intelligence to transform the way they do business over the next five years, with 69% of executives expecting disruption from technological change. Ellis said: “Disruption from emerging technology is now a fact of life and business leaders are considering how the fourth industrial revolution will impact their operations and employees. “At the same time, they also have the day-to-day demands of managing costs and growing their businesses. How UK businesses respond to these short- and long-term opportunities and challenges will determine their own and the UK’s future success.” In a separate report, the World Economic Forum said the UK came 21st in its new measure of economic performance designed to be an alternative to gross domestic product. Norway, Iceland, Luxembourg, Switzerland and Denmark filled the first five places in the WEF’s inclusive development index, an annual assessment that measures how 103 countries perform on 11 dimensions of economic progress in addition to GDP. Britain was ranked fourth of the G7 industrial nations – behind Germany (12th), Canada (17th) and France (18th) but ahead of the US (23rd), Japan (24th) and Italy (27th). The WEF said a new performance measure was badly needed. “Decades of prioritising economic growth over social equity has led to historically high levels of wealth and income inequality and caused governments to miss out on a virtuous circle in which growth is strengthened by being shared more widely and generated without unduly straining the environment or burdening future generations.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/jan/22/venice-authorities-step-in-after-four-tourists-charged-1000-for-meal","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-22T18:18:55Z","webTitle":"Venice authorities step in after four tourists charged £1,000 for meal","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jan/22/venice-authorities-step-in-after-four-tourists-charged-1000-for-meal","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jan/22/venice-authorities-step-in-after-four-tourists-charged-1000-for-meal","fields":{"headline":"Venice authorities step in after four tourists charged £1,000 for meal","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The police chief and mayor of Venice have pledged action after four Japanese tourists said they were presented with a bill of €1,100 (£970) for four steaks and a plate of mixed grilled fish, washed down with water. Another three women in the same group suspected they might be taken for a ride at the restaurant near St Mark’s Square and ate elsewhere, the Ansa news agency reported, but still ended up paying €350 (£308) for three dishes of seafood pasta. “We will thoroughly examine this episode over the coming days. We’ll make sure the complaint was justified,” the mayor, Luigi Brugnaro, said on Twitter. “If this shameful episode is confirmed, we’ll do all we can to punish those responsible. We are for justice, always!” It is unclear why the tourists, among an estimated 30 million who visit Venice each year, did not refuse to pay the bill. They filed a complaint after leaving the city in Italy’s north-east and upon returning to Bologna, where they were on a study visit. A spokesman for the restaurant, which according to local media is owned by Chinese investors and managed by an Egyptian, reportedly told journalists he had “no recollection of any problems with Japanese customers”. A residents’ action group, Gruppo 25 Aprile, jumped on the case as further evidence of the risk that tourists run of being ripped off. “We defend local residents, and whoever puts the good name of Venice at risk harms all Venetians,” it said. The group’s spokesman, Marco Gasparinetti, said that in the immediate vicinity of St Mark’s Square in the historic city centre, only 1% of restaurants were still owned and operated by locals. With Carnival fast approaching, he said, the group planned to publish “a user’s guide for visitors on how to survive in Venice, with details on the kind of situations to avoid” on its Facebook page. Other associations are considering introducing a seal of approval for strictly local businesses. In November, a British family of three from Birmingham were charged €526 (£463) for lunch – including €297 for a platter of grilled fish – in the Trattoria Casanova on a busy tourist route between St Mark’s Square and Santa Maria Formosa."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"artanddesign/2018/jan/23/museum-of-selfies-los-angeles-interview","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-23T11:00:00Z","webTitle":"'Art can be for everyone': behind the scenes at the Museum of Selfies","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/jan/23/museum-of-selfies-los-angeles-interview","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2018/jan/23/museum-of-selfies-los-angeles-interview","fields":{"headline":"'Art can be for everyone': behind the scenes at the Museum of Selfies","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Museums are no longer just places to see art – they’re venues to take selfies posted with #museum. So why not call out the elephant in the room? That’s the philosophy behind the Museum of Selfies, a pop-up exhibition which opens next month in Los Angeles. The exhibition traces the history of self-portraits from the prehistoric era to 2006, the year Paris Hilton claims to have “invented” the selfie. There are self-portraits in 21st-century art, mirror selfies by Jacqueline Kennedy in the 1960s, food selfies from Instagram, iconic skyscraper selfies and the infamous bathroom selfie. Naturally, there is an entire section devoted to “the art of the narcissist”. The California game designers Tommy Honton and Tair Mamedov came up with the idea last year after learning that more people take selfies with Leonardo da Vinci’s Mona Lisa in the Louvre in Paris than photograph the artwork itself. “We joked around with the idea of a selfie museum and thought: ‘What about a space that explored something that was polarizing but undeniably catchy, in terms of selfie culture?’” asked Honton. “We bring in sceptics while exploring the history and the culture around this whole phenomenon.” The 8,000 sq ft museum, which is set in a former department store, will be divided into two sections. The first is a timeline of the selfie from the first cave painting to Facebook and cellphone cameras. “We want to show people all these things had to converge for selfie culture to become a thing,” said Honton. “If we didn’t have social media, the selfie probably wouldn’t have taken off.” The internet revolutionized the selfie, said Honton. “You can take a selfie with a Polaroid, but unless you can share it, or upload it quickly, what effect will it have?” he asks. “Selfies are universal – it’s culturally represented.” The second part of the exhibition is a series of contemporary artists who have made artwork inspired by selfie culture, though their names are currently under wraps. The museum also hopes to announce something in the museum which will merit inclusion in the Guinness Book of World Records. But while you might think a space like this is just another digitally driven exhibition, the museum has installations where people can make their own selfies. There are photo-op setups and a gym-like setting where guests can walk into a mirror showing six-pack abs or a “crazy pretzel” yoga pose. “It’s all sculpture. We wanted things to be physical, tactile and real,” said Honton. More than just a theme park, though, the show aims to be educational. Did you know the first self-portrait photograph was taken in 1839 by the American lamp manufacturer Robert Cornelius? He had to stand still for 15 minutes to capture the daguerreotype image. The term “selfie” was Oxford Dictionaries’ word of the year in 2013, but it was first used in 2002 in an online forum in Australia. Today, more than 2m selfies are uploaded daily. But should we be worried by selfie culture? “We all have egos. Selfies aren’t bad unless they’re at the sake of your mental health, sanity or your life,” said Honton. That concern taps into an eerie section of the museum, which is devoted to death selfies. More than 300 people have died from selfie-related accidents, including drowning from taking selfies in water, falling on to railway tracks or tumbling off the tops of buildings. “Why do people do this? Is it worth dying for a photo?” asks Honton. “We try and look at the psychology. We hope people will ask ‘why am I taking this photo?’ and ‘why do people do as they do?’” There are no photos of the Kardashians in the exhibition, but they’re referenced as a default. “The fact that a famous person can pose for a photo with their phone in front of a mirror and have it be culturally relevant says a lot about our culture,” said Honton. “Their ‘just woke up’ selfies are mostly ads. It’s almost an art to make something look like its authentic when it’s staged.” Ellen DeGeneres’ 2014 Oscar selfie, one of the most liked and shared images on Twitter, had a certain quality that made it successful – beyond its star-studded cast. “The strongest aspect people connect with in selfies is [their] unscripted, spontaneous approach,” said Honton. “That Oscar shot captured spontaneity and fun.” The most-liked photos on Instagram are not selfies – Beyoncé’s twin pregnancy announcement last February garnered 11.2m likes, Selena Gomez’s kidney transplant in September got 10.5m likes, and the Portuguese soccer player Cristiano Ronaldo’s announcement of his fourth child’s birth is currently the most-liked photo on Instagram, with 11.29m likes. The museum hopes to have its viewers question why we take and post photos in the first place. “Selfies are easy to document a trip, a moment, something to brag about,” said Honton. “It makes it easier to rely on a photo as a memory, but does a selfie make it more personal, or is it just to hoard them? People use it as a replacement for experiencing the real thing.” Thankfully, the museum doesn’t take itself too seriously, however. “We don’t want this to be an elite, art world, ivory tower thing,” said Honton. “Art doesn’t have to be hard to understand – it can be for everyone.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"crosswords/cryptic/27419","type":"crossword","sectionId":"crosswords","sectionName":"Crosswords","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-30T00:00:03Z","webTitle":"Cryptic crossword No 27,419","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/cryptic/27419","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/crosswords/cryptic/27419","fields":{"headline":"Cryptic crossword No 27,419","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"us-news/2018/jan/22/government-shutdown-republicans-democrats","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-23T02:26:28Z","webTitle":"Senate passes short-term funding bill to end government shutdown","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jan/22/government-shutdown-republicans-democrats","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/jan/22/government-shutdown-republicans-democrats","fields":{"headline":"Senate passes short-term funding bill to end government shutdown","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The three-day government shutdown is over, as Donald Trump signed a short-term spending bill that would provide a temporary respite from the crisis until 8 February. The official end to the shutdown came on Monday night after Senate Democrats voted to fund the government for three weeks in exchange for a promise of a future Senate vote on immigration. The compromise broke the standoff over the fate of Dreamers, undocumented immigrants brought to the United States as children. Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer announced earlier on Monday that his party would support the legislation – which funds the government through 8 February, while extending for six years a popular health insurance program, Chip, that provides coverage to 9 million children. Democrats yielded after Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell promised to put an immigration bill on the floor in February to address the status of Dreamers, if no bipartisan deal could be reached by then. The bill passed 81-18. Sixteen Democrats and two libertarian-minded Republicans voted against it. Among them were a number of potential Democratic presidential candidates in 2020 including Cory Booker, Kirsten Gillibrand, Kamala Harris, Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren. The bill then went to the House which quickly passed it a vote of 266-150. A total of 45 Democrats voted in favor and six Republicans voted against. It must now be signed by Donald Trump before federal employees can go back to work. Trump said on Monday afternoon that Democrats “have come to their senses”, and said he was open to an immigration deal only if it was “good for our country”. Earlier McConnell had offered to consider legislation that would protect Dreamers. “This immigration debate will have a level playing field at the outset and an amendment process that’s fair to all sides,” McConnell said in a speech on the Senate floor on Monday. Speaking on the floor before the vote, Schumer placed the blame on the shutdown squarely on the White House. He mocked Trump for not engaging in negotiations, saying “the great deal-making president sat on the sidelines”. However, he said he felt confident that McConnell would abide by the terms of the deal they reached and tried to place the burden on following through on the majority leader. “The Republican majority now has 17 days to prevent the Dreamers from being deported,” said Schumer. McConnell spoke briefly and took a small victory lap. “If we learned anything in this process, the strategy of shutting down of the government over issue of illegal immigration is something the American people didn’t understand and would not have understood in the future.” The status of Dreamers was thrown into uncertainty in September, when Trump rescinded an Obama-era program, Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (Daca), that allowed hundreds of thousands to work and study without fear of deportation. Trump allowed a six-month grace period for Congress to pass a legislative solution. McConnell’s proposal is to allow debate and a vote on an immigration bill that would pair border security enforcement with a Daca fix – if bipartisan agreement does not emerge before federal funding runs out on 8 February. But many Democrats were wary, fearing they would not have the leverage to force an immigration vote if a spending bill was passed. Richard Blumenthal, a Democratic senator from Connecticut, told CNN the offer was an “an empty promise, a transparent ploy without any commitment to making dreamers legislation part of a must-pass bill”. “I don’t believe he made any commitment whatsoever,” Kamala Harris, a senator from California who opposed the bill, said of McConnell. “And I think it would be foolhardy to believe that he made a commitment.” Even if the Senate were to take up immigration legislation, there is no guarantee House Republican leadership would take action on a subject that fiercely divides their caucus. When asked Monday he believed a reasonable immigration bill could pass the House, Delaware Democrat Chris Coons snickered. “Ha, that’s an excellent question,” said Coons. “Go ask some House members.” Coons was nonetheless confident the debate would be defined by the Senate, where he cited substantive talks along bipartisan lines. He said: “Look, we can’t move forward here if we don’t trust each other, and I will trust that Leader McConnell will keep his word.” Angus King, an independent who caucuses with Democrats, told reporters: “I think the reality is … you can’t get a commitment from the House.” But if the Senate were able to pass an immigration bill, King added, there would be “tremendous pressure” on Trump and House Republicans to act. “Do they really want to start deporting third-grade teachers on March 5?” Over the weekend, Democrats and Republicans blamed each other for the shutdown. Trump and Republicans attacked Democrats for prioritizing undocumented migrants over Americans. Democrats cited polling that showed the public blame Republicans, who run both houses of Congress and the White House. But on Monday Republican senator Lisa Murkowski, who was a part of the bipartisan negotiations to reopen the government, said: “We are in a much, much different space than we were on Friday.” This was echoed by Missouri Democrat Claire McCaskill, who told the Guardian “shutdowns are never good thing but this really motivated a group of Democrats and Republicans to come together and get things done”. Senator Jeff Flake, a leading co-sponsor of legislation to grant legal status to Dreamers, said Trump’s lack of engagement had undermined discussions, in part due to a lack of clarity around the president’s position on immigration. “We don’t know what the president wants,” Flake said. “Let’s put it this way – we shouldn’t rely on the president to move forward.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/feb/06/2018-election-is-no-problem-for-putin-but-what-about-2024","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-06T05:00:15Z","webTitle":"2018 election is no problem for Putin – but what about 2024?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/feb/06/2018-election-is-no-problem-for-putin-but-what-about-2024","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/feb/06/2018-election-is-no-problem-for-putin-but-what-about-2024","fields":{"headline":"2018 election is no problem for Putin – but what about 2024?","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Less than six weeks before a presidential vote, Russia should be right in the thick of a heated election campaign. But with Vladimir Putin’s victory on 18 March all but in the bag, the thoughts of the Russian elite are occupied with a much bigger electoral problem: what happens at the next vote, in 2024? With nothing much at stake this time around, the Kremlin’s most pressing problem for the 2018 vote is ensuring enough people show up on polling day to make the turnout percentage respectable – which the opposition are trying to bring down through calls for a boycott. The problems on the 2024 horizon are far more serious. Over the years, Putin’s dominance over the Russian political landscape has grown. Vicious battles may be going on behind the scenes, but a Kremlin without Putin as the ultimate arbiter seems hard to imagine now. Vyacheslav Volodin, a key Putin aide who is now the speaker of the Russian parliament, said in 2014: “If there is Putin, there is Russia. If there is no Putin, there is no Russia.” By 2024, Putin will be 72. He currently shows little sign of illness, and could feasibly enjoy another decade of good physical and mental health. Under Putin, the influence of other players on the political playing field has been decimated, so there are very few politicians with any real kind of independent support base or profile. But, according to the Russian constitution, the president cannot serve more than two consecutive terms, meaning Putin is obliged to step down. He already got around this requirement once: after governing for two four-year terms between 2000 and 2008, Putin stepped aside to become the prime minister between 2008 and 2012, while his trusted long-term associate Dmitry Medvedev kept the presidential seat warm. He returned in 2012, with a newly elongated six-year presidential term. Now, the defining issue of his upcoming fourth term is likely to be the question of succession. As the country gears up for an election in which the only candidate who has mounted a real campaign, the opposition leader Alexei Navalny, has been barred from standing, the 2024 question is the one that everyone is thinking about but nobody dares to voice publicly. “I don’t think Putin has made a decision yet about what he will do in 2024,” said one source close to the Kremlin. “He always likes to postpone a decision if it can be made tomorrow rather than today.” The source said Putin had already shown in 2008 that he was not minded to change the Russian constitution, and suggested that Putin might promote a member of his inner circle to president and take on a ceremonial role such as speaker of the Duma, which would allow him to keep overall control. Already, there is frequent speculation about potential candidates for Putin’s handpicked successor, though Putin himself has given little clue of his thinking. “Looked at from today’s perspective it’s hard to see any eventuality where Putin doesn’t take some kind of major role after 2024. Of course everyone is thinking about it, constantly. The elites are scared,” said another source, close to the presidential administration. For years, turf wars and battles between powerful members of the Russian elite have been settled privately, with Putin acting as referee where required. In recent months, there have been signs of the kind of fights that could become more commonplace in Putin’s next presidential term. Most startlingly, the former economy minister Alexei Ulyukayev was sentenced to eight years in prison in December for allegedly soliciting a bribe from Igor Sechin, one of Putin’s most powerful right-hand men. Sechin, the only witness, did not turn up to court, and the evidence appeared flimsy at best, and yet Putin was either unable or unwilling to intervene. Russia watcher Mark Galeotti has written that the Ulyukayev verdict showed Putinism had reached its “ancien régime” stage: “Putin is fiddling while the Russia he has committed himself to building, begins to burn.” The lukewarm level of competition in the current electoral campaign has disappointed even pro-Kremlin stalwarts. “We wanted to make the elections interesting, but we’ve failed, that’s pretty clear. We need to bring real issues to the fore but the elite is against it,” said the source close to the presidential administration. With the result in little doubt, intrigue around the elections is linked to third-tier issues. Moscow’s chattering classes have been convulsed with long discussions about whether to support the liberal socialite and journalist Ksenia Sobchak, who critics describe as a Kremlin stooge intended to provide a veneer of legitimacy to the vote. The Communists have decided against fielding their long-standing leader, Gennady Zyuganov, in favour of a younger collective farm boss, Pavel Grudinin, a big surprise. None of these issues is likely to have much effect on the outcome, however, and the main concern for the Kremlin remains ensuring a respectable turnout, which is likely to require pressure on state workers to vote as well as potential ballot-stuffing in far-flung regions. Even Putin appears to be struggling to find enthusiasm for another electoral campaign, and is short on big ideas. When asked about his programme at the end of last year, he was remarkably vague: “Specifically, it has to do with infrastructure development, healthcare and education. This is also about high technology and improving labour efficiency,” he said. He has failed to give much of a sense of what the dominant themes of his new presidency would be. While the Kremlin has blocked Navalny from standing in 2018 he has nevertheless run an impressive campaign and the creation of regional hubs and a network of volunteers across the country is seen as preparation for the long-term political future. Worried supporters of Putin also have their eye on the long-term. “Our problem is not 2018, our problem is 2024,” said Konstantin Malofeyev, a financier with Kremlin connections. He has backed an organisation calling for a return to the monarchy and hinted that Putin could fill the role of a new tsar – a solution few expect to transpire but which illustrates the lack of current alternatives. “We can see elections are pointless, like showbusiness. We will support Putin fully in these elections and we hope they will be the last elections we have,” he said, during a roundtable meeting with journalists at his Moscow office in December."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2018/jan/22/health-fears-over-boys-as-young-as-13-using-steroids-for-good-looks","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-22T18:56:18Z","webTitle":"Health fears over boys as young as 13 using steroids for 'good looks'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jan/22/health-fears-over-boys-as-young-as-13-using-steroids-for-good-looks","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/jan/22/health-fears-over-boys-as-young-as-13-using-steroids-for-good-looks","fields":{"headline":"Health fears over boys as young as 13 using steroids for 'good looks'","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The children’s commissioners for England, Wales and Northern Ireland have expressed concern at the number of boys using anabolic steroids for cosmetic reasons. The commissioners said they believed that social media was putting pressure on children to try to achieve what they believed was an ideal body shape. Experts who work with users of image and performance enhancing drugs (IPEDs) have reported that boys as young as 13 are using steroids. Social media is seen to pile pressure on children over their body shape and there is also a concern that it makes it easy for them to source IPEDs. The children’s commissioner for England, Anne Longfield, said: “I’d be very concerned with any young person using steroids to enhance the way they look. The real solution is to tackle early on issues around body image and the desire of some young people on social media desperate to match celebrities’ images. “Teaching children in PSHE (personal, social, health and economic) classes in school the resilience not to worry about how a celebrity looks or how their own friends think they look in photos would deter the feeling that risking their health to get such a look was worthwhile.” Sally Holland, the children’s commissioner for Wales, said her office had co-produced a pack for secondary schools encouraging young people to challenge stereotypes about appearance. “There is a consistent pressure on young people to look and behave in a certain way; a pressure that is often amplified and perpetuated by social media,” she said. “We need all young people to know that there is no definition of ‘perfect’ and that individuality is to be celebrated. “Outdated gender norms can often make young men feel like they need to be muscular. For boys and girls, it’s so important that schools and professionals working with children and young people support them to challenge these norms.” Koulla Yiasouma, Northern Ireland commissioner for children and young people, said: “It’s important to educate young people on how they can keep fit and nourish their bodies in a healthy way. “It’s also important that we build young people’s resilience so they can learn to navigate the ever-changing nature of social media” The Guardian has revealed that up to 1 million people in the UK may be taking IPEDs, the majority for aesthetic rather than sporting reasons. A particular concern among health officials is teenagers and young twenty-somethings using the drugs when their bodies are still developing. There are real worries they may suffer serious health problems in 10 or 20 years as a result. Nick Hickmott, early intervention lead at the Young Addaction charity in Kent, said boys as young as 14 were asking for advice about steroids. “These are young people, often high-achievers, who are generally living a healthy lifestyle. They want to make quick improvements without being fully aware of the risks.” Hickmott said those using steroids ranged from talented athletes who wanted to boost their performances to others who simply wanted a honed body to – in their eyes – look good during nights out or on the beach. He said: “We’ve got all the pressures of social media saying: ‘this is what a young man should look like’. In films, in TV, everyone is ripped and young people think there can’t be much harm in it. “These are not disenfranchised people from deprived backgrounds that we are used to working with. They are from the more affluent side of the tracks. We’re really worried about this. We think it’s a hidden epidemic.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jan/22/epidemic-violence-transgender-people-experienced-stonewall","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-22T14:50:40Z","webTitle":"We’re in the midst of an epidemic of violence against trans people | Paris Lees","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jan/22/epidemic-violence-transgender-people-experienced-stonewall","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/jan/22/epidemic-violence-transgender-people-experienced-stonewall","fields":{"headline":"We’re in the midst of an epidemic of violence against trans people","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Of those trans people lucky enough to have a job, one in eight have been physically attacked by a colleague or customer within the past year. Drink after work? Maybe next time, eh. A third of trans people have been discriminated against when visiting a cafe, bar or restaurant. Quiet night in? A quarter of trans people in a relationship in the last year have experienced domestic abuse. These are just some of the findings published in new research by YouGov and LGBT charity Stonewall, revealing the profound discrimination trans people face in Britain. It’s shocking stuff, though not surprising, I suspect, to the majority of trans people who, like me, will have experienced some if not all of these kinds of bullying at some point. Almost half of us avoid certain streets because we don’t feel safe. I know the feeling well. I was called a “fucking tranny” and had rubbish thrown at me on my first trip to London in 2007 by myself, as a newly transitioned, nu rave trans teen. I was staying with a friend who didn’t always “pass” as female – that is, people often perceived her as trans. Alex was a warm-hearted Italian who haggled for buffalo mozzarella in Bethnal Green market while Madonna’s Hung Up played on the radio, but she had to run quite the gauntlet to get there. Every day she left the house a group of men would intimidate her and call her a fake woman and an abomination, which is probably why she didn’t leave the house every day. She killed herself a few years later. Nottingham. I’m 16. A gang of lads quite literally snatched the wig off my head and chased me down the street screaming: “Kill the battyman.” A few months later a group of grown men turned up and bashed on my front door, shouting: “We know he’s in there.” I think they just wanted a cup of tea. Pity I was out. Or there’s the time someone asked me if I was a bloke when I dared to buy a pint of milk. Or the men who shouted, “You’re a fucking tranny aren’t you?” when I was walking home through supposedly liberal Brighton as a university fresher. Or the man who pushed me down the stairs in a nightclub in Nottingham on my 18th birthday because he didn’t think “queers” had a right to celebrate in public. I could go on. It was wrong in the 1960s when people spat on trans pioneer April Ashley in the street, it was wrong when I was too frightened to walk to school at the start of the millennium, and it is wrong now. Stonewall chief executive Ruth Hunt says the UK is an “unsafe, unwelcoming and frightening place for trans people”. She’s not kidding. Last year a British trans woman was granted residency in New Zealand on the grounds that it is “safer” for her there, following years of harassment and discrimination in the UK. Shame on us. But where, apart from New Zealand, can we go to escape to this hatred? It’s everywhere. I won’t bombard you with statistics from around the world but I can tell you that a 2014 report concluded that the average life expectancy of trans women in the Americas is between 30 and 35. This violence is often justified on the grounds that we’re not “real” women, that we’re tricksters, sick men who deserve to be beaten and murdered. I wonder if cosy establishment figures who question whether we’re real women have considered how that directly contributes to this culture of violence? The abuse trans people face doesn’t occur in a vacuum. The things people read or hear about trans people in the media affect the way they perceive and, ultimately, treat trans people. Because while we’ve been being beaten by our partners and colleagues and attacked in the street, the British press has led a relentless campaign against us. Over the past 12 months I’ve seen trans people blamed for everything from perpetuating gender, abolishing gender altogether, Trump, patriarchy, floods, hurricanes, their own murders, suppressing academic freedom, and destroying truth itself. Forget potential nuclear war, global warming and the many other threats we face: sometimes you’d be forgiven for thinking that trans people are public enemy number one. But here’s the thing: trans people can’t be a threat to civilised society, because we don’t live in one. Bullied, stigmatised and on the receiving end of death threats, almost half of trans pupils in Britain have attempted suicide. Research tells us that people who are part of stigmatised social groups suffer chronically high levels of stress that affect their mental and physical health. In a civilised society people like me would be able to go about our daily business without feeling constantly under siege. We’d be free to work, to live, to love, without harassment and fear of abuse. We’re not. I’m lucky enough to blend in as a woman these days so I feel relatively safe, or as safe as any other woman in 2018, which, admittedly, isn’t necessarily saying a great deal. But even this safety is conditional. It shouldn’t be OK for me to walk down the street because people can’t, touch wood, tell that I am trans. It should be OK for the same reason it should be for anyone to walk down the street: because I’m human. Britain needs to take a long hard look at itself and ask why it’s allowing some of its most vulnerable citizens to be bullied like this. It’s time to admit we’ve got a serious problem in this country. The Stonewall study isn’t just about trans people. It’s a portrait of a sick society. • Paris Lees is a freelance journalist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jan/22/distrust-social-media-traditional-journalism-fake-news","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-22T16:43:35Z","webTitle":"Distrust of social media is dragging traditional journalism down | James Ball","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jan/22/distrust-social-media-traditional-journalism-fake-news","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/jan/22/distrust-social-media-traditional-journalism-fake-news","fields":{"headline":"Distrust of social media is dragging traditional journalism down","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"A global survey has revealed twice as many people distrust the media as trust it, a third of people say they’re watching less news than they used to and only 6% of UK adults describe themselves as “informed”. Nonetheless, many in the media see this as good news. The reason is that the survey shows people trust journalists more than they trust “platforms”, such as Facebook and Twitter, and this is being taken as a reassuring piece of news that quality journalism and traditional media institutions are beginning a fightback against technology giants. However, by focusing on social media’s failings, traditional news outlets are fighting the wrong war: just because faith in the social media giants is falling – surely unsurprising after a year’s focus on “fake news”, Russian propaganda and filter bubbles – it doesn’t automatically make things better for traditional reporting. Trust in social media platforms fell just four points year-on-year in the UK, and even after the relentless coverage of social media being exploited for propaganda, and the big tech backlash in the US, fell just 11 points there. Globally, media was trusted less than business and NGOs, and is equal to government – and this trust level isn’t increasing. It might be nice for journalists to see people looking more sceptically at social media firms, but schadenfreude aside there is little here that is reassuring. Beyond the headlines, the news from the 28-country survey, the Edelman trust barometer, is not good. Of the respondents, 66% said the media is more concerned with attracting a big audience than reporting; 65% said they believed outlets sacrifice accuracy to be the first to break a story; and 59% said the media prioritised supporting an ideology over informing the public. The reflexive response of most media outlets – and their leaders – on hearing statistics like this is to go on to the defensive, to say the criticism is unfair or exaggerated, and to highlight the best bits of their reporting as a counter to the unflattering figures. Some of these rebuttals have grounding, but most are largely meaningless. If so many people have such a dim view of media, this needs to be addressed rather than rejected as unfair. The loss of faith in the media isn’t the worst news the survey reveals. This is that large portions of the audience are cutting back on or abandoning news entirely. The study found a third of the UK population said they were cutting back on news, and about 20% said they now avoided the news entirely. Perhaps more alarmingly still, some of the people most likely to switch off the news are in the demographics most appealing to advertisers, and the influential people news outlets would hope to reach. In the UK, the most likely rejecters were educated professionals aged 40 and over, living in London, with children. Their top reasons for switching off were that news was “too depressing”, “too biased” or “controlled by hidden agendas”. This speaks to two simultaneous crises: the first is that, when people turn off mainstream news through fear of “hidden agendas”, they become increasingly vulnerable to polarising and extremist messages from other sources. The crisis in trust, paradoxically, could easily leave us with a proliferation of media that are less trustworthy. The second problem is the more serious: people increasingly see news as just another form of media, which they can choose to dip into or not. If it’s depressing, or doesn’t fit their interests, then why not just turn off? As politicians and others diminish and demean the media, this view becomes all the easier to hold. Let’s face it, news isn’t as entertaining as a new Netflix comedy, but we’re all better off if most of us tune in now and then. Ultimately, government and society benefits from a free and high-quality news media, even if journalists are often a pain in the arse (if they’re doing their job right). The risk at present is that journalistic outlets get distracted by what is in essence a phoney war with social media giants, seeing that tussle as a zero-sum game. In reality, it’s likely they are now wedded to one another, and will sink or swim together. News won’t be saved by the public falling out of love with Facebook. It will take much more than that. • James Ball is a former Guardian special projects editor, and the author of Post-Truth: How Bullshit Conquered the World"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"environment/2018/jan/22/fears-for-future-of-uk-onshore-wind-power-despite-record-growth","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-22T16:35:24Z","webTitle":"Fears for future of UK onshore wind power despite record growth","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jan/22/fears-for-future-of-uk-onshore-wind-power-despite-record-growth","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/jan/22/fears-for-future-of-uk-onshore-wind-power-despite-record-growth","fields":{"headline":"Fears for future of UK onshore wind power despite record growth","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"A record amount of onshore wind power was built in the UK last year, but government policy has been stalling the sector and risked increasing energy bills for consumers, the industry has warned. Turbines capable of generating 2.6GW were installed across Britain in 2017 as developers rushed to meet the government deadline for securing subsidies. The previous record was 1.3GW in 2013. The Conservatives’ ban on onshore windfarms competing for subsidies means the sector’s future prospects are very limited, according to RenewableUK. The trade body expects new capacity installation to fall to 0.94GW this year and 0.37GW next year. Emma Pinchbeck, its executive director, said: “Investment made since 2015 has delivered record new capacity and made onshore wind the cheapest form of power. “But the government’s current policy means that we are missing out on future onshore wind development, and consumers are missing out on a return on their investment through lower electricity prices.” A ban on onshore windfarm subsidies was one of David Cameron’s key manifesto pledges of the 2015 general election. The policy followed lobbying from Tory MPs concerned about apparent opposition to onshore turbines in English shires. But recently ministers have indicated a possible softening in their stance, which several experts have said leaves the UK missing out on a clean, cheap source of power. Pinchbeck welcomed the shift in tone, though the government has yet to change its policy on onshore wind subsidies. “This is an easy win for a government that has recently been keen to highlight its green credentials – and for the consumers that want lower bills,” she said. The record-breaking capacity built last year accounts for a fifth of the total 12.06GW of onshore wind power now installed, which National Grid last week reported had set new records for power generation. Onshore windfarm developers are excluded from bidding from the £557m pot of subsidies that offshore projects will be able to compete for next year. While windfarms at sea have commanded headlines because of their falling costs, those on land still have more than twice the energy capacity. Energy companies that want to continue building onshore have argued that to compete at a low enough price to win subsidies, new windfarms would be located in Wales and Scotland, which have the windiest sites. That should allay any political concerns over England, they say. ScottishPower commissioned research that suggested new onshore windfarms were now so cheap that subsidies would help lower the cost of capital but would effectively be cost-free for householders, who pay the subsidies through energy bills. Npower’s German owner, Innogy, operates 17 onshore windfarms in the UK and is building five more. It said it was exploring all options to make them economically viable but was frustrated by the government ban. Tanya Davis, head of business development at Innogy SE, said: “We don’t currently have a clear route to market. There isn’t access to a CFD [a type of subsidy contract] for onshore wind and this means less projects will be built. “In the coming years there will be a little bit of a lull in construction. This is really frustrating. We should be allowed to participate in a technology neutral auction because we are one of the cheapest forms of generation.” But judging from the Conservative party conference last year, there was “more appetite” from the government to reopen support for onshore windfarms, Davis said. The German firm is exploring power purchase agreements with big energy using corporations as well as the possibility of sites windy enough to work on wholesale prices alone. Hans Bunting, chief operating officer of renewables at Innogy SE, said: “Onshore wind is not at its end.” A spokesperson for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said: “We are pleased to see that established technologies, such as onshore wind and solar, are driving costs down for consumers. If this continues, and they have local support, they may play a significant role in the energy mix in future.” • Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2018/jan/30/savages-the-wedding-sabri-louatah-review-sharp-political-thriller","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-30T07:00:15Z","webTitle":"Savages: The Wedding by Sabri Louatah review – sharp French political thriller","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jan/30/savages-the-wedding-sabri-louatah-review-sharp-political-thriller","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/jan/30/savages-the-wedding-sabri-louatah-review-sharp-political-thriller","fields":{"headline":"Savages: The Wedding by Sabri Louatah review – sharp French political thriller","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"This novel arrives in English with a high reputation from France, where it was published in 2011 and was an immediate bestseller. It won almost unanimous praise from the French press and feverish, if unlikely, comparisons with Philip Roth, Zadie Smith and Elena Ferrante. TV rights were sold and literary prizes have been won. This phenomenon was all the more amazing given that, when all of this happened, Louatah was still in his late 20s, a nobody from the gritty town of Saint-Etienne, addicted to American cop shows, and in every sense at a far remove from the Parisian literary world. The central premise is that France is about to elect its first president of Arab (Algerian) origin. Idder Chaouch – nicknamed the “French Obama” by the American press – is meant to heal the old wounds of race and religion in France with a new, liberal and inclusive government. He is charismatic and mischievous, a graduate of the elite Ecole National d’Administration who speaks fluent English; he is also aware that a dangerously large section of the French population wants to kill him. In the run-up to the final vote tension builds as the possibility of a terrorist attack – most probably from an Islamist group – grows ever closer. Meanwhile we have the Nerrouche family, Algerians established in France, who are gathering for a big reunion at a family wedding in Saint-Etienne. Like all families, there are rifts, power plays and multilayered grudges. There is also an indirect link to Chaouch. One member of the family, Fouad, is a well-loved celebrity in France – a Zidane-like figure who plays a fictional football coach on TV. Most significantly, Fouad has also just endorsed the presidential candidate, a gesture that may well tip the balance. This is where the real danger for Chaouch lies. More specifically, Fouad’s cousin Krim, an angry and lost soul, has fallen in with powerful gangsters and is easy prey for manipulation. So the scene is set for a conflict where very different worlds collide. This ending is also a cliffhanger. And it works: like any good Netflix series you are now locked in and waiting for the next instalment. There are three more volumes to come. This is not the first time that the scenario of a French Arab president has been in a French-language novel – this was also the conceit of Michel Houellebecq’s Submission, published the same week as the Charlie Hebdo massacre in 2015. Savages is, however, a far superior book, having more in common with the complex and crafted plotting of The Sopranos or The Wire than the arch, sarcasm of Houellebecq’s dystopia. Louatah says that he was inspired by news coverage of the riots that broke out all over France in 2005. He also says that he was reading Dostoevsky at the same time as watching the news. This makes sense – Savages is both a 21st-century political thriller and a dark premonition in the manner of the great Russian doomsayer. He promises no happy ending to the tensions that still plague France, but the book manages to thrill and entertain, while never losing the sharp political edge that also makes it important.

As we settle into the common room at the top of the youth scholars’ boarding house at Borussia Dortmund’s training ground, on Big Brother-style soft furnishings between table football and a games console, the club’s press officer points out this sort of dedicated facility did not exist when the midfielder was a teenage aspirant. Sahin, from the age of 12, and the other scholars lived in a boarding house in the city centre. It was there he met and lived with Marcel Schmelzer, the club’s long‑serving left-back, “one of the best friends I ever had or ever will have.” For the first six months they did not get on. “I was already a professional and everybody’s darling,” says Sahin, smiling. “I didn’t go to school that much and he had to bring my homework home. The teachers asked him where I was and he always had to lie for me. He’d tell them I was at football when I was actually in bed resting for training.” Last May Schmelzer caused a stir after Dortmund’s DfB Pokal final win over Eintracht Frankfurt, publicly rebuking the team’s then coach for leaving Sahin out. “I never had a problem with Thomas Tuchel,” Sahin underlines, making clear he did not agitate for the departure of a man who ruffled feathers throughout the club in his two years at the helm. The removal of Tuchel was just the tip of the iceberg in a turbulent 2017 for Dortmund, which incorporated the shocking attack on the team bus in April – which he understandably feels he is done with talking about – and ended with Peter Bosz’s short and ill-fated spell in charge. The Dutchman’s tenure had its silver lining for Sahin on a personal level – their paths had crossed when Bosz was the Feyenoord technical director and Sahin was on loan there as a teenager, and the Turkey midfielder was successfully restored to the BVB lineup – though he emphasises the end of a miserable spell of injuries has been key. “In the last eight months,” he says, “I’m the boss of my own body again.” Despite this Sahin’s frustration that the club are not quite hitting the heights of his first spell, or indeed the run to the Champions League final in 2013, shortly after he returned from Real Madrid, is palpable. Things did not work out for Sahin in Spain: after one season on the bench under José Mourinho he left to join Liverpool for a season on loan, which lasted only five months before he was back at Dortmund in January 2013. “The club grew up too much in the last 10 years to accept anything else,” he says, speaking with the insistence of a fan – because that is what he is. “There was no other choice,” he says. “It was always Dortmund.” It was a commitment cemented when he impressed the club on trial as a seven-year-old, in the midst of Ottmar Hitzfeld’s glory era. On the night of the Champions League final in 1997 Sahin’s parents went out for his mother’s birthday dinner. Nuri and his brother Ufuk stayed at home and watched the game, transfixed. Sixteen years later, the newly returned Sahin was on the bench at Wembley as BVB faced Bayern Munich. “I was sure we were going to win,” he says. “The only problem was that Bayern already lost two finals [recently] so, if there’s a football god, he was with Bayern.” When the final whistle went, it all started to flood back. “I started to cry,” he says. “I don’t cry that much because of football but the movie of ’97 – me in the living room, with my brother, with our own Champions League trophy that we were holding in our hands – went through my mind. When we went up, I wondered if I should touch it but I thought no. Maybe God will give me another chance one day.” The Europa League, with a tie against Atalanta on the horizon, remains a target under Peter Stöger but the aspirations from Jürgen Klopp’s era remain with Sahin. “He gave us the philosophy that we can beat anyone,” Sahin says. “I remember when we played at Bayern Munich [in February 2011] in the season we became champions. We were seven points in front of them and we were in the hotel saying: ‘OK, when we get a draw here, there are only a few more games to go.’ I don’t know how but he heard from someone that we were talking [like] this. He’s very smart, as you know … and then we had the most amazing meeting before the game. By the time we got on the bus I knew we’d win the game [Dortmund won 3-1].” The pair remain close – as Klopp promised they would when he accepted Sahin’s decision to go to the Bernabéu after the 2011 Bundesliga win – and discuss a range of subjects beyond football, including Brexit. “I spoke with Jürgen about it,” he confides. “On the night [of the referendum] we were having dinner at his house in Dortmund. We spoke about how it will influence football, and transfers, and what it’ll do to the pound and the euro. I don’t know everything but I want to learn and to speak to experts to know more.” That desire to see life in widescreen extends to thinking post-career, with Sahin booked on a sports management course at Harvard this summer. “I have big plans after football, to give back and to give my children something to be proud of. Not just to talk about how I used to be a football player.” For now, at 29, he has plenty of that left, and recognises his role in guiding the club’s younger talent, though he has no desire to lecture them. The burgeoning quality at the club excites him. “I wouldn’t buy a ticket to watch a player like me. I would always buy a ticket to watch Jadon Sancho beating two players.” Whatever is next, Dortmund will remain his constant. “It’s a story I hope will never end, even after my career has finished,” he says. “Whether it’s as a player, coach, board member or even as a fan, I want to bring the Champions League back to this place. I just want to see what will happen on the streets because I saw it when we won the German Cup, and the Bundesliga, and it was crazy. It would be the last chapter I’m missing to write a book.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"technology/shortcuts/2018/jan/22/four-ways-avoid-being-victim-russian-cyberwarfare","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-22T14:48:23Z","webTitle":"Four ways to avoid being a victim of Russian cyberwarfare","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/shortcuts/2018/jan/22/four-ways-avoid-being-victim-russian-cyberwarfare","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/shortcuts/2018/jan/22/four-ways-avoid-being-victim-russian-cyberwarfare","fields":{"headline":"Four ways to avoid being a victim of Russian cyberwarfare","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Russian cyberwarfare is the new threat to the nation, according to Nick Carter, the head of the British army, which means that the new frontline is, well, you. So it’s now more than just simple self-care to be smart about your online security – it’s your patriotic duty. Update your devices – and upgrade the ones you can’t Some of the most damaging cyber-attacks in recent years haven’t come through elite hackers crafting one-of-a-kind viruses to break into secure government devices, but from exploiting the old and out-of-date hardware that normal people use every day. Take the Mirai botnet: a swarm of millions of hacked devices, it was used to overload servers by bombarding them with traffic requests. But the basic elements of the botnet were simple, cheap, “internet of things” devices such as security cameras or smart lightbulbs, which had glaring security flaws that no one ever bothered to fix. Don’t be a John Podesta “Fancy Bear” is the organisation behind the hacking of Hillary Clinton’s campaign chairman, John Podesta. He fell prey to a phishing campaign, well-executed but simple, that allowed the attackers to download – and leak – every email he had sent or received. At its heart, the hack used a fake warning from Google, asking Podesta to click a link and log in to respond to a security alert. After an aide mistakenly told him the link looked legitimate (he meant to type “illegitimate”), he did – but the link didn’t go to Google, and so he ended up sharing his username and password with the attackers. The easy-to-say, hard-to-do advice is “always make sure links are from who they say they are”. A more useful recommendation may be to join the 10% who have “two-factor authentication” turned on their email. Avoid paying the ransom The WannaCry ransomware attack has been credibly linked to North Korea, which has apparently been stepping up its use of cybercrime as a method of fundraising – a technological improvement from recent history, when the nation was one of the largest forgers of US currency. Keeping a backup of your critical data is a good idea anyway (who knows when a stray cup of coffee will fry your treasured photos?), but it is twice as useful if you can avoid paying a bitcoin ransom to a pariah state. Think twice before retweeting and sharing According to new figures from Twitter, more than 50,000 accounts on the site were created for the express purpose of spreading Russian misinformation during the US election.

While insults traded between Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un dominated headlines, North Korea’s severe food shortages, estimated to have left two in five of its population undernourished, received little attention from the world’s news outlets, the report said. Care International’s study used media monitoring services to track the volume of coverage dedicated to humanitarian crises in English, German and French media during 2017. Analysis of more than 1.2m online articles found that North Korea’s food scarcity was the most neglected globally, followed by emergencies in Eritrea and Burundi. The report does not rank crises in order of severity, but instead compares the news coverage received. About 18 million people in North Korea, 70% of the population, are estimated to rely on government food aid, according to the UN. The situation deteriorated last summer, when the country suffered its worst drought since 2001. Very few aid agencies are able to operate in the country, and independent media and civil society organisations are also prohibited. “Among the most vulnerable are women and children,” the study said. “Almost a third of all pregnant and lactating mothers and more than 200,000 children are estimated to suffer from severe acute malnutrition.” In Eritrea, an ongoing drought has compounded the devastating effects of the El Niño weather phenomenon, which began in 2015, the report said. Access to Eritrea, where President Isaias Afewerki has entered his 25th year in power, is also severely limited. The country has no independent civil society organisations or media outlets. “Rarely do we hear about people suffering in parts of the world that are not popular tourist destinations, considered a low priority for global security or simply too hard to reach,” the report said. “And when crises are under-reported, they are often consequently underfunded. Public awareness and funding for humanitarian causes are closely intertwined.” Six of the 10 crises highlighted in the report also appear in the UN’s list of most underfunded emergencies in 2017. Burundi, the third country on the list, was plunged into turmoil in April 2015, when President Pierre Nkurunziza announced that he would run for a disputed third term, triggering widespread protests and an attempted coup. Almost a third of the population are not able to feed their families, while political unrest and human rights concerns persist. In 2017, a malaria epidemic was declared with more than 6.6 million cases, including 2,875 deaths, reported in the first eight months of the year. The report also warns of a lack of coverage for crises in Sudan, Central African Republic, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Mali, Lake Chad Basin (Niger, Cameroon and Chad), Vietnam and Peru. “We all know that a single photo can make the world turn its attention to an issue. But the people in the countries featured in Care’s report are far away from the cameras and microphones of this world,” said Laurie Lee, Care International’s interim secretary general. “These crises might not make the media headlines, but that does not mean we can forget about them.” Filippo Grandi, UN High Commissioner for Refugees, said the outlook for 2018 is grim. “The political will to resolve conflicts and address the root causes that are driving them – poor governance, growing impoverishment, inequality and climate change – is weak,” he said. “Political leaders must step up and shoulder responsibility for tackling today’s forgotten crises.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/jan/22/michael-oneill-turns-down-scotland-northern-ireland","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-22T13:30:50Z","webTitle":"Michael O’Neill turns down Scotland job to stay with Northern Ireland","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jan/22/michael-oneill-turns-down-scotland-northern-ireland","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/jan/22/michael-oneill-turns-down-scotland-northern-ireland","fields":{"headline":"Michael O’Neill turns down Scotland job to stay with Northern Ireland","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The Scottish FA will speak to multiple managerial candidates after being rebuffed in attempts to prise Michael O’Neill from Northern Ireland. O’Neill has knocked back the offer to succeed Gordon Strachan as the Scotland manager on a four year contract and while there is an expectation he will now sign a new deal with the Irish FA, that isn’t yet a foregone conclusion as the 48-year-old carefully ponders his future. Sources at the SFA have insisted there was a shortlist in place from which O’Neill was chosen, with the plan now to revert to that for other potential managers. Some of them are believed to be in work elsewhere, just as there may be fresh names under consideration given the time that has lapsed during pursuit of O’Neill. The SFA has been concerned by publicity surrounding the O’Neill chase, meaning further talks are expected to take place in a more private manner. The Scots have no competitive match until September but would ideally have a new manager in position before a March friendly against Costa Rica. Alex McLeish is the bookmakers’ favourite to start what would be a second stint as Scotland’s manager but hasn’t held such a position in Britain since 2013. Aberdeen’s Derek McInnes was earlier of interest to the SFA but is likely to prove too expensive. Those with international experience who may feature in the SFA’s thoughts include Slaven Bilic, Jurgen Klinsmann and Iceland’s Heimir Hallgrimsson. O’Neill held talks with SFA officials for more than three hours on Thursday afternoon and would have been the highest paid Scotland manager in history had he accepted the job. After using the weekend to mull over what was a difficult personal dilemma, the former Brechin City and Shamrock Rovers managed informed the SFA of his decision on Monday. O’Neill subsequently issued a statement. It read: “Having given the matter a great deal of thought and consideration, I have decided not to take up the opportunity to become the next Scotland national team manager. “It is a huge honour to be offered the position, however, I do not feel that this is the right opportunity for me at this moment in my career. “I would like to place on record my gratitude to the SFA for the very professional manner in which they conducted negotiations and I would also like to wish them every success for the future.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"books/2018/jan/22/somerset-says-only-volunteers-can-keep-libraries-open","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-22T16:20:03Z","webTitle":"Somerset says only volunteers can keep libraries open","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jan/22/somerset-says-only-volunteers-can-keep-libraries-open","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/jan/22/somerset-says-only-volunteers-can-keep-libraries-open","fields":{"headline":"Somerset says only volunteers can keep libraries open","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Almost half of Somerset’s 34 libraries could be under threat of closure if volunteers are not found to run them. Struggling to meet its budgets, Somerset county council is looking to save up to £520,000 from its library budget. It is preparing to launch a consultation on 29 January setting out plans to use community involvement to keep 15 of its 34 libraries open. If volunteers are not found for the 15 branches, they will close. “We aim to keep as many library buildings as possible open. However, the consultation proposes that, for a number of libraries, we may require community support to do this, through partnerships with local communities,” says a report about the consultation. “We recognise that some of our proposals present difficult choices for communities and wish to stress there is no expectation that communities should step forward. This is entirely their choice. Where communities are unable to provide sufficient support to keep a building open, alternative library services will be provided such as library outreach services, online services or mobile library services.” The council said that the proposals “seek to put the service on a sustainable footing for the long-term, at a time when all council budgets are under enormous pressure”. Councillor David Hall said: “These are challenging financial times. Library services will continue across Somerset whatever the response from this consultation, but our proposals highlight that keeping some libraries open may require community support. Where we are unable to keep libraries open, we will deliver library services in other ways such as via alternative venues or mobile library services.” Author Andrew Miller, who lives in Somerset, said he had used libraries for research and had been taking his teenage daughter to Bruton library “since she could first read”. “I have never seen any of my local Somerset libraries empty. They are a resource like the pharmacy and the post office. Closing them is a further hollowing out of rural communities. To put it more grandly - libraries are a marker of civilized society. If we believe in reading and readers, in the broad social ideal of a place, free to enter, free to use, where anyone at all can have the transformative experience of a good book (not to begin on all the other services a good library provides) then we need to resist the temptation to save a little money by doing away with them. We will lose far more than we gain,” he said. Somerset is not the only region facing drastic cutbacks to its library service. In Northamptonshire, campaigners are fighting the planned closure of up to 28 of the council’s 36 libraries. But Somerset campaigners have fought off threats to their libraries before: in 2011, a high court judge ruled that in planning to withdraw funding from 11 Somerset libraries, the council had failed to take account of its equality duties. Speaking about the new consultation, Friends of Somerset Libraries’s John Irven, who was part of the legal action in 2011, told ITV News: “The question will come when we look at the final resources available, how much local communities can or can’t contribute into these areas and what the ultimate solution is. But let’s not pre-judge it before we start, let’s actively engage and hopefully come up with solutions.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2018/mar/02/is-there-life-after-plastic-the-new-inventions-promising-a-cleaner-world","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-02T10:31:04Z","webTitle":"Is there life after plastic?

The new inventions promising a cleaner world","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Barely a day goes by without a new anti-plastic initiative: the Dutch supermarket with a plastic-free aisle; the Bali inhabitants sweeping the island for jetsam, the moves to get plastic out of teabags - and even out of Lego. And that was all just this week. But can we - or should we - aim to move beyond plastics altogether? What are the alternatives to a material that has dominated packaging for 70 years? Promising new technologies are vying for attention, but plastic is so ubiquitous – and so useful – that it will not simply disappear. Rob Opsomer, systemic initiatives lead at the Ellen MacArthur Foundation believes that 50% of plastic packagings could be recycled if they, or after-use systems, were better designed, and 20% could be tackled by reuse schemes. However about 30% of plastics need a fundamental rethink to prevent them ending up in landfill. It’s a sentiment that is gathering pace, with small businesses, laboratory scientists, corporate giants and individual innovators scrutinising every aspect of the plastic problem, from product design to sophisticated new biodegradable bioplastics. New materials Among those exploring alternatives to traditional plastics is Jeffrey Catchmark, professor of agricultural and biological engineering at Penn State University, who is plumbing the potential of naturally occurring polymers. Among the team’s successes are waterproof coatings made from cellulose and chitosan – the latter a material made by treating the shells of crustaceans. Not only are these coatings compostable, and break down in the environment, but they offer other benefits since they also act as adhesives, making the recycled products even better than the virgin packaging. “In fact [the waterproof coating] is completely compatible with the processes that the recyclers use to treat the paper pulp in order to prepare that for the next product that is made,” says Catchmark. Israel-based Tipa is one of the packaging companies focussing on bioplastics, and is developing their own flexible packaging. While the company admits their products are more expensive than traditional plastic, the approach could tackle one of the big problems with plastic wrappers, such the films that surround your tomatoes. “That plastic is not recyclable because it is three different plastics,” said Mark Miodownik, professor of materials and society at University College London. Tipa claims that its material – produced from a combination of biological and synthetic materials – breaks down rapidly in a home composter, unlike most so-called compostable plastics which only properly degrade in industrial treatment facilities. “Just imagine that all flexible packaging will be treated and will behave the same way as organic waste,” said Daphna Nissenbaum, CEO of Tipa. “What we offer is a packing solution that on the one hand is similar to conventional plastic, it brings us as consumers the same benefits as plastic, but on the other hand, [it is] fully compostable.” However Miodownik is cautious, noting that for compostables to catch on, the starting materials have to be sustainable or otherwise make use of abundant waste materials, such as waste oil, whereas recycling means resources can be used again and again. Nonetheless, so far Tipa’s flexible packaging has been embraced by businesses including snack-company Snact and fashion designer Stella McCartney. Others, meanwhile, have embraced a golden oldie: cellulose. Made from the plant polymer, cellophane is the wrapping that got us hooked on the idea of “seeing what we buy” but ended up being usurped by cheaper films made of plastic with a host of attractive properties. Now some, including Nestlé’s Quality Street are going back, using cellulose films from UK-based firm Futamura for their wrappings. Andy Sweetman of Futamura said its NatureFlex range is made from sustainable raw materials and can be industrially or home composted. And while the toxic chemical carbon disulphide is still used in manufacturing, this is now fed back into the system, tackling environmental concerns. Packaging made from seaweed promises another alternative to sachets and wrappers. Jakarta-based Evoware say both food-grade and packaging-grade products are available, with the focus on use in the food and drink, beauty, jewellery and electronic industries. One use, they note, is to package seasonings for instant noodles, with the sachets breaking down in hot water. Seaweed-based packaging has even been deployed for water, with London-based start-up Skipping Rocks Lab developing Ooho: squidgy liquid-filled balls that last for a few days and can be eaten. Among others keen to see their packaging eaten is Peggy Tomasula of the US Department of Agriculture whose team has used proteins from milk to make films which are claimed to be better than plastic at keeping oxygen out. Improved product design From coffee cups to drinks packaging and juice cartons, solutions are proliferating. A host of companies have taken-off, selling reusable alternatives to single-use coffee cups, and many cafes now offer discounts for their use. Others are redesigning single-use products, like the Triocup – a paper coffee cup which folds over at the top, removing the need for a plastic lid. Triocup co-founder Tom Chan said the ultimate aim was to remove the plastic lining too, making the vessel compostable or recyclable. UK-based FrugalPac, is also looking to tackle drinks packaging, with easy to recycle juice cartons and a coffee cup that, it claims, “can be recycled in any UK paper mill”. Rather than using paper with a tightly bonded plastic layer, the cup is made from recycled paper that easily breaks down at the mill, while the waterproof plastic lining floats free and can be scooped off, or removed by filters. “We should be making it a lot easier for consumers to be recycling these products and the way to do it is to redesign them so that they will go in existing recycling streams,” said Martin Myerscough, founder of the company, adding that eventually the team want to replace the plastic lining. Back to basics New materials take time to develop, and the pressing challenge for supermarkets to introduce plastic-free aisles, or go plastic-free all together, means some are turning to existing alternatives. Iceland has pledged that its own-brand items will be plastic-packaging free by 2023, embracing “a range of packaging comprising paper and pulp trays along with paper bags”. Tesco, which has set its target at 2025, has reduced the amount of plastic in some of its packaging – including meat trays – as well as making supportive noises about the much-mooted deposit-return scheme. Plastic water bottles – possibly the epitome of single-use plastic waste – have already been replaced in venues, including London Zoo which now uses recyclable aluminium cans. Although still single-use containers, cans are recycled at higher rates than plastic bottles, and each is largely made of recycled metal. “Aluminium is the most infinitely recyclable material on the market – as long as you recycle your can it will come back as another can and sometimes in as little as six weeks,” says CanO Water’s co-founder Ariel Booker. “Most plastic gets downgraded, it can’t be formed into another plastic bottle.” While the resealable cans make use of a plastic lid, these are separated during the recycling process, he adds. But new innovations are also afoot: M&amp;S which already has 90% recyclable packaging is among those looking to find new types of black plastic for its ready meals, since the dyes in current packaging mean it cannot be sorted using existing tech and usually ends up in landfill. Clothes While once the idea that a fleece jumper could be made out of recycled plastic was considered eco-friendly, recent revelations about the extent of microplastic pollution from synthetic fibres has resulted in a u-turn, with the majority of modern clothes guilty culprits. Traditional textiles, including wool, cotton, hemp and flax are all alternatives, however that hasn’t stopped new companies springing up with fresh approaches. Among them is Ananas-Anam, which produces a natural fibre from pineapple leaves, while Bionics makes fibres from reclaimed ocean plastic and wraps them or blends them with natural fibres. There is even a new alternative to leather, made from the grape by-products of the wine industry. In summary, there is no shortage of promising technology in the pipeline. But plastic is simply too good at its job to be completely phased out any time soon. “Plastics have come into being because they meet a lot of our needs as people, as humans, and I don’t think we are going to row back,” says Miodownik.

But they can lose their value as the world changes around them. In a world where interdisciplinary research is of growing importance, dividing universities by academic departments creates barriers not benefits. As academics, we’re used to departments. We cling to them for our sense of identity. They provide stability as a store of resources and a physical home. But these monolithic structures are blocking the next phase in the evolution of universities. Departments make it harder for academics to push boundaries as they struggle to find new intellectual homes for ideas that don’t fit neatly into disciplinary boxes. Students lose out too: poorly managed course development across disciplines can lead to a joint degree that is two mealy halves joined together rather than a seamless matrix of ideas and challenges. Inter-departmental rivalries have also long been recognised as a problem for higher education management. Rigid departments and administrative systems can be a drag on efforts to innovate. They are the basis of division rather than collaboration, engendering disputes over resourcing and financing. They introduce barriers between teaching and research activities, leading to hostility and sometimes predatory competition. The result can be unbalanced levels of financial subsidy between departments. This was revealed in a survey of the higher education workplace in 2014, where academics flagged how different subject areas were valued and supported as a key issue – particularly the gap between Stem subjects and the arts. Designing courses that are cross-disciplinary, where one discipline learns from the perspective of another, or interdisciplinary, where the disciplines are integrated, allows for more context-specific programmes that better suit industry and prepare students for jobs, opening doors rather than closing them. It benefits academics too, since research councils now rarely fund research in a single discipline. They’re looking for the broader view and sharper insights that come from the intersection between multiple disciplines that defines new territory – and so should universities. The higher education sector needs to find new structures that demonstrate we’re set up in the most effective ways to wrestle with real problems. While cross-disciplinary and interdisciplinary research centres are common, they tend to be offshoots of departments. In the US, there has been a shift towards more flexible structures, with staff free to move between interdisciplinary centres. There are not enough of these in the UK. Universities can take inspiration from the University of Essex, which has an Interdisciplinary Studies Centre where students can choose modules from across humanities and social sciences subjects and work with staff from different departments. At Bradford University’s faculty of management and law we’re following these initiatives. We’re removing departmental divisions and restructuring ourselves around research. Under this approach, research centres – based around interdisciplinary expertise and collaborations – administer taught courses, using research to inform course creation and delivery. The structure is intended to encourage cooperation between staff and students, strengthen the ties between teaching and research activities, and turn collaborative, interdisciplinary working into the norm. Open, flexible boundaries are likely to become increasingly important for academics and students, as emphasis within universities shifts from structure to cooperation. Everyone is set to benefit: researchers will receive wider input, ideas and energy, teaching staff will no longer feel excluded from higher-status activities, and students will gain experience and skills from being part of live projects. Freed from departmental traditions, higher education will spring into new life.

Water supplies froze. Medical assistance slowed, threatening genuine peril. People began to store fuel. Across the Midlands, families were left without power – no electricity, no heat – in some instances overnight. For those of us safely tucked away indoors, or unaffected by the weather, the news could be shocking. It also brought to mind an unnerving question: would you be ready if calamity struck? The answer for most of us is no, not really. We tend to think of disaster as something that happens to others. But a growing number of people around the UK – preppers or survivalists, in the parlance – are quietly gearing up for the worst. They’re filling pantries with supplies in case their local food chains disintegrate, storing thermals in their cars in the event that they break down in a snowstorm, packing “go-bags” with a collection of bare necessities – water, food, medicine, perhaps a portable stove – supposing they need to leave home in a hurry. If catastrophe were to strike, the thinking goes, a preparatory head-start might well be life-saving. This is behaviour that can sound extreme, but often it’s forged in reaction to events that could affect any one of us. Some preppers are concerned by natural disasters. Others worry about terrorism, or our financial system, or the repercussions of Brexit, whatever they may be. Survivalism has had a dedicated following in America since the 1970s, swelling during the run-up to the millennium in the 90s and peaking again after 9/11. Trump’s posturing hasn’t helped – the threat of nuclear war can send even the most rational thinkers running to the tinned-food aisle. And not everyone is rational. The prepping movement contains overzealous elements, particularly in the US, where natural disasters are bigger and badder and, well, the guns. But those signed up to the movement in the UK are like you and me: relatively normal, with the odd quirk. They just keep a half-tank of petrol in the car at all times, and at least a month’s worth of food, and an alternative way to heat their homes in winter if the gas goes down. Shaun Leonard: ‘I’ve organised escape routes’ When I was 17, Nasa announced the discovery of a far-off planet. News reports hinted at the prospect of the Voyager being deployed, but I never got to hear what the probe actually found. The excitement eventually dwindled and I got on with my life, but the discovery sparked an ongoing interest in space and exploration and, later, in the environment and geopolitics. About 18 months ago those interests led me to prepping. I prep on two levels: first, for events that might cause a bit of social unrest and all of the food in my local supermarket to quickly disappear – a financial collapse, say – and, second, for something bigger: a national pandemic, a major environmental catastrophe. For the first scenario I’ve organised a reliable supply of clean water and a store of long-shelf-life food, and then some practical stuff: stitches for wounds, analgesics, antibiotics, a whole range of meds you wouldn’t normally have, various kinds of equipment needed to start a fire. I have go-bags at home and in my car, because you never know where you’ll be when something happens, and I’m part of a prepping community that has an equipment cache stored in a secluded spot near to my house. If there’s some kind of cataclysm? I’ve organised escape routes, away from the general population. You’ll find me above 900ft – or out of the country. I’m a grandfather now and I’m a positive person, but being a prepper can be tough. It’s difficult to get others on board, for most it’s a no-go subject. A lot of my friends think I’m barking mad. It’s taken me three years to convince my daughter and her family to take more of an interest and, before she eventually became a full-blown enthusiast, my partner used to humour me politely. But there are more and more like-minded people out there in communities around the country: engineers, nurses, doctors, dentists, people with different skills and mindsets and ways of contributing. We’re harmonious. We offer each other support and keep ourselves to ourselves. We see prepping as a way to increase our chances of survival if something happens. And we’re all ready to get out of the way when it does. Beckie Clarke: ‘I’m ready’ Eight years ago the leaders of my church suggested I keep a store cupboard. Hurricanes and earthquakes were becoming more prevalent, and flooding was affecting whole villages within hours. The store cupboard was suggested as something to fall back on – a few months’ food in case of disaster. I live in a small village in Derbyshire. It’s rural. And with five kids I have to be prepared for everything. I thought it was a good idea. I started to store a tin a week – sweetcorn, beans, tinned tomatoes – and, over time, added cases of pasta, bags of rice, boxes of long-life meat and bottles of water. Most people keep a few tins in their cupboard – soup and beans, things like that. That’s what I’ve got in mine. It’s just that I’ve got 70 of each, stored in a brick outhouse that my husband converted. It helps. I’ve never had to panic-buy when snow’s been threatened and everybody else has raced to the supermarket. And I could cut back on the food shop when my husband was temporarily asked to work three days a week instead of five, reducing his pay. Perhaps it’s hereditary. My parents have a year’s worth of food in their store cupboard, including 50kg of wheat, which they can soak to make a vegetarian supplement or grind to make flour. My eldest daughter keeps a 72-hour bag in her car. It’s mostly natural disasters we’re preparing for. I’m concerned about a war’s potential knock-on effects on the food chain, although I haven’t dug a bunker in my garden or anything. And then there’s Brexit. If that doesn’t go the right way, who’s to say we’ll be able to get hold of the things we can get hold of now? But, realistically, we are mostly likely to be affected by flooding or severe snow. There have been times when we have been cut off, unable to get out. We’d need to be prepared if that happens again. And if something happened at the house? We can be clear with everything we need for 72 hours within 20 minutes. We have a family go-bag in the loft: a big tent, sleeping bags, medication, food, a portable stove. My husband’s in charge of equipment and I’m in charge of the kids. We all know the plan. Steve Hart: ‘I can forage, hunt, trap and fish’ Many years ago, while living in Australia, I was bitten by a snake. I’d gone walkabout and wasn’t carrying medical supplies, but I met a few locals who very quickly rustled up a remedy to ease the pain and stop the swelling. That was the first time I realised the importance of thinking ahead, and I’ve prepped in a small way ever since. About 10 years ago I got into prepping seriously. I started to analyse “what-if” scenarios: what if something went wrong near to where I live? What would I do? How would I survive? This country is one of the safest in the world. We have no killer animals. We don’t have earthquakes. There are no major tsunamis. We don’t really have to prep for a huge natural disaster – and there’s very little you could do to prepare for a nuclear event even if you wanted to – so we prep more pragmatically. Suppose you lose your job and money’s an issue. Or the electrical grid goes out and the food chain goes down and all of a sudden every man and his dog is arguing over a bag of sugar. Do you have your own supplies? Do you have the means to cook? And what about keeping warm – could you make a fire? Some of us buy food through an app; groceries are delivered to our front doors. Do people know how to survive without electricity? The difference between me and someone else? Imagine if we both lost our jobs at the same time. Realistically, I haven’t got to spend any money. I’ve got a back-up of food supplies to last six months. I haven’t got to buy wood. I haven’t got to turn the taps on, because I’ve stored rain water and filtered it for drinking. I haven’t got to put the heating on, because I have other means of keeping warm at home. I could be unemployed for a while without it impacting me financially. Whereas someone else, they’re thinking: “Shit, I’ve got a month’s wages. I don’t know how long this can go on for.” That’s a kind of prepping in itself. Our grandparents were the original preppers, really. They could make a chicken last for two weeks. When my wife and I are wandering around the supermarket, I’ll keep my eye out. I’m always looking at a product’s shelf life. I don’t want to buy food that has a shelf life of two weeks; I need five years plus. It’s an attitude, really, but it’s also a fascinating hobby. I’m constantly learning survival techniques: how to forage, hunt, trap, fish, purify water. And I’m informed on larger environmental and political issues by friends in the know. People think I’m a tin hat-wearing nutter, sitting here guarding 3,000 tins of beans, but it’s not all-consuming. It’s like having a spare tyre in your car, or some winter basics: a torch, some candles, a sleeping bag. You can leave it at that, you don’t have to go mad. That’s how I started – I just happened to carry on. Sarita Robinson: ‘People think it won’t happen’ I run the BSc psychology course at the University of Central Lancashire. I wrote my doctorate on survival psychology and completed the write-up in LA, on the San Andreas fault. I’m a big sci-fi fan, and obviously tales of the apocalypse creep into every great story in the genre, but I only really started to consider my own preparatory behaviours when I began living in a city that experiences major earthquakes and spending my days writing about people dying horribly in disasters. I remember thinking, wouldn’t it be embarrassing, writing what I was writing, if someone found out I’d never looked into prepping myself? I’ve always thought the UK was sheltered from major natural disaster. But when I returned from LA I reconsidered, and I started to identify situations for which prepping might give me a bit of an advantage. It’s basic stuff: having a first aid kit in my car, storing extra food, carrying a power bank for my mobile phone – things a lot of us do naturally. Think of mothers with young kids: they’ve all packed a first aid kid, some water, some food. That’s a go-bag. I live about an hour outside Manchester. It’s not the back of beyond, but there are things that could happen, especially as we’re approaching winter: a delivery drivers’ strike, an oil strike, floods. I store a bit of extra food in case the food and petrol chains crumble. I travel with a blanket and thermals in case I break down in snow, lose a phone signal and am too far away from home to walk. My husband once got stuck in poor weather on a motorway. He was grateful for the self-heating food packages I’d packed. A lot of prepping is common sense, but there’s very little of it around. The theory goes that it’s psychologically uncomfortable to think about death and dying, so people tend not to. And people often think that a disaster won’t happen to them, so they’re less likely to prepare. But it’s not very difficult, and it’s not expensive – I buy equipment from Amazon: a survival blanket, a sleeping hammock, one of those bottles that filters contaminants found in water. Most of the time you won’t need it. But it’s that one time when you really do, and you haven’t got it, or you haven’t taught yourself how to use it… that’s when it’s too late."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"music/2018/jan/28/on-my-radar-laurie-anderson-cultural-highlights","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-28T10:00:15Z","webTitle":"On my radar: Laurie Anderson’s cultural highlights","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/jan/28/on-my-radar-laurie-anderson-cultural-highlights","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/jan/28/on-my-radar-laurie-anderson-cultural-highlights","fields":{"headline":"On my radar: Laurie Anderson’s cultural highlights","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Laurie Anderson is an artist, composer and film-maker. Her notable works include the 1981 single O Superman and the 2015 film Heart of a Dog, dedicated to her her husband, Lou Reed. Last week she organised Art Action Day, an event in New York promoting open cultural borders. Her album with Kronos Quartet, Landfall, is released on Nonesuch on 16 February, and her book of essays, All the Things I Lost in the Flood (Skira Rizzoli, £60), is out on 6 February. 1. Restaurant Via Carota, New York This is on my beat between the studio and my house. It’s super cosy: a lot of the tables are communal, and they have menus in the back of their chairs, which they got from a chapel. The best food they do is something called strip steak, which is basically a burger, but one of the best burgers I’ve ever had. I’ve also had some of the best conversations of the last year there: the place, the wood, the wine, all put you in a really relaxed and free mood. 2. Film The Square (Ruben Östlund, 2017) There are not enough comedies now, so I was relieved to see this. It’s hilarious. It skewers the art world, which is long overdue: that whole scene is pompous and ready for satire. The film looks at what happens when people step out of their social structures in Stockholm, and it makes you realise how isolated people are within their scenes. Elisabeth Moss is fantastic in it. I love Swedish films – I’ve just been doing some research on my Swedish ancestors so I feel even closer to them. 3. Place Central Park, New York I live in the West Village, which is pretty far away, but I’ve started walking in Central Park a few times a week, early in the morning. It’s kind of changed my life: it’s a huge treasure of a place filled with meadows and forests and lakes and groves. If you go before 9 o’clock, dogs are off the leash and it’s raucous and wonderful. I’ve started having meetings there: because you’re walking you feel that your thinking moves forward as well. Trees do something to people that is deeply magic: you breathe in a different way and everything looks more natural and reasonable. 4. Exhibition Beau doublé, Monsieur le marquis! Sophie Calle et son invitée Serena Carone This is on until 11 February, so rush over to Paris to see it. It’s at the Museum of Hunting and Nature, which is a 17th-century house in the Marais district with a collection of all sorts of stuffed animals. There’s a beautiful red gown draped over an animal that I liked very much, and a stuffed cat on an upholstered chair that looks like it’s been strangled. The museum itself should be on everybody’s list as something to see in Paris, and Sophie’s show makes it even more mysterious and beautiful. 5. Music A Tribe Called Quest: We the People I love the Quest and I love the chorus in this song: “All you black folks, you must go, all you Mexicans, you must go.” Their righteous anger is so appealing and it’s got a great beat. It’s one of our great new political songs and it’s a relief to hear somebody saying things so clearly – I think rap is one of the few art forms that doesn’t ignore the collapse that’s going on. And also any song that rhymes “ramen noodle” with “simple voodoo” is good in my book. 6. App The Breathing App You’d think that after a lifetime of breathing you’d sort of know how to do it, but not really. This app, made by yoga teacher Eddie Stern, is about how to become balanced and calm. People usually breathe between 15 and 18 times a minute, and this encourages you to breathe at less than half of that, six breaths a minute, which is what meditators and monks do. I think it has a really amazing effect on depression. As our country rips apart, this is one of the things I find really helpful. 7. Movement #metoo This is a really phenomenal, interesting moment. What I love about #metoo is that it gives people a way to look at power and men and women in a new way. People are suddenly going “let’s talk about all women, not just the media-friendly movie stars, because all women face this situation”. And of course there’s a backlash, which happened almost immediately. But I love the fact that people are waking up to the situation and thinking about it and seeing their own prejudices in it that they didn’t really see before."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"travel/2018/jan/28/detroit-michigan-motown-city-new-bars-live-music","type":"article","sectionId":"travel","sectionName":"Travel","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-28T07:00:12Z","webTitle":"Dazzled by Detroit: how Motown got its groove back","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2018/jan/28/detroit-michigan-motown-city-new-bars-live-music","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/travel/2018/jan/28/detroit-michigan-motown-city-new-bars-live-music","fields":{"headline":"Dazzled by Detroit: how Motown got its groove back","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"They have a saying down here, in southern Michigan: “Nothing stops Detroit.” It’s a good moniker for the city. Beaten down, bankrupt, riddled with crime, Detroit was, for many years, the butt of a joke. Not any more. Recently voted by Lonely Planet as one of the hottest cities to visit in 2018, Detroit has transformed itself, and its image, into the epitome of urban entrepreneurship and resurgent city cool. It’s a good time to visit, too. New low-cost flights launching this April, from Wow Air, will make reaching the Motor City more affordable than ever before. Cool boutique hotels are opening by the dozen – including the Foundation, where I stayed, a gorgeous former fire station converted to a hip hangout (no fire poles to breakfast though, sadly). The food and cocktail scene is exploding – a new restaurant, bar or cafe has opened every week for the past three years. And, this being Detroit – the birthplace of Motown, techno and garage – the music has never left. If you’re looking for an alternative US city break, something fresher and more affordable than the usual Chicago, New York scene, then forget the ghosts of its past and embrace the spirit of its future. They call it “America’s comeback city” but the truth is Detroit is happening right now. I started downtown. In the first half of the 20th century, Detroit was the car-manufacturing capital of America. “We had more money than God,” my guide, local die-hard Detroiter Jeanette Pierce, said – and an echo of those glory days still remains. Detroit is an art-deco masterpiece: there’s the Guardian Building, with its vaulted ceilings hand-painted in bright Aztec patterns; and the Fisher Building, with 30 storeys wrapped entirely in marble like a caricature of capitalism. Detroit has the second-largest theatre district in America after Broadway, and an art museum, the Detroit Institute of Arts, where you’ll find Monets, Van Goghs and Picassos. An exquisite Diego Rivera mural graces the Rivera Court, once dubbed “America’s Sistine Chapel” – except here only the gods of manufacturing are honoured: giant iron machinery, men on the assembly line and a solitary red, shining car in the corner. But that infallible surge of American idealism wasn’t to last. As the car giants automated, or moved jobs elsewhere, the city, quite literally, turned to ruin. Skyscrapers and factories, those former bastions of prosperity, slowly hollowed out from within: we passed the Fisher plant where Cadillacs were once made, now riddled with vandalism; and the once-magnificent Michigan Central Station, with broken windows like open wounds. It was like seeing the American dream in reverse: the withered skin of wealth left to rot, as the march to progress marched out of town. But in catastrophe, there is opportunity. The city’s motto (surely, one of the greatest premonitions of all time) is: “We hope for better things; it will rise from the ashes” – and rising it is. I browsed a shop selling guitars made by hand using wood from demolished buildings (Wallace Detroit Guitars) and another that transformed decrepit graffiti into jewellery (Rebel Nell); I stopped in the trendy new fashion boutique, Detroit Is The New Black; got drunk with people from local arts and urbanism mag Grand Circus (set up to showcase Detroit’s blossoming creative scene); and explored the Aladdin’s cave of locally made curios in City Bird and the Ponyride Market. Home-grown brands, and fresh new craftspeople and artists seemed to be springing up everywhere, like flowers growing in the cracks of a broken pavement. Far from the downtrodden wasteland so often depicted, the city felt optimistic and determined to prove the world wrong. And because it’s being driven by small, creative business rather than big commercial stores, it was authentic and original, too – a garden of unique treasures rather than a homogenised mass of chains. Then there’s the music. Detroit is the birthplace of Motown (an abbreviation of the city’s nickname, Motor Town) and you can’t come here without visiting the studio (now the Motown Museum) where it all began: the Supremes, Smokey Robinson, the Four Tops and more got their start in this unassuming two-up, two-down residential home they called “Hitsville USA”. I toured its gallery of old photographs and gold records, saw the piano where they perfected those iconic harmonies and ended up in the basement recording room, untouched since the doors closed in 1972, stacks of master tapes, huge analogue equipment and the microphone where Marvin Gaye sang What’s Going On: sorrow and pain in every lyric, but hope and spirit, too – just like Detroit. But, in the end, this city is about having fun. So, on my last night, I decided to go big. I started in Baker’s Keyboard Lounge, the oldest jazz club in the world – established in 1933, graced by Miles Davis and Ella Fitzgerald. After that, I had one of the best meals of my life in Grey Ghost: posh wagyu beef with the ghosts of derelict mansions all around. Later, I wound up in what is surely the coolest drinking den in the world: Bad Luck. Down a dark dirty alley, with no sign on the door, it’s the kind of place that makes the hairs bristle on the back of your neck, though it is gorgeous inside with speakeasy-style decor. It also serves the smoothest, most elaborate cocktails you’ll ever drink. Try Mysticism, served in an elaborate puff of smoke, like a magician’s trick. But I wasn’t done yet. Detroit has another musical child: techno was born here in the 1980s, when illegal raves were thrown in abandoned factories. “It was an audio assault,” Sam Fotias, a pioneer of the genre, told me. “It was almost like you were in a cathedral.” Music from the ruins: there is, perhaps, no better metaphor for the city. I finished the night old-school style: in a blacked-out room with lasers, dancing into the dawn. And, yes, for those of you who remember the Fedde Le Grand hit of 2006, I did put my hands up for Detroit. And, yes, I do love this city. Nothing stops it.

It’ll be all: “Wait, what? Second left? Does that mean this one?” Understanding satnav-ese definitely takes practice and even now instructions from my trusty TomTom can throw me. One way of making your device sound more friendly, or more authoritative, or more whatever you fancy, is to download a “celebrity” voice. For a while now I’ve had Ozzy Osbourne’s rich Brummie yelling: “Naww, not that one, y’right lummock” whenever I missed a turn. The tech retailer Ebuyer reveals that Sir David Attenborough’s is the voice most people choose to have guiding them, quickly followed by Ant and Dec, and Prince Harry. None of those would be appropriate for Peugeot’s new wagon – the 5008. For a start it should be French. The car is also ambitious, technologically sophisticated and good looking. Emmanuel Macron would be a good fit – especially as his centrist liberal policies are very middle of the road. Until recently, the no-brainer for anyone wanting to transport kids and clobber would be an MPV – a people-mover just like the old 5008, in fact. But nobody really buys MPVs any more – we’ve gone all SUV. We’ve steered our families away from those commodious baggage swallowers and gone for the chunkier, sportier lines of the sports utility vehicle. What Peugeot has now cleverly done is taken the practicality of its seven-seat MPV and blended it with the aesthetics of a large SUV. This type of car sells like hot cakes in China and South America – where Peugeot wants to reach a whole new market. At the moment the only other two in this sector are the Nissan X-Trail and Skoda Kodiaq. It should be an interesting battle. It was a risk, but somehow it works. From the pavement the relative shallowness of the car makes it look long and elegant. While inside there is a remarkable amount of space for heads, shoulders, knees and toes. Peugeot has reused the excellent i-Cockpit interface from its smaller 3008 – the system has two digital screens and actual buttons. For so many years manufacturers have been stripping out buttons in favour of touchscreens. Now they’re back – and what simple, clicky, binary joy they are. Tech is abundant. There are the usual clever driver and safety aids, but you also get massaging seats, a decent sound system (with Apple’s CarPlay or Android Auto). A massage and music – and all to calm the nerves of the stressed-out parents in the front, while anarchy reigns behind them. Peugeot knows all about engines: its clever and very efficient three-cylinder unit, which reduces emissions by around 20% compared to the four-cylinder version, has won the engine equivalent of the Baftas for the past three years. The range heads up from the 1.2 and 1.6-litre petrol to larger 1.6 and 2.0-litre diesels. Despite expectations, I found the smaller petrol units far more of a pleasure to drive than the larger diesels, despite the size of the car. You’ll find it cruises smoothly, looks suave and handles crisply. With Macron whispering in your ear, what could be more French?

Let's work together to make it louder","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"A recent blog from a social worker on this network called for social work leaders to raise their game and create a greater public profile for issues affecting the profession. It suggested that we had much to learn from our colleagues in healthcare, and how their campaigns on pay, hours and major contract changes – especially for junior doctors – regularly make national headlines. As a longstanding member of the British Association of Social Workers (BASW) and one of its professional officers, I can confidently say that the organisation completely shares this aim, and agrees with some of the points made. It is true that social workers have much to learn from colleagues in healthcare, but we already aspire to have a greater voice in the media. BASW is making good progress on this and I believe it is misleading to suggest the profession and its leaders have been ineffectual. In the past couple of weeks, our chair, Guy Shennan, appeared on Channel 4 News, explaining why increased poverty is driving up child referral rates; on ITV News at Ten, our vice-chair, Jon Dudley, highlighted the launch of our adoption inquiry and how austerity policies are linked to higher adoption figures; and BASW member Melanie Adegbite discussed the poor working conditions driving social workers out of practice on the BBC’s Victoria Derbyshire show. There is also a great deal of important work going on behind the scenes, in parliamentary corridors and at political party events. Lobbying efforts by Ruth Allen, our chief executive – and BASW country managers and members – on better working conditions for social workers and an end to cuts has driven these important issues up the political agenda. Our voice is also widespread and brave; the Northern Ireland Association of Social Workers recently condemned dissident Republican threats against colleagues on the probation board as well as the murder attempt on a colleague in the Republic of Ireland. It also secured significant media exposure for its campaign against universal credit and the rape clause. The profession is seeing results. Partnership work in lobbying for changes in the children and social work bill – now an act – in England was a result of social workers across the country wanting to stand up and be counted. There is a long way to go, but we are continuing to improve our media presence and our voice is getting louder. Organisations such as BASW and the Social Workers Union are learning from working with colleagues in other professions, particularly healthcare, but we need to bear in mind what makes us different. For a start, more than one million people are employed directly by the NHS, a universal service that enjoys a great deal of public sympathy. In comparison, there are about 100,000 social workers in England – getting a voice in the media is much harder. A member organisation is only as strong as its membership. We have ambitions to achieve much more, but it would be achieved more quickly if our membership increased. I urge social workers to get involved in BASW to voice their concerns and celebrate all the great work we do every day. If social workers work together, we can become the solution and make our voices heard.

More than 17 million Brits were hit by cybercrime in the past year, meaning the nation, which accounts for less than 1% of the global population, makes up almost 2% of the 978 million global victims of cybercrime and almost 4% of the global losses. The losses were more than just financial. Each victim of cybercrime spent, on average, nearly two working days dealing with the aftermath of the attack. The most common crimes were generally low-tech, such as attempts to trick individuals into revealing their personal information through bogus emails with generally low costs to victims. Other forms of cybercrime were more expensive: the typical victim found that a technical support scam cost them £44, a ransomware attack £111, and a fraudulent purchase online costing as much as £166. But Norton warns that cybercrime victims are not doing enough to protect themselves online. The report found that they are more than twice as likely as those who haven’t fallen prey to cybercrime to share passwords to online accounts with other people, and almost twice as likely to use the same password for all online accounts. What’s more, a surprising number of cybercrime victims – more than a quarter – believe they are safe from future attacks. “Consumers’ actions revealed a dangerous disconnect: despite a steady stream of cybercrime sprees reported by media, too many people appear to feel invincible and skip taking even basic precautions to protect themselves,” said Nick Shaw, Norton’s general manager for EMEA. “This disconnect highlights the need for consumer digital safety and the urgency for consumers to get back to basics when it comes to doing their part to prevent cybercrime.” The head of the UK’s National Cybersecurity Centre warned on Tuesday that it was a matter of “when, not if” Britain would be hit by a major cyber-attack, capable of disrupting critical infrastructure or the democratic process. “Some attacks will get through. What you need to do [at that point] is cauterise the damage,” Ciaran Martin said.

The Hinkley Seabank plan is an essential overhaul of the power network to send electricity from the new plant in Somerset – which will meet 7% of the UK’s demand – to the rest of the country. The 57km National Grid project involves new substations, underground cables and the new T-pylon design, which are intended to have less impact on the landscape. Shares in the firm fell by 2% on the decision, which National Grid said was “very disappointing”. The company said the regulator’s approach did not reflect the costs of financing and its estimate of £100m savings to consumers was too high. “These parameters do not, in our view, offer the level of returns that would allow sustainable investment in the UK energy sector needed to deliver good outcomes for both customers and investors,” National Grid said in a statement. On Tuesday, Ofgem said it was minded to impose a mechanism on National Grid that simulates the effect of the project being put out to competitive tender. That would be done by setting a lower rate of return than the regulated monopoly would usually face. The model Ofgem has chosen is known as “competition proxy”, and is meant to simulate the cost savings the regulator has managed to achieve in the offshore wind sector, where grid connections are put out to tender. Hinkley Seabank is one of several major power network upgrades that a new generation of nuclear power stations will require. The cost is expected to even higher for other regions – work for new reactors at Moorside in Cumbria has been estimated at £2.8bn. Ofgem’s ruling is known as a “minded to” position; the regulator will make the final decision in the spring. The grid works are due to start 2019 ahead of Hinkley Point C coming online in 2025."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2018/jan/23/teletubbies-tinky-winky-actor-simon-barnes-dies-aged-52","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-23T12:33:33Z","webTitle":"Teletubbies' Tinky Winky actor Simon Barnes dies aged 52","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/jan/23/teletubbies-tinky-winky-actor-simon-barnes-dies-aged-52","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2018/jan/23/teletubbies-tinky-winky-actor-simon-barnes-dies-aged-52","fields":{"headline":"Teletubbies' Tinky Winky actor Simon Barnes dies aged 52","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The actor Simon Barnes, best known for playing Tinky Winky in the BBC children’s series Teletubbies, has died aged 52. The father of three, who once described being in the Teletubbies as being “a bit like the Beatles or Take That of television”, died four days after celebrating his birthday. Barnes was a trained ballet dancer and choreographer, but found fame as the tallest Teletubby who always carried a red “magic” handbag. He became embroiled in a furore over the sexuality of Tinky Winky, who was accused of being a gay role model who could be morally damaging to children by evangelical preacher Jerry Falwell in 1999. “He is purple – the gay-pride colour; and his antenna is shaped like a triangle – the gay-pride symbol,’’ he wrote in the National Liberty Journal. “People always ask me if Tinky Winky is gay,” Barnes said. “But the character is supposed to be a three-year-old so the question is really quite silly.” Barnes’ niece and Inbetweeners actor, Emily Atack, paid tribute to him on Instagram: “My wonderful uncle Simon Barnes has been taken from us all so suddenly. The kindest and most talented man you could ever wish to meet. Loved by all who knew him, and will be forever.” Barnes took over the role of Tinky Winky in 1997 from Dave Thompson, who claimed he was fired after 70 episodes because his “interpretation of the role was not acceptable”. The BBC refused to acknowledge the change at the time, with a spokesperson saying: “We are not allowed to say. As far as we are concerned they are real.” Teletubbies first aired on BBC2 on 31 March 1997. Writing about the show’s impact on its 20th anniversary last year, Stuart Heritage wrote in the Guardian: “Teletubbies was different. It was brightly coloured. It was airy. It was shot outside, so it had the slightest drab tinge to it. The characters communicated in what sounded like a stream of unbroken nonsense.” The show was sold to broadcasters around the world and the group had a No 1 single in December 1997 with the song Eh-oh, while merchandise sales totalled more than £1bn globally."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"sport/2018/jan/23/davis-cup-kyle-edmund-to-lead-britain-into-tricky-spain-tie","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-23T10:41:58Z","webTitle":"Kyle Edmund ready to test his nerve in Australian Open semi-final","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/jan/23/davis-cup-kyle-edmund-to-lead-britain-into-tricky-spain-tie","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/jan/23/davis-cup-kyle-edmund-to-lead-britain-into-tricky-spain-tie","fields":{"headline":"Kyle Edmund ready to test his nerve in Australian Open semi-final","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Kyle Edmund may or may not be the nerveless ingenu he some times appears, immune to outside distractions, whatever the occasion, but he is about to get the chance to prove it. The occasion here on Thursday night will test his nerves: a debut slam semi-final against world No 6, Marin Cilic, who had to hold focus as Rafael Nadal collapsed in front of him with a hip injury in the fifth set of their quarter-final. “It’s totally normal to feel nervous, as an emotion, as a human being,” Edmund whispered after getting through his own tense quarter-final against Grigor Dimitrov. “I’m aware of the occasion, but I just tried to focus on my tennis, enjoy it as much as possible. “It was a great feeling out there. I am loving it right now, the way I’m playing. I’m 23 years old, my first grand slam semi-final, first time I played on one of the biggest courts in the world” Edmund, and nearly everyone else, expected him to be playing Nadal in the semi-final. The step-down is incremental. This is still a huge ask. Cilic is 29, owns a slam title, the 2014 US Open, and was a semi-finalist here in 2010 – stopped by Andy Murray. But, whoever is in front of him, Edmund’s heartbeat does not vary much. Still, there was a hint of relief after he’d beaten Dimitrov – who defeated him in Brisbane recently. “I didn’t really think about how good it would feel because then you’re sort of letting your mind wander too far ahead instead of staying in the present. At the end when that ball was out, it was such a good feeling for me, knowing that I’d won the match and was through to my first slam semi. “I’ve gone in there knowing where my game is at, knowing what I want to do on court, not taking anything for granted.” The enormity of it might yet hit him when he steps on court on Thursday. “You dream of lots of things when you’re young. It’s all a dream. But, until it becomes a reality, then it really hits you. You dream of playing in grand slams, first of all. I’ve done that. You dream of hitting with the top guys. I remember being a practice partner for Andy and Rafa and Roger, to warm then up. Then suddenly you’re playing these guys. At first it’s a bit surreal. Then you take it in your stride. You want to beat them. “A dream was to play for my country. I’ve done that. But again, of course the big one is to be in a grand slam final. And the dream is to win.” Edmund will also lead Britain in their difficult Davis Cup tie against Spain in Marbella. Leon Smith, the long-time captain, confirmed the team on Tuesday, with Cameron Norrie, Liam Broady, Jamie Murray and Dominic Inglot joining Edmund for the three-day World Group first-round tie, starting on 2 February. It is clear Edmund is now Smith’s pivotal player, in the absence of Andy Murray. “Whoever goes out to play as a No 2 against what will be a really high-level opponent, it’s about them giving everything they’ve got, learning from it and hopefully leaving a better tennis player,” he said. “I had dinner with Kyle and his team [on Monday night] and so much of the conversation with him was about Davis Cup – even though he was playing in the quarter-finals the next day. He is genuinely excited to be going to Davis Cup.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/live/2018/jan/23/bristol-city-v-manchester-city-carabao-cup-semi-final-second-leg-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-23T21:45:21Z","webTitle":"Bristol City 2-3 Manchester City (agg 3-5): Carabao Cup semi-final second leg – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2018/jan/23/bristol-city-v-manchester-city-carabao-cup-semi-final-second-leg-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/live/2018/jan/23/bristol-city-v-manchester-city-carabao-cup-semi-final-second-leg-live","fields":{"headline":"Bristol City 2-3 Manchester City (agg 3-5): Carabao Cup semi-final second leg – as it happened","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Phew! What an end to a memorable semi-final! Manchester City are on their way to Wembley, where they’ll play either Chelsea or Arsenal on Sunday 25 February. They’re one match away from their fifth League Cup! And the quadruple is still on! Bristol City meanwhile are left to concentrate on the league, and their push for promotion to the Premier League. On the evidence of this cup run, they’d be a worthy addition to the top flight. A first major cup final since 1909 wasn’t to be, but they’ve done themselves proud against the best side in the land. Bristol City over-commit. David Silva slips a pass down the left for Sane, who rolls into the centre. De Bruyne races in, and slams into the bottom right. City worried? No. Nearly, but no. 90 min +5: Silva is booked for faffing around. Then there’s space for Flint down the right, but he can only slice behind for a goal kick from a tight spot. But hold on! Hold on! Brownhill crosses deep from the left. Reid pulls off the last man at the far post, heads across the face of goal, and Flint slides in! Game on! Shame there’s only 60 seconds to go! 90 min +3: The Ashton Gate faithful are serenading their heroes. It’s been a superb cup run, and the famous ballboy-bothering win over Manchester United will never be forgotten. 90 min +2: Kent slips a ball wide left for Diedhiou, tight on the touchline. He makes good for a while, but eventually runs into Fernandinho. Manchester City go up the other end, Gundogan having a whack from the penalty spot, after good work from Danilo and Sane. His shot is deflected out for a corner, which leads to nothing. 90 min: Only five minutes remain of Bristol City’s dream. Unless ... 89 min: Kent dances down the right but runs into trouble. David Silva races up the other end, spreading the ball towards Danilo on the right. Danilo opens his legs, enters the Bristol City area, and fires a low shot inches wide of the bottom left. 87 min: A throw for Bristol City, deep in enemy territory. Brownhill launches it long. Diedhiou attempts a scissor kick from the edge of the box. Full marks for ambition. 85 min: Walker eventually makes way for Danilo. 83 min: Walker clatters into the back of Diedhiou. Perhaps he’s not so convinced the elbow was an accident. 82 min: Then they replace Aguero with Gundogan. 81 min: Manchester City run down the clock with some pretty triangles. 79 min: To be fair, Walker had taken a rare old clatter on the lug from the elbow of Diedhiou. There didn’t look like there was any bad intent; all accidental. Manchester City prepare Danilo as a replacement, but Walker frowms and shakes his head quite a lot. He’ll continue. 77 min: Bristol City are on the attack, but the referee is forced to stop the play because Walker is down holding his head after a coming together with Diedhiou. The home crowd aren’t too pleased, but the official’s hands were tied. 75 min: The game’s become rather disjointed. Flint tries to make good down the right but shanks his cross deep into the stand behind the goal. 73 min: Kent comes on for Paterson. 71 min: David Silva skitters down the inside-right channel, thinking about a shot. He finds Sane instead. There’s a bit of pinball, and Sane tries to scoop a no-backlift shot into the top right from a tight spot, six yards out. It’s deflected away for a corner which leads to nothing. 70 min: Walker goes bowling down the right at preposterous pace. He whips a low ball into the centre, Flint very nearly sliding into his own net. Steele saves his pal some major embarrassment. 68 min: Manchester City decide to take the sting out of the game, stroking the ball around the centre circle in the professional style. 66 min: That’s woken Ashton Gate up! Manchester City try to put a stop to Bristol City’s gallop immediately, winning a corner from which Aguero blooters over. The hosts regroup. Still plenty of time for the unthinkable to become reality! Manchester City go to sleep at the back. Stones lets Paterson race into space down the left. He hooks into an empty area. Pack rises on the penalty spot, and guides a wonderful header into the top left, past a flat-footed Bravo! Bristol City just need the two goals to take this to extra time. They couldn’t, could they? 63 min: A lovely bittersweet moment in the dugout, as poor Magnusson, no doubt running through tonight’s opening goal again and again in his mind, is momentarily pictured alone. There’s nobody in any of the surrounding seats! But his pal Engvall eventually comes across to sit next to him, in support his friend. There’s nice. He’ll never walk alone. 62 min: David Silva has space and time to shoot from the edge of the Bristol City area. But he takes far too much of the latter, and is eventually closed down. Then De Bruyne should send Sane scampering clear on goal down the left, but his pass is woefully overhit. A couple of rare slapdash strokes by Manchester City’s greatest artists. 60 min: Reid took a small clatter in the face from Fernandinho there. All accidental, and he’ll be good to continue once a wet sponge works its old-school magic. 58 min: But this is better from Bristol City, who may as well give it a go. Brownhill nicks the ball off Zinchenko down the right, and pulls it back for Diedhiou, who shoots straight at Bravo from 12 yards. A hand-warmer for the Manchester City keeper, nothing more. And then there’s another attack, Paterson racing down the left and dinking in the middle for Reid, who isn’t allowed to get a header goalwards, Fernandinho nipping in to clear. 56 min: Inevitably, some of the fire and passion has gone out of this match. A period of midfield passing that doesn’t amount to much. 54 min: Walker, tight on the right touchline, fires a stunning crossfield pass to Sane, on the left-hand corner of the Bristol City box. Sane looks to send a heatseeker into the top right. It’s not so far away, but high and wide nonetheless. That would have been a picture-book goal. 53 min: De Bruyne has a blast from 25 yards, having waited patiently for his own man Bernardo Silva to get out of the road. Steele is the match of it. A corner results, and nothing much comes of that. The home fans are still giving it plenty, despite being thoroughly deflated by events. 51 min: Sane loses the ball in the middle of the park, allowing Diedhiou to make haste towards the Manchester City box. He crosses for Reid in the centre. Reid tries to flick the ball around Otamendi, but can’t quite make the space for a shot. Despite it all, Bristol City aren’t giving up yet. Bristol City throw a few men forward. Big mistake. De Bruyne races up the other end, and flashes a pass wide right for Aguero. Baker doesn’t get close to his man. Aguero strides towards the box and unleashes a ripper across Steele and into the bottom left. Manchester City are surely going to Wembley! 49 min: De Bruyne pings a ball down the inside left. It bobbles through to Steele, but only just, Baker ushering it back with Magnussonian patience. 47 min: Manchester City are clearly of a mind to polish this tie off at the earliest possible opportunity. Walker tears down the right, released by De Bruyne. He can’t find anyone with his cross. Sane then has a look down the left, but can’t square it for anyone. The visitors are playing with great intent. Here we go again! Bristol City get the second half underway, having made a couple of changes. Poor Magnusson is hooked and replaced by Baker, while Diedhiou comes on for Walsh. The hosts immediately gift possession to Aguero, who scuttles off down the inside-left channel and has his shot blocked on the edge of the area. It loops through to Steele. Half-time reading: And that’s that for the first half of the second leg. On balance of play, the scoreline is about right on the night, but Bristol City had battled hard to stay level, and were so close to reaching the break still within touching distance overall. But now they’re two goals adrift on aggregate. It’s a huge ask now. The biggest 45 minutes of Bristol City’s recent history is coming up soon. Manchester City meanwhile will be dreaming of Wembley. 45 min: That was very poor defending by Magnusson, who is a picture of misery. He knows what a costly mistake that was. Ashton Gate falls silent, bar the visitors’ section, who are trilling about a trip to Wembley. Magnusson tries to usher a ball played down the inside-right channel out for a goal kick. Bernardo Silva doesn’t let him, nicks the ball, and plays it back to Sane, who blasts goalwards from eight yards. It’s heading into the net, and though Flint slides in, hoping to hook clear, all the defender can do is help the ball home. 43 min: Walsh over-elaborates as he looks to shuttle the ball away from his own area. Aguero picks his pocket, and nearly breaks clear down the inside left. He’s hounded out. But no matter, because... 41 min: Manchester City are turning up the heat again. Bernardo Silva dribbles with purpose, in from the right, and works space to shoot. But his low fizzer is blocked and hacked clear. 40 min: Another De Bruyne shot from distance. This one deflects out for a corner on the right. The set piece is half cleared, dropping to Aguero on the edge of the box. Aguero chests down, and attempts a very creative Le Tissieresque volley into the top right. And it’s not as easy as Le Tiss used to make it look. Goal kick. 39 min: De Bruyne plays some gorgeous one-touch stuff down the inside-left, in tandem with David Silva and Sane. Eventually he smashes a shot well wide left of goal. A slight sense of Manchester City frustration. 37 min: A throw for Bristol City down the left, and a chance for Magnusson to Delap one into the mixer. Flint tries to eyebrow the ball goalwards from six yards. Otamendi deflects it slightly. The ball very nearly loops over Bravo on the goalline, but Manchester City breathe again. The hosts are slowly working their way into this match, having held firm during the early onslaught. 35 min: Fernandinho aims a heatseeker towards the top left of Bristol City’s goal from the best part of 30 yards. The home side will be very happy to see the Premier League team resort to nonsense like that. 34 min: Pack, quarterbacking from deep, smacks a lovely ball down the right. Paterson race ahead of a sleeping Zinchenko, and very nearly reaches the ball before Bravo, who does well to race out of his area, intercept and blooter clear. 32 min: City knock it around the middle in the old-fashioned tiki-taka style. Eventually they spring forward through De Bruyne, who earns a corner off Bryan. Sane whips it in from the left. Pack heads clear. This represents a slight lull. Bristol City won’t give a hoot; they’re very much still in this semi-final, despite all Manchester City’s possession and probing. 30 min: Walker, from his right-back position, rolls a diagonal pass towards David Silva in the centre circle. Silva romps forward, and with options right and left, decides to shoot for the bottom-right corner from 25 yards. He drags it wide. 28 min: Sane slips a pass down the left for David Silva, who whips an immediate ball through the six-yard box. Steele fingertips it across the face of his goal, meaning it somehow evades Aguero in the middle. Magnusson is on hand to clear. Bristol City were living very dangerously there. 26 min: The corner isn’t worth waiting for. Thank goodness for the volleyball interlude. Bristol City launch a counter attack themselves, Brownhill nearly releasing Paterson down the inside-left channel, but there’s way too much juice on the ball. 25 min: Manchester City had been snoozing for a couple of minutes there, but they’ve woken up, and how. Some pretty, high-speed triangles down the left. Sane and David Silva very nearly open the hosts up. It’s just a corner. Which won’t be taken yet because the ball’s up in the stands, and the Bristol City fans are enjoying an impromptu game of volleyball. Yay! Yay! Y-yay! It lasts a while, and it’s a lovely moment of genuine humour. 23 min: ... but De Bruyne can’t work space to shoot. Eventually the ball is worked to Zinchenko on the left, and he flashes a speculative long-distance shot wide of the target. 22 min: Bristol City load the box from the set piece. Smith’s delivery is disappointing, straight into Bravo’s arms. The goalie flings the ball upfield, and Manchester City are quickly on the break ... 21 min: A high ball down the Bristol City right. Fernandinho should head clear, but he allows Reid to bully him out of the way, then spin him brilliantly. Reid makes off for the box, and is tugged back. Fernandinho is booked, and that’s a free kick in a very dangerous position. 20 min: Walsh presents the ball to Aguero on the edge of the Bristol City box. He’s very happy to see the striker over-elaborate when a dangerous shot looked on the cards. Aguero is closed down and the danger is gone. 19 min: More Manchester City passing. But their Bristol namesakes are holding firm, and the Ashton Gate faithful continue to enjoy themselves at volume. 17 min: The biggest cheer of the evening so far, as De Bruyne races down the middle and lays off to the left for Sane. The winger has time and space to shoot from the edge of the area, but in taking one extra stride slips over and skids along on the seat of his pants. Perfect coming timing, in the silent-movie style, but there goes the chance of tonight’s opening goal. 16 min: A bit of respite for Bristol City, who are doing their best to close the visitors down with a diligent pressing game. But it only means Manchester City do their passing thing in the midfield for a while. Possession for the home side still comes at a premium. 14 min: Bristol City are under huge pressure here. Aguero is bundled over by Smith, just to the left of the D. David Silva wedges the free kick into the box, Stones glancing a header wide right from the right-hand corner of the six-yard box. Stones should have done much better. Manchester City will wonder how they’re not leading on the night. 12 min: De Bruyne bursts down the middle. He slips the ball to the left for David Silva, whose first touch squirts further left to Aguero. The first-leg matchwinner hooks into the centre, and the ball bounces off the top of the crossbar and away. Bernardo Silva earns a corner at the far post which comes to nothing. 11 min: Walsh is down after getting an accidental boot in the face from Otamendi, the pair sliding in for a 50-50 in the midfield. He’s up and about again after a good soaking with the magic sponge. 9 min: Bernardo Silva has a quick poke around down the right wing. Nothing doing right now. Then there’s some space for the progressive Zinchenko along the left. He hooks into the mixer but out for a goal kick to the right. It’s thoroughly one-sided in terms of possession and territory right now ... but it’s still goalless and as such, the first job’s done for the home side. 7 min: Aguero and Zinchenko play a few pretty triangles down the left. They eventually lose possession, but once again Paterson gifts the ball straight back to the visitors. De Bruyne probes down the wing and pulls back for Fernandinho, who hesitates too long 20 yards from goal, and can’t get a shot away. 5 min: Zinchenko rakes a pass down the left and releases David Silva into space. The flag goes up for offside, Bristol City’s back four pushing up in perfect time. The home team could do with a little bit of possession; this is attack versus defence right now. 4 min: Bernardo Silva waltzes down the right and hits deep. Sane can’t get on the end of the cross, but Paterson treads on the ball as he tries to clear, allowing Sane to attack down the left flank. He earns a corner which leads to nothing. But the home side have started very nervously. You can hardly blame them on the biggest night in Bristol City’s recent history. 2 min: Manchester City stroke it around the back awhile. Walker has a wander down the right, but goes nowhere in particular. Bristol City have hardly touched the ball in these early stages. 29 sec: Stones meets the corner, 12 yards out, but misses the ball and kicks Smith by accident instead. Free kick and that very, very, very early pressure on the home heroes is released. And we’re off! The visitors, Premier League leaders and tonight’s hot favourites get the ball rolling. De Bruyne with the first kick of the evening. Aguero zips down the left and wins a corner off Smith within 11 seconds. From which ... The teams are out! Bristol City sport their crisp and classic red shirts. Manchester City eschew their famous sky blue and wear third-choice black; bah! Nice change strip and all, but y’know. Ashton Gate is buzzing, red and white tin-foil flags shaking and shimmering in every corner of this atmospheric ground. We’ll be off in a minute! “Cor, 1909 was the last cup final for Bristol City?” begins Woolie Madden. “It boggles my mind sometimes just how old football is. That was before World War I! I wonder if football fans of the Edwardian era enjoyed a tasty Thai energy drink every now and then? I suppose not, but if they could see us now they’d certainly be in awe of some of the improvements made to the League Cup, such as holding the third-round draw at 4am. Poor, simple folk!” Pep Guardiola speaks! “I think Bristol City will play the best football they can. We have to play the game. If you think about what you have done, you forget what you have to do. We have to play football, try to score goals and win the game.” Lee Johnson considers Bristol City’s recent 0-0 draw with Derby County, a result which brought to an end a five-game losing run in all competitions. “It was good. It was a bit of a test for us, a difficult period. There’s an emotional dip players get from a big game back down to the league. But we’ve performed quite well, I don’t think it tells a real story. We will give it a go. If we do score first, the atmosphere will be electric. This could be the biggest night in the club’s history. We’re going to do everything we can to entertain the folks at home and in the stadium.” Lee Johnson has already said he doesn’t intend to die wondering. With that in mind he’s made two changes to the team sent out at the City of Manchester Stadium two weeks ago. The first is enforced: Luke Steele takes the injured Frank Fielding’s place in goal. The second is a positive switch, defender Nathan Baker benched in favour of midfielder Liam Walsh. Pep Guardiola names a very strong side. There are five changes to the team he named a fortnight ago. In come Kyle Walker, Nicolás Otamendi, Fernandinho, David Silva and Sergio Agüero. No messing, with full respect paid to the hosts. Then again, he’d named a pretty darn good team in that first leg, too, because look who are dropping to the bench: Danilo, Raheem Sterling, Ilkay Gündoğan, Eliaquim Mangala and Yaya Touré. Bristol City: Steele, Smith, Flint, Wright, Magnusson, Brownhill, Pack, Walsh, Bryan, Paterson, Reid. Subs: Wollocott, Baker, Diédhiou, Taylor, Engvall, Eliasson, Kent. Manchester City: Bravo, Walker, Stones, Otamendi, Zinchenko, Fernandinho, B Silva, D Silva, De Bruyne, Sané, Agüero. Subs: Ederson, Danilo, Kompany, Sterling, Gündoğan, Mangala, Touré. Referee: Graham Scott (Oxfordshire). April 1909: it’s an awfully long time ago. Nearly 109 years have passed since Bristol City reached the final of the FA Cup, losing 1-0 to the Manchester United of Billy Meredith, Charlie Roberts and Sandy Turnbull. It remains the only major showpiece occasion in the entire history of the Robins. They came close to reaching another in 1971, but Spurs knocked them out of the League Cup semi-finals. They came close in the League Cup again in 1989, but Nottingham Forest did for them that time. And so here they are now, hoping it’s third time lucky in English football’s second cup. It’s only Manchester City in the way. The runaway Premier League leaders, English football’s champions-elect, a team that can call on the brilliance of Kevin De Bruyne, Sergio Aguero, Raheem Sterling and Leroy Sane. God speed, Bristol City ... except Lee Johnson’s spirited side really did push Pep Guardiola’s team all the way in the first leg at the Etihad, so they’ve got more than just pie-in-the-sky hope. Another big performance, like the one that put out Manchester United in the quarters, could see Bristol City’s second major final become a reality. After their 2-1 defeat in the first leg of this semi, they need to win tonight, bottom line. They may need to rely on away goals (which only count after extra time) or perhaps penalty kicks. But they’ve proved they have what it takes to make it. Of course, Manchester City - brilliant Manchester City, chasing an unprecedented quadruple - have other ideas. A rambunctious semi-final is almost guaranteed. It’s David versus Goliath! It’s cup football at it’s best! It’s on!

The survey of 641 UK sex workers [pdf] who use the internet to find clients or perform services found that more 80% were either satisfied or very satisfied with their working conditions, with half agreeing that their work was socially useful most or all of the time. The study by academics at the universities of Leicester and Strathclyde found that the internet had given sex workers much more control over their working conditions and reduced the risk of physical attack. It found a high level of online abuse, but only 5% of those surveyed had experienced physical assault in the last year. Teela Sanders, professor of criminology, said the survey represented the largest database of online sex workers in Europe “if not beyond”. Speaking to BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, she said: “One of the really interesting findings is that the types of crimes that sex workers are experiencing have changed. So there was a much lower incidence of violent crime, sexual and physical assault than in other studies. But there was high levels of digitally facilitated crimes – harassment by email and and text, for example.” Those interviewed for the study said the internet allowed them to screen clients, avoid drugs and alcohol, choose where they work and provide peer support. Almost 80% said the internet had improved the quality of their working life. Charlotte Rose, a sex worker, said the internet had made her job much safer. She told Today: “It still doesn’t take away the dangers that sex comes with, but as a sex worker I feel a lot safer knowing that I can vet my clients. “Ten years ago it was just a phone call, whereas now it’s a phone call, it’s an email, we can research their names online. There’s an organisation called National Ugly Mugs that gives us an opportunity to check phone numbers, to see if they have been reported. This is absolutely brilliant for sex workers’ safety.” The study found that sex workers were often highly qualified: more than a fifth had a degree, while 14.4% had a postgraduate qualification. More than a third said they rarely or never experienced stress at work. More than half strongly agreed that they were well-paid, with more than 10% reporting earning more than £50,000 a year. The vast majority used a pseudonym at work, to help protect their safety, and more than half said they were worried their neighbours would find out about the nature of their work. Only 23% of those surveyed had reported crime to the police, and 39% felt they were unlikely to report further crimes because of concerns about how the law stands – particularly over the ban on brothels. Cambridgeshire police assistant chief constable Dan Vajzovic, who leads on prostitution for the National Police Chiefs Council, which sponsored the survey, encouraged more sex workers to report crimes. He told Today: “The act of prostitution itself is not illegal; we are not the moral police. We are here to enforce the law and our focus is going to primarily be on targeting those people who coerce or exploit sex workers through modern-day slavery and protecting those who are vulnerable to crime. He added: “The keeping of a brothel is illegal under current legislation, but if a serious crime takes place at a brothel our focus is going to be on investigating that allegation and not on trying to criminalise people who have been a victim of a serious crime.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2018/jan/24/juan-de-marcos-afro-cuban-all-stars-celtic-connections-festival","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-24T06:00:22Z","webTitle":"Juan de Marcos Afro-Cuban All Stars review – a blast of sun-baked sultriness and Strictly magic","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/jan/24/juan-de-marcos-afro-cuban-all-stars-celtic-connections-festival","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/jan/24/juan-de-marcos-afro-cuban-all-stars-celtic-connections-festival","fields":{"headline":"Juan de Marcos Afro-Cuban All Stars review – a blast of sun-baked sultriness and Strictly magic","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Juan de Marcos González is the bandleader and producer who helped make global superstars of some of Cuba’s most soulful, if overlooked, veterans. In 1996, he was recruited by Ry Cooder as a vital fixer, headhunting local talent for the original Havana recording sessions that would give birth to the Buena Vista Social Club phenomenon. More than two decades later, González is keeping the flame of Cuba’s melting-pot music traditions alive with his own globetrotting ensemble. While the average age skews a little lower thanks to his two young daughters on clarinet and vibraphone, the result is just as transportive, bringing a blast of sun-baked sultriness to Celtic Connections festival. It is an experience that seems tailor-made for Strictly fans. Roaming the stage with guiro in hand, the dreadlocked González leads his dapper band – including a trio of hot brass and a gaggle of tireless percussionists – through a mellifluous set of bolero, rumba and salsa-infused classics, paying particular tribute to Cuban songwriters Miguel Matamoros and Arsenio Rodriguez. The band also put their own spin on the popular Buena Vista Social Club hit Chan Chan by foregrounding some rather mournful bass clarinet, and throw in a few González originals, including Laura en el Paraiso, a rhythmically roaming tribute to his youngest. If the concert hall aisles don’t immediately lend themselves to dancing, González and singer Emilio Suárez latterly abandon the stage to encourage audience members on to their feet. Impressively, the smooth Suárez never misses a note even while twirling starstruck patrons. It chimes with the overall sensation of being safe in the hands of polished professionals. • Celtic Connections festival continues until 4 February."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"politics/2018/jan/23/hammond-dismisses-johnsons-talk-of-post-brexit-nhs-dividend","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-23T09:02:36Z","webTitle":"Hammond dismisses Johnson's talk of post-Brexit NHS dividend","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jan/23/hammond-dismisses-johnsons-talk-of-post-brexit-nhs-dividend","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/jan/23/hammond-dismisses-johnsons-talk-of-post-brexit-nhs-dividend","fields":{"headline":"Hammond dismisses Johnson's talk of post-Brexit NHS dividend","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Economic confidence is suffering due to the UK’s impending withdrawal from the EU, Philip Hammond has said, as he pointedly knocked down demands from Boris Johnson for a “Brexit dividend” for the NHS, in a sign of growing divisions within the government. In the wake of reports that Johnson intends to demand an extra £5bn injection for the health service at a meeting of the cabinet later on Tuesday, Hammond offered a withering response. “Well, Mr Johnson is the foreign secretary,” the UK chancellor told reporters in Brussels. “I gave the health secretary [Jeremy Hunt] an extra £6bn in the recent budget and we will look at departmental allocations again at the spending review when that takes place.” Allies of the foreign secretary have been briefing that Johnson has a “track record of winning” and would not relent on demands for £100m a week for the NHS, in recognition of the lower payments to Brussels that will be necessary in the future. The chancellor, who is a keen advocate for keeping the UK closely aligned to EU rules and regulations in the hope of minimising economic disruption after the UK leaves the bloc, said that rather than reaping a Brexit dividend, the economy was suffering due to uncertainty over the future. His comments came in response to the decision by the International Monetary Fund to downgrade its forecast for UK growth in 2019, the year when the UK leaves the EU, to 1.5%, against an earlier forecast of 1.6%. It upgraded its forecasts for much of the rest of the G7 on the back of a strengthening global economy. Germany was upgraded from 1.5% to 2%. Arriving in Brussels for a meeting of European finance ministers, Hammond said: “Because of the negotiations that are going on there is a degree of uncertainty about our future direction and arrangements for trading with our European partners and that is bound to have an impact on thinking about the economy. “The sooner we can generate certainty the better and that’s why we are keen to build on the momentum that we got in December and get the negotiations moving forward now in a steady way so that we can see real progress over the course of the coming months.” He also disclosed that while in Brussels and Davos, where he will visit with the prime minister later on Tuesday, the chancellor would be talking up the City of London’s role in the global economic system. The EU has repeatedly said it will not offer the UK a continuation of “passporting rights”, which would allow the City’s financial services companies to do business across Europe as they do at present. Hammond said he was concerned that progress made in December – when Brussels agreed that sufficient progress had been made on the opening issues of the financial settlement, the Irish border and citizens’ rights – was not lost in 2018. He said: “I will take the opportunity to meet with colleagues to build on the momentum that we generated in December on the agreement of the completion of phase one discussions and progress to begin phase two discussions on Brexit. “There will be lots of people at Davos and the message we will be taking is that Britain is open for business and we are keen to discuss with partners, both European and further afield, about our future relationship and Britain’s role in the global economy and in particular London’s role in the global financial economy.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2018/jan/23/pets-at-home-closes-barkers-grooming","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-23T10:08:12Z","webTitle":"Pets at Home brought to heel as it shuts Barkers chain","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jan/23/pets-at-home-closes-barkers-grooming","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/jan/23/pets-at-home-closes-barkers-grooming","fields":{"headline":"Pets at Home brought to heel as it shuts Barkers chain","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Pets at Home is closing its upmarket, dogs-only grooming and accessories chain, Barkers, four years after opening its first shop. The UK’s largest pet supplies retailer said it would close all seven stores by the end of March, after launching the premium pampering brand in Wilmslow in 2014. The other stores are in Marlow, Ilkley, Sevenoaks, Farnham, Muswell Hill and Clifton. All 55 Barkers employees will be offered alternative roles at local Pets at Home stores, the company said. The brand was launched to capitalise on the growing popularity of dogs, ownership of which now outstrips that of cats in the UK, and consumers’ desire to splash out on their pets. Barkers offers spa treatments and grooming including a “pawdicure” for £15, a “VIB” treatment for £29, and a full-body groom from £35. It also offers a range of accessories as well as food and treats. A spokesperson for Pets at Home said Barkers had been a trial concept and that although the products and services had been popular among customers, the cost of renting the high street stores meant they were not profitable. “There are a number of positive aspects from the trial that we will incorporate into our core Pets at Home stores,” she added. In a trading update, the retailer said it expected the store closures to generate one-off costs of about £2m associated with its shop leases and writedowns on fixed assets. Shares rose 8%, making Pets at Home the leading FTSE 250 riser after the company reported a 7.2% increase in like-for-like sales – which strip out the impact of new stores – in the 12 weeks to 4 January. Total sales rose 9.6% to £223m over the period, and guidance for the full-year was left unchanged. “I’m happy to report further progress in the third quarter, where trading momentum in our merchandise division built over the Christmas period,” said the Pets at Home chief executive, Ian Kellett. “In the year since we launched our lower pricing initiatives we have seen a really strong customer response to the investments we have made.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/jan/22/calls-to-abolish-tolls-on-severn-bridges-to-build-western-powerhouse","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-22T13:39:48Z","webTitle":"Call for abolition of tolls on Severn bridges to create 'western  powerhouse'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jan/22/calls-to-abolish-tolls-on-severn-bridges-to-build-western-powerhouse","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/jan/22/calls-to-abolish-tolls-on-severn-bridges-to-build-western-powerhouse","fields":{"headline":"'Western powerhouse' could rival London and north, say backers","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The abolition of the tolls on the Severn bridges creates a “once in a lifetime” chance to create a cross-border economic region that will rival the northern powerhouse and challenge the south-east of England, politicians, business leaders and academics have said. The decision to make the crossings between the west of England and south Wales free later this year could lead to a “western powerhouse” stretching from Bath and Bristol to Newport, Cardiff and Swansea and leading to a boost in prosperity and jobs, advocates believe. A summit was held on the Welsh side of the border at the Celtic Manor resort to discuss how the regions on either side of the bridges could benefit. Attendees also heard the move could bring cultural and sporting benefits as, for example, schools and clubs would be more willing to travel across the border. But the summit was also told that the abolition of the tolls, coupled with poor road and rail connections, could cause congestion. In addition fears were voiced that abolishing the charges would create a spike in property prices in places such as Monmouthshire on the Welsh side of the bridges and force local people out of the area. The summit was called by Alun Cairns, the secretary of state for Wales, who said cancelling the tolls created a “profound” chance for economic change. He said: “Can you imagine if there was a £6.70 charge to travel between Bath and Bristol or Newport and Cardiff? Imagine the distortive effect that would have on the economy. That is what has been in place here for 50 years because of the Severn tolls. “Cardiff and Bristol are 40 miles apart, Newport is even closer. By removing the tolls, we’re creating an opportunity for a much stronger region on the western side of the UK.” Cairns said he knew a haulier who spent £500,000 a year on tolls but also gave the example of a florist from Chepstow on the Welsh side of the Severn. He said: “If they get an order from the other side of the crossing, the charge makes it prohibitively expensive. Now that market will be made available.” The two bridges are used by more than 25m vehicles a year. Despite the charges more people already commute between Bristol and Cardiff than Liverpool and Manchester. Cairns said: “Our individual strengths are many but by pooling our resources, expertise and experiences we can deliver the best ideas, world-leading projects and innovations and also cultural, tourism and sporting opportunities to beat any other part of the UK.” He added that the bridges had been a “symbolic” as well as a financial barrier. “When the tolls go it will be just be a stretch of motorway. Today is start of a process by which we can bind the region together.” The concept of a “Severnside” region has been around for decades. Welsh devolution is seen as one of the reasons why the concept slipped down the agenda but Brexit has led to a reassessment. Dylan Jones-Evans, assistant pro-vice chancellor at the University of South Wales, said motorists and haulage companies had felt “penalised” for entering Wales and said the abolition of the tolls was a “once in a lifetime” opportunity. He said: “At at time when the UK faces economic challenges as a result of the decision to exit the European Union it’s vital that regional economies of the UK work closely together. “Many businesses on both sides of the bridges felt [the tolls] formed a major psychological and financial barrier. Wales was seen as being separate from the rest of the UK economy.” But he warned: “The current transport provision for road and rail between south Wales and the south west of England is not fit for purpose for a modern 21st-century economy.” Denise Lovering, director of Glenside Commercials, a Welsh company that supplies commercial vehicles, said her business was already planning to expand its operation on the English side of the Severn. Grant Mansfield, of the television production company Plimsoll Productions (with offices in Bristol, Cardiff and Los Angeles) said creating a super-region could help sectors like his challenge London and the south-east. Jez Becker, a Chepstow councillor, said the abolition of the tolls was a great opportunity but he warned there was a lack of resilience in the transport system. He said: “If we want to take advantage of this opportunity we need to work better rather than talk better.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2018/jan/28/vasilis-xenopoulos-nigel-price-quartet-sidekicks-review","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-28T08:00:13Z","webTitle":"Vasilis Xenopoulos/ Nigel Price Quartet: Sidekicks review – downright irresistible","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/jan/28/vasilis-xenopoulos-nigel-price-quartet-sidekicks-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/jan/28/vasilis-xenopoulos-nigel-price-quartet-sidekicks-review","fields":{"headline":"Vasilis Xenopoulos/ Nigel Price Quartet: Sidekicks review – downright irresistible","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Put a tenor saxophonist and a guitarist together and you’ve got a band. There’s something about the combination of saxophone and electric guitar that just works. When the players are, respectively, Vasilis Xenopoulos and Nigel Price, with Dario Di Lecce on bass and Steve Brown on drums, the outcome is downright irresistible. Over the past few years the London jazz scene has become a magnet for young musicians from Europe, and Xenopoulos/Price Quartet is one of the more outstanding results. Xenopoulos, originally from Athens, settled here in 2002, while Di Lecce arrived from Bari five years ago. Price is a dynamic guitarist, with the rare gift of instinctive empathy. His accompaniments are as incisive and inspired as his solos. Xenopoulos has a briskly fluent style which gently mellows at slower tempos. All 10 numbers are pieces associated with jazz sax-guitar duos over the years. XPQ’s version of When Joanna Loved Me is a little masterpiece, easily equal to the Paul Desmond/Jim Hall original, although quite different in approach. And O Pato, a jazz samba, sets off rhythmic sparks, with Di Lecce and Brown making some very tricky stuff sound deceptively easy."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"sport/2018/jan/22/james-bowen-champion-jockey-gold-cup","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-22T12:22:01Z","webTitle":"James Bowen: ‘I’d rather be champion jockey before winning a Gold Cup’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/jan/22/james-bowen-champion-jockey-gold-cup","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/jan/22/james-bowen-champion-jockey-gold-cup","fields":{"headline":"James Bowen: ‘I’d rather be champion jockey before winning a Gold Cup’","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"“I went to bed about midnight and woke up at four o’clock,” James Bowen says with a helpless smile after I’ve asked him how he celebrated on the Saturday night, earlier this month, when he became the youngest jockey to win the Welsh Grand National. “I didn’t sleep much as I was still revved. I watched the race on my iPad, my phone and the TV. Three times on each one.” High up in an empty box at Ludlow racecourse the 16-year-old laughs as he relives a sweet racing story. Bowen, who is spoken of as a future champion in a way few other young jockeys have experienced, shared his victory with 13‑year‑old Raz De Maree, the oldest horse to win the Welsh National since the second world war. The little old slugger with a big heart, and the young tyro in the saddle, confounded the 16-1 odds. Bowen won a major race which his father has always dreamed of winning. Peter Bowen trains horses in Haverfordwest and, following the astonishing victory, he was in the mix of professional snappers photographing his son. Having already reminded me that he was still racing ponies this time last year, Bowen pays tribute to his dad and mum, Karen. “They spent a lot of time and money getting me and my brothers, Mickey and Sean, around the pony racing circuit. It’s a massive cost and they gave us so much time taking us around the country.” The Bowen boys are on a roll. Sean, 19, is second only to Sam Twiston-Davies at Paul Nicholls’ yard with nearly 250 winners. Mickey helps his dad as a trainer and, aged 22, supplied many of the winners on which James established himself as a rare talent when he could finally compete in point‑to‑point racing after turning 16 last March. Having set a record 30 wins in his first point‑to‑point season, James was pursued by a number of leading trainers from Gordon Elliott to Nicky Henderson. He eventually joined Henderson, the current champion trainer, as conditional jockey last September. But his Welsh National breakthrough came at the invitation of a less exalted trainer. The romance of this year’s race was deepened because the closest Gavin Cromwell had come to glory before was as a farrier when he shod Gold Cup and Grand National winners for other trainers. Bowen and Raz De Maree gave Cromwell his biggest win after 13 years as a trainer. It is a marker of Bowen’s rising status that his agent is Dave Roberts – the man who steered AP McCoy to 20 successive titles as champion jockey. “When the Welsh National entries came out Dave asked me if I wanted to ride Raz De Maree or Famous Boy. Raz De Maree was a good choice even if it was the first time I’d seen him and the first time I’d met Gavin.” Was he concerned about riding such an old horse – even if Raz De Maree had finished second in the same race the previous season? “It was a concern but we thought he’s never lost his form. I was confident he’d do himself justice. He’s not very big, but he jumps well and tries very hard. I thought I had a very good chance on him. “I was almost last all the way. I knew they’d gone at a good pace but I thought: ‘I’ll just get myself around and see how we get on.’ To be honest I thought I was too far back. But he seemed to pick a few horses off one by one and he started enjoying it. The horses ahead of us didn’t find as much as I expected and he kept running on at the same speed. I went into the lead at the second last and he ended up winning by six lengths. It’s incredible.” Cromwell said his teenage jockey had given Raz De Maree a “peach of a ride”. Bowen shrugs. “I almost rode him as if I didn’t care. I know it sounds bad but it’s the way you have to be because if you tried to force it something goes wrong. You just have to sit and suffer at the back and when the horse came back to me it makes it look good.” Bowen had looked good to Henderson, Elliott and other trainers as they tracked his progress on the pony racing circuit and in point‑to‑pointing. He even spent a month every summer for three years riding at Elliott’s yard in County Meath. “Gordon was definitely very good to me and Sean,” Bowen says of Elliott who came so close last year to deposing Willie Mullins as Ireland’s champion trainer. “I was only 12 my first time so it was relatively young. He’s obviously a very good trainer and it was a great experience. If I’d wanted to ride in Ireland I definitely would have gone over to him. There was a chance to do so last summer and it was very tempting. But in the end I felt that being over in the UK was where my career would really take off.” Had Nicholls, a multiple champion trainer, also approached him? “I’d ridden out a bit with Paul because Sean is there. It was a possibility but Sean has a position. So I was never keen on the idea.” Does he worry that it is difficult for Sean, who is obviously talented and seventh in the current jockey’s championship, being overshadowed by his kid brother? “I don’t think it’s too hard for him,” Bowen says. “It’s harder for my other brother Mickey because he’s not looked at in the light he could be. He’s probably working harder than me and Sean. He trains pointers and helps Dad in the yard and he does really well. I think it won’t be long before you’ll see Mickey on the front pages of the Racing Post. It would be incredible to have a big winner on one of his horses.” There is a strong chance that James will beat Sean’s record and become the youngest‑ever conditional champion jockey. “I could well do it,” Bowen nods. “I’m [12] winners in front so hopefully I can keep that up. Me and Sean will come up against each other but we are just as happy when each other has a winner. I probably get more nervous watching Sean than riding myself – and vice versa.” When we spoke before racing began at Ludlow last Thursday, Bowen had recorded 38 winners. He has won three races since then, including another big race at Ascot last Saturday, and it seems likely he will soon reach 75 victories and lose his claim and ride on equal terms with the best jockeys. Resilience and drive distinguish the best jockeys and Bowen seems to have both in abundance. His dad has spoken of Bowen’s courage and ability to withstand pain when, last year, he rode 10 point-to-point winners with a half-inch gap in his collarbone after a heavy fall. “The injury wasn’t as bad as my dad made out,” he says. “My collarbone had been dodgy ever since I broke it when pony racing. I’d say it probably broke again but it was only a little fracture because I was able to ride with it and I had a few winners. It soon healed. The worst fall I had was in Arab racing when I broke my collarbone the first time. That wasn’t much fun.” Seven days after the Welsh National, Bowen won another notable race – steering home William Henry, trained by Henderson, in the Lanzarote Handicap Hurdle at Kempton. Has life changed this heady month? “Yeah, it’s amazing. There’s lots of publicity but I’m trying to live a very similar life. I am just working in the [Henderson] yard and racing.” An insight into Bowen’s ambition is offered when he identifies which jockeys he most admires. “McCoy obviously was brilliant and what he achieved is amazing. Gordon Richards, too. He won 26 championships [on the Flat in a career stretching from 1921 to 1954] and that’s incredible. But right now you can’t take anything away from Dicky [Richard Johnson, the current champion]. He’s riding as well as ever. Harry Skelton, too. I love watching those two.” The teenager does not hesitate when asked what would matter to him most if he was forced to choose – winning the jockeys’ title or securing victories in great races like the Gold Cup or Grand National. “Being champion would mean more. I’d love to do that. Obviously the big days are special but for me the aim is to ride winners every day and try to be champion jockey. I’d rather be champion jockey before winning a Gold Cup.” We walk across the track, before racing begins, and Bowen chats about being too young to drive a car. Early afternoon clouds gather in the distance but sunshine still streams down on the teenager. Just before he returns to the weighing room I ask about the horse he will ride in the 1pm at Ludlow. “He’s called Melangerie and is trained by Nicky Henderson,” Bowen says. “I’ve got a real chance on him.” Thirty minutes later the first race of an anonymous January meeting at Ludlow is won by Melangerie. His jockey, a likely future champion, is still only 16."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"artanddesign/2018/jan/22/charles-i-king-and-collector-review-royal-academy-london","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-22T18:01:39Z","webTitle":"Charles I: King and Collector review – majestic collection fit for an unfit king","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/jan/22/charles-i-king-and-collector-review-royal-academy-london","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2018/jan/22/charles-i-king-and-collector-review-royal-academy-london","fields":{"headline":"Charles I: King and Collector review – majestic collection fit for an unfit king","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Just for a moment the tapestry of grandeur parts to reveal the brutal truth. Armies clash on an English field in a chaos of smoke and horses. From under a furled flag peers the grey, dead face of the monster Medusa, snakes writhing on her severed head. This hideous face and the armies behind it suggest all is not well with the British monarchy. In the foreground stands the young crown prince, Charles I’s eldest son. Still barely a teenager when this was painted in the early 1640s, he is portrayed by William Dobson with the proud bearing of a war leader. The painting prophesies that he will become a fearsome fighter. Like Medusa’s head that turned those who looked upon it to stone, his royal eye will petrify his enemies. That, of course, is not what happened. Charles I was a catastrophic king who alienated his people and parliament so totally that by 1642 he provoked civil war in England, not to mention big trouble in Scotland and Ireland. Defeated and captured, in 1649 he was beheaded. His son fled abroad, and England became a republic until 1660. And yet, with this single, fascinating exception of the civil war battle scene in Dobson’s portrait of the Prince of Wales, you’d never guess from this stonking baroque blockbuster of an exhibition that there was a violent revolution in England in the 1600s or that Charles I is generally acknowledged to have been a fatally incompetent ruler. He stares with godlike calm out of portraits, his mild characterless eye and pale thin face implacably asserting the divine right of kings. Anthony van Dyck, the Antwerp-born painter and pupil of Rubens, became Charles’s most brilliant court artist. His surreal vision of three Charles Is was painted in the 1630s when the king wanted to commission a bust by the great Italian sculptor Gianlorenzo Bernini. Van Dyck’s painting was done so that Bernini could picture the monarch (who he had never met) from every angle. In the centre he faces us full on, his ghostly eyes engaging ours. The other two heads reveal a straight profile and a three-quarter view. Yet Van Dyck exceeded his brief. He dressed the three kings in contrasting costumes – blue, red, gold – and given the scene a bizarre conviction, not just in the realism of every long, silky strand of regal hair but the cloudy sky that unifies Charles with his doubles. Bernini’s bust is long-lost in the fire that destroyed Whitehall Palace in 1698; the painting remains an eerie masterpiece in its own right. The strangeness of the commission must have tickled Van Dyck, whose eye for the unusual is also seen in his nearby Self-Portrait with a Sunflower (c.1633) in which he points to the giant golden flower, radiating like the sun, its head as big as his own. There’s no doubting Van Dyck’s exceptional talent, but you do have to wonder why he was happy to coast along at court. Money and power, presumably. The central hall is given over to a grandiose array of his biggest paintings, including two massive pictures of Charles I on horseback. By this time the Roundhead in me was beginning to rebel. My anger, however, was not because I wasn’t enjoying the show. On the contrary. Charles I: King and Collector is a feast of great art. It brings together the jaw-dropping array of European masterpieces Charles I assembled before his untimely decapitation. Charles loved art, and believed that a great collection made a palace look truly royal. He commissioned leading artists of the day – Rubens as well as Van Dyck, the gifted female painter Artemisia Gentileschi and her father Orazio, Gerrit Honthorst and Guido Reni, and when he bought the entire collection of the hard-up Dukes of Mantua he brought a treasure trove of Renaissance art to Britain. The exhibition’s most spectacular room is dominated by Andrea Mantegna’s The Triumphs of Caesar, nine big square canvases that together show the opulence, barbarity, splendour and cruelty of ancient Rome. A soldier looks out at us sadly from a scene in which the empty armour of the dead is carried aloft in triumph. In another, captives trudge past on their way to be enslaved. On a hill, a ruined city reveals that Rome, too, will fall and all its harsh power is transient. After Charles I’s execution, his treasures were sold by the new Commonwealth. Many were rebought or otherwise got back by the monarchy after the Restoration in 1660 and are still owned by the Queen today. That’s the case with Mantegna’s Triumphs. Usually, they hang in what feels like a glorified garden shed at the side of Hampton Court Palace. Here, superbly installed and lit, at the right height, in a generous space so you can walk around and look at them properly, you can see them for what they are. They should be part of the national imagination. Why does the Queen need to keep such great art at Hampton Court where most people are more interested in the maze? I found myself becoming even more revolutionary when I looked at the marble busts of Roman emperors that are beautifully installed in the same room as Mantegna’s masterpiece. These are ancient Roman sculptures from the 1st and 2nd century AD. They belong to the Queen and are also in Hampton Court, largely unnoticed. The wonder and bafflement grow. Here is the Queen’s Dürer, a painting by this German Renaissance genius that’s better than any of the National Gallery’s paintings by him. Here is her Tintoretto, a smoky, shadowy masterpiece of expressiveness by this experimental Venetian Renaissance master. I’ve never seen either of these works before. Where do they usually hang – in a private palace or in an obscure corner of Kensington Palace or Hampton Court? Not everything in this exhibition comes from the current Royal Collection. Many of Charles I’s masterpieces ended up abroad not to return. Some of his wonderful Titians have been lent by the Louvre and the Prado, including Conjugal Allegory, a tender, subtle image of love. And don’t be fooled into thinking the Royal Academy has definitively reunited Charles I’s lost collection. It has not got Leonardo da Vinci’s John the Baptist nor Caravaggio’s Death of the Virgin from the Louvre, for instance. But the russet blazing sky in Titian’s The Allocution of Alfonso d’Avalos to His Troops, lent by the Prado, makes up for a lot. The magic of this exhibition is to reveal the development of European art at a critical moment in its story. Charles I hoarded Renaissance art while also employing contemporaries, led by Rubens and Van Dyck, who reinterpreted that art in the new style known as baroque. There’s a majestic moment when you look from Mantegna’s Triumphs to see Rubens’ Peace and War in the adjoining space. Rubens shows the fury of war held back so love and kindness can triumph. It’s like a reply to Mantegna’s vision of war – and in fact Rubens had been a court painter at Mantua and knew Mantegna’s work well. But the exhibition’s refusal to engage with the civil war is not so much a political failing as a historical one. It robs us of the art’s proper context. The show includes a lovely drawing by Wenceslas Hollar of Whitehall Palace. Why not also include Hollar’s terrifying print of a vast crowd of puritan Londoners gloating at the execution of Charles’s minister Strafford in 1641? To tell the full story of the king and his country hurtling towards disaster would add to the drama of this show. It would have been better to move us with the tragic truth that in 1649 the ceiling of Whitehall’s Banqueting House by Rubens was virtually the last thing Charles saw before he was marched on to the scaffold. It is reasonable to wonder if the king’s aestheticism and love of art was somehow connected with his alienation from his subjects? In a Protestant country where many thought religious art was Catholic idolatry, this king was buying up magnificent Catholic paintings. An exhibition of this scale must have been conceived back when David Cameron was still prime minister and the UK seemed a cosily conservative place. It opens at a time when the country seems to be headed for a revolution by the ballot box, and yet here is the Royal Academy not only celebrating absolute monarchy, but glorying in today’s Royal Collection and expecting us peasants to lap it up gratefully. I’ve got a policy suggestion. Nationalise the egregious monarchist folly that is the Royal Collection. Put these wonderful paintings and sculptures in our public galleries where anyone can see them for free, any time we like. As this gorgeous and enraging exhibition proves, that would instantly give Britain the best national art galleries in the world. • Charles I, King and Collector, is at the Royal Academy of Arts, London from 27 January until 15 April."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"society/2018/jan/22/call-to-stop-insurance-firms-refusing-cover-after-mental-illness","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-22T16:22:43Z","webTitle":"UK government urged to investigate insurer 'discrimination' against mentally ill","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jan/22/call-to-stop-insurance-firms-refusing-cover-after-mental-illness","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/jan/22/call-to-stop-insurance-firms-refusing-cover-after-mental-illness","fields":{"headline":"UK government urged to investigate insurer 'discrimination' against mentally ill","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"MPs and campaigners have launched an urgent appeal for the government to take action after the Guardian revealed insurers are preventing people with mental illnesses from getting access to cover. Individuals who have suffered mild depression or anxiety, or one-off mental health episodes, have been consistently refused life and other kinds of insurance, adding to their financial insecurity. Dozens of customers told the Guardian they had been refused cover based on long-distant episodes of depression or if their medical report mentioned suicidal thoughts or self-harm. They said they were denied cover even when they had no physical health complaints. Charities and campaigners said this was worrying and accused insurers of working from an outdated understanding of mental health. The concern is that insurers are dismissing customers with depression and anxiety to minimise risk and boost profits. Labour and Liberal Democrat MPs have joined a growing number of voices calling for action. The shadow minister for mental health, Barbara Keeley, said: “It is unacceptable for insurers to discriminate flatly against people with mental health conditions or clobber them with higher premiums, particularly for mild conditions or historic episodes ... Labour is calling for the government to investigate, as a matter of urgency.” The Liberal Democrat MP Norman Lamb launched a Commons early day motion, a parliamentary device used to highlight an issue. Lamb said these practices amount to a serious discrimination and urged the government, the Equality and Human Rights Commission and the Financial Conduct Authority to look into it. “These alleged practices are deeply shocking and, in my view, amount to an outrageous discrimination against people with mental ill health ... the government must look into this as a matter of urgency and stamp out any loopholes in the law which are allowing these practices to continue,” he said. Gaps in legislation mean customers have little protection against this form of prejudice, according to charities. Michael Henson-Webb, head of legal at the mental health charity Mind, said that the current definition of disability under the Equality Act does not cover everyone with a mental health problem, making it “difficult for individuals with mental health problems and their legal advisers to clearly determine their rights”. The motion launched by Lamb has already been backed by the Labour MP Luciana Berger. She said: “The government has time and again told us how it is committed to equality for mental health. If they are serious they must act now to end this wholly unacceptable and discriminatory practice.” She added: “It’s the government’s responsibility to ensure that insurance companies are obeying both the letter and the spirit of anti-discrimination laws.” Prof Wendy Burn, the president of the Royal College of Psychiatrists, said: “It is deeply worrying to hear that insurance companies are making sweeping judgments about people without true understanding of their condition.” The Guardian has also heard allegations from new complainants. Tony Blair’s former director of communications Alastair Campbell, an ambassador for Time to Change, said: “Whenever my partner Fiona and I have engaged with insurance, it is harder and more expensive for me than for her, because I have been open about having had mental illness, something she has not had.” He added: “People are judged on past mental health problems differently to how they are judged on past physical health problems. It encourages people not to open up, which in turn means the stigma and taboo are reinforced. It is there in black and white in the NHS constitution – there should be parity between physical and mental health. But this scandal is just one more example of how far the reality is from the words in law.” Dozens of others spoke out on Twitter. One person said: “[The same] happened to me. I was denied [insurance] as I struggled after a divorce and sought help from GP, so it was on my medical records.” Another said: “My husband can’t get life insurance because of his depression ... we have six children. I’m just glad if anything happens to me my family is covered. Just disgraceful.” Helen Undy, the head of external affairs at the Money and Mental Health Policy Institute, said: “One in four of us will experience a mental health problem each year, and by some estimates this rises to almost half of us across a lifetime. So if the insurance market isn’t working for all these people, then it really isn’t working at all.” A treasury spokesperson said: “It is wrong for people to be refused insurance purely on the basis of a mental health condition. Insurance companies should follow both the best-practice guidelines from the Association of British Insurers, and equality law to ensure that full cover should be offered wherever possible.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2018/jan/31/top-10-errant-teenagers-in-fiction","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-31T10:13:34Z","webTitle":"Top 10 errant teenagers in fiction","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jan/31/top-10-errant-teenagers-in-fiction","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/jan/31/top-10-errant-teenagers-in-fiction","fields":{"headline":"Top 10 errant teenagers in fiction","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"A few years back, I started teaching secondary school and was suddenly reintroduced to the hysterical world of the teenager. Returned to me was their constant turmoil, bubbling beneath the surface, bursting to be heard, screaming to be left alone. Reading their essays (I taught English), I was struck by the fact that, as a teenager, everything feels at stake, every day. These essays featured stabbings, murders, suicides, love, zombies, global disasters … These were the tropes of the adolescent (though in some cases these were lived realities too – it was a neglected borough of London), and by extension perhaps the most suitable creative expressions for raging hormones. The teenager endures an awful state in which innocence is daily lost but the mystery of selfhood remains unsolved. The world is increasingly known, but the emotional capacity, vocabulary and maturity to process it haven’t yet been fully acquired. Or perhaps the teen’s particular brand of indignation is the appropriate response to this fraying world. Either way, it is no wonder so many teens err en route to adulthood. In writing The Earlie King &amp; the Kid in Yellow – a novel that would be about a heroic act in a fallen society – it seemed to me that only a teenager would possess enough love, hope, hate, fear, outrage, naivety and bravery to take the action required of the myth. There are many books in which errant or outcast teenagers are used to examine contemporary society. Here are 10 great ones, in the order they came down off my shelf: 1. Tetsuo in Akira by Katsuhiro Otomo Tetsuo is a boy who quite literally contains apocalypse, badness bursting out of him so furiously that he fears his head will explode. The manga series’ antagonist, he is unremarkable at first: best friends with Kaneda, insignificant in the gang hierarchy, and suffering from inferiority issues. After an encounter with a strange, ancient-looking child, Tetsuo gains supernatural powers; powers that amplify (catastrophically) the hormonal unpredictability of the adolescent. The pill-popping teens of Akira are lost, alienated, hopeless, set against authority. Tetsuo is their worst incarnation and, over six volumes, the iconic artwork brings potent clarity to his turmoil. 2. Hal Incandenza in Infinite Jest by David Foster Wallace The simple opening sentence of Wallace’s masterpiece – “I am in here” – is a perfect descriptor for the claustrophobia of anxiety. Hal is a gifted student and prodigious tennis talent whose nerves encourage a destructive marijuana addiction. Wallace is sublime on “life’s war against the self you can’t live without”, and the pressures on talented youngsters to perform. In that opening scene, Hal is appraised by a roomful of adults, and his narrative pursues that crippling sensation until he is so far adrift that he is unable to formulate language. The sad promise resonates: “I’d tell you what you want and more, if the sounds I made could be what you want to hear.” 3. Ryan Cusack in The Glorious Heresies by Lisa McInerney I’m particularly fond of Ryan because he’s from the Cork I know, a typical city feen (drug-dealing aside), a fella I might meet in the shop. McInerney is perfect on teen love and sexuality, every atom of it experienced in high definition. A shared moment during a drug-enhanced exam celebration (the fabled Irish “Junior Cert night”) is perhaps my all-time favourite love scene. And Ryan – dispensing coke and sage wisdom in his school uniform, distressed by neglect, trying to find his place in the world – has the most enigmatic of all teen habits: he constantly surprises you. 4. Leo Colston in The Go-Between by LP Hartley Leo turns 13 during the summer that will alter his life’s course. Put under increasing pressure to pass messages between two lovers, Leo is made complicit in adult concerns and consequences, even as he is enduring his first crush and learning harsh lessons about social inferiority. Hartley’s elegy for innocence – masterfully framed by old Leo, now crippled by emotional detachment and repressed memories – is about knowing and not knowing, the no-man’s land between childhood and adulthood, and sadly explores how one teenage summer can blow a hole right through a person’s future self. 5. Pinkie Brown in Brighton Rock by Graham Greene Pinkie – the delinquent, disapproving, 17-year-old Brighton gangster – is referred to as “the boy”, but his “old eyes” are much feared. While his name and the novel’s title suggest innocence, it takes only a few pages to realise the twist in the symbolism. The boy, it quickly turns out, plays murder games for real. Pinkie’s attitudes to sin and morality are thought-provoking, his refusal to acknowledge his childhood desperately sad. 6. Esther Greenwood in The Bell Jar by Sylvia Plath At 19, Esther is no closer to affirming who she might be. A bright, soulful girl suffering from the most insidious depression, she tries on different fates for herself– motherhood, piety, stenography, literature – but doesn’t find her self in any of them. She is disorientated and detached throughout; Plath’s great feat of narrative style is that we keep thinking Esther might be in control. Her morbid obsession with the execution (and later the cadavers) of the Rosenbergs are darkly symptomatic. That she is wholly aware of what she is “supposed to be doing” (as well as of society’s cruelty towards her gender) makes her breakdown all the more painful. 7. Adam/Eve in Apples by Richard Milward Such a breathless, drastically honest two-hander is Apples that it is impossible to separate its chief narrators, Adam and Eve, as they navigate their lives on a grim Middlesbrough estate. Reading it, I was dredged through my own teen years, regurgitating experiences I’d thought forgotten. Underage drinking, drug-taking, bullying, abuse, paranoia, ecstatic love, painful loneliness, obsessions with and dread of sex: Apples is full of these violences and passions. It is about making choices (usually the wrong ones), and Jesus is it honest. 8. Kelly Broad in Darkmans by Nicola Barker An epic in a postcode, Darkmans is (mostly) about the past inhabiting the present, with various characters possessed by mysterious forces. Seemingly immune, however, is broken-legged Kelly Broad – a skinny blast of a teenager from a notorious family. Pulsing with drama, opinion, bad language and a head for knowing exactly what’s going on, Kelly’s empathy is powerfully endearing. She is largely without hope, even referring to herself as a “skank”, but she wants to believe in someone or something, so avidly in fact that even the bedbound reverend feels compelled to hide from her. 9. Alex in A Clockwork Orange by Anthony Burgess An underlying struggle of adolescence concerns the question of how to fit into adult society; A Clockwork Orange relates its antihero’s meandering, delinquent answer to that question. An archetype, Alex is ultra-violent, ultra-manipulative, contemptuous even towards a novel that proposes to tell his story. His rage is expressed by his desire to carve the face of “the creeching world”. Beyond that, he obsesses about teenage things – sex, music, fashion, morbidity, pulling sickies from school – and must decide what kind of adult to become. 10. JJ O’Malley in Notes from a Coma by Mike McCormack In a novel both experimental and state-of-the-nation, JJ does not speak a single word until the novel’s last line. Instead, he is reconstructed by those who know and love him, from his infancy as a “rescued” Romanian orphan, through his startling intelligence in school, to his psychological disintegration and need for respite from himself. In a masterclass of reflective character construction, JJ’s image is rebuilt from shards. The Earlie King &amp; the Kid in Yellow by Danny Denton is published by Granta, priced £12.99. It is available from the Guardian bookshop for £11.04, including free UK p&amp;p."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jan/22/britain-money-defence-russian-cyber-warfare-threat","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-22T11:19:25Z","webTitle":"Britain already throws money at defence.

Ignore this Russian red herring","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The Russians are coming. The terrorists are at the door. Feel afraid, feel very afraid. Give us the money. Every year at budget time, the defence lobby waves shrouds and howls blue murder. With yet another defence review in the offing, the army fears it will lose thousands of soldiers, while the navy and the Royal Air Force fear the (long overdue) merger of the paratroop and marine brigades and the loss of more frigates. Britain’s defence budget is one of the largest in proportion to population in the world, the largest in the EU and the second largest in Nato. This is unrelated to threat and entirely related to history. That is why each year no one asks what the nation needs, only whether it can “do with” less than the year before. The army has only itself to blame. When Labour came to power in 1997 and the coalition formed in 2010, there was a chance to listen to collective defence wisdom and accept that Britain discontinue its aircraft carriers and Trident nuclear deterrent. They would eat money and serve no reasonable defence purpose, least of all now in the age of unmanned power projection. The navy and the RAF lobbied furiously, and a sceptical army said nothing. Downing Street capitulated to a massive distortion in equipment defence spending, largely at the army’s expense. Last year, Britain’s second aircraft carrier was launched, bringing their cost close to £7bn, wildly over budget. Trident was extended. A sign of Trident’s lunacy is that the Treasury proposes to remove it from the defence budget altogether. It will go with HS2, overseas aid and Olympics legacy under the heading “vanity project”. Britain’s three services should long ago have merged into one, so that defence could be viewed in the round, not as a derivative of mutual lobbying. Defence should be seen from threat upwards, not history downwards. Such is the anarchy that British taxes are now financing the country’s “defence” in no fewer than 80 overseas outposts around the world, chiefly as mercenaries to American interventionism. The row over defence spending has nothing to do with defence, but with an arbitrary target, unrelated to threat, for it to consume 2% of the nation’s wealth. Labour’s spokesman, Nia Griffiths, who should be challenging this, merely attacks the government for damaging “Britain’s international credibility”. What is she talking about? Germany has no need of drone squadrons and nuclear missiles for its credibility. A sure sign of the decay of the defence debate is the abstract language in which it is conducted. Defence is now a mish-mash of rightwing virtue-signalling, international credibility, influence, greatness, friendship and showing the flag. Tell that to the NHS. • Simon Jenkins is a Guardian columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"business/2018/jan/22/bookmakers-judicial-review-fixed-odds-betting-curbs","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-22T16:15:43Z","webTitle":"Bookmakers weigh up judicial review against FOBT curbs","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jan/22/bookmakers-judicial-review-fixed-odds-betting-curbs","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/jan/22/bookmakers-judicial-review-fixed-odds-betting-curbs","fields":{"headline":"Bookmakers weigh up judicial review against FOBT curbs","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The government could face a high court showdown with bookmakers over fixed-odds betting terminals (FOBTs), amid industry dismay at suggestions that ministers have decided to cut maximum bets on the machines to £2. The stock market value of some of the UK’s biggest bookmakers slumped by more than £660m on Monday, following reports that new digital, culture, media and sport (DCMS) secretary, Matt Hancock, favours tough curbs on the lucrative but controversial machines. Bookmakers have previously ruled out launching a judicial review of the department’s decision, regardless of the outcome, due to the difficulty in proving the process was flawed. However, industry figures believe the government may have unwittingly opened the door to a legal challenge by appearing to take a decision before Tuesday, when a 12-week evidence-gathering period is due to end. One senior figure at a major bookmaker said: “If it looks like they’ve ignored a lot of evidence and made up their mind there’s a risk [of a judicial review] from someone in the industry. “If it’s a disaster-case scenario, there must be someone who’ll say we’ve got nothing to lose.” A source at another high-street bookmaker said: “It [a judicial review] is always a last resort but a departmental briefing has to be a major concern just days before the consultation closes.” A departmental head at a third bookmaker said his firm could not afford to fund a legal challenge, but added: “Whether in the larger scale of things we’re approached to join an industry group is a different matter.” Bookies gained more than half of their revenues from FOBTs last year, pulling in £1.8bn from machines that allow gamblers to stake £100 every 20 seconds on digital casino games such as roulette. Campaigners against FOBTs claim they are particularly addictive, clustered in deprived areas, and allow gamblers to rack up huge losses. But in a statement to the stock market, Ladbrokes said a cut to £2 would “fail to adequately address any issue of problem gambling” and have “serious consequences” for the survival of high-street bookmakers and the horse-racing industry, which is part-funded by a levy on bookies’ profits. The bookmaker is in the midst of a takeover by the online gaming specialist GVC, with the value of the deal directly linked to the outcome of the review. An 8% fall in Ladbrokes’ share price on Monday took its stock market value down £281m to just above £3.1bn, indicating investors now think a cut to £2 is more likely than it was. GVC’s stock also declined, falling 4%. William Hill fell nearly 12%, cutting its stock market value by £347m. The DCMS insisted no decision on stakes had yet been taken. The Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, tweeted: •This article was amended on 22 January 2018 to correct the headline. The total value of major bookmakers had at one point slumped by £800m, not solely at Ladbrokes."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/blog/2018/jan/22/talking-horses-last-chance-to-make-hay-with-james-bowens-5lb-claim","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-22T10:05:21Z","webTitle":"Talking Horses: Last chance to make hay with James Bowen's 5lb claim","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2018/jan/22/talking-horses-last-chance-to-make-hay-with-james-bowens-5lb-claim","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/blog/2018/jan/22/talking-horses-last-chance-to-make-hay-with-james-bowens-5lb-claim","fields":{"headline":"Talking Horses: Last chance to make hay with James Bowen's 5lb claim","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Today’s best bets, by Chris Corrigan James Bowen, the 16-year-old jockey who has plundered several big prizes in the past month – including the Welsh Grand National and the Lanzarote Hurdle – maintained his winning momentum at Fontwell on Sunday. He was successful on a 6-4 favourite, Atlantic Roller, for trainer Chris Gordon, following victory on the 5-1 chance Jenkins at Ascot on Saturday for Nicky Henderson, and has prospects of stretching that to a three-day winning sequence when he heads to Fakenham today. Bowen, who does not turn 17 until March, teams up with Phil Middleton’s Holly Bush Henry (2.25) and, while Saturday’s success finished off his rider’s 5lb claim, that process takes a few days to implement and he is still taking 5lb off today. This pair won at Plumpton on good ground in September, when Bowen’s claim was 7lb and his mount was a couple of pounds lower in the handicap. Testing conditions add to Fakenham being likely to prove a tougher assignment than Plumpton, but the Bowen factor can prove decisive once more. Middleton, for whom Bowen won on Exitas in a valuable event at Ascot in November, said on Sunday: “Holly Bush Henry may not want it turning heavy, but he has won on soft. I won’t be giving James any instructions – and there’s not many 16-year-olds who you could say that about. He knows the horse, and in my opinion he is a complete natural and has a gift.” The Welsh teenager has a second booked ride, aboard Heresmynumber, in the final race on the card, a conditional jockeys’ handicap hurdle. But the Ali Strong-trained eight-year-old may well find it difficult to hold Little Windmill (3.55). Neil King’s runner has never won over hurdles but turns out here following a chase success on heavy going at this track on New Year’s Day.

The Yorkshire trainer may be represented once more at Wetherby tomorrow. Warren Greatrex is the biggest riser of the week and probably in the short history of this table, since he was on 0% last week. His Lambourn yard has since had seven winners, including all three of its Saturday runners. Harry Fry is doing well again, while Colin Tizzard’s tally represents only a couple of winners but one of them was in the Peter Marsh, which counts as a significant strike for a yard that had been quiet. Paul Nicholls has also started winning again but it’s been a couple of weeks since Philip Hobbs had his Saturday treble and he’s threatening to go quiet again. Each Monday through the core jumps season, we’re monitoring the relative success of 35 major jumps stables.

Darren Osborne, 48, denies murdering Makram Ali,51, and trying to murder others as they left a mosque in Finsbury Park, north London, on 19 June. The prosecution claims the act was a terrorist one driven by Osborne’s hatred of Muslims, which his partner said developed rapidly in the weeks before the attack, leaving Osborne “a ticking time bomb”. Osborne drove the van into a crowd of people, some wearing traditional Islamic clothing, flinging some several metres and leaving one with life-changing injuries. Ali died an hour after being run over. The attack came after London and Manchester had suffered terrorist attacks blamed on Islamist ideology. A note recovered from the van Osborne had driven down from Wales railed against Muslims and also attacked London mayor Sadiq Khan and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. The jury at Woolwich crown court heard after the attack Osborne had been saved by an imam, who protected him despite his attempt to run down Muslims. Osborne was also seen to smile and say: “I’ve done my bit.” Opening the case, Jonathan Rees QC, told the jury: “The evidence establishes that the defendant was trying to kill as many of the group as possible. “...The prosecution say that the note and the comments he made after his detention establish that this act of extreme violence was, indeed, an act of terrorism, designed to influence government and intimidate the Muslim community, and done for the purpose of advancing a political, religious, ideological or racial cause.” The attack happened barely one hundred yards away from a mosque, and Ali had become ill and fallen to floor two minutes before Osborne struck. It was just after 12.15am and Muslims were thronging the streets of Finsbury Park, north London, after prayers at two nearby mosques to mark the festival of Ramadan. Rees said: “To seek to kill someone merely because of their religion is a terrible thing. And what makes this act particularly horrific is that the group he drove into had gathered in the street in order to help Makram Ali, the deceased, who had collapsed as he walked along Seven Sisters Road a couple of minutes before the defendant carried out his attack.” Rees told the jury that one witness heard the van “accelerate and the noise of changing gears” as the engine revved up. Ali’s family were in court and were visibly moved as they watched CCTV footage of the attack. Ali was found by a pathologist to have been alive when Osborne’s hired van struck him. Rees told the jury: “Makram Ali was run over by the van and his body moved a short distance. He appeared dead. There was a tyre mark across his torso and his tongue was hanging out.” The prosecution said Osborne did not show remorse after the attack, but was heard by witnesses to say: “I’ve done my job. You can kill me now.” Rees said a witness claimed the attacker was “constantly smiling”. Rees said Osborne was seen hitting out at people as he tried to escape the throng, and said: “I want to kill more Muslims.” An imam stepped in to save Osborne and Rees told the jury: “So, it was a Muslim who stepped in to save the defendant from suffering any further violence.” Investigators spoke to Osborne’s partner Sarah Andrews, who said that in the weeks before the attack his attitude changed after he watched Three Girls, a BBC TV drama about the Rochdale grooming scandal. He also read extremist rightwing propaganda online that left him “brainwashed” and a “ticking time bomb”. The jury heard that Andrews said in a witness statement that Osborne had become “obsessed” with Muslims and an avid follower of social media postings by the former EDL leader Tommy Robinson, as well as members of the far-right group, Britain First. The jury heard the pair had watched Three Girls and, in her statement, Andrews said she believed Osborne had become angry “about seeing young girls exploited” and developed his fixation with Muslims from that point. “In recent weeks, he has become obsessed with Muslims, accusing them all of being rapists and being part of paedophile gangs,” she said. Later, she added that Osborne “seemed brainwashed” and had been watching content posted online by Robinson and a woman she thought may be the deputy leader of Britain First, Jayda Fransen, leading him to seek out more online. Smartphones and computers showed Osborne viewing material from Britain First, that “campaigns primarily against multi-culturalism and what it sees as the Islamisisation of the UK”, Rees told the jury. Rees said that, according to Osborne’s partner, he had not worked for a decade and had mental health issues. He added: “Ms Andrews says that the defendant has an unpredictable temperament; she describes him as a loner and a functioning alcoholic.” Weeks before the attack Osborne tried to kill himself and felt worthless. The jury heard that Osborne had written a note about his motivation for the attack. It had been found in the van and bore his fingerprints. It railed against the terrorist attacks in London and Manchester in the preceding months, and the Rotherham child abuse scandal. It also said “Islam’s ideology does not belong here”, and taunted Khan, Corbyn and the singer Lily Allen, jurors heard. The jury heard that Osborne spent the night before the incident in a pub, where he was heard to say he was “going to kill all the Muslims” and to accuse all Muslims of being terrorists.

The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said it wanted to give as many as 160,000 more companies access to the ombudsman service, which until now has handled relatively small complaints on behalf of consumers and the smallest of firms. The ombudsman solved 336,381 complaints last year, with compensation awarded to one in six customers who had problems with a financial firm. Under the new rules, companies with fewer than 50 employees, turnover of less than £6.5m and assets of up to £5m would be given access. The development follows the scandal at majority state-owned RBS, where there were accusations that its global restructuring group had systemically mistreated small firms. Companies also suffered at the hands of a fraudulent loans scam linked to the Reading branch of HBOS, now part of Lloyds. Only the smallest firms, with fewer than 10 staff and revenues of less than £2m, currently have the ability to make complaints. Many companies which are slightly larger still lack the financial firepower to take on the big banks in the courts. RBS had previously said that companies with turnover of as much as £20m had been put into its Global Restructuring Group. Andrew Bailey, the FCA chief executive, said: “What we’ve learnt from these unfortunate episodes is that it’s a very tall order for a small firm to take a major bank to court in this type of case ... There is a gap in the system – the gap is access to an independent and affordable complaints-handling system.” However, the changes are likely to disappoint MPs who have been pushing for more protections for small businesses. The Labour MP Clive Lewis, who opened a debate in parliament over the scandal at RBS last week, said that expanding the ombudsman service “is not the right solution for what is a very complex problem”. Bailey said the changes would be implemented by the autumn and that any further avenues to redress for small firms would require parliament to pass new laws. He added: “The issue has been around a while and we have decided it’s time to get on with it, frankly. If they [MPs] want to do more they should do it.” RBS and Barclays said they were supportive of the FCA’s plans to expand the remit of the financial ombudsman to take in small firms. • Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/the-running-blog/2018/jan/22/how-was-your-weekend-running","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-22T10:35:45Z","webTitle":"How was your weekend running?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/the-running-blog/2018/jan/22/how-was-your-weekend-running","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/the-running-blog/2018/jan/22/how-was-your-weekend-running","fields":{"headline":"How was your weekend running?","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Goodness, but my long run felt pretty epic yesterday.

That, of course, is one of the themes of Oscar Wilde’s 1892 play about young Lady Windermere, who flees her own birthday party because she mistakenly believes her husband is having an affair with Mrs Erlynne, a woman with a past. Wilde’s play, which borrows from the conventions of Victorian melodrama and never entirely subverts them, offers its own deceptions, too. It is not as exquisitely constructed as his masterpiece, The Importance of Being Earnest, which will be produced later this year as part of the same Oscar Wilde season in London’s West End. But there is a delicacy beneath the play’s creakiness and its avalanche of epigrams; a great revival can cut through the brittleness to reveal genuine feeling. This is an uneven production, directed by Kathy Burke, but it has its moments, most particularly when Samantha Spiro’s Mrs Erlynne, discovering an unlikely capacity for self-sacrifice, sadly observes how easily love is killed. Dripping charm and diamonds, Spiro is superb as a scarlet woman doing unarmed combat with Victorian moralism. There is a real sense of desperation behind her pasted-on smile. The women fare best. The Duchess of Berwick is Lady Bracknell writ light, and can be turned into a monstrous star turn, but Jennifer Saunders – returning to the West End for the first time in more than 20 years – does something subtler with the role. She offers a gently simmering comic portrait of a woman so bound by the conventions of her class that she has become a bit of a joke, perhaps even to herself. Lady Windermere begins as a little prig. But Grace Molony mostly gets the measure of her, suggesting a maturing girl who suddenly glimpses the cruelties lurking beneath society’s civilised veneer when it comes to the treatment of women. Burke offers a nod to current debates around misconduct with the interjection of a witty music-hall style number about sexual predators. The servants are quirkily interesting, too: Ami Metcalf plays Agatha, a girl who is never allowed to say a word, and doubles as Rosalie, a maid who uses her tongue as a form of rebellion. Matthew Darcy is terrific as the butler who sees everything and turns the hypocrisies of polite society to his own advantage. But the men are mostly dull company. Kevin Bishop’s Lord Darlington is about as dangerous as a neutered tomcat and approaches the famed line “We are all in the gutter, but some of us are looking at the stars” like a jockey facing Becher’s Brook for the first time. Joshua James tries to inject some character into the wet Lord Windermere, but gets absolutely no help from Oscar. Another great stylist, Noël Coward, observed that wit needs to be a glorious treat, like caviar, and never spread around like marmalade. Wilde almost scuppers his drama by making it so sticky with bons mots that it becomes a series of quotations rather than a play. But when he shows us his heart and his compassion for Mrs Erlynne it is like glimpsing a snowdrop peeking through a snowdrift, and is unexpectedly moving.

Richmond school, a comprehensive formerly known as Richmond grammar school, was officially ratified by Elizabeth I in 1568. Jenna Potter, its headteacher, announced on Sunday that it would stop offering the classical language to new pupils from next September. Cathy Bothwell, Richmond’s former lead teacher for Latin and classics, said 12 students would sit GCSE Latin exams this summer and 17 the following summer, but there would be no more Latin classes after that. “Cutting access to Latin affects social mobility,” she told the Yorkshire Post. “It is very hard to get access to Latin and the classics anywhere outside of London and the south-east of England. That has a knock-on effect on access to university degrees, especially at the leading universities.” Potter said all schools were having to make adjustments to their curriculum offer because of funding restrictions. “After considering a number of factors, including exam results and student numbers, we have regrettably made the decision to cease offering Latin from September,” she said. “Richmond school and sixth-form college’s broad and balanced curriculum will continue to consist of academic, practical and artistic subjects that promote the school’s vision of providing the best possible educational experiences and high quality outcomes for the young people of Richmondshire.” Steven Hunt, president of the Association for Latin Teaching, said it was sad that Richmond was closing its “very strong” Latin department after so many centuries. “Latin is quite popular still, and increasing in popularity in London and the south-east of England, but there are large swathes of the UK which simply are not moving forward in terms of getting more Latin into them,” he said. Each year about 10,000 pupils take a GCSE in Latin and about 1,500 do an A-level. Hunt said there was a historical north/south divide when it came to Latin provision in schools. “Classics has survived since the 1980s – after the national curriculum, which didn’t include classics – primarily in the grammar schools, which are heavily located in the south-east of England and in the private schools in the south-east of England.” He said Latin was a valuable subject because “the Romans were really interesting people and you have to study them in their own words. It gives you a true appreciation of the ancient worlds, which makes you reflect upon yourself in the modern world.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2018/jan/23/imf-lifts-global-growth-forecast-to-almost-four-per-cent-saying-momentum-is-building","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-22T17:00:29Z","webTitle":"IMF lifts global growth forecast to 3.9%, saying momentum is building","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jan/23/imf-lifts-global-growth-forecast-to-almost-four-per-cent-saying-momentum-is-building","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/jan/23/imf-lifts-global-growth-forecast-to-almost-four-per-cent-saying-momentum-is-building","fields":{"headline":"IMF lifts global growth forecast to 3.9%, saying momentum is building","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The International Monetary Fund has lifted its forecasts for global growth, saying momentum is building in global economic activity and Donald Trump’s tax cuts in the US are likely to stimulate activity further. It says the growth momentum is expected to carry into 2018 and 2019, and it has revised upwards its global growth forecasts by 0.2 percentage points for both years, from 3.7% to 3.9%. But it has warned that extreme weather events – such as droughts in Australia, and hurricanes in the Atlantic – pose a significant risk to its positive forecasts, saying “recurrent, potent climate events” impose “devastating humanitarian costs and economic losses” on affected regions. It has also warned growing financial vulnerabilities could derail its forecasts, as could increasing trade barriers flowing from poorly executed trade renegotiations between the UK and the rest of the EU, and between the US, Canada and Mexico. It says Trump’s corporate tax cuts are expected to stimulate activity, with the short-term impact in the US mostly driven by the investment response to the tax policy changes. It estimates the effect on US growth of the tax cuts will be positive through 2020, accumulating to 1.2% through that year, with a range of uncertainty around its central scenario. But it also warns the effect of the cuts will probably wear off quickly – before detracting from growth “for a few years from 2022 onwards”. The IMF released an update of its World Economic Outlook on Tuesday. It came a day after Oxfam Australia released a report showing the level of wealth held by Australia’s richest 1% grew to 23% in 2017, up from 22% the year before, with the top 1% owning more wealth than the bottom 70% of Australians combined. The report, Growing Gulf Between Work and Wealth, shows the wealth share held by the top 1% in Australia has been growing almost continuously over the past two decades, and income inequality has steadily climbed too, despite some fluctuations. The IMF says the pick-up in global growth last year was broad-based, with 120 countries – accounting for three quarters of world GDP – experiencing stronger growth in year-on-year terms, making it the broadest synchronised global growth surge since 2010. It says global economic output is estimated to have grown by 3.7% in 2017, which is 0.1 percentage points faster than projected in October, and 0.5 percentage points higher than projected in 2016. It has told policymakers that the current cyclical upswing provides an “ideal opportunity” for reforms. “Shared priorities across all economies include implementing structural reforms to boost potential output and making growth more inclusive,” the IMF update says. “In an environment of financial market optimism, ensuring financial resilience is imperative. “Weak inflation suggests that slack remains in many advanced economies and monetary policy should continue to remain accommodative. “However, the improved growth momentum means that fiscal policy should increasingly be designed with an eye on medium-term goals – ensuring fiscal sustainability and bolstering potential output. “Multilateral cooperation remains vital for securing the global recovery.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2018/jan/24/warwick-thornton-on-sweet-country-australia-is-ready-for-films-like-this","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-23T17:00:07Z","webTitle":"Warwick Thornton on Sweet Country: 'Australia is ready for films like this'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/jan/24/warwick-thornton-on-sweet-country-australia-is-ready-for-films-like-this","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/jan/24/warwick-thornton-on-sweet-country-australia-is-ready-for-films-like-this","fields":{"headline":"Warwick Thornton on Sweet Country: 'Australia is ready for films like this'","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"There are many contrasts and contradictions in the director Warwick Thornton’s new neo-western, Sweet Country. Its political messages are unsubtle, but the tone is meditative and the drama achingly personal. Stunning cinematography captures vast outback landscapes but small details resonate: a chain dragging across dirt; a bullet hole in a wall. The themes are universal but the film is unmistakably Australian. “It resonates in a strange way with people,” the director tells Guardian Australia. “It’s a classic tale. It’s about land grabs. It’s about taking over the country. It’s a basic western that people relate to on a range of different levels, based in a place they don’t have access to: 1920s central Australia. “I don’t know exactly why, but it’s working very well around the globe. The really interesting one was last night’s screening.” The night before our interview, Sweet Country made its Australian premiere at the 2017 Adelaide film festival – the first time local audiences had a chance to see the film, whose reputation preceded it. The buzz began after Sweet Country won the special jury prize at the Venice film festival in September, then, one week later, received another prestigious award from the Toronto international film festival. But Adelaide was a particularly important screening for Thornton, because, he says, “The film is completely about Australia. It’s completely about who we are and where we come from.” Like Thornton’s 2009 directorial debut, Samson and Delilah – a brutal portrait of poverty and addiction in contemporary Indigenous Australian communities – Sweet Country confronts difficult subjects head on. In this case, Australia’s dark past: what Thornton and his screenwriters David Tranter and Steven McGregor argue is a nation built on the back of slavery and racism. This polemic is reflected through the story of Sam Kelly (Hamilton Morris), an Aboriginal man employed as “blackstock” by a kindly preacher (Sam Neill). Sam and his wife, Lizzie (Natassia Gorey Furber), are borrowed by the violent, bigoted Harry March (Ewen Leslie) who, one evening, in the throes of terror, Sam shoots dead. It is clear that if the shoe were on the other foot, Sam’s death would be swept under the rug, but Harry’s is certainly not – drawing any number of parallels to race-based double standards throughout Australian history. “If we want to man up, or stand up as a country and move forward, we need to know about our history,” Thornton says. “The film is completely truthful about history, even though it’s fiction. I think Australia is really ready for films like this. We’ve got constitutional recognition, conversations about treaties. “If you want to go into those conversations with better knowledge, it’s a good film to watch about Australia’s past.” The Australian audience agreed, giving it a long standing ovation, then, a couple of weeks later, another gong to add to its tally: the best feature fiction prize from the festival’s audience awards. Sweet Country was a family affair. Thornton, 47, worked closely with the second unit director and second unit director of photography, his son Dylan River. River became interested in film-making after the release of Samson and Delilah. He was 24 Sweet Country was shot. “Because I’m his son, and I’m on set, I’ve got a different relationship with him than other crew,” River says. “If somebody had some question they knew was a bit touchy, they would ask me to ask it. Or they’d have an idea, and make me act like it was my idea. “Sometimes the response was positive, other times he would growl at me and say, ‘Go away, you know I’m stressed.’” The shoot was short – just 22 days – and the locations remote, in the picturesque MacDonnell Ranges of the Northern Territory. Filming struggled through extreme weather, including multiple floods. One day, according to Thornton, “We drove out of the set, 20km, with a metre of water over the bonnet.” River believes their knowledge of the land was key to their success. “The thing that held this film together when we were shooting was the fact that we were in our home, Alice Springs,” he says. The director agrees: “I had control over the cinematography because I grew up in that town. I knew where to shoot and I knew how to work the light. Even if we were shooting at 12 o’clock in the day, I’d design scenes that worked at that time, in that kind of light.” Limited time and money meant “acknowledging the things you can’t control”, says River, “and turning them into blessings”. In a film widely praised for its visual aplomb, some of the most striking flourishes were happy accidents. A rainbow that appears at a crucial moment, for example, wasn’t planned for. Nor was one striking image of Bryan Brown (playing a cop in pursuit of the murderer) who, in one scene, desperately parched, finally finds water in the desert. “There’s a funny, spirit kind of thing that goes into his face as he looks around,” Thornton says. “Water had splashed on the front element of the camera. Slowly it drained away and created this fractured light. We went, ‘This is awesome, let’s embrace it’ ... When he gets in the water it’s almost like his spirit comes back, the fractured light on the lens. It’s really beautiful.” Being both director and cinematographer is an unusual combination, but one shared with another Indigenous film-maker, Ivan Sen, who directed Mystery Road and Goldstone. Thornton says “there should be more directors who shoot, I don’t know why there aren’t”, then perhaps goes on to answer his own question: juggling both duties is a challenge. “There was a massive balance I had to play with on every scene, between how much I spent on cinematography and how much I spent on actually directing – getting the cameras in the right places, creating the style and form, directing the actors,” he says. “Some actors need a lot of nurturing. Others need to be pushed … There would be films where I’d be mad to shoot them, because if I did I would not be directing them properly.” Adds River: “It was borderline. Even though Sweet Country looks beautiful, there were times when your shooting was getting in the way.” He describes moments when his father, time-strapped, asked him to take over camera duties so he could focus on the actors. Thornton looks at his son, then responds: “Yeah, it was borderline. So next time you’ll be like, ‘Make me the DP,’” he says, laughing. “That’s what he’s up to, the little bastard. “Well, that might happen. If you be nice to your father, you might get to shoot the next one.” • Sweet Country is released nationally on Thursday"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/feb/04/integrity-or-influence-peering-into-the-world-of-modern-freemasons","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-04T14:00:28Z","webTitle":"Integrity or influence?

Inside the world of modern Freemasons","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"After closely guarding their secrets for centuries, Britain’s Freemasons have spent the last decade trying to open up their organisation, and some of its rituals, to outside scrutiny. Public relations consultants have been hired, some doors at Freemasons’ Hall in central London have been unbolted for the public, and documentary makers have been allowed into lodge meetings. There are even Freemasons’ Twitter feeds – and a hashtag, #ASK12B1. The often-repeated message has been that Freemasonry in the 21st century should not be seen as a mysterious and clandestine affair. The unspoken message has been that the wider public has nothing to fear. Then on New Year’s Eve, the outgoing chair of the Police Federation, Steve White, tossed a hand grenade into this carefully crafted reputation management operation, with an allegation that Freemasons were blocking reforms in policing and thwarting the progress of women and officers from black and minority ethnic communities. “The people who blocked progress at the Police Federation were all masons,” he said. “And they were all a pain in the arse.” On reading the interview with White, many people who had not given Freemasonry a moment’s thought for many years immediately recalled the enormous suspicion surrounding the organisation during the 80s and 90s. Officers of the United Grand Lodge of England (UGLE), the governing body for Freemasons in England and Wales, were incensed. “The idea that reform within the Police Federation or anywhere else is being thwarted by an organised body of Freemasons is laughable,” UGLE’s chief executive, David Staples, said in a letter to the press. Police officers and masons enjoyed “shared organisational values of integrity and service to the community”. Freemasonry’s problem, however, is that there is a limit to its transparency. It remains a secret society, or “a society with secrets” as it prefers to put it. There will always be some on the outside, unable to peer in, who will assume the worst – that the fraternal ties of the brotherhood could encourage improper conduct in public life. What do we know about Freemasonry? There are about six million Freemasons around the world, about 200,000 of them in England and Wales. That means there’s been a drop in membership of about 150,000 in England and Wales in the last 20 years. There are about 30,000 active masons in Scotland and about 25,000 in Ireland, 70% of them in Northern Ireland. The basic unit of organisation is the lodge, of which there are about 6,300 in England and Wales. Some have exotic names. There’s the Chapter of Sincerity in Norwich, for example, and the Swan of Avon in Warwickshire. Lodges are organised in towns and cities, at universities or around schools, recruited from trades or professions, or are based upon military units. They have also been organised around other interests, such as football or rugby fans. The Mike Hailwood lodge recruits motor racing fans. The Lux In Tenebris lodge – light in darkness – was established toward the end of the first world war for blind masons. There are a number of lodges for women, governed by their own grand lodges, but those governed by UGLE are entirely male affairs. Despite efforts to recruit younger men, particularly undergraduates, masons are also predominantly middle-aged or elderly. Only 2% in England and Wales are under 30, but more than 10% are over 80. Candidates were traditionally recruited by word of mouth, but in the digital age men can apply online. Some of the rumours about the ancient initiation ceremony are true. The candidate must roll up one trouser leg to show that he is healthy and unshackled, a free man. He must expose his left breast to show that he is not a woman. A rope noose known as a cable tow is placed around his neck. This represents either an umbilical cord or ties to fellow masons. It is open to interpretation. He is then led blindfolded into the lodge meeting room, where he is introduced to the secret signs of recognition – a word, a handshake, a symbol – and expected to deliver oaths of loyalty and secrecy. The blindfold is removed and he is shown the light. At this point, he is an entered apprentice. Further initiation ceremonies are required before he can be accepted as a fellow craft mason and then a master mason. With each stage, known as a degree, comes a different ceremonial apron. There are other regalia – collars and white gloves and badges – and a plethora of ranks, with titles such as assistant grand pursuivant and grand sword bearer. During this period he is expected to acquire detailed knowledge of the rituals at the heart of Freemasonry. These are a series of one or two-act allegorical morality plays centred upon the building of Solomon’s Temple. Masons are expected to learn and deliver long passages of texts, often in archaic language, and to help each other to do so. The rituals are intended to deliver messages about rebirth as a mason, passage through life and preparation for death. Masonry sometimes describes itself as “a peculiar system of morality, veiled in allegory and illustrated with symbols”. Far from it being about mutual, covert support, they insist, its three principles are brotherly love, “relief” – or charity – and “truth”, which is usually interpreted as integrity and honesty. Freemasonry is a secular affair open to men of any race or faith, although candidates for entry must declare a belief in a superior god-like being. In practice, the overwhelming majority of masons in Britain are not only older men, but also white. One lapsed mason told the Guardian: “You’d find yourself sitting in one meeting after another surrounded by lots of old men. Masons profess a belief in equality, but there are no women and very few black faces.” Suspicion and investigation Such cynicism may be rare among the initiated, but it is more common among non-members. Freemasons’ charitable efforts are evident – they raised £33m in England and Wales in 2015, a sum that was split evenly between masonic and non-masonic causes – but sceptics fear the privileges of brotherly love can lead some masons away from their commitment to truth. During the third degree ceremony, masonry is described as “a column of mutual defence and support”. Could this not lead to corruption, they ask. Suspicion grew during the 1970s after journalists began unearthing evidence that a handful of police officers and criminals were members of the same lodges. The following decade, suspicion turned to paranoia after police in Italy began to investigate the notorious Propaganda Due lodge and its suspected links with a banking collapse and the murder of the banker and lodge member Roberto Calvi, who was found hanged under Blackfriars Bridge in London in 1982. That year, the Scotland Yard commissioner Sir Kenneth Newman advised his officers to stay clear of Freemasonry. “The discerning officer will probably consider it wise to forego the prospect of pleasure and social advantage in Freemasonry, so as to enjoy the unreserved regard of those around him,” he wrote. A number of officers responded by setting up a new lodge, the Manor of St James. Newman’s successor, Peter Imbert, went further, quietly putting out the word that his officers should leave, and that those who refused would not achieve high rank. At this point, according to a number of masons, many Scotland Yard officers quit the brotherhood. By then, however, the Commons home affairs select committee had decided it should investigate the influence of Freemasonry in public life. The UGLE agreed to cooperate, but only after it had been warned it could be found in contempt of parliament if it did not. One of the main witnesses was Martin Short, a campaigning journalist who investigated Freemasonry and corrupt links between police and criminals, and whose book on the brotherhood was an 80s bestseller. In 1998 the committee concluded that while it had no evidence that Freemasonry had played a role in police misconduct, it could not rule out the possibility. It also said that while there was “a great deal of unjustified paranoia about Freemasonry”, the brotherhood, with its obsessive secrecy, was partly to blame. The solution, the committee said, was for public servants to be required to declare membership. For a while, newly appointed judges and magistrates were obliged to declare whether they were masons. Expansion of the registry was resisted by the UGLE, however, and in 2009 the justice ministry quietly dropped the measure after the European court of human rights ruled that a similar registration scheme in Italy was discriminatory and breached masons’ rights to freedom of association. Secrecy intact The experience of coming under investigation had been uncomfortable for masons – “bruising” according to one UGLE officer. Along with other grand lodges around the world, the UGLE decided it was time to partly draw back the veil. Those outside the brotherhood cannot be sure what remains hidden, however, even in 2018. There are the known unknowns – the secret signs of recognition – but are there any unknown unknowns? Short remains suspicious. “It’s not the handshakes and rituals of Freemasonry that are secret” he says. “As always, its biggest secret is its membership. Who are these 200,000 men? We have the names of their ceremonial leaders, as listed in the Masonic year book, but almost all the brothers are unknown. We have no idea how they relate to each other in society at large, or what deals they may be doing behind our backs to the detriment of everyone else.” Freemasonry could not abandon its last vestiges of its secrecy, even if individual masons wished to, because it is key to the future of the brotherhood. Men continue to join in order to discover what is being hidden from them. As one mason put it: “The idea that there is an inner circle has a real allure, particularly for men working in a hierarchical situation: the police, the army, in business. Nobody wants to feel that they’re being left out.” As long as secrecy remains, Freemasonry’s age-old problem – the suspicions of outsiders – will also persist. Staples says that in shying away from explaining who they are and what they do, Freemasons have not helped themselves in the past. “That is now changing and we have a greater resolve to put forward a case – and it is a positive argument – to highlight that we are driven by integrity, by a desire to help those less fortunate than us, and to stem the flow of negative perceptions which has unfairly dominated public perception.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/jan/28/fear-and-loathing-on-the-last-train-home-racism-prejudice-nikesh-shukla","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-28T06:00:11Z","webTitle":"Fear and loathing on the last train home | Nikesh Shukla","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jan/28/fear-and-loathing-on-the-last-train-home-racism-prejudice-nikesh-shukla","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jan/28/fear-and-loathing-on-the-last-train-home-racism-prejudice-nikesh-shukla","fields":{"headline":"Fear and loathing on the last train home","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"It’s late and I’m on a train back to Bristol. I’ve just done a talk about a book I worked on, about race and immigration and I’m wearing the name of the book – The Good Immigrant – across my sweatshirt. It’s late and I’ve spent the evening talking at people, so I’ve bought myself a burger and a beer to keep me company on the two-hour journey home. The train is packed until Reading, as it always is, and then deathly quiet. Bored and with a need to stay awake, I put on a crap Jason Statham film, perfect company for the long journey. The action-packed thrills will keep me awake because if I fall asleep and miss my stop, I’m ending up in Swansea. The further the train gets from London, the more it empties out. I don’t really notice it at first. I’m too engrossed in the film. Around Swindon, three men get on the carriage shouting loudly. They sit around me and talk. I realise, looking at them, and around, and up from my Jason Statham film, that the carriage is empty, except for me and for them. They are carrying beer cans and talking in that high octave slur that carries most lads home from the pub after closing time. One of them looks at me and my sweatshirt then gets up and moves closer. As he stands, he says: “There’s no such thing as a good immigrant.” I hear him because I’ve lowered the volume of the Statham film. Something about the encroachment of space has made my skin itchy. Almost like their placement on the seats nearest to me when the entire empty carriage is on offer is a purposeful move. I suddenly feel terrified. Why is he talking about me? Is he talking in a way that is designed for me to hear? Is he having a private conversation with his friends? About my sweatshirt? I mute the film, watching it in silence while I listen to their exchange. Aside: watching an action-packed Jason Statham film on mute is a strange experience. “What you saying?” one of his friends says. I clock where they all are. The original commentor is across the aisle from me. The friend who just spoke is sitting in front of me. A third person is behind me. “That guy’s jumper. It says good immigrant. No such thing.” He laughs. “Maybe we should show him how we treat immigrants round here,” the person behind me says. “Nah, CCTV mate,” says the man across the aisle. What the hell? Are they threatening to beat me up, but backing down because of CCTV? I watch Jason Statham shoot some people. “Why would you wanna be proud of being a good immigrant? Makes me sick. I wanna knock the guy out,” the person behind me says. “Yeah we should sort him out,” the person in front of me says. “Leave him, you’re pissed,” the person across the aisle says. The only person I can see is the guy across the aisle. I am terrified. I am pressed entirely against the window, trying to get my body as small as possible. I will not move. I cannot move. My feet want to thrash out. I want to run. But there is something keeping me rooted to the spot. Fear. Fear that I do not know how to be in this situation. If one of these men decided to sort me out, I wouldn’t know how to defend myself. I wouldn’t know the right way to take up space. It’s just a sweatshirt, I think. I can wear whatever sweatshirt I want, political slogan or not. But sitting there, alone on the train, without the confidence to just stand up and move away, I feel afraid. After 30 minutes, they head to the bar and I gather my things and move to a part of the train where other people are. I am very awake now. I will not be waking up in Swansea. I feel like I haven’t breathed in an hour. As I get off the train in Bristol at 1.30am, I think what might have happened. I don’t know how to defend myself.

No exact figures were immediately available for either fatalities or injuries. In total, 22 people were killed in the attack including 14 foreigners, Afghan officials said. Eleven of the 14 foreigners had been identified as working for an Afghan private airline, KamAir. Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid claimed gunmen belonging to the group were responsible for the attack. The Afghan interior ministry blamed the Taliban-affiliated Haqqani network, which killed 21 people at the same hotel in 2011. “We offer our deepest condolences to the families and friends of those who were killed and wish for the speedy recovery of those wounded,” the state department said. “Out of respect for the families of the deceased, we have no further comment.” The American deaths were the latest reminder of the continuing toll paid by the US in Afghanistan, where local forces have struggled to fight the Taliban since the US and Nato formally ended their combat mission in 2014. Donald Trump has pursued a plan that involves sending thousands more US troops to Afghanistan and envisions shifting away from a “time-based” approach to one that more explicitly links US assistance to concrete results from the Afghan government. Trump’s United Nations ambassador, Nikki Haley, said after a recent visit to Afghanistan that Trump’s policy was working and peace talks between the government and the Taliban were closer than ever before. The six Taliban militants who stormed the Intercontinental Hotel on Saturday in suicide vests were looking for foreigners and Afghan officials to kill. Afghan security forces have said the standoff ended on Sunday when they killed the last of the militants. More than 150 people were rescued or escaped, including 41 foreigners. Some hid in bathtubs or under mattresses as the attackers roamed the hotel’s hallways. It was unclear how seriously the injured Americans were wounded. In addition to the Americans killed in the attack, six Ukrainians, two Venezuelan pilots for KamAir, a citizen of Kazakhstan and a citizen of Germany were killed, officials said. Word of the American deaths came as Afghan’s interior ministry said an investigation was under way to find out how the attackers got into the building so easily. Najib Danish, spokesman for the interior ministry, said on Tuesday that security forces also defused a vehicle full of explosives near the hotel after the siege ended."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2018/jan/23/cate-blanchett-urges-davos-to-give-refugees-more-compassion","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-23T15:14:06Z","webTitle":"Cate Blanchett urges Davos to give refugees more compassion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jan/23/cate-blanchett-urges-davos-to-give-refugees-more-compassion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/jan/23/cate-blanchett-urges-davos-to-give-refugees-more-compassion","fields":{"headline":"Cate Blanchett urges Davos to give refugees more compassion","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The actor Cate Blanchett has condemned the shameful way in which refugees are treated, and accused politicians of pandering to populist voices. Speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos on Tuesday, Blanchett called for renewed compassion to help the 65 million people who have been displaced worldwide, including 22 million refugees. Blanchett told a session at WEF that the world has reached “a fork in the road”. “I think it’s shameful. There’s so much misinformation about refugees,” she said. “They are forced to flee, and then they are vilified in the media.” The Australian actor is a UNHCR goodwill ambassador, having visited refugee camps in Jordan and the Lebanon to raise awareness. On Monday night, she received a Crystal award from WEF for her work. Blanchett pointed out that only 1% of the world’s displaced people have been resettled in developed countries. Developing countries are picking up the burden, with a quarter of Lebanon’s population now refugees, mainly from Syria. Politicians, Blanchett said, must show compassion and responsibility, adding: “We try to teach our children to be compassionate, to be tolerant, to accept diversity, to share. But all the structures that are around them are not doing the same, so it’s quite a schizophrenic world they’re living in.” Davos also heard that there could be fresh humanitarian crises in 2018, which could lead to even more refugees seeking sanctuary across the globe. Peter Maurer, president of the International Committee of the Red Cross, said there were many fragile situations that could develop into “full-fledged” conflicts this year. He cited southern Philippines – which is currently under martial law – Myanmar, Afghanistan, the Middle East, and large parts of Africa as risks. “We don’t know which one will blow up in our face,” Maurer warned. Maurer also told WEF that aid agencies lacked the financial resources to address the many pressing problems across the world. Davos also debated the battle against sexual harassment. Winnie Byanyima, executive director of Oxfam International, said the #MeToo campaign had helped women around the world tackle the “deep” problem of sexual exploitation. Byanyima said Oxfam hears many stories from female workers in the developing world who are exploited and abused, such as domestic workers who are treated no better than slaves. The solution must include removing laws that discriminate against women, tackling the social norms that justify exploitation, and helping women into leadership positions, she explained. “It is not an accident that women are abused sexually at work or at home. It’s due to the social norms that are there to justify their economic exploitation,” Byanyima said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"global/2018/jan/30/weekly-notes-queries-smart-animals","type":"article","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"Global","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-30T11:59:18Z","webTitle":"Why can’t we admit that animals are smarter than us?

Delegates of Martin Schulz’s SPD gave a reluctant green light on Sunday to continue talks about renewing the GroKo (grand coalition) that has governed Germany for the past four years. But the 440,000 members of the centre-left party could plunge the country into turmoil when they get a final vote on the coalition agreement next month. Invigorated by the close-run result at the weekend, the people behind the #NoGroKo campaign are seeking inspiration from the tactics that helped Jeremy Corbyn to a surprise victory in the 2015 Labour leadership election. Emma Rees, one of Momentum’s four founding members and its national coordinator until December, met SPD activists in Berlin on Monday and Tuesday, and took part in a panel debate at the Friedrich Ebert Foundation, a political foundation closely associated with the party. “The key lesson that I was able to offer is that people care about and want to participate in politics, if you let them,” she told the Guardian. “Politics as a spectator sport has lost traction with voters.” Momentum’s head of digital communications also visited the German capital to hold a workshop with SPD activists at the end of last year. Numerous speakers at the party summit in Bonn called on the SPD to draw inspiration from Labour, which bucked an overarching trend among European leftwing parties by increasing its share of the vote at the previous general election. However, the Guardian understands that the SPD youth organisation, Young Socialists, remains cautious about being too closely associated with Momentum for fear that its tactics could widen the growing rift between the party’s base and leadership. Senior SPD leaders warned that a campaign based on personality, such as Corbyn’s, would be difficult to recreate under Germany’s proportional voting system, and German voters already have a more overtly leftwing option in Die Linke, which won 9.2% of the vote at the election in September. Kevin Kühnert, 28, the Young Socialists leader who has become the public face of the campaign to prevent a renewed grand coalition, received a standing ovation on Sunday for a speech in which he pleaded with delegates to vote against coalition talks, while holding out an olive branch to the leadership, emphasising his “pain” about the growing split in the SPD. Kühnert was not among the young activists who met Rees in Berlin. The youth wing has already announced a nationwide campaign to get members to sign up in order to influence the outcome of the membership vote, using the slogan “a tenner against the grand coalition”, referring to €10 (£8.80) being the cost of two months’ membership. Frederick Cordes, the Young Socialists leader in North-Rhine Westphalia, told the Rheinische Post newspaper: “What matters now is that we bring as many GroKo opponents into the party as possible so we can blow up the result at the membership vote.” SPD branches in a number of German states have reported significant rises in membership this week, with its North-Rhine Westphalia stronghold registering 520 applications on Monday alone. Johannes Kahrs, a spokesman for the SPD’s liberal Seeheim circle of MPs, tweeted: “Allowing people to join for only two months in order to vote no is indecent. Joining and then leaving is nasty trickery.” The SPD leadership is yet to confirm whether there will be a cut-off point after which new members will no longer be able to vote on the coalition deal. A spokesperson said a decision on the technicalities of the poll was expected at the start of next week. Rees said: “My advice to the SPD would be that fostering a sense of inclusivity also makes strategic sense in the long run, as Labour saw at the general election. Especially for a party that wants to renew itself, like the SPD, that could be a valuable lesson.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2018/jan/23/ukip-faces-reform-or-die-moment-warns-nigel-farage","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-23T17:06:44Z","webTitle":"Ukip faces 'reform or die' moment, warns Nigel Farage","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jan/23/ukip-faces-reform-or-die-moment-warns-nigel-farage","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/jan/23/ukip-faces-reform-or-die-moment-warns-nigel-farage","fields":{"headline":"Ukip faces 'reform or die' moment, warns Nigel Farage","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Ukip faces a “reform or die” moment, Nigel Farage has warned, as insiders say the party is losing up to 1,000 paying members a month amid the continuing chaos over Henry Bolton’s future, placing severe strain on its finances. Farage stopped short of explicitly backing the beleaguered Bolton in his efforts to remain leader and reform Ukip’s internal structures on Tuesday but argued that it was a long overdue fight. Farage said he supported Bolton’s plan to change Ukip’s constitution to curb the role of the powerful national executive committee (NEC) as the party’s ultimate decision maker. “That is exactly what I and all the other previous leaders of the party want,” Farage told Sky News. “In my last two years of leading that party I was unable to do any of the things I wanted. I was outvoted by a group of volunteers, who frankly had no political experience at all.” This was a last opportunity for change, Farage said. “Simply, it’s reform or die. If it goes on being run by a group of amateurs, within 18 months it will be worthless,” he said. Bolton has his own reason for wanting to rein in the NEC, after its members overwhelmingly passed a no-confidence vote against him on Sunday. But he is far from alone in seeking to reform a body many in Ukip believe is a roadblock to change. One senior Ukip figure, with many years of experience in the party – which topped the vote in the 2014 European elections and won the third-biggest total in 2015’s general election – said the NEC had a long history of delaying or watering down necessary changes, meaning little was actually done. “The NEC is very good at stopping the leader doing what they want, but it’s not very good at being proactive,” he said. “So it doesn’t really achieve very much. It’s good at throwing spanners in the works, but not very good at managing things.” Battling with the NEC was one of the reasons Farage stepped down as Ukip leader in mid-2016, and since then the increasingly dysfunctional party has seen three more permanent leaders and two interim ones, and is likely to soon seek a successor to Bolton. Farage’s successor, Diane James, who won her leadership election on a platform of internal party reform, stepped down after 18 days saying she did not have “sufficient authority” to push through the changes. She was followed by Paul Nuttall, who stepped down after Ukip’s disappointing performance in last year’s general election. While the NEC is elected by party members, as Farage noted the last vote saw 93 candidates vying for six vacancies, making the result something of a lottery. Its 14 current members, who are unpaid, include senior figures such as Bolton, and the party chairman and general secretary, but also a number of little-known activists with no experience beyond local politics. Bolton’s defiance of the NEC means ordinary party members will gather for an emergency meeting next month, which is expected to see him finally ejected and an interim leader picked. Yet another leadership contest would then begin – potentially leaving the party rudderless up to the local elections in May. A consequence of this drift is a precipitous decline in the finances of an already modestly funded party, which has little more than eight paid staff, split between London and a head office near Newton Abbott in Devon. Ukip’s 19 MEPs are well-paid and enjoy good expenses, but are not allowed under European parliament rules to channel any of these resources to the national party. The party has about 24,000 members, and according to the senior insider, it is currently seeing anything close to 1,000 per month failing to renew their annual membership, which ranges from £20 to £35. The supply of active donors is also drying up: Electoral Commission figures show that in the second quarter of 2017 these totalled around £156,000, down from £246,000 in the previous three months. In 2015, the quarterly average was £750,000. “What the bigger donors really want is stability,” the senior figure said. “They need to know who the leader is, where the party is going, what their money is going towards. And so, until the Henry situation is resolved, who is going to give the party a big sum of money? “It’s a mess, and I don’t think the party has fully woken up to it yet.” The emergency general meeting was crunch time for the party, he said, with no real clue as to which was the better outcome “This is high noon. It comes down to one question: who is more unpopular with the party membership – the leader or the NEC? I think if the membership could get rid of both at the same time they would. But unfortunately they have to choose.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"media/2018/jan/23/rupert-murdoch-sky-bid-what-next-for-the-media-mogul","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-23T17:58:14Z","webTitle":"Murdoch's Sky bid: what next for the media heavyweight?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/jan/23/rupert-murdoch-sky-bid-what-next-for-the-media-mogul","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2018/jan/23/rupert-murdoch-sky-bid-what-next-for-the-media-mogul","fields":{"headline":"Murdoch's Sky bid: what next for the media heavyweight?","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"What has happened to Rupert Murdoch’s bid to buy Sky? The UK competition regulator investigating Rupert Murdoch’s £11.7bn bid has said the deal is against the public interest because it would give the Murdoch family “too much control over news providers in the UK, and too much influence over public opinion and the political agenda”. The deal, which would see Murdoch’s 21st Century Fox buy the 61% of Sky it does not already own, would add full control of Sky News to Murdoch assets which include the Sun, Times, Sunday Times and Wall Street Journal. Does this mean the deal is dead? No. The Competition and Markets Authority has launched a three-week consultation examining three options relating to Sky News that could allow the deal to go through. The nuclear option is to stop the deal. The second is a potential spin-off or sale of Sky News. The third is to keep Sky News as part of Sky but to beef up its independence to address concerns about Murdoch’s influence, such as an independent board and funding guarantee. What are Murdoch’s options now? Murdoch is in talks to sell most of 21st Century Fox, including its 39% Sky stake, to Disney. He could theoretically walk away from the Sky deal and wait for Disney, which has no UK news media plurality concerns, to take Sky News off his hands. However, that would leave Fox with a £200m bill for backing out, and there is no guarantee the Disney deal will get regulatory clearance to take over Fox. Murdoch is most likely to submit strengthened guarantees to the regulator to protect the independence of Sky News to gain deal approval. Could Sky News be closed? Sky has already threatened to review the future of Sky News if the takeover bid is ultimately blocked. This would immediately eliminate the media plurality issue. Such a move would be political dynamite – critics have already accused Murdoch of using Sky News and its staff as “pawns” to coerce regulators and the government. Closing Sky News would cause a major reduction in overall news plurality in the UK. Ofcom has said a loss of Sky News could “present risks to plurality equal to or greater than those presented by the transaction itself”. Why was the deal cleared on broadcasting standards grounds? The CMA was asked to look at issues including the sexual harassment scandal at Fox News US, alleged lax corporate governance, and phone hacking at Murdoch’s newspapers. The CMA said that of “central relevance” was Fox and Sky’s record of compliance with Ofcom’s broadcasting code. It said that phone hacking was “some time ago” and that a corporate governance overhaul at News UK has been successful. The regulator said that issues such as sexual harassment are “not directly related to the attainment of broadcasting standards, in the UK or elsewhere”. Who makes the final decision? The CMA has until 1 May to submit its final recommendation on the takeover to Matt Hancock, the new culture secretary. Hancock then has up to 30 working days – until mid-June – to make his decision on whether to allow the deal to go through. He does not have to abide by the CMA’s final decision. If Disney’s deal for 21st Century Fox is cleared what happens to Sky News? Bob Iger, Disney’s chief executive, has described Sky as a “crown jewel” asset in its proposed deal to takeover most of 21st Century Fox. However, the question remains about whether a company that owns Marvel, Pixar and Star Wars maker Lucasfilm is really interested in continuning to run a loss-making news operation. Is that the end of the Murdoch’s near 30 year association with Sky? Not quite. The deal with Disney will see the Murdoch family trust hold a stake of just under 5% in the enlarged company. This will make the Murdochs the second-largest shareholder in Disney although they do not, at this point, have any agreement for board representation. What do the Murdochs own? Through News Corp the Murdochs own assets including the Times, Sunday Times, Sun and TalkSport in the UK. News Corp also owns the New York Post, Dow Jones, the Wall Street Journal, Barrons and book publisher Harper Collins. In Australia, the Murdochs own more than a dozen outlets including The Daily Telegraph and The Australian, and operates Fox Sports and Foxtel. After the Disney deal, a separate company, New Fox, will be the home for the remaining 21st Century Fox assets including the Fox TV network, Fox News, Fox Business, Fox Sports and regional stations in the US."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2018/jan/25/britannia-recap-series-one-episode-two","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-25T22:00:28Z","webTitle":"Britannia recap – series one, episode two","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/jan/25/britannia-recap-series-one-episode-two","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2018/jan/25/britannia-recap-series-one-episode-two","fields":{"headline":"Britannia recap – series one, episode two","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"SPQR (So…plot, quick recap) The Romans have arrived on British shores, skewered and burned a pile of locals and received a witchy-woo warning from the Druids to pack their wagons and go home. Spoilers: they are definitely going to stay for ages yet. The local Cantii and Regni tribes are deadly enemies after that business with the nob-chopping, but Queen Antedia’s lot are up for a Roman truce if the invaders will bring them the de-wangerer herself Kerra, alive. Pict a side Veran and Aulus’ habit of exchanges messages via the decaying head of Antonius is starting to look impractical. Veran reads the papyrus and looks almost affectionately at the fetid skull of his former hostage: “Now, there’s one more thing I want you to do,” he says. Hurdy Gurdy Man by Donovan feels increasingly like the cue to take whichever psychoactive herb would best aid our journey into this weekly lunacy. I’ve got parsley and cat mint in my garden. Worth a try? This episode is written by Tom Butterworth, brother of Jez and it’s clear he similarly enjoys an abundance of effing and jeffing where any other word would do. At the Regni fortress, Phelan of the limp trouser (Julian Rhind-Tutt giving his best be-jerkined creep) gleefully awakes his wife and her new, far more butch second husband (it is their way) to inform them the Romans have arrived. King Pellenor welcomes his visitors’ request to parlay with an unequivocal, “Fuck off back to Rome,” leaving Phelan in no doubt about their foreign policy. Queen Antedia has other ideas about the Roman threat and decides to turn it to her own advantage. At least we’re getting some idea of what’s driving these disparate elements now. Cait and Divis’ grudging partnership continues on its prickly path but his interest in her is briefly piqued when she seems invisible to those passing Roman soldiers thanks to a mystic circle of twigs he’s laid around her. It was meant for him. After he cruelly ditches her on the clifftop with vague instructions about climbing down the sheer rock to a waterfall, she ends up lost in a forest which is mercifully demon-free but very much a hunting ground for the local wolves. Back at the luxuriously draped Roman camp, Aulus sees a vision of Antonius while bathing in a nearby lake. This man of civilisation and science (did they have science back then?) is becoming increasingly rattled by the mumbo jumbo underworld talk. Still, the haste with which he decides to visit the Druid settlement alone does seem far-fetched and I mean this in the context of a show where folk talk to dead heads and callously de-willy people they don’t like. By Puica’s nostrils Divis’ self-delusion (or is he actually the visionary he claims to be?) expands to talk of fighting a mighty pixie called Puica. I’ll have to use the phonetic spelling here as I can find no trace of this mystic spirit on the internet. Anyone else know what he’s talking about? “My mission is huge!” he yells at a furious Cait when she realises he has made up the story about her father being dead and turns on him. Trump could do no better. I think we need to add a Trump or Butterworth? sub-head each week from now on. While Aulus starts crucifying prisoners to get Pellenor’s attention, the old king talks with his sometime daughter-in-law Amena (she of the two husbands) and listens to her theories on Kerra who we now know has Roman blood. No wonder they don’t trust her. Kerra’s ride to the Roman camp to parlay with Aulus and her subsequent ambush look like folly but how will it look to the king? More like treachery, I reckon. Obviously, there is a frisson between her and the general, who mentions just before her arrival that he’s up for some “female company”. And so to Aulus’ parlay with the queen of the Regni: “Sit the fuck down, pretty boy,” barks Antedia as she hunkers on the sod to talk turkey. She shows Aulus her son’s missing knackers and tells the sad tale of their untimely removal. That awkward moment reminds me of one of those explicit medical segments on This Morning where Philip Schofield tries desperately to look cool about being six inches away from some stranger’s bum hole. You have male Aulus finds Antonius’ now quite rotten head returned with a new message in its mouth, although we don’t see what the note says. But shortly afterwards Aulus, inexplicably, rides solo into the Druid camp, watched by the massive-eyed locals and the hollow sockets of a thousand tree-mounted skulls. He wants to go to the underworld but on a return ticket, it seems. Is there someone there he needs to see? “You got my map then,” says Veran as the two men eyeball each other. Never enter a staring contest with someone who looks like a cross between an embalmed Emma Stone and a bush baby. You won’t win. Veran puts his hands to Aulus’ face and presumably sends him on a daytrip to the underworld. The end of this ep is confusing as Aulus’ apparent hallucination becomes the throw-forward to “next week on Britannia”. Notes from the end of the woad Mackenzie Crook’s nail piercings are distracting and keep making me think of Claire’s Accessories. How did Veran send Aulus down under without the magic smoky twigs he used on Antonius last week? Is Aulus just getting the tourist package fob-off? Cait’s dad looks to have been saved from crucifixion at the last minute, suggesting that they will reunite somewhere along the way. Bearing in mind Kerra’s form with peen-abduction, Aulus might want to choose another local to make sexy eyes at. I’m not a stickler for historical accuracy if there’s fun to be had, but I still don’t know if I’m actually having fun yet. Is it camp enough? Something’s missing for me."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"football/2018/jan/23/uefa-nations-league-draw-england-scotland-wales","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-23T13:00:04Z","webTitle":"What is the Uefa Nations League – and will it be successful?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jan/23/uefa-nations-league-draw-england-scotland-wales","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/jan/23/uefa-nations-league-draw-england-scotland-wales","fields":{"headline":"What is the Uefa Nations League – and will it be successful?","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"When Uefa first began seriously discussing the prospect of a brand new international competition, back in 2011, their intentions were honourable enough. The lustre of national team football had faded steadily over the previous decade, largely due to the club game’s suffocating spread but also to the contemporary nature of the beast. Friendly matches, seen by managers as valuable testing grounds but by the public and – in some cases – players as halfhearted trudges, had become little more than ballast in the calendar; qualifying for major tournaments had, for the leading lights, generally become a procession. If the latter owed partly to the geopolitical changes within Europe since 1989 and a slew of successor states whose football infrastructure lagged behind the rest, it merely emphasised that a little agility was long overdue. The fruits of that shapeshifting will be displayed on Wednesday when, in front of a suitably curious assembly in Lausanne, the inaugural Uefa Nations League draw takes place. It has, to a large extent, flown under the radar so far but from September onwards it will be stitched into the sport’s fabric and replace the majority of friendly games. Uefa’s four-tier brainchild will rattle through six international dates by the end of November, completing a group stage that funnels into a four-team finals competition the following June. So far, so uncomplicated. There is, certainly for those who still hold international football in high esteem, an innate pleasure in the idea of countries competing in league form, effectively working their way up or down from Leagues A to D in a relatable format. A summer mini-tournament between, say, Germany, Belgium, France and Spain to decide the overall champion has appeal; there is also an element of interest in seeing just where the dust settles for aspirational smaller countries, who will play competitive matches against teams of similar weight. For Kosovo, Moldova, Kazakhstan and Liechtenstein it offers scope to hone a winning mentality where none previously existed. Yet, even allowing for the fact that any tournament looks infinitely more appealing when there are fixtures to discuss, the lack of buzz has been glaring. If Uefa were looking to create a crowdpleaser, an event that had the dual benefits of helping football development while catching the wider imagination, the fear is that things have moved on at such a rate – even in the last seven years – that the Nations League resembles a dead weight. The clubs’ hold over most casual fans is almost total, in large part due to the unstinting efforts of news outlets, financial backers and social media accounts to make it so. Anything new needs to grab the modern attention span: while other sports – cricket an obvious example – tinker with tweaked formats to do exactly that, the convoluted nature of Uefa’s offering looks decidedly out of step. A competition that will initially be contested across 16 groups – four in most leagues, their sizes flitting between four and a patently unfair set of threes – already seems plenty to stay across but the most disappointing element reveals itself at the very end. In March 2020, nine months after the first Nations League has finished, the top four ranked teams in each league that have not already qualified for that summer’s European Championship – via that tournament’s own qualifying series – will be offered another bite of the cherry. They will enter a play-off round between themselves, with one spot guaranteed for each league. This means that, unless Latvia are the eventual beneficiaries from League D, there will be at least one debutant at Euro 2020. But the concept could hardly be more absurd, particularly when Uefa have already given ample hope to potential first-timers by expanding their flagship competition to 24 teams. It smacks of an inducement to push their new event through, in the process lessening their own brainchild’s credibility and confirming its Europa League-ification. Scotland were among the occasional European Championship qualifiers to back the idea of a consolation place during early discussions about the Nations League, seeing it as a more compelling plus point than the near-abolition of friendlies and, unsurprisingly, they were far from alone. Perhaps Uefa deemed it a measure that would lasso its disparate members into the new format; soon enough the audience figures will show whether it was worth the added head-scratching. It is in football’s interest that the Nations League works. The international game still produces, with regularity and at all levels, the most compelling examples of what the sport can be: an expression of a moment in time, a snapshot of battles won and struggles ongoing, a celebration of the communal in an era of the individual. It deserves the best possible chance. Should the Nations League prosper then Fifa is minded to create a global version early next decade; the nagging impression before we enter the labyrinth, though, is of a fudged opportunity to reimagine football at its purest."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2018/jan/23/the-fiver-bristol-city-manchester-milk-cup","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-23T16:23:49Z","webTitle":"The Fiver | Some more golden-age-of-Hollywood slapstick combined with pathos","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jan/23/the-fiver-bristol-city-manchester-milk-cup","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/jan/23/the-fiver-bristol-city-manchester-milk-cup","fields":{"headline":"Some more golden-age-of-Hollywood slapstick combined with pathos","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"A(NOTHER) TALE OF TWO CITIES It’s been a week of seismic shocks in sport. A British man who isn’t fated to be bagelled by Novak Djokovic in the final has reached the last four of the Australian Open. Ronnie O’Sullivan didn’t win the Masters snooker, bad news for those of us who like to watch rocket-fuelled century breaks, good news for anyone whose teeth are set on edge by desperate phlegm-rattling bellows of CAHMONRONEEEE from members of the audience whose ability going forward to pay the mortgage may be seriously compromised by the book they’ve been running down the drinker. And in the football on Monday night, there was a classic for fans of cognitive dissonance, as Southampton supporters tried to balance the sight of Virgil van Dijk turning into Dejan Lovren II with the view of Swansea City coming up hard in the rear-view mirror. But Tuesday’s events could trump them all, should Bristol City somehow manage to become only the third team this season to beat Manchester City, following Shakhtar Donetsk and Dejan Lovren I’s Liverpool. A 1-0 win would see the Championship side through to the final of Three-Handled Tin Pot on away goals, but only after extra-time; a 2-1 victory after 120 minutes would require them to slap home a few penalty kicks; a 4-0 win after 90 would for goodness sake come on! Having said that, anything is possible, not least when you consider how well the Bristolians played in Manchester a fortnight ago. Lee Johnson’s side went toe to toe with Pep Guardiola’s rabble from the off, forcing the likes of Eliaquim Mangala and John Stones to revert to Keystone Pictures Studio type. The Robins came within 90 seconds of a more-than-creditable draw, so expect a similarly cavalier approach at Ashton Gate, and with it the very real possibility of some more golden-age-of-Hollywood slapstick combined with pathos. “I’d rather fail bold than fail timid,” explains Johnson. “We don’t want to be brave losers. For this team to beat Man City, it would rank as one of the best results in the club’s history. They’ll go down in folklore!” Stirring rhetoric, with the modern-day Robins aiming to go one better than their Tin Pot semi-finalists of 1970 and 1989, reaching the club’s first major showpiece since the 1909 FA Cup final. The speech was only a little bit spoilt by Johnson needlessly adding: “For me and the club, the Premier League is the dream.” Silly old Fiver, getting long in the tooth, with its traditional view that big days out and trophies are what fans really crave. Nevertheless, please let us take this opportunity to scream CAHMONBRISTOLCITEEEE. We’re usually scrupulously neutral on all matters, so apologies to all Citizens for this aberration; it’s just that we’ve been offering generous odds down our local on Pep’s lads completing the quadruple, and have suddenly realised that should they manage it, we’ll be getting evicted come the end of May.

Knowledgeable, intelligent and respectful, he had that wonderful skill of all great old-school broadcasters (Richie Benaud being a classic example): knowing to keep quiet when he had nothing so say. It is sad to think that he is succeeded by the likes of Robbie Savage, who – by that last criterion – ought to remain permanently silent. If that represents ‘progress’, then it is definitely time to STOP FOOTBALL!” – John Caley. “Since Robert Darby (Monday’s Fiver letters) took the trouble to tell Stoke their title hopes were still alive, I thought I might offer further encouragement. Since Stoke’s hopes rest on Manchester City losing all their remaining games, logically their goal difference must decrease. Therefore 4.5 goals per game (possibly less) will be enough for Stoke to mow them down” – Tim Scanlan (and many other amateur mathematicians). “In relation to Monday’s laboured Fiver analogy of a slightly less shiny sun understudy, I would propose a red dwarf. As any astronomer could tell you, red dwarfs are considerably redder and smaller than our own star, with a tendency to eject charged particles.

Water fountains are coming back. In an attempt to tackle plastic waste, the old municipal staple will be installed in public places in London so we can have a free drink and top up refillable bottles. But can we be sure the water is clean? If your lips touch the spout, will you get herpes or some other orally transmissible infection? Should you wipe the spout before drinking? Or perhaps do a sneaky inspection of the person in front of you to establish if their oral hygiene is up to scratch? Water fountains have been a feature of cities since the ancient Greeks put them near temples and dedicated them to gods and heroes. Britain caught up in the mid-19th century, with the Metropolitan Free Drinking Fountain Association responsible for 800 drinking fountains in London alone. The technology used to help reduce the risk of infectious diseases has improved, including slanted jets of water, filters and better maintenance. But over the past 30 to 40 years, drinking fountains have been disappearing because of the marketing of bottled water, a lack of investment and maintenance by local authorities, and concern about health risks. So, how best to ensure a hygienic experience? The main source of contamination is on the knobs and buttons of fountains; if you are going to wipe anything with a disinfectant, go for the knobs, not the spout. The risk of getting herpes from the spout is almost negligible, but for those who feel queasy about any public amenities, it is best to drink from the flowing jet of water, rather than wrapping your lips round the spout. Remember: disease outbreaks from municipal water fountains are extremely rare and tend to be isolated cases involving individuals with an impaired immune system. Modern designs of water fountains are likely to pose a negligible risk to your health. And the benefits of access to free, clean water in city centres are enormous. Kids can have water instead of sugary drinks; older people can avoid dehydration; runners and cyclists can rehydrate without having to lug plastic bottles with them. The only downside will be for businesses that sell us expensive water in plastic bottles. Ah, well."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"teacher-network/2018/jan/27/captures-children-imagination-sustainability-arts","type":"article","sectionId":"teacher-network","sectionName":"Teacher Network","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-27T07:30:44Z","webTitle":"'It captures their imagination': teaching sustainability through the arts","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/teacher-network/2018/jan/27/captures-children-imagination-sustainability-arts","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/teacher-network/2018/jan/27/captures-children-imagination-sustainability-arts","fields":{"headline":"'It captures their imagination': teaching sustainability through the arts","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"At Fleet primary school in north London, children between the ages of three and 11 are learning songs about climate change and the environment. Tunes featuring fossil fuels, composting, growing vegetables and the impact of transport have all become popular in class, despite the somewhat serious messages at their heart. For the teachers, music is proving to be a useful tool in explaining subjects that may otherwise be considered complex or inaccessible for young children. “The kids love singing about green issues,” says Beth Cleine, head of science and arts at the school. “They learn simple, catchy songs and sing them in the classroom or all together in assembly. It’s a fun way to learn.” The children performed some of the songs at last year’s Camden Music Festival at the Royal Albert Hall.The school started using music as a tool to educate its pupils about the environment after hearing about a project called Project Earth Rock, which creates songs, animation and videos about sustainability for schools. The resource works well for the students, says Cleine, because it offers both a clear message and a visual aid. The topics also lend themselves to a number of different aspects of the curriculum or campaigns such as walk to school week. Cleine adds: “When we set up the compost bins, we learn the ‘compost and growing’ song and produce artwork in relation to it, too. The arts and other curriculum areas are continually connected. Teaching the children to be sustainable has nice science, humanities and responsible citizenship links.” The school also has its own garden, which the children help to maintain. Capturing the imagination Gomersal St Mary’s CE primary school in Cleckheaton, near Bradford, has also found the creative arts helpful with engaging pupils in discussions about sustainability. Here, children aged eight and nine have been learning about people in Pakistan who make fair trade footballs. “The children make footballs out of recycled paper, carrier bags and elastic bands, and they discuss global issues around poverty, fairness and fair trade,” explains Cindy Sheard, a teacher at the school. The children have also made “bottle bug hotels”, which involves filling leftover plastic bottles with twigs and leaves for insects to live in. Teacher Emma Wilson says: “The kids learn that if you remove the bottom of the food chain web, there’d be nothing for the birds to feed on. It captures their imagination – if we can’t get them to engage at this age we’ve lost the opportunity to really get them.” The workshops at Gomersal are run in partnership with fairandfunky, a community interest company that aims to teach key stage 1 and 2 children about recycling, the environment and fair trade through art. Since the organisation’s inception five years ago, 10,000 students around Yorkshire have attended its sessions, some of which it offers for free. Teaching the whole child Elsewhere, students are focusing on the processes involved in getting their food from farm to plate. At Meltham CE primary school in Holmfirth near Huddersfield, “farmer drama” sessions have been encouraging students to put themselves in the position of those working within the supply chain. “Students learn about banana farmers and the chain from supplier to the fruit bowl,” headteacher Alex Beaumont says. “They suggest the different roles – from the farmer, to a truck driver, to the consumer. Students then step into the shoes of the farmer, for example, and make up dialogue such as: ‘I can’t make enough money to send my kids to school if I don’t get a fair price … ’ They have lively discussions about making it possible for everyone along the supply chain to be paid fairly for their work.” Pupils and teachers also host their own farmers’ markets. Fair trade has become part of the curriculum, says deputy head, Phil Gibbins, even though it has required putting some of the budget aside to fund the workshops, which are also run by fairandfunky. But it’s a topic the school felt it should touch early on, and the outside help has made the lessons more effective. “It has a lot do with your ethos as a school: what are your priorities?” Gibbins says. “Key stage 1 in particular need to understand, to see and feel. Abstract learning at that age isn’t successful and would be a poor way of teaching.” At a time when some are voicing concerns about the arts being squeezed out at primary level, Beaumont feels it’s important to recognise the value these subjects can have in teaching children about the world. “As headteacher I can steer the direction we go in and I put great importance on environmental and third world issues and working with the arts,” he says. “I believe that primary school education is about teaching the whole child, and this is a very good way of doing that.” Follow us on Twitter via @GuardianTeach, like us on Facebook, and join the Guardian Teacher Network the latest articles direct to your inbox Looking for a teaching job?

But in Sandgren’s case, the line sits there like an attempt to say: Hey, just because I read, like and share alt-right bigotry does not mean I’m an alt-right bigot. A week ago, few knew or cared about Tennys Sandgren’s Twitter account. Most didn’t even know who Tennys Sandgren was. But that was before the 26-year old from Tennessee, the 97th-ranked player in the world who didn’t even make it off the Challenger tour until last year, went on an improbable run to the men’s quarter-finals at the Australian Open, including a five-set victory over Dominic Thiem, the No5 player in the world. It was a feel-good story. Until some fans checked the verified Twitter account run by Tennys and immediately stopped feeling good. Sandgren’s more than 500 Twitter follows feature a who’s who of who’s hateful from the alt-right. Mike Cernovich, Ann Coulter, Dan Roodt, Tommy Robinson, Sebastian Gorka, Laura Ingraham, Don Nehlen, Iowa Congressman and overt racism aficionado Steve King. Sandgren even follows @MAGAjoe69, an account with 17 other followers outside of the tennis player and one that features a Pepe’d Donald Trump avatar. And the list – unfortunately for society in that so many of these people exist – goes on and on. Yes, to be fair, Sandgren also follows the likes of Elon Musk, Hugh Jackman and Andre Agassi, proof that curiosity about white nationalism doesn’t comprise the full spectrum of his interests. Asked after his last match if he is a far-right sympathizer, Sandgren responded: “Who you follow on Twitter, I feel, doesn’t matter even a little bit. What information you see doesn’t dictate what you think or believe. I think it’s crazy to think that. I think it’s crazy to assume that. To say: ‘Well, he’s following X person, so he believes all the the things that this person believes.’ I think that’s ridiculous.” Both ridiculous and crazy, Sandgren tweeted not long after the 2016 US presidential election that the evidence of “Pizzagate” – a far-right conspiracy theory that involved Hillary Clinton helping run a child sex slave operation out of a Northern Virginia pizza shop – was “sickening” and “the collective evidence is too much to ignore.” It is baffling that someone foolish enough to fall for Pizzagate can even understand tennis’ scoring system, let alone play the sport, but that’s a discussion for another time. At this time, and in the last 24 hours, Sandgren has removed the pizza tweet and nearly every other Twitter post he’s made. Yes, even his tweeted ponderance about why the media wasn’t reporting more on Hillary Clinton’s supposed ties to “spirit cooking.” Same with his “RIP @Nero” tweet, mourning the banning of alt-right troll Milo Yiannopoulos from Twitter in the summer of 2016, now gone forever. RIP, idiocy. Sandgren, when pushed again by a reporter if he supported the alt-right movement said: “No, I don’t. I find some of the content interesting. But no, I don’t, not at all. As a firm Christian, I don’t support things like that. I support Christ and following him. That’s what I support.” OK. Tennis fans can choose to believe Sandgren’s brief words at the press gathering demonstrate who he really is. Or they can choose to believe that his now-deleted words on Twitter, written over numerous years, better capture the man. And then they’ll decide if they can continue to root for the upstart in his quarterfinal match against Hyeon Chung, the unseeded South Korean underdog who wears glasses, just upset Novak Djokovic in straight sets and, as of this publishing, has no known associations to hateful rhetoric. Sandgren is the latest athlete to highlight a modern sports fan dilemma: Is an athlete’s politics enough of a reason to root against him or her, regardless of the uniform they wear or the country or city they represent? Without question, many American football fans decided Colin Kaepernick’s silent kneeling during the national anthem was too much for them. (As did, obviously, many NFL owners, general managers and coaches, as the quarterback remains unemployed while Blake Bortles is handed the keys of a play-off team.) For others, Kaepernick wearing police pig socks at a San Francisco 49ers practice and a Fidel Castro T-shirt to a press conference is what pushed them into the anti-Kaepernick camp. On the opposite side of the political spectrum, there’s Curt Schilling, former baseball pitcher and now a Breitbart online radio show host. And, yes, you guessed it: someone Tennys Sandgren follows on Twitter. When Schilling pitched through his bloody sock in Game 6 of the 2004 American League Championship Series, Twitter didn’t exist, the United States was far less polarized politically and, so, Boston fans didn’t know that Schilling held loathsome views on Muslims and the transgender community. Nor did they know he was someone who would take tens of millions in loans from the state of Rhode Island for a (failed) video game company, only to then align himself with a political philosophy that rails against welfare and entitlements. Boston fans face a similar dilemma today with their beloved Patriots. Tom Brady, Bill Belichick and Robert Kraft may be the greatest quarterback, head coach and team owner in NFL history. It’s impossible not to marvel at Brady’s on-field performance or the strategic and organizational advantage Belichick somehow manages to hold over every opposing coach week after week. Yet in the deep blue state of Massachusetts, is all of that enough to overlook Brady’s MAGA hat and friendship with Trump? Or Kraft and Belichick’s overt endorsement of the president, including Belichick writing a letter that was read by Trump himself at a New Hampshire rally the night before the 2016 election? Meanwhile, New England’s Super Bowl opponent, the Philadelphia Eagles, has been called the “wokest” team in the NFL with not one, but two, players who have raised a fist during the national anthem. Do some fans of the Eagles, playing in a state that tipped for Trump in 2016, struggle to justify rooting for a team full of players that openly dislike the president? Probably. Although an unexpected trip to the Super Bowl may help them set aside their displeasure for a time. But can you still root for someone, even if they represent your city or nation, if they hold political beliefs that disgust you? It’s an interesting discussion to have. Maybe someone on the far-right can tweet it into Tennys Sundgren’s Twitter feed so he can think about it, too."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"music/2018/jan/22/the-smiths-partially-reunite-for-classical-concerts","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-22T15:09:01Z","webTitle":"The Smiths partially reunite for classical concerts","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/jan/22/the-smiths-partially-reunite-for-classical-concerts","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/jan/22/the-smiths-partially-reunite-for-classical-concerts","fields":{"headline":"The Smiths partially reunite for classical concerts","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Members of the Smiths will reunite on stage for the first time in more than 30 years this summer.

Members of the University and College Union (UCU) at 61 universities backed industrial action amid widespread concern about new pension proposals that they fear would result in a typical lecturer losing £200,000 in retirement. There has been growing anger at UK university campuses since last summer when the Universities Superannuation Scheme (USS), the sector’s main retirement fund, demanded an extra £500m a year from university employers and staff to fill a £5bn funding hole. Universities UK (UUK), which represents university employers, has proposed altering the fund from a defined benefit scheme that gives a guaranteed retirement income to a riskier defined contribution plan, where pension income is subject to movements in the stock market. The union is concerned its members would lose out and that the scheme would be less generous. The decisive UCU vote – in which 88% of members who voted backed strike action and 93% backed action short of a strike – was described by UUK as “disappointing”, with talks due to finish on Tuesday. The union said it hoped talks could be extended in an effort to resolve differences and avoid strike action. The list of universities where the ballot took place and that are likely to be affected by any industrial action includes many of the country’s leading institutions such as Oxford, Cambridge, Imperial College and King’s College London. The UCU general secretary, Sally Hunt, said: “UCU members have made it quite clear that they are prepared to take sustained strike action to defend their pensions. USS already offers worse benefits than other schemes available in universities, and UUK’s proposals would make matters worse.” According to the union, two earlier rounds of cuts have already left USS members with pensions worth less than those of school teachers and academic colleagues in the Teachers’ Pension Scheme, an alternative scheme on offer in universities. A number of vice-chancellors have voiced their concerns about the proposed changes. A UUK spokesperson warned against industrial action, saying it could cause unwanted disruption to students, and said urgent action was required to solve the significant funding challenges facing USS. “We should be under no illusion, this is not a problem that will go away if ignored. UUK’s priority is to put USS on a secure and sustainable footing while offering attractive, market-leading pensions – the very best that can be afforded by both employers and employees. “To retain the status quo would only serve interests in the short term. Without reform now, universities will likely be forced to divert funding allocated from research and teaching to fill a pensions funding gap. The option of no reform is a dangerous gamble. It is a risk that employers cannot take. “If industrial action takes place it could cause disruption to students at some universities. We hope that this can be avoided through further talks with UCU and that union members carefully consider the possible impact on students of taking industrial action.” The union said it hoped that the overwhelming mandate for strike action on a 58% turnout would focus universities’ minds and that more vice-chancellors would add their voices to the growing pressure on UUK to agree a deal. The union’s higher education committee is meeting to plan an industrial action strategy in case talks fail to produce a solution. About 184,000 university staff – mainly at pre-1992 universities – contribute towards a USS pension."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2018/feb/02/cocaine-rhinestones-a-country-history-lesson-podcasts-of-the-week","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-02T08:00:46Z","webTitle":"Cocaine & Rhinestones: a country history lesson – podcasts of the week","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/feb/02/cocaine-rhinestones-a-country-history-lesson-podcasts-of-the-week","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2018/feb/02/cocaine-rhinestones-a-country-history-lesson-podcasts-of-the-week","fields":{"headline":"Cocaine & Rhinestones: a country history lesson – podcasts of the week","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Pick of the week: Cocaine &amp; Rhinestones, and American History Tellers Cocaine &amp; Rhinestones: The History of Country Music Podcast Within this decadently titled podcast lies a brilliant encyclopedia of country music, which makes the genre accessible even if you’ve never set foot in a cowboy boot.

Because Ames so often questions his own motives and impulses, we can’t help but do the same. Yes, he is mainly writing for his young son, to be read at a time when Ames is long gone – but, as a religious man, it is also reasonable to assume that he wonders what God makes of his concerns and self-justifications. As we judge Ames, we also find ourselves playing that God – which is no easy game. Ames is simultaneously jealous and fearful that once he has gone, the younger Jack Broughton may take his place with his wife and child. But it’s hard to blame the old man for having such twinges, after his long, lonely time “getting by on books and baseball and fried egg sandwiches”. The thought of passing his new family on to someone else is agonising: “The truth is as I stood there in the pulpit, looking down on the three of you, you looked to me like a handsome young family, and my evil old heart rose within me, the old covetise I have mentioned elsewhere came over me, and I felt the way I used to feel when the beauty of other lives was a misery and offense to me.” He adds the heartbreaking comment: “And I felt as if I were looking back from the grave.” Poor man! He is so aware of his own failings that it’s hard to hold them against him. He’s honest right down to the smallest detail (“You are drawing those terrible little pictures that you will bring me to admire, and which I will admire because I have not the heart to say one word you might remember against me,” he writes fondly of his small son); and admits to not being a neutral judge of Broughton (“You may know by now what a fallible man I am, and how little I can trust my feelings on this subject”). While we sympathise with Ames, there are things that must give us pause. It’s hard not to wince when he writes of Broughton: “He is not a man of the highest character. Be wary of him.” He seems prepared to condemn the man from beyond the grave, eventually detailing the very worst story he knows about Broughton: how he took advantage of a young, poverty-stricken girl then abandoned her. All this does make one question the old Christian’s capacity for forgiveness, especially when he recounts Broughton’s silly childhood transgressions (like painting Ames’s step with molasses) and admits: “I have never been able to warm to him ever.” Ames may be right in his judgment – but may also be very wrong. And not only about Broughton – how, for instance, does his pacifism stack up against his grandfather’s willingness to shed blood during the struggle for emancipation? Sure, his grandfather sounds wild and difficult. But should he not have joined such an important struggle? Again, he and Ames are both right – and both wrong. We may be put in an impossible position when it comes to judging Ames, but there’s more to playing God than weighing scales: we also get the joy of forgiving John Ames. Even before the beautiful final scenes where he tries to make his peace with Broughton, I couldn’t help but indulge him. How not to feel for a man who concludes his career as a preacher with: “I’ve probably been boring a lot of people for a long time”? Or who writes, while watching his young son and a playmate horse around with a sprinkler: “Well but you two are dancing around in your iridescent little downpour, whooping and stomping as sane people ought to do when they encounter a thing so miraculous as water”? I can think of few literary characters I’ve liked as much as John Ames, nor many who have so successfully challenged my own prejudices. I didn’t expect a pious old Iowan Protestant could move me so deeply. Robinson may have invited me to play God – but she also taught me humility along the way."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/jan/22/yes-jacinda-ardern-can-combine-work-with-a-baby-but-its-not-for-every-woman","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-22T13:05:19Z","webTitle":"Yes, Jacinda Ardern can combine work with a baby – but it’s not for every woman | Chitra Ramaswamy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jan/22/yes-jacinda-ardern-can-combine-work-with-a-baby-but-its-not-for-every-woman","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jan/22/yes-jacinda-ardern-can-combine-work-with-a-baby-but-its-not-for-every-woman","fields":{"headline":"Yes, Jacinda Ardern can combine work with a baby – but it’s not for every woman","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The reaction to New Zealand prime minister Jacinda Ardern’s pregnancy in office is two-pronged. First, the standard woke response. Of course a woman can be prime minister and a mum! Women are multitaskers! This whole fierce story represents all that is anti-Trump about the world! As Ardern herself put it: “It’s what ladies do.” Sample that, Beyoncé. Second, the standard misogynistic response, which will be given all the attention it deserves. The truth is, both prongs are too weak to prise open the can of worms that is motherhood. Yes, a woman can be a prime minister and a mum … with enough support, better maternity pay (one recent study found universities with generous policies employed twice the number of female professors), an equal partnership and so on. The question, and it’s one that feminism seems to want buried, is whether she wants to. Ardern has said she will return to office six weeks after the birth (when her partner will take over), during which time she will remain “contactable”. Let’s be honest: this sounds bloody stressful. Six weeks after the birth of both my babies, I was still bleeding, barely sleeping and losing entire hours marvelling/angsting over the rise and fall of the baby’s chest. Or looking for muslins. This doesn’t mean I was less competent, only that I was utterly consumed with the hard graft of parenting. I did not want to go back to work. I wanted to be a full-time mother, to be able to afford it and to not be made to feel ashamed of it. If Serena Williams hadn’t wanted to return to tennis four months after the birth of her daughter, that would have been a victory for feminism, too. When France’s justice minister, Rachida Dati, returned to work five days after a caesarean in 2009, it was not a triumph for women. It was a triumph for capitalism (and any triumph for capitalism is a triumph for the patriarchy). The uncomfortable, intimidating and joyous truth is that becoming a mother – not for all, but for many – changes everything, for ever. It is a life’s work. Until we acknowledge both the enormity of this unpaid, undervalued and unseen job, we continue to do motherhood and the women who choose to do it (or want to, but are not able) a gross disservice."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"world/2018/jan/22/swedish-bookseller-allegedly-snatched-by-chinese-agents-from-train-gui-minhai","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-22T12:00:17Z","webTitle":"Swedish bookseller 'snatched by Chinese agents from train'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jan/22/swedish-bookseller-allegedly-snatched-by-chinese-agents-from-train-gui-minhai","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jan/22/swedish-bookseller-allegedly-snatched-by-chinese-agents-from-train-gui-minhai","fields":{"headline":"Swedish bookseller 'snatched by Chinese agents from train'","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"A Swedish publisher believed to have been abducted by Chinese agents after riling Beijing with his books about the peccadilloes of the Communist party’s elite has allegedly been snatched for a second time while travelling to Beijing by train with a group of European diplomats. Supporters and relatives of Gui Minhai, a Hong Kong-based bookseller who mysteriously vanished from his Thai holiday home in October 2015, had hoped he was on the verge of freedom after reports that he was “half free” and living under surveillance in the eastern Chinese city of Ningbo. However, those hopes were dashed on Monday by claims that he had again vanished, this time while taking a train to Beijing for medical treatment with two Swedish diplomats. Angela Gui, the bookseller’s UK-based daughter, told the Guardian she was “very saddened” by the latest twist in her father’s story. “This was precisely what wasn’t supposed to happen,” she said. Gui, 53, is understood to have been travelling to Beijing on Saturday to be examined at the Swedish embassy because of concerns that he might have a rare neurological disease. As the publisher’s train stopped at a station not far from the Chinese capital, his daughter said, about 10 plainclothes agents boarded and escorted him away. “I haven’t heard anything [about where he is now],” she added. John Kamm, an American human rights campaigner who has been working with the bookseller’s family, told the New York Times: “Gui Minhai is exhibiting symptoms of a serious neurological condition, symptoms that did not exist before he was taken into custody in October 2015.” Referring to the death in Chinese custody last year of the Nobel laureate Liu Xiaobo, Kamm added: “I pray we will not witness the death in prison of another person accused of political crimes.” Angela Gui told the Guardian: “I would like my father to be immediately released so he can return to Sweden and receive the medical care he urgently needs.” Gui’s original disappearance – and that of four other Hong Kong booksellers, including one British citizen – was widely seen as part of a broader crackdown on Communist party foes that has unfolded since Xi Jinping became China’s leader in November 2012. Xi, who was recently anointed as China’s most powerful leader since Mao, has overseen what activists and diplomats describe as the most severe political chill since the days following the 1989 Tiananmen massacre. However, more than two years after the booksellers were first targeted, the forces driving the saga remain shrouded in mystery. In June 2016 another of the abducted men, Lam Wing-kee, claimed he had been kidnapped by Chinese special forces as part of a coordinated push to silence Beijing’s critics. “They blindfolded me and put a cap on my head and basically bundled me up,” Lam told reporters. Patric Nilsson, a spokesman for Sweden’s foreign ministry, told Radio Sweden that Stockholm was taking “vigorous action” at the highest political level in response to Gui’s detention. “This event will be handled with the utmost seriousness,” Nilsson vowed. Human rights activists urged Beijing to free the bookseller. Sophie Richardson, Human Rights Watch’s China director, said: “This is a shocking development, for Chinese police to do this to a foreign citizen, in the company of his country’s diplomats, and when Chinese authorities have themselves said he is ‘free’.” “It tells us that if Chinese authorities want to silence you, they will, regardless of your citizenship [or] regardless of whether you have violated any discernible law.” Amnesty International’s William Nee tweeted that Gui should be released immediately."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/jan/27/why-i-love-a-daytime-cinema-trip-bim-adewunmi","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-27T06:00:42Z","webTitle":"Why I love a daytime cinema trip","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jan/27/why-i-love-a-daytime-cinema-trip-bim-adewunmi","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jan/27/why-i-love-a-daytime-cinema-trip-bim-adewunmi","fields":{"headline":"Why I love a daytime cinema trip","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"To be deemed a true luxury, a thing has to be regarded as an uncommon indulgence.

It’s clumsy, and in the wrong light suggests something a little more personal, I know. We can workshop a new title, but the concept is sound. My self-luxe activity this week was a simple daytime movie trip. The rituals of movie-going are soothing and always the same: good for quieting parts of the brain, even as it engages others. At midday on a weekday, I settled into a seat on the Lower East Side and rendered my phone silent. Cinema days were a thing I did as a freelancer, once a deadline or three had been met, and I didn’t realise how much I missed them. Sliding the credit card across the counter brought an illicit thrill – similar to the feeling adulterers get when booking a room by the hour, I reckon – that lingered all day. Emerging from hours spent indoors to a bright sky makes a person feel giddy (and somehow wealthy), especially in winter. And it was gilded with the pleasing notion that this trip was also useful, in the pursuit of mental wellbeing. Self-luxe.

Four years after damning revelations of chattel slavery aboard Thai fishing boats linked to seafood exported and sold by major retailers around the world, a report says that rights violations in one of Thailand’s major export industries continue unabated, including forced labour and widespread human trafficking. For the report HRW conducted interviews with 248 current and former Burmese and Cambodian fishermen as well as Thai officials, boat owners, local activists and United Nations agency staff over a two-year period in all of Thailand’s major fishing ports. It documented how migrant fishermen from south-east Asia continue to be routinely trafficked on to fishing boats, prevented from leaving or changing employers, and are often not paid for their work or paid less than the minimum wage. “What the report found was that although this military government has taken more positive steps forward than the last, the reforms that have been put in place are still largely cosmetic,” said Brad Adams, director of Human Rights Watch in Asia. “Forced labour is routine. The workers we interviewed described being trafficked on to ships, trapped in jobs they couldn’t leave, physical abuse, lack of food, long hours and awful working conditions. The worst thing for many of them was not being paid – the psychological harm and final indignity was the hardest to bear.” Steve Trent, chief executive of the Environmental Justice Foundation (EJF), who has been working with the Thai government on its reforms, said the focus should also be on ensuring that those selling seafood to consumers take responsibility for ensuring supply chains are free from rights abuses. “There is no shadow of a doubt that widespread and very serious labour violations are continuing throughout the industry,” said Trent. “Buyers and retailers have failed comprehensively to play their part in finding a real solution.” He said the creation of the Sustainable Seafood Taskforce had failed to live up to its promises: the industry body, made up of supermarkets, buyers and retailers sourcing seafood from Thailand, was set up in 2015 to bring transparency and accountability to their supply chains. “Never in my career have I seen a process more focused on talking in hotel rooms in Bangkok rather than actually committing to using their influence to create real change,” he said. “I challenge any of the retailers selling Thai seafood to consumers to guarantee that products from Thailand are free from human rights abuses and illegal fishing. They have arguably more power than anyone else and they are failing to use it.” The Sustainable Seafood Taskforce did not respond to a request for comment. A major investigation by the Guardian in 2014 exposed brutal cases of slavery aboard Thai fishing boats feeding trash fish – inedible or infant species of fish to be ground into fishmeal – into the supply chain of prawns sold by supermarkets in the UK, Europe and United States. In 2015 the European Union imposed a “yellow card” on Thailand under its illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing framework, threatening to ban Thai fisheries imports if the government failed to clean up its fishing industry, including labour rights violations. The Thai government responded with a broad programme of reforms including new laws to regulate and improve working conditions, documentation and wages for migrant fishermen. A “port-in, port-out” (Pipo) system was also created to require boats to report for inspections, as well as limiting time at sea to 30 days. However, HRW said that although some progress had been made, the persistence of trafficking and forced labour on fishing boats illustrated that many of the reforms were cosmetic. The report said that the labour inspection regime was largely a “theatrical exercise for international consumption” and that in 2015 Thailand failed to find a single case of forced labour in inspections of 474,334 fishing crew. The group is now urging the European Union to continue using the IUU framework to keep the pressure on the Thai government to address trafficking and slavery at sea. “Although we understand that the IUU is designed to focus on fishing stocks and environmental issues, we’re really concerned that a move to address human rights concerns outside the IUU framework means that we will lose the only real effective tool that the EU had to address trafficking and forced labour in the Thai seafood industry,” said Adams. Luisa Ragher, deputy of the delegation of the European Union in Thailand, said that the EU is committed to working alongside the Thai government to tackle labour rights violations. “The government of Thailand has given high priority to this and put significant effort into addressing these problems. There are still shortcomings but progress has been made and we are confident of their commitment to improving things,” she said. “We are working intensively at opening up a broader discussion on labour rights that extends past fishing into other sectors.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/jan/22/turkish-shelling-of-kurdish-controlled-afrin-in-syria-continues","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-22T15:54:04Z","webTitle":"Turkey plans Syria 'safe zone' as shelling of Kurdish area resumes","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jan/22/turkish-shelling-of-kurdish-controlled-afrin-in-syria-continues","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jan/22/turkish-shelling-of-kurdish-controlled-afrin-in-syria-continues","fields":{"headline":"Turkey plans Syria 'safe zone' as shelling of Kurdish area resumes","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Turkey has resumed shelling a Kurdish enclave inside Syria on the third day of a military campaign that the government says aims to create a “safe zone” across the border. The fighting is ongoing in villages and towns around Afrin, which is controlled by the Kurdish Democratic Union party (PYD) and its military wing, the People’s Protection Units (YPG), which Ankara says is the Syrian arm of a terror group that has fought a decades-long insurgency inside Turkey. The Turkish prime minister, Binali Yıldırım said the aim of the campaign, dubbed “Operation Olive Branch”, would be to create a zone inside Syria’s borders that was 30km (19 miles) deep. Turkish officials also said they wanted to significantly degrade the military capabilities of the YPG, which they say has 8,000 to 10,000 fighters in Afrin. The “safe zone” would probably be secured and administered by Turkey’s Syrian rebel allies, creating a buffer zone with the Turkish border. Turkish officials have also hinted that it could be used as a safe area for civilians who wish to return to Syria, modelled on other parts of the country that Turkey had seized from Isis in an offensive called “Euphrates Shield” that was launched in the summer of 2016. “First goal is to create a safe area there and then we can take concrete steps to eliminate terrorist elements,” Yıldırım said. Competing claims have emerged on both sides, with Turkey saying it has joined allied Syrian rebel fighters to take control of a series of YPG military points along the enclave’s outskirts. A spokesman for the Kurdish militia said fierce fighting was ongoing amid intense artillery bombardment from Turkey’s border provinces of Kilis and Hatay. The YPG also claims to have launched counter-attacks on Syrian rebel positions. There have been no credible reports of the total casualties on either side. The US Secretary of State, Rex Tillerson, said Monday he was “concerned” about Turkey’s new offensive in northern Syria, as he urged all sides to show restraint. “The US is in Syria to defeat Isis. We’ve done that with a coalition of partners and the [Kurdish-led] Syrian Democratic Forces, so we are concerned about the Turkish incidents in northern Syria,” he said ahead of a meeting in London with the UK foreign secretary, Boris Johnson. But the US, he added, also recognised Turkey’s “legitimate right to protect its own citizens from terrorist elements that may be launching attacks against Turkish citizens on Turkish soil from Syria.” His statement was echoed by Johnson. “We understand that the Kurds have been instrumental in taking the fight to Daesh, and everybody appreciates that,” he said. “On the other hand, Turkey does have a legitimate interest in protecting its own border.” The remarks stopped short of the level of criticism of Turkish actions voiced by the french foreign minister, Jean-Yves Le Drian. France has convened a closed-door meeting of the UN Security Council for Monday deploring the “brutal degradation of the situation” in northern Syria. The Turkish foreign minister, Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu, will travel to Paris for talks on Tuesday. Yıldırım and the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, have vowed the campaign would be swift, saying they would establish the safe zone and root out the militias, as well as rebuilding infrastructure and democratic institutions. But questions remain on whether they can dislodge the militias from the majority Kurdish enclave and whether locals are likely to welcome Ankara’s troops and proxy fighters. Turkey has long regarded the growing power of the YPG in northern Syria as a national security threat. The militia spearheaded the ground campaign against Islamic State that was backed by the US-led coalition against Isis, and has essentially enjoyed a security umbrella from Washington, which supported the group with airstrikes and later with direct arms supplies. The YPG led the campaign against the city of Raqqa, the self-proclaimed capital of the Isis caliphate, successfully ousting the militants. The alliance with the US has created deep-seated tensions between Turkey and the US, the two largest armies in Nato, and Ankara intervened militarily in Syria in August 2016 to create a buffer zone that would halt Kurdish expansion west of the Euphrates river. Russia, which had granted Turkey permission to begin the operation, pulling out its military from the area and allowing the use of Afrin’s airspace by Turkish warplanes, blamed the US on Monday for the crisis. The Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, said Washington had encouraged “separatist” sentiments among Syria’s Kurds, whom Turkey had long accused of wanting to establish a self-governing statelet in areas liberated from Isis. The Olive Branch operation came after a US announcement that it would build a border security force inside Syria that would include the YPG as a key component."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2018/jan/24/the-book-of-joan-by-lidia-yuknavitch-review","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-24T07:29:24Z","webTitle":"The Book of Joan by Lidia Yuknavitch review – the future is medieval","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jan/24/the-book-of-joan-by-lidia-yuknavitch-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/jan/24/the-book-of-joan-by-lidia-yuknavitch-review","fields":{"headline":"The Book of Joan by Lidia Yuknavitch review – the future is medieval","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The Book of Joan opens with an epigraph from Doris Lessing: “We are all creatures of the stars”. It’s a quote from her 1979 science fiction novel Shikasta, about a world that has destroyed itself through environmental damage and war. At a moment when the end of life as we know it feels even more likely than it did in 1979, Lidia Yuknavitch follows Lessing in imagining in precise detail what might come after life on Earth. Her book has a similar level of ambition to Lessing’s novel, going deep into history at the same time as it dwells in the future. In this case, the history is medieval. One premise of The Book of Joan is that the 21st century, for all its technological advances, has returned us to pre-modern levels of brutality and strife. There are children fighting once again; there are religious crusades; land is seized at will. Yuknavitch takes three real people from medieval France and reimagines them in a post-apocalyptic future. They are the romance poet Jean de Meun (author of part of The Romance of the Rose), his poetical adversary the proto-feminist writer Christine de Pizan, described by Simone de Beauvoir as the first woman to “take up her pen in defence of her sex”, and the girl warrior with apparently magical powers, Joan of Arc. When the book opens, it’s 2049 and De Pizan is living semi-incarcerated in a panopticon on Ciel, a suborbital complex built from remnants of old space stations and located just above the Earth. Ciel is presided over by Jean de Men, a dictator who writes romances in his spare time. Although they have only been there for 35 years, Ciel’s inhabitants have undergone a rapid process of “devolution”. They have lost their hair, their skin pigmentation and, most crucially, their genitalia. They do not sweat and though they cry, the tears fall unseen because they have mutilated themselves by burning skin grafts on to their bodies and faces, obscuring the pathways from the eyes. These skin grafts are at the heart of the book. In the face of a world that has become ever more virtual, Ciel’s inhabitants have come to believe fiercely in the power of art and of what is left of their bodies. They have taken to burning images and, most importantly, texts, on to their skin. Christine is the great grafter of the community; she has mastered the technique and learned to be impervious to the pain. Now, she knows that she has only a year to live (because of shortage of space, people here are killed at 50), so she begins her final masterwork. Where the original De Pizan wrote the first epic poem describing Joan of Arc, the modern Christine has taken it upon herself to write the story of Joan of Dirt, “the woman whose story broke the world”. As told by Christine, by Joan herself and by the narrator (it’s not always clear who is narrating), Joan’s story is the tale of an idealism that turns destructive once it becomes clear that there can be no place left for ideals. Rather like the original Joan, this one sets out to use her magical gifts to end war. However, she comes to see that “to end war meant to end its maker, to marry creation and destruction rather than hold them in false opposition”. She joins forces with the sun to terminate the possibility of human habitation on Earth. As a result, she is given a trial on Ciel in which she comes face to face with her adversary, De Men. He proposes a linguistic chess match; Joan retorts that there can be no such thing “when language and being and knowing themselves are revealed to be dumb binaries”. And then, in an act meant to evoke shock and awe at its medieval authenticity, Joan is burned at the stake. Or is she? Joan’s story, burned on to Christine’s skin, becomes a way to consider the relationship between the word and the flesh, as well as the ties between the Earth and its human inhabitants. Gender is key here because, in the absence of genitalia, it has become so theoretical. What Joan offers, perhaps more importantly than anything else, is her continued embodiment as a woman. In a move reminiscent of The Handmaid’s Tale, De Men hopes to capture Joan and to use her to breed. But he is not the only one to be obsessed by the power of Joan’s body. Christine too, mourning the carnal, craves “her sexuality – her sexual reality. The fact of her body. Not particularly female, leaning towards male, an exquisite androgyny.” There is a tension here that lies at the core of the book. Christine celebrates the androgyny that is the by-product of bodily disintegration. She and her quasi-lover Trinculo (a man who was gay on Earth but can now desire Christine in their new, disembodied world) engage in a kind of bawdy banter that arouses them both into an apparently orgasmic state. Yet she nonetheless craves Joan’s body, which, however androgynous it may seem from the outside, is still the body of a woman in the old-fashioned, earthly sense. These conundrums are presented within a framework that is unapologetically intellectual. Yuknavitch is an American academic who writes literary criticism as well as novels; the book is inflected with the language of critical theory. If Joan sounds curiously like a semiotician at her trial, then Christine is even more openly academic. The narrative mode is to show through dramatic, often moving scenes, and then to tell, reflecting on them analytically. This disjunction can be jarring, but it’s knowingly done, because the book’s style is itself a theme. Christine is aware of the tiredness of theoretical language even as she uses it; she hopes that by writing on the body she can resist this. “It’s our idiotic minds that overwrite everything. But the body has a point of view.” She is coming to see – and this is where the book is at its most idealistic – that “two things have always ruptured up and through hegemony: art and bodies”. By combining the two she hopes to provide resistance on behalf of Joan, of women in general and, ultimately, of the life force of the Earth itself. What Joan and Christine are learning together, through their curiously interconnected stories, is that the Earth is living matter and its inhabitants are merely part of it. It can be regenerated, but it will take the blood of the living to do so. “Everything is matter,” Christine says, in a passage reminiscent of Lessing’s Sufi-inspired Shikasta. “Everything is moved by and through energy. Bodies are miniature renditions of the entire universe.” As with Lessing, there is much to confuse and to irritate in this book. But as a vision of the collective that is carefully attuned to the importance of the ties that bind us to each other, and to our world, it is nonetheless moving and compelling.

He figured he’d bitten himself in his sleep and thought nothing more about it until halfway through the winter holidays, when he realised the sore was still with him. He Googled “cut on tongue won’t heal” and, after sifting through pages of medical information on oral cancer, he decided to call his doctor. The cut was nothing, Joe was sure: he was a non-smoker with no family history of cancer. But he’d make an appointment, just in case. I’m sure it’s nothing, the doctor said. You’re not a smoker, and you’re 31 years old. But see a specialist, just in case. I’m sure it’s nothing, the specialist said, you don’t check any of the boxes, but we’ll do a biopsy, just in case. When the biopsy results came back positive for cancerous cells, the specialist said that the lab must have made a mistake. The second time Joe’s biopsy results came back positive, the specialist was startled. Now Joe was transferred to Guy’s hospital, which has one of the best oral cancer teams in Britain. The oncologists at Guy’s reassured Joe again: the cancerous spot was small, and cancer of the tongue typically starts on the surface and grows inward. This tiny sore could likely be nipped out without much damage to the rest of his tongue. They’d take an MRI to make sure there wasn’t any serious inward growth, and then schedule the surgery. The image revealed a tumour like an iceberg. It was rooted deep in the base of Joe’s tongue, mounding upward and out, its tip breaking the surface just where the telltale sore was located. “When the doctor told me the news, there was a work email that was bugging me and I still had that on my mind,” Joe wrote to me last summer. “As he was explaining to me that I was going to lose my tongue, I was redrafting a reply in my head.” “You’re going to lose two-thirds of your tongue,” the doctor was telling him. “This is going to seriously affect your ability to eat. And your speech.” Joe wanted to know how the surgery would affect his speaking. Would he have a lisp? The doctor hesitated, and then looked at his hands. “Your family will still be able to understand you.” A week before the surgery, Joe started to panic: he realised that he might never speak again. Even if he did, he would no longer sound like himself. Knowing that he was about to lose a huge part of his identity, Joe asked a friend to film an interview with him so that he would have a permanent record of his voice. In the video, Joe’s speech is already beginning to falter: he has a bit of a lisp, and he has to sip water frequently and take breaks to withstand the strain of talking. He is dressed in a black knitted V-neck sweater, and seated near a window through which you can see the London skyline at dusk. He is pale, with sunken, blue eyes, dark, shaggy hair and three days of stubble. He looks a little unwell, a little sad, and a little rueful, as if he’s unsure about being the centre of attention. He keeps ducking his head and looking away, or making jokes. When asked to state the date, he smirks and says, with wry formality, “The date is, I believe, the 24th of February, the year of our Lord 2017.” Speaking to the camera, Joe struggles genially to articulate what it feels like to contemplate losing his voice for ever. “I’m not what you’d call a vain man,” he says, quietly. “Usually it’s very far into the day before I’ve looked in the mirror. I don’t care about any of that.” He takes a moment. “But I am human. And the idea that I’m going to not look like me or sound like me … terrifying.” He swallows. “And also my job, my life, is all about communication, all about talking. I love talking,” he says feelingly, with a little smile. “I’ve got a few things to say.” Shortly before this video was taken, the friend behind the camera had come to Joe with some news. He had found a company outside Boston called VocaliD, which creates custom digitised voices for people who use devices to help them speak. The company could use recordings of Joe speaking to recreate his own voice on a computer for him to keep and use for ever. When they contacted VocaliD’s founder, a speech pathologist named Rupal Patel, she explained that it would be possible to digitally reconstruct Joe’s voice if, before his surgery, he was able to “bank” his voice. This meant recording the few thousand sentences that VocaliD has developed to capture all the phonemes in the English language. Joe agreed to try. He recorded several hundred sentences and then, realising the magnitude of the task, stopped for several days. “This was my last week of freedom and I had a lot of stuff to do, people to see, life to live (and steaks to eat),” he wrote to me. Two days before the surgery, he started again. Banking his voice was slow and painful – by then, it was excruciating to talk, and he was trying to be at his most eloquent. On the final day, he recorded late into the night. The next morning, Joe went back to hospital and had his tongue cut out, joining the ranks of those who cannot, in any traditional sense, speak. * * * There are surprisingly many ways for the power of speech to fail. There are disorders such as stuttering or apraxia, in which syllables are scrambled; motor neurone disease and cerebral palsy, which rob people of the muscle control required to articulate; traumatic brain injury; stroke; anatomical excisions like Joe’s; multiple sclerosis; autism. In the US, more than 2 million people require digital “adaptive alternative communication” (AAC) methods to help compensate for speech deficits. A 2008 study by the disability charity Scope estimated that 1% of people in Britain use or need AAC. Modern adaptive alternative communication often involves the type of device made famous by Stephen Hawking – a small computer or tablet that plays aloud words typed into it. Before the invention of the first modern text-to-speech communication device in 1969, people with muscular or vocal disorders had to use “sip-and-puff” typewriters, which were operated by inhaling and exhaling through a straw. By 1986, when Hawking began using a speech device, AAC technology had improved significantly. The programme he used, known as the Equalizer, allowed him to press a switch to select words or phrases on a desktop computer and, later, a smaller computer mounted to his wheelchair. The 2014 biopic of Hawking’s life, The Theory of Everything, contains a stark reminder of the loss that this technology tries to amend. When Hawking and his first wife, Jane, first hear what will be Hawking’s new voice, they are stunned. After a moment of speechlessness, Jane offers a timid objection: “It’s American.” The moment is played for laughs, but it marks a trauma. Our voices are coded with information by which others know us – age, gender, nationality, hometown, personality, mood – but they are also coded with the information by which we know ourselves. When your voice is no longer English, what part of your Englishness do you lose? Hawking’s case is one of the most striking examples of the way a person’s voice shapes their identity. Though the robotic quality of his digital voice (and the American accent) felt inappropriate at first, it came to be his trademark. Hawking reshaped himself around his new voice, and years later, when he was offered the opportunity to use a new voice that was smoother, more human-sounding, and English, he refused. This felt like “him” now. The “Stephen Hawking voice” doesn’t belong only to Hawking. In the years since it was created, the same voice has also been used by little girls, old men, and people of every racial and ethnic background. This is one of the stranger features of the world of people who rely on AAC: millions of them share a limited number of voices. While there is more variety now than before, only a few dozen options are widely available, and most of them are adult and male. “Walk into a classroom of children with voice disorders and you’ll hear the exact same voice all around you,” Rupal Patel of VocaliD told me. Ten years ago, she was at a speech disorders conference when she came upon a little girl and a man in his mid-50s who were using their devices to have a conversation. They were speaking in the same adult, male voice. Patel was horrified. “This is just continuing to dehumanise people who already don’t have a voice to talk,” she told me. The film critic Roger Ebert, whose jaw was removed to treat cancer, wrote in 2009 about how frustrating it was to use one of these generic voices: “I sound like Robby the Robot. Eloquence and intonation are impossible.” He was tired of being ignored in conversations or coming across like “the village idiot”. He went on: “We put men on the moon, people like to say about such desires: Why can’t I have a voice of my own?” This is the problem Patel has set out to solve. In 2007, she began researching technology that would allow her to make customised digital voices that sounded more like the humans they would represent. By 2014, the technology was sufficiently developed for Patel and her team to set up what they claim is the world’s first “voice bank”, an online platform where anyone with an internet connection can “donate” their voice by recording themselves reading aloud on to the VocaliD Voicebank, which is programmed with stories crafted to capture all the phonemes in the English language. (Early donors were required to upload 3,487 sentences; now, Geoff Meltzner, VocaliD’s Director of Research, can create a voice with as few as 1,000 sentences, though more material makes for a more human-sounding voice.) Each donation is catalogued in a library of voices that VocaliD can then use when crafting a new voice for a client. The company offers clients “BeSpoke” voices – custom-made voices that combine the sound of a client’s own voice with the vocabulary supplied by a donor. This way, a teenager could use his brother’s donated voice, or a perfect stranger’s from the Voicebank, whichever is the closest approximation to their imagined vocal quality. (Clients like Joe bank their voices for a purpose VocaliD calls “voice legacy”: they record themselves for later, and then, when the time comes, are given back a digital file of their own voice.) Creating a new digital voice like this requires splitting two elements of the human voice that normally function as one: the source and the filter. “Source” is the term for the vocal cords, larynx and throat muscles – the part of the body responsible for making sound when we laugh, yell or talk. As Geoff Meltzner, VocaliD’s vice-president of research, explained, your source is like a fingerprint. “There’s enough identity in each source alone to make it unique among all other sources.” The voice’s “filter” is the muscles (tongue, lips, pharynx etc) that shape those sounds into discrete, discernible words. VocaliD’s technology works by capturing a few seconds of vowel sound (the source) from the recipient, and applying it to the filter provided by a donor. The combination allows the production of a voice that’s largely “of” the recipient. By tweaking his algorithms, Meltzner can offer voice that is “warmer” (more nasal) or more “authoritative” (lower pitch) or “brighter” (full of high overtones). When a new voice is completed, it is added as a plug-in to whatever speech device its owner already uses. Recently, VocaliD added a feature on their own app that allows clients to adjust their voice to get exactly the timbre and volume they want. The system is designed to be convenient, but it still occasionally falls victim to glitches. One time, a teenage client called Patel in a panic because she had updated the software on her iPhone and lost her voice. Donating your voice – unlike, say, a kidney – usually takes a few days, and you’re awake for all of it. There’s no screening process and no equipment involved except a laptop and an internet connection. One lazy day last winter, I decided to donate my voice from bed, which is how I found myself pitched forward with my laptop, mouth to the built-in microphone, insisting: “That tiramisu is to die for! That tiramisu is to die for!” VocaliD’s Human Voicebank runs on an internet browser and is set up to look slightly like a video game: an indigo-blue backdrop frames a jaunty cartoon mouth with arms and legs standing next to a line of text, which you read aloud. Once you’re satisfied with your delivery, you click to upload the sentence to the bank, and a new line emerges. A bar at the bottom of the screen tracks your progress. There are so many sentences to read that people usually spread their donation out over days and weeks, doing just a few hours at a time. In an attempt to make the long exercise entertaining, VocaliD gives options to read material according to your interests: poetry, say, or science fiction. The sentences I read ranged from the proverbial (“It ain’t over till the fat lady sings!”) to the banal (“Did you see it on Twitter?”) to the sobering (“This is an emergency. Get help now”). Some felt too private. Donating any part of your body is intimate. It strikes at the core of something we appreciate about ourselves: we are each single-editions. The voice is perhaps a uniquely personal gift. It’s both physical and metaphysical. It’s the emissary between our corporeal selves and the rest of the world. When “I love you” came up, I re-recorded it over and over in a slight panic. (Other people, I’ve since learned, come upon this line and burst into tears.) What kind of I-love-you was this? Should I be speaking as if to a lover, a parent, or a pet? Was this I-love-you an assurance of the strength of the feeling (“I love you”) or its target (“I love you!”)? Should it have the butterflies tone of a first I-love-you, like a shy declaration, or of warm confirmation, like a mother saying goodnight to her child? Now sweating slightly, I recorded the phrase in what I hoped was a warm, neutral tone, deemed it not too stiff on playback, squeezed my eyes shut, and clicked. It was my last donation of the day. * * * Shortly after making my donation, I visited Rupal Patel at VocaliD’s offices in the western suburbs of Boston. Patel is slight and energetic, with bright eyes, a pert, chin-length bob, and brilliant enunciation. She is ardent about how miraculous a personalised voice can be for someone who has been unvoiced. When disabled people have communication impairments, she explained, it increases the likelihood that they’ll be removed from the workforce, isolated socially, mistakenly identified as cognitively impaired, or rendered invisible. Humans respond with special attention and empathy to other human voices, and to unconsciously equate the ability to speak with presence of mind. In 2010, medical anthropologist Mary Wickenden wrote a thesis on teenage AAC users titled Teenage Worlds, Different Voices, in which she pointed out: “If you cannot talk, it may be hard to prove that you [think] … language expressed out loud makes our subjectivity ‘more real’.” Those who cannot speak are constantly reminded of their “unreality” in the eyes of society. Of the seven voices VocaliD completed in its first year, six were for children or teenagers with cerebral palsy, many of whom complained that strangers tend to either ignore them entirely, directing any questions or conversation to their parents, or speak to them as though they were toddlers. Type-to-talk technology varies widely based on the needs of the individual user: people who have muscular command of their fingers can simply type on to a traditional keyboard and hear the words echoed out over a speaker. More common is a version in which the user scrolls and selects from a selection of words, phrases or symbols on screen, using a lever or switch positioned closest to the limb they have best control over. For those who can’t use levers, there are screens that track eye movement and are programmed to read aloud a phrase or symbol when the user has stared at it long enough. Even for people who become fluent users of type-to-talk technology, the devices can be frustrating. Often, you have to wait for a cursor to pass over more than a dozen letters or symbols before it arrives at the one you need – and if you miss, you have to wait for the cursor to cycle all the way through again. Until recently, many devices didn’t even come with words or symbols for female genitalia, leaving no easy way to talk candidly with a friend or partner about sex, or to alert a caregiver about, say, a urinary tract infection, or abuse. Preprogrammed voices are often inappropriate to their user’s age, or frustratingly robotic. Patel told me about one of her clients, a teenager named Sara Young, for whom they were building a new voice. At the time, Sara was using the same voice (“Heather”) as her mother’s GPS and some bank ATMs. Several girls with speech disabilities in Sara’s class at school use Heather, which means that in group settings it’s nearly impossible to distinguish who is saying what unless you’re looking closely. Like lots of her peers, Sara often played around with the different preprogrammed voices in her device – trying on different options for a day or two, or speaking in an adult male voice to give herself a laugh – but still she was frustrated. When I visited the office, Patel and Meltzner were putting the finishing touches on Sara’s BeSpoke voice, which they were constructing using a few “ahhh” sounds that Sara had recorded, and a donated voice. They were hoping for it to be ready by Christmas. On my second day with Patel, I accompanied her to a technology fair at the Cotting School in Lexington, Massachusetts, a private school for special-needs students, several of whom are VocaliD clients. The company often does outreach at schools, both to offer their products to children using AAC, and to recruit new donors – they are always short on young donor voices. The fair was full of parents and children with cerebral palsy, including Sara. Like many kids with cerebral palsy, Sara is exceptionally small for her age, because eating requires muscular control she doesn’t always have. Her hair is dark and wavy and dyed with teal streaks, and when we met, she was wearing a light pink, long-sleeved shirt, the bag affixed to her motorised wheelchair was pink, and the foot she uses to drive (her only limb with reliable fine motor control) was shod in a pink sneaker. As is often the case for people with movement and muscle disorders, Sara’s body moves in spasms. Her tongue flexes in and out of her mouth, and her neck twists from side to side. Her arms curl and unfurl like leaves. She can’t eat or shower or use the bathroom without help. She uses silicon straws to drink, because she bites uncontrollably when she sucks, which destroys regular straws. (Before her parents figured out about the silicon, they cut short lengths of fish-tank tubing for her.) She uses her left foot to do her homework assignments on an iPad and – with the help of duct tape and markers – to draw. When she speaks, it’s through an AAC device mounted on her roller chair, which senses her eye movements as a substitute for typing. Her bodily presence, which seemed at first glance childlike, belied her personality, which was classic teen. She kept her wheelchair still, occasionally shuffling back and forth a bit listlessly, like someone rocking back and forth on her heels. When she got bored, she made a little loop. She has a blue-and-pink nose ring, and she hates having to carry an outmoded cell phone. (“BLACKBERRY SUCKS,” she told me.) She has ferocious eyebrows and sharp, dark, funny eyes, which she rolls frequently. Because she is a strong communicator, Sara has become an occasional ambassador for the other kids in her AAC community. At this technology fair, Sara and her mother, Amy Young, took the stage to give the keynote address. Sara spoke first, giving a few sentences of introduction she had written in advance on her device. Her voice did indeed sound just like an ATM. “HELLO EVERYONE, MY NAME IS SARA. I AM 16. WHEN I DON’T HAVE A [DEVICE], PEOPLE BABY TALK TO ME OR JUST TALK TO MY MOM. SOMETIMES I AM SLOW TO SPEAK AND SO THEY JUST TALK OVER ME. THEY DON’T KNOW HOW TO WAIT FOR MY ANSWER.” The truth of this became clear later in the day, when Amy and Sara conducted a joint Q&amp;A. When Sara was asked what she uses her iPad for, she began staring at her screen with particular focus, twisting her head to keep her gaze levelled at the device regardless of her neck spasms. Thirty seconds passed, then 60. Everyone sat in silence, looking at her. Ninety seconds later, the computer spoke in a fluid stream: “HWFACEBOOKIGSNAPCHATMUSIC.” Amy translated. “Homework, Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat and music.” In the hour-long Q&amp;A, Sara spoke fewer than 30 words. As is their custom, Amy did the majority of the speaking, partly for the sake of time and partly because Sara routinely relies on her mother to understand and translate her non-verbal cues. “It’s a tremendous amount of energy for her,” Amy explained to me later. “And while we encourage people to talk to her directly, sometimes she’ll reply by looking at me, like, ‘Can you just answer that?’” Sara has a canny sense of humour, but her speaking style and pace lends itself more to well-placed interjection. In the middle of Amy’s careful explanation of why Apple’s bluetooth systems are incompatible with the motorised wheelchair, Sara cut in to phrase things more succinctly: “IDIOTS.” She peppered her mother’s sentences with brief exclamations in her own voice: “Yeah!” When she was out of the spotlight and speaking to people who knew how to adapt to her ways of speaking, conversation flowed more naturally. After the Q&amp;A, scrolling through Instagram with a young aide at her high school, Sara let out a series of amused hoots. The aide shook her head in mock disapproval at the screen and said conspiratorially: “Your class is crazy.” Sara laughed. “YOU DON’T EVEN KNOW.” The disconnect between the spirit of Sara’s words and the robotic deadpan of their delivery was jarring. “The digital voice gets kind of lost,” said Amy. “When we heard about VocaliD, we thought: ‘How cool it would be to create something a little more natural.’ Sara hasn’t had the experience of having her voice change as she ages, and so that would be neat, too. If the voice is that much more natural, I’m hoping it won’t get lost as much.” When I told Patel about this conversation, her eyes sparkled. “I really want people to be able not just to hear Sara, but in hearing her, to see her and experience her. When she belts out that “Yeah!” or that “No!” or whatever she says with her natural voice and then transitions to her device, boy wouldn’t it be nice if those two types of communication felt fluid. In an ideal world, she’d never have to use that thing. She’d be wearing a pair of glasses and an oculus and she’d have all these messages that she’d typed out. It wouldn’t be stigmatising. She wouldn’t have to be seen as an “other” communicator. That’s the wave of the future.” * * * For Joe, the transition from being able-bodied and seamlessly verbal to someone who seems physically – and, to the careless observer, mentally – disabled has been astonishing, and deeply painful. When he woke up from the surgery, it was the first time he was really, truly speechless. The doctors had excised most of his tongue – “and you have to remember that a large portion of your tongue you can’t see, because it’s in your throat,” Joe reminded me – and then took a long strip of his quadricep and attached the muscle to the flap that was left in his throat. They hoped that in time he would gain enough control of the new muscle to swallow and, in time, form words. For the first week and a half, the tracheotomy tube diverted all air from his windpipe out through his neck, so that even if he tried to speak, no sound would come. “I felt completely trapped, a prisoner in my own body,” he told me via email. He could write things down to let the medical staff know if he was hungry or in pain. “But in terms of meaningful communication, you’re locked out completely.” His friends came to visit, and for the first time, he couldn’t join in the conversations, couldn’t interject with thoughts and jokes. He sat there, silent. “I love debating and arguing and being heard,” he told me. “And joking – that was really hard. You can’t have much of a wit when you need to write everything down. You miss the moment.” This is one thing you lose when you’re taken outside the flow of conversation. The other, as Joe would discover, is the privilege of being included as an equal. “People treat you differently,” Joe wrote. “They don’t mean to, but they patronise you, treat you like a child.” In the months that have passed since his glossectomy, Joe has made slow and steady progress with his physical therapy. The natural timbre of his voice is lower than it was before the surgery, though it may rise as the swelling continues to go down. “I fear I’ve said my last ‘S’ sound,” he typed to me over the summer. Ls and Js are also difficult, which frustrates him, because he struggles to say his own name, and that of his wife, Louisa. When I spoke to him in late November, he cheerfully reported that his Ss were nearly back, if a little bit reminiscent of Sean Connery. He prefers to get along with his occasionally muddled natural speech, but he has found his digital voice helpful as a reference in his speech and language sessions. Recently, he started a new job at an ad agency and used his VocaliD version to show his new colleagues his “old voice”. Joe may not end up using an AAC device every day, but he insists that it was important to him that, no matter what, his voice exists somewhere. “My wife is a Harry Potter fan, so I joke that this is my Horcrux,” he said, referring to the object in which a wizard can hide a part of his soul, and so attain a kind of immortality. He saw it as an act of self-preservation. “I was worried that as I grew older and this became more and more a past event, I might start to forget the sound of my own voice.” People often use the Voicebank this way, Patel says. Early on, she noticed that a disproportionate number of the people who “banked” their voices were transgender people in some stage of transition, often at the beginning, before starting hormone-replacement therapy. For them, as for Joe, the bank might serve as a vault for safeguarding an old self. The record is there to find, just in case: this is who I was. * * * For others, the digital voice is not a remnant of who they were, but a promise of who they will be. Sara Young got her new voice just before Christmas, in the VocaliD offices. Patel and Meltzner shifted nervously on their feet as they stood before Sara and Amy Young, making smalltalk and cueing up the two voices Meltzner had designed for her to choose between. He played the first, using a sentence he had pre-programmed. “HI, MY NAME IS SARA. I’M 16 YEARS OLD, AND I’M AWESOME.” It sounded tinny and halting, like “Heather’s” younger sister, but with a trace of something idiosyncratic and human at the base of the sound. Sara laughed delightedly. “OK,” Patel said. “Now we’ll hear the second one.” “HI, MY NAME IS SARA. I’M 16 YEARS OLD, AND I’M AWESOME.” The second voice sounded clearer, more bell-like. It seemed older than the first in its assurance, but younger in its vitality. “OK, which do you like?” Patel asked Sara. After a long pause, Sara asked for the second. “Oh, phew!” Patel laughed. “That was our favourite, too. What do you like about number two?” After a long pause, Sara said: “IT’S SPUNKY.” They downloaded it on to her device. Patel pointed out to me later that the moment when a person’s new voice is turned on can be anti-climactic, because they’re not quite sure how to respond to it. The really interesting stuff, she says, comes in the days and weeks after, when the client notices how they’re treated differently, or in watching how they psychologically internalise the experience of having a voice that sounds like them. As the voice was loading, Patel asked Amy how she felt. “Great – as long as Sara feels great!” She paused. “It’ll take some getting used to. It was 12 years with the other voice, with Heather. It’s foreign in some way, like when my son’s voice changed.” When Sara’s voice had finished its transfer and was finally in her control, the team gathered to hear what her first words in the new voice would be. “THANK – THANK YOU FOR ALL YOUR WORK,” she said. “I KNEW YOU COULD DO IT.” Patel laughed. “Thank you for giving us this chance!” The adults stood around aimlessly for a second, looking at Sara. “Do you want to say anything else?” She thought for a moment, and then stared fixedly at her screen. “YO.” Illustrations by Bratislav Milenković • Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, or sign up to the long read weekly email here."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/jan/22/tennys-sandgren-alt-right-australian-open-twitter","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-22T19:20:25Z","webTitle":"Tennys Sandgren deletes tweets after denying far-right sympathies at Australian Open","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/jan/22/tennys-sandgren-alt-right-australian-open-twitter","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/jan/22/tennys-sandgren-alt-right-australian-open-twitter","fields":{"headline":"Tennys Sandgren deletes tweets after denying far-right sympathies at Australian Open","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Tennys Sandgren, the last remaining American in the Australian Open men’s singles draw, has deleted years-worth of tweets after denying he is an alt-right sympathiser. The 26-year-old reached the quarter-finals of the tournament after an upset victory over the No5 seed, Dominic Thiem, on Monday but questions over his political views had swirled over the weekend and he was challenged at a post-match press conference. Since facing the media, posts on his Twitter feed since July 2014 have been wiped. Earlier this month, Sandgren retweeted a video by Nicholas Fuentes, a Boston University student who received death threats after attending the white supremacist rally in Charlottesville last year. Sandgren also follows a number of controversial figures on Twitter, including Tommy Robinson the former leader of the far-right English Defence League, and Dan Roodt a South African once described by John Oliver as a purveyor of “some of the finest examples of vintage bigotry”. Sandgren also described “Pizzagate”, a conspiracy theory linking Hillary Clinton to a paedophile ring as “sickening and the collective evidence is too much to ignore”. Sandgren was challenged over his views by a reporter after his victory over Thiem. “Look, who you follow on Twitter I feel doesn’t matter even a little bit,” he said. “What information you see doesn’t dictate what you think or believe. I think it’s crazy to think that. I think it’s crazy to assume that. To say, well, he’s following X person, so he believes all the things that this person believes, I think it’s ridiculous. I think that’s ridiculous.” Sandgren has also debated racial injustice in America with fellow tennis player James Blake on Twitter. During the exchange he denied systemic racism exists in the US because the country elected a black president. The world No97 also denied he supported far-right theories. “No. No, I don’t. I find some of the content interesting, but no I don’t. Not at all,” Sandgren said. “As a firm Christian, I don’t support things like that. I support Christ and following Him and that’s what I support.” Sandgren next plays Hyeon Chung, who upset former champion Novak Djokovic in the fourth round."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"books/2018/jan/22/landeg-white-obituary","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-22T18:01:16Z","webTitle":"Landeg White obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jan/22/landeg-white-obituary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/jan/22/landeg-white-obituary","fields":{"headline":"Landeg White obituary","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"My friend and former colleague Landeg White, who has died at his home in Portugal aged 77, was an academic and poet, one of the most versatile and prolific of the Africanists who began work in the post-independence era. He was born in Taff’s Well, near Cardiff, the son of Reginald White, known as REO White, who became principal of the Scottish Baptist College, and Gwyneth (nee Landeg). After schooling at Rutherglen Academy in Lanarkshire and Birkenhead Institute on the Wirral, Landeg graduated in English from Liverpool University then began work teaching English literature at the University of the West Indies, Trinidad, in 1964. A product of his time there was his critical introduction to the work of VS Naipaul (1975). The three years he spent at the University of Malawi from 1969 were decisive, personally, intellectually and politically. There he met his Anglo-Mozambican second wife, Alice Costley-White, and acquired an interest in Luso-African language, literature and culture. Falling foul of the dictatorial Banda regime, he was deported in 1972, but not before inspiring a generation of Malawian poets, including Jack Mapanje, Frank Chipasula, Lupenga Mphande and Felix Mnthali. Landeg moved on to the University of Zambia (1974-79), where he formed an intellectual alliance with the American historian Leroy Vail. Their two jointly written books, Capitalism and Colonialism in Mozambique (1980) and Power and the Praise Poem (1991), pioneered the use of work songs and praise poetry in the writing of African history and were hugely influential. He used the same methods for his book, Magomero (1987), the vivid portrait of a Malawian village – the basis of a BBC Timewatch programme. From 1984 to 1994 he was director of the Centre for Southern African Studies at the University of York, where he organised an important conference on the South African economy after apartheid and waged a three-year campaign for Mapanje’s release from detention without trial in Malawi – the theme of a Channel 4 programme. Moving to Portugal, he taught at the Open University in Lisbon and cultivated a smallholding near Sintra. He combined literary and historical scholarship with creative writing. The first of a dozen well-received collections of poems was For Captain Stedman (1983), while the last was Traveller’s Palm (2017). His historical novels included Livingstone’s Funeral (2010), and Ultimatum (about the Anglo-Portuguese crisis of 1890), published last October. His translation of Luís de Camões’s Lusíads in the Oxford World Classics series won the TLS poetry translation prize in 1998 and his later edition of Camões’s collected lyric poems was also well received. His identification of Camões as the first global poet, and as a poet “made in India”, had latterly made him a cult figure in Goa. He is survived by Alice and their two children, Martin and John, by Graham and Louise, his children from his first marriage, to Alison Hinton, three grandchildren and his sister, Glenda."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"film/2019/aug/07/da-pennebaker-on-making-monterey-pop-festival-documentary","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2019-08-07T13:29:16Z","webTitle":"'It felt like a wonderful dream' – DA Pennebaker on making Monterey Pop","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/aug/07/da-pennebaker-on-making-monterey-pop-festival-documentary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2019/aug/07/da-pennebaker-on-making-monterey-pop-festival-documentary","fields":{"headline":"'It felt like a wonderful dream' – DA Pennebaker on making Monterey Pop","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Lou Adler, promoter and producer In 1967, there was a meeting at Mama Cass’s house that included Paul McCartney. The general conversation was: “Why isn’t rock’n’roll considered an art form in the way that jazz and folk are?” A few weeks later, the promoters Alan Pariser and Ben Shapiro got in touch to book the Mamas and the Papas for one night at Monterey County Fairgrounds in California. We said we’d think about it. About three o’clock in the morning, I got a call from John Phillips of the Mamas and the Papas. He said: “Why don’t we do a festival, add more days, and get the acts to play for nothing?” This was a chance to elevate how rock’n’roll was thought of. We had six weeks. Chip Monck had to build the stage, put in all the lights and sound, and get 35 acts on and off. That had never happened before. We wanted to show all the genres of rock’n’roll: the blues people, the San Francisco groups, the bands from England. We wanted the Stones but they couldn’t get into the US. The Beach Boys backed out. We tried for all the Motown acts but I don’t know if [label founder] Berry Gordy understood what we were doing. You had to really buy into it if your acts weren’t going to get paid. It was pretty phenomenal. Otis Redding was beyond anything I had ever seen. That was the largest white crowd he had ever performed for. And Hendrix, of course. A couple of girls in the movie of the festival look as if they could be watching a horror film – they don’t know what they’re seeing. It was maybe the last time you would see so many performers in the audience. Most of these acts had heard about the other bperformers but had never seen them so they were as curious as anybody. Look at Mama Cass’s face during Janis Joplin. They were fans. Woodstock was about the weather and the number of people – Monterey was about the music. That’s the difference. John and I made a deal with ABC to do a movie for TV. We asked DA Pennebaker because of [his Bob Dylan tour documentary] Don’t Look Back. He really understood the music and the personalities. Once we looked at the footage, Pennebaker said: “This is not a television show. This is a movie.” We went to see Tom Moore, head of ABC and a very conservative southern gentleman, and showed him Hendrix [humping] his amp. He said: “Not on my network.” But we knew exactly what we were doing. With the advent of FM radio, Rolling Stone magazine and the festival, rock’n’roll was truly elevated. Promoters realised they could do festivals, which eventually led to Coachella. It’s unfortunate how many people who performed at Monterey are no longer with us, but they’re with us because of Pennebaker. I’d say we wouldn’t be talking about Monterey today without the movie. I play it at universities and when Hendrix and Otis and Joplin finish, I hear applause. These people are there. DA Pennebaker, film director John Phillips asked me if I’d be interested in doing a film of a music festival in California. I was still under the influence of The Endless Summer, Bruce Brown’s film about surfers. California was where everyone wanted to go when they graduated from school or college. Generally, people from Los Angeles and people from San Francisco had conflicting musical tastes and were sort of antagonistic. Monterey was a way of joining California where it hadn’t been joined before. What made it successful was the decision to throw the big-money ideas out of the window. People really came to play and hear each other play. They weren’t there to make a lot of money. I made Don’t Look Back by myself but Monterey Pop was made by the people who worked with me, such as Albert Maysles. I didn’t direct it really. I edited it and made a storyline out of it but they all saw it differently and filmed it how they saw it. They were all people who had come to work with us to find out how to make these kind of films. They were not made the way commercial films were. You went out and found something or somebody and you filmed it the way you wanted. They were learning right there in front of me. We only had a limited amount of film so we thought we’d have to decide on a particular song for each group, but in fact people shot anything that interested them. So we had to go down to Los Angeles twice to get more stock. I hesitated to say: “Don’t do it.” The music was so incredible: I wanted to shoot everything that happened. I liked the idea of watching music expand its possibilities as it went along. The movie started off with Canned Heat doing a simple country song, and ended with Ravi Shankar playing really complicated music. Music was moving so fast and nobody understood what was coming next. I grew up in Chicago during the 1930s when jazz was new. At Monterey I could see that the music of my youth was no longer big. I think for TV audiences who were used to a certain kind of music, somebody like Hendrix was too much. We came back to New York with so much footage that we had to get people in to help. We went three or four days straight, 24 hours a day, screening all the rushes, and everybody came to see them, including Ravi Shankar. I dozed and woke up and dozed and woke up so when I sat down to edit it, it felt like a wonderful dream. People used to sell documentaries by having someone like Henry Fonda doing a narration: it was like having a celebrity watching over the film. We were trying to get away from that. I saw this as a kind of film-making where you found people who were responsible for doing something, and you watched them do it, from the beginning if you could. That kind of film led me to The War Room [about Bill Clinton’s 1992 presidential campaign]. We didn’t need a script. We just had a sense of what was going to happen and we followed it. • The Complete Monterey Pop Festival is out now on Blu-ray from The Criterion Collection."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"stage/2018/feb/15/fanny-and-alexander-old-vic-london-ingmar-bergman-penelope-wilton","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-15T08:00:33Z","webTitle":"Chaos, conflict – and conga: Fanny and Alexander takes the stage","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/feb/15/fanny-and-alexander-old-vic-london-ingmar-bergman-penelope-wilton","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2018/feb/15/fanny-and-alexander-old-vic-london-ingmar-bergman-penelope-wilton","fields":{"headline":"Chaos, conflict – and conga: Fanny and Alexander takes the stage","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"At the age of 64, flushed with international success and bruised by a long-running dispute with the Swedish tax office, Ingmar Bergman announced his retirement. His final work would be his grandest – a film that mined his own childhood, a lavish family saga set deep in the past yet pointing to the future. He referred to it as his mountain peak, a love affair he would never surpass, “a summing up of my entire career”. After Fanny and Alexander, he said, there would be nowhere else to go. But real life has a way of confounding such neat, scripted endings. After completing his supposed swansong, Bergman continued writing and directing for a further two decades. More recently, Fanny and Alexander has taken a fresh direction as well. For this, Bergman’s centenary year, it has been merrily reworked as a play at London’s Old Vic. “It’s a bit different from the film,” cautions its writer, Stephen Beresford. “But that’s probably as it should be.” For all its vaunted reputation, the 1982 original remains a playful, accommodating, allusive work – modelled along the lines of a classic fairytale and sprinkled with references to Hamlet. It’s about two kids in 1900s Uppsala who find themselves torn from the bosom of their extended family after their widowed mother marries the strict local bishop. The irresistible force of boyhood imagination is pitted against the immovable object of religious dogma and it ends in disaster, a conflagration and what might conceivably be read as a happily-ever-after were it not for the fact that the film leaves the struggle unresolved. For Bergman, no doubt, the struggle was the point. Fanny and Alexander was originally shot as a five-hour TV miniseries, with an abridged 188-minute version playing in cinemas. But theatre was always in its DNA. The central Ekdahl family are shown to own and manage the local playhouse, while Bergman structures the tale as three acts, around three distinct sets. The action opens amid the red-and-green opulence of the Ekdahl home, with its candles, Christmas trees and boisterous conga lines around the dining table. Then it jumps to the bleached austerity of the bishop’s palace before climaxing amid the exotic clutter of an old curiosity shop. The whole thing feels suspiciously pre-arranged, almost as if Bergman was anticipating its eventual move to the stage. Even so, the conversion gave Beresford headaches. Cinema, he says, speaks a different language. He had to build in backstories, insert family history, and flesh out the character of the grandmother (played on stage by Penelope Wilton). Beresford is best known for The Last of the Haussmans (2012), a play about a family at war inside a crumbling art deco home, and for the 2014 film Pride, which celebrated a makeshift mid-80s brood of gay rights activists and striking miners. “Family is basically all I’m interested in,” he says. “And that’s what drew me to this.” He recalls first seeing Fanny and Alexander as a kid, late one evening on BBC Two. The film, he feels, is not just the best introduction to the director’s work, but the ideal final destination. “In writing about his childhood, Bergman is essentially saying, ‘This is everything.’ So he can be funny and silly as well as all the other stuff – and that’s what I love about it. The older I get, the less time I have for tragedy. I mean, it’s all a disaster, we’re all going the same way – so let’s eat oysters and have sex and dance around the table.” It’s this quality that distinguishes Fanny and Alexander from Bergman’s anguished mid-period masterpieces. Maybe the director was mellowing with age, but there may have been commercial imperatives, too. “Bergman understood the market,” says Max Webster, the play’s director. “He made Fanny and Alexander for Swedish TV, for a more popular audience, and that’s why it suits this theatre as well. The Old Vic is a large, celebratory space, so it needs a production with a broad appeal.” No one would deny Fanny and Alexander’s broad appeal. The film has been pegged as Bergman’s most accessible work, an antidote to all that harrowing Nordic noir of the soul. Here was a box-office smash, the winner of multiple Oscars, likened by the critics to Shakespeare’s later comedies. Variety called it “a sumptuously produced period piece”. Pauline Kael described it as a “sustained flight of Victorian fantasy”. And then somewhere along the way, the praise seemed to curdle. The suspicion took hold that Fanny and Alexander might be too broad, too tasteful – rich to the point of being cloying. “Fanny and Alexander is like a big, sugary cake,” wrote the film-maker Alex Cox shortly before Bergman’s death in 2007. “It looks nice, but it isn’t good for you, and it leaves a sickly taste.” After speaking to Beresford and Webster, I rewatch the film and am relieved to find I don’t agree. Yes, Fanny and Alexander contains Christmas trees and conga lines, disreputable farting uncles and elements of drawing-room farce. But it also features an androgynous madman, a grotesque, bedridden aunt, and the ghost of Alexander’s father, who drops in at intervals to observe the meltdown of his family. This is not some middlebrow confection. It’s altogether starker, stranger and more haunting. Far better to think of it as a turbulent canvas of darkness and light, a clash of competing world views: order and chaos, emotion and reason. Every splash of warm colour is offset by a thick splotch of black. “It’s about the contrast, the conflict,” says Eva Bergman, the director’s daughter. “Of course my father saw himself as Alexander. But he saw himself as the bishop, too. He’s inside all of these characters and they’re inside all of us. That’s the gift and the genius of the film.” If anyone is going to object to a British theatre tinkering with Bergman’s masterpiece, I’m guessing it would be his children, charged with safeguarding his legacy. But Eva is not merely eager to catch the Old Vic production, it transpires that she’s planning on directing one of her own. Scheduled for this December at the Gothenburg City Theatre, her version – loosely based on a 2010 adaptation by the Swedish writer Stefan Larsson – adopts a still more radical tack. It shifts the original action forward to the 1930s, a time of fascism and ragtime music – the darkness and the light. “It’s going to be a jazz-age Fanny and Alexander,” she says. In the meantime I’m still mulling over what she said about the film’s dualities, about Bergman being both over-imaginative Alexander and his stern, vicious stepfather. I think this makes sense. Behind the camera, the director had a reputation as a control freak and a faithless husband, given to long-standing grudges and sudden, volcanic rages. “It’s common knowledge,” says Eva Bergman, “that my father left my mother when I was very small, four or five years old. After that, he was off with other women. So I wasn’t brought up by him. We had to build a relationship later. But we always had a good connection when it came to talking about music. So I think he might like my jazz-age Fanny and Alexander. I feel he might look down and bless me from his heaven.” • Fanny and Alexander is at the Old Vic, London, from 21 February to 14 April."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"us-news/2018/jan/22/amazon-go-convenience-store-corner-shop","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-22T19:14:53Z","webTitle":"Amazon Go: convenience and concern at new checkout-free corner shop","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jan/22/amazon-go-convenience-store-corner-shop","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/jan/22/amazon-go-convenience-store-corner-shop","fields":{"headline":"Amazon Go: convenience and concern at new checkout-free corner shop","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"All around me in this Seattle corner shop, people are grabbing items off the shelves, shoving them into bags or pockets, and bolting for the door. It would feel like well-mannered looting if not for the hi-tech gates where shoppers have to swipe in with their smartphones. This is the first day that Amazon’s new checkout-less convenience store, Amazon Go, is open to the public, and shopping is even easier than online. There is no tedious clicking or scrolling, no banner ads to negotiate nor passwords to remember. Simply present the Amazon Go app at the gates and start shopping. The range is typical of a 7-Eleven: a few essential groceries and toiletries but mostly snacks, breakfast items, sandwiches and salads. After a shopper walks through the gate, a bank of cameras and other sensors in the ceiling tracks her progress through the store. When an item is picked up, the same cameras recognise it and add it to the visitor’s virtual shopping cart. Ten minutes after the shopper walks out the door, the app charges a credit card and provides a digital receipt. On day one, the system was in full working order. I tried picking up and replacing a salad or two, then quickly slipped a box of tissues into my bag. The shop was not fooled. The app came up with the correct total, and even told me exactly how long I had spent inside, to the nearest second. That speed and convenience is what Amazon Go’s Just Walk Out Shopping is all about, says the company. It was easy to identify the company’s employees, who have had access to the experimental shop for over a year. They rushed in, grabbed what they needed and were out again in less than 30 seconds. Some first-time users were still getting used to the technology, however. “It was strange just walking out,” said Paul Hamilton, visiting Seattle from Slough, in the UK. “Even though I knew how it worked, I wanted to look for checkout.” “This feels like the beginning of something really big,” said Abrar Ali, who had popped into Amazon Go to pick up lunch for his job at a telecoms company in the Seattle suburbs. “It’s at the cutting edge of AI and machine learning and I wanted to experience it for myself.” The implications for retail staffing are ominous. Cashier is the second-most-common job in the US, and self-checkout machines are far less common here than they are in Europe or Japan. Atsushi Ueda, an engineer with Hitachi in Tokyo, eyed the Amazon Go shop in a professional capacity. “It was very smooth, very easy,” he said. “We don’t have anything like this in Japan yet but we’re trying.” Over the past year, Amazon has made a big push into bricks and mortar retail, buying the high-end supermarket Whole Foods and restructuring its Amazon Fresh grocery service to include kerbside pickup as well as home delivery. It also has more than a dozen physical book stores across the US. Amazon has not announced any plans to open other Amazon Go shops, but job listings suggest that a rollout beyond Seattle is possible. In December, Amazon advertised for a real estate manager to develop a strategic real estate plan and conduct field tours of potential locations for Amazon Go, with travel required. However, Amazon Go’s hi-tech solution is unlikely to work everywhere. A bank of four self-serve checkouts cost about $125,000 each and Amazon Go’s serious computing power and hi-tech sensors are likely to cost significantly more. Amazon Go might be economic on the ground floor of Amazon’s offices, where developers earn six-figure salaries. But you will probably still have to remember your wallet at most corner shops for a few more years yet."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2018/jan/23/labour-selects-just-one-bme-candidate-in-marginal-seats","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-23T17:09:41Z","webTitle":"Anger as Labour selects one BME candidate in marginal seats","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jan/23/labour-selects-just-one-bme-candidate-in-marginal-seats","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/jan/23/labour-selects-just-one-bme-candidate-in-marginal-seats","fields":{"headline":"Anger as Labour selects one BME candidate in marginal seats","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Black and ethnic minority Labour MPs have expressed concern after a Guardian analysis revealed Labour has picked just one ethnic minority candidate in 28 of the most marginal seats where candidates have been selected to fight the next general election. Labour MP David Lammy, who recently led a review into diverse representation, said the figures were “disappointing” and that Labour had to improve. “I’m proud that the Labour party has led the way in improving the diversity of parliament, and we can not afford to go backwards. To represent modern Britain we have to reflect modern Britain,” he said. Operation Black Vote’s director Simon Woolley said he was concerned that all-women shortlists had meant experienced BME male candidates were being dislodged, and had become so concerned he had written to Labour’s general secretary, Iain McNicol. Woolley said he had been particularly concerned after Chingford and Woodford Green candidate Bilal Mahmood, who stood for the party in the last two elections and slashed Iain Duncan Smith’s majority, had been told he could not run again because the seat would have an all-women shortlist. The equalities campaigner said he had written to McNicol and Labour’s shadow women and equalities secretary, Dawn Butler, to query the decision. “The BME candidate worked in successive general elections to turn a previously rock-solid Tory seat into a highly winnable one for Labour, only to find the opportunity taken away from him to benefit from years of hard work,” Woolley wrote in his letter to McNicol. Woolley said he had similar concerns about selections in Putney, Harrow East and Telford. “This is working against black men but also black women, very few of whom have come through all-women shortlists,” Woolley told the Guardian. OBV said it had calculated that all-women shortlists had produced seven BME women MPs, just 3% of women MPs selected by all-women shortlists. “Overall, this number is bitterly disappointing, not least because part of Labour’s revival in the snap election was due to the unprecedented numbers of black and minority ethnic communities registering to vote and voting, particularly in marginal seats like Croydon, Harrow and Battersea,” said Woolley. He also said he was convinced Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and shadow home secretary Diane Abbott cared deeply about representation, but the party as a whole had not done enough. “The broad leadership of the party has showed scant regard to getting more black politicians in parliament, demonstrated by this paltry number in the marginal seats.” Barrister Mark McDonald, who won the selection vote in Stoke-on-Trent South, is the only candidate from an ethnic minority background to have been selected so far. The seat is one of the most marginal in the country and was previously held by Labour’s Rob Flello until it fell to the Conservatives in June last year. Equality campaigner Anjona Roy, the Momentum-backed candidate, lost her bid in November to stand in the swing seat of Northampton North to Sally Keeble, the constituency’s centre-left former MP. Labour MP Tulip Siddiq, who represents Hampstead and Kilburn, also said it was “deeply disappointing” to see so few black and ethnic minority candidates selected. “I know for a fact that there talented BME men and women across our Labour movement who would be an asset to parliament,” she said. “It’s not good enough, and we must do more to ensure that our candidates represent the people were seeking to represent.” Alice Perry, a member of Labour’s national executive committee, said the NEC hoped to see a substantial improvement in the number of BME candidates selected in the marginal seats that were yet to finalise their selection process. “We would like our candidates to reflect the diversity of the communities they represent, and the NEC is discussing the best ways to achieve this at local and national levels,” she said. Party sources admitted there was concern about the lack of ethnic minority candidates who had been chosen so far, citing a push for all-women shortlists in many seats, which dislodged several BME men who had previously contested the seats. Officials said they hoped those future selection battles would be won by ethnic minority women in areas where BME men would not be able to run again because of all-women shortlists. Labour has the highest number of black and ethnic minority MPs in the Commons, 32 compared to the Conservatives’ 19 BME MPs. Liberal Democrat leader Vince Cable, whose party has just one ethnic minority MP, is understood to be considering introducing all-BME shortlists for his party at the next election. A Labour party spokesperson said: “The Labour party has been at the forefront of championing equality and diversity and tackling discrimination. We are proud that our party has more BME MPs than all other political parties combined and that our shadow cabinet contains more ethnic minority members than any cabinet or shadow cabinet ever. “Labour is committed to further increasing the representation of BME candidates at all levels of the party and, as part of our democracy review, is looking at how we can further improve the diversity of our party.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/andes-to-the-amazon/2018/jan/24/amazon-tribe-mercury-crisis-leaked-report","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-24T10:09:21Z","webTitle":"Remote Amazon tribe hit by mercury crisis, leaked report says","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/andes-to-the-amazon/2018/jan/24/amazon-tribe-mercury-crisis-leaked-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/andes-to-the-amazon/2018/jan/24/amazon-tribe-mercury-crisis-leaked-report","fields":{"headline":"Remote Amazon tribe hit by mercury crisis, leaked report says","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"An indigenous people living in one of the remotest parts of the Peruvian Amazon has been struck by a mystery mercury epidemic, according to an unpublished Health Ministry report dated 2015 and 2017 seen by the Guardian. The Nahua only entered into sustained contact with “outsiders” in the mid-1980s, which led to almost 50% of the population dying mainly from respiratory and infectious diseases. Today, numbering less than 500 people, the vast majority live in a village in the Kugapakori, Nahua, Nanti and Others Reserve established for indigenous peoples in “voluntary isolation” and “initial contact” in south-east Peru. The leaked report, titled Análisis de Situación de Salud del Pueblo Nahua de Santa Rosa de Serjali en la Reserva Territorial Kugapakori Nahua Nanti y Otros, states that government health authorities were first alerted to the mercury crisis among the Nahua when a six month old baby, initially diagnosed with pneumonia, and his mother were admitted to a private clinic in Lima in November 2014. The baby was found to have severe anaemia and his blood was tested for heavy metals, resulting in both him and his mother being diagnosed with “mercury intoxication.” Between then and September 2015, a series of visits to the Nahua’s village, Santa Rosa de Serjali, were made by national and regional government health authorities. More than 150 urine samples - 41% of the Nahua population - were taken: 78% contained “high levels of mercury”, with “no significant differences” across age groups, women and men, or adults and children. The highest level (96.57 μg/L [micrograms per litre]) was recorded in a 14 year old girl, the second highest (80.38 μg/L) in a 27 year old man, and evidence was found for lactating mothers passing mercury to their babies. According to the World Health Organisation, mercury is one of the world’s “top ten chemicals or groups of chemicals of major public health concern” and is a particular “threat to the development of the child in utero and early in life.” “The results are extremely concerning and mean serious risk for the people living in Santa Rosa,” states the Health Ministry report, a general survey of the Nahua’s health running to 171 pages. According to the report, the source of the mercury isn’t known, but two possible explanations are considered in some detail. One is fish consumption, which it concludes is unlikely to be the main source. The other is the Camisea project, the pioneering Latin American gas extraction development, which it recommends should be investigated. “Without adequate and sufficient information about gas operations in the Camisea project, it is not possible to rule it out as the source of the mercury contamination among the Nahua in Santa de Rosa de Serjali,” the report states. “The Peruvian state must conduct serious, complete analyses of the mercury emissions - in the air and water from run-off produced during exploration - and the contamination routes in order to establish the risk levels for people in the reserve as well as others elsewhere in the Urubamba basin.” The report cites research by the United Nations Environment Programme (Unep) that mercury is present in “almost all” fossil fuels including gas as well as rock sediments and strata, and that the extraction or burning of fossil fuels “contributes significantly to the liberation of mercury into the global environment.” It states that the presence of mercury in Camisea gas has been confirmed, and that a mercury removal tower has been installed in the main processing plant, Las Malvinas. The Health Ministry states it has been unable to access reports by the Energy Ministry and Environment Ministry on the removal tower and its “levels of mercury capture”, and that it has also been unable to access reports by the same ministries on gas flares in the region. Other possible explanations for the mercury are mooted by the report, but quickly dismissed. These include the use of mercury in possible artisanal gold-mining in the reserve - ruled out because satellite images showed no evidence of any mining - or visits by the Nahua to the adjacent Madre de Dios watershed where artisanal gold-miners have cleared 10,000s of hectares of the forest, causing a chronic mercury epidemic among the population. Further, more general possible explanations are mooted too: deforestation, waste burning, water capture and industry. The report states there are large logging concessions just to the north of the reserve about which “no information exists”, but that there are no “significantly deforested areas” in the reserve itself. In addition to urging Peru’s government to research Camisea’s mercury emissions, the Health Ministry report makes other recommendations too. These include taking hair samples to better understand the extent of the contamination and whether it is caused by exposure to organic or inorganic mercury, conducting further studies to discover the source and design the “best strategies of response”, and monitoring permanently all the Nahua who have “high levels” of contamination. But to date the report hasn’t been published. The version seen by the Guardian suggests it was written in 2015 and would be printed in May 2017, and includes a preface by the now former Health Minister, Patricia Jannet García Funegra, who left her position in September 2017. The aim of the report, the then minister stated, is to “generate a better response by the health sector to the Nahua people.” One Nahua man, who prefers to remain anonymous, told the Guardian “almost everyone” is contaminated with mercury and the government has “forgotten” them. He said that no one from the authorities has visited Santa Rosa de Serjali since March 2017, that the only advice they have received is to “eat well” and avoid drinking alcohol, and the only possible explanation given for the mercury is that two species of fish might be contaminated. “We need help, we want help, we want someone to help us,” the Nahua man says. “People are concerned. There’s no one dealing with this. We’ve been well forgotten.” National indigenous federation AIDESEP has accused the government of a “cover-up” and was demanding the “immediate publication” of the Health Ministry’s report back in mid-2016 – to no avail. “The Nahua in the Kugapakori, Nahua, Nanti Reserve continue dying from illnesses while the government hides reports about their plight,” AIDESEP stated, before highlighting that “almost 80%” are contaminated with mercury and numerous organisations have repeatedly requested the government to take action. A year later AIDESEP wrote to six United Nations special rapporteurs urging them to request Peru’s government to protect the Nahua from mercury, highlighting the possible connection to Camisea, expressing concern that indigenous peoples living in “isolation” in even remoter areas in the reserve could be contaminated too, and making a series of recommendations, including that the rapporteurs should request that Peru suspends gas operations in the reserve until the source of the contamination has been identified. AIDESEP acknowledged that the government formed a Working Group in 2016 to support the Nahua but claimed the results were “nil or little”, and stated that two “declarations of emergency” were made the same year but “their impacts haven’t been what was hoped for.” In late 2017, in Uruguay, AIDESEP also appealed to the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights about the crisis. In a statement to the Commission, the very first issue raised was the Nahua’s mercury contamination. The urine samples taken by Peru’s health authorities were reviewed last year by two scientists at the Biodiversity Research Institute in the US. They reported “notable exceedances of acceptable levels” among the Nahua, and concluded “it appears that a large segment of the sampled Nahua population in the village of Santa Rosa de Serjali is exposed to elevated levels of mercury.” The scientists, David Buck and Oksana Lane, described anything above 10-20 μg/L as indicating “excessive exposure” – much lower than the levels of 96.57 μg/L or 80.38 μg/L found in the 14-year-old Nahua girl and 27-year-old man. But they noted that the samples had not been collected according to WHO guidelines, and asserted that they are “insufficient to fully characterize [the Nahua’s] exposure” and determine the source. Yet various explanations, including the Camisea project, were considered. They stated that there have been gas operations since early 2015 “upstream of the Nahua’s village including in new exploratory wells on the Upper Serjali river basin”, and that “activities associated with natural gas exploration in the region could be the original source”. Gold-mining was mentioned too, but Buck and Lane stated that it is “not practiced near the community in the watershed” and that operations in Madre de Dios were “unlikely” to be the source too because it is a different watershed. The scientists made numerous recommendations, including re-taking urine samples according to WHO guidelines, taking hair and food samples, surveying surface soil, monitoring air, and investigating the “mercury removal process”, gas flares and production waters in the Camisea project. “I think the levels of mercury measured in Santa Rosa de Serjali warrant concern and further investigation,” Lane told the Guardian. “The exposure is elevated and if this reflects chronic exposure, it can lead to kidney damage and possibly other health issues. The testing conducted so far has been inadequate and so we recommend sampling and testing human hair for total mercury – a combination of inorganic and organic forms – to determine exposure from the diet. Most exposure to mercury from the diet is organic – methylmercury – which is a potent neurotoxin and has detrimental effects on the central nervous system. Mercury in urine is inorganic and therefore doesn’t measure exposure from the diet.” The Camisea project indirectly precipitated contact with the Nahua in the mid-1980s and since 2000 has been run by Pluspetrol. In early 2014 Peru’s government approved expansion of the project into Nahua territory. Asked about the links made to gas operations by both the scientists in the US and the leaked Health Ministry report, Pluspetrol told the Guardian it does not have access to the latter but that gas operations are not to blame for the mercury. “It has been ruled out that Camisea is one of the sources of the mercury contamination,” the company told the Guardian. “It is widely-known that the area is overrun by mining.” Asked to clarify who exactly has ruled out Camisea as the source and which specific “area” it is referring to, Pluspetrol did not respond. In 2015 the Culture Ministry issued a statement about the Nahua which included saying that it had asked Pluspetrol about mercury and the company replied it did not use it in any of its operations because it was not “suitable” or “necessary”. The Culture Ministry also stated that it had made an overflight of the “main river basins and tributaries” used by the Nahua for their food and water, but found no evidence of “illegal activities” – ie gold-mining – “that could be the source of the contamination.” The leaked report by the Health Ministry includes further concerning findings about the Nahua’s health, describing them as in an “extremely vulnerable demographic situation”. While acknowledging that they recovered from the “demographic collapse” in the 1980s following contact, they continue to suffer from a series of diseases and problems today – so much so that the perception among the Nahua themselves is that their health was better pre-contact. According to the report, 50% of all deaths between 1997 and 2014 occurred in people younger than 17, and 25% in babies less than six months. The diseases and problems highlighted include chronic malnutrition (61% of children under five sampled), anaemia (76% of children under five sampled), severe diarrhoea (main cause of death between 2007-2014), tuberculosis (the first case recorded in a young man returning from military service), and hepatitis B. One of the primary explanations given is the Nahua’s shift from a mobile to a sedentary way of life following contact in the mid-1980s, and the subsequent reduction in access to natural resources and clean water which have resulted in a less nutritious, diversified diet and an increase in intestinal parasites and infectious diseases. Other contributing factors include frequent travel to other areas, jobs in the timber trade and Camisea project, and “insufficient and inadequate” medical attention including “low vaccination coverage” in both children and adults. Two young Nahua men are reported to have died in recent weeks. Both Daniel Dixpopidiba Shocoroa and Ruben Yuradahua Shure were in their early 20s. According to regional media outlet Gaceta Ucayalina, Yuradahua died on 21 January in Atalaya from pulmonary tuberculosis – described as possibly the “consequence of mercury contamination.” The Health Ministry did not respond to questions."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/jan/22/henry-slade-injury-england-six-nations-exeter","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-22T22:13:09Z","webTitle":"Shoulder injury forces Henry Slade to withdraw from England training camp","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/jan/22/henry-slade-injury-england-six-nations-exeter","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/jan/22/henry-slade-injury-england-six-nations-exeter","fields":{"headline":"Shoulder injury forces Henry Slade to withdraw from England training camp","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"England have been given another injury headache before the start of the Six Nations after Henry Slade withdrew from this week’s training camp in Portugal with a shoulder injury. Slade was forced off during Exeter’s Champions Cup defeat by Glasgow on Saturday and he will remain with the Chiefs this week for further assessment rather than travelling to the Algarve. It is further disruption for Eddie Jones, who was already without 13 players for England’s Six Nations opener in Italy on 4 February, and if Slade is not fit enough to join the squad in Bagshot next week, it leaves limited options at outside-centre beyond Jonathan Joseph. Slade started two of England’s three autumn internationals in November, including at outside-centre against Samoa, and Ben Te’o, though nearing full fitness, has not played since October because of an ankle injury. Furthermore Elliot Daly (ankle) is a long-term absentee and Jack Nowell – now considered by Jones a contender for the No 13 jersey – was last week rated as “touch and go” to face Italy. Sam Underhill, meanwhile, has admitted he has changed his approach to tackling and is no longer preoccupied with making “big hits” after recently returning from an eight-week layoff due to a concussion. Underhill has started Bath’s last two matches following his prolonged absence, having suffered his second concussion of the season against Australia in November. His first was on his Premiership debut for Bath against Northampton, in which he made 23 tackles before being withdrawn after an hour. The 21-year-old is the favourite to start the Six Nations at openside flanker, provided he proves his fitness, and while he has only three caps to date, his dominant style means he is already a valued member of Jones’s side – he was appointed one of two defensive captains during the autumn. But having also been withdrawn before half-time in his first England appearance – in the non-capped victory over the Barbarians in May – after a blow to the shoulder, fears have been raised that Underhill’s technique leaves him vulnerable to injury. “The biggest consideration for me has been how I prepare for contact,” he said. “It’s a game of numbers, if you have a lot more contacts where your head is in a vulnerable position and they are bigger contacts, then you’re more likely at some point to get it wrong. You have to tackle efficiently because there’s no point trying to smash big guys all the time. It’s not the most efficient way to do it. Being a big hitter, just because you’re good at one type of tackle doesn’t mean you’re a good defender. Having better situational awareness will mean I’m more effective. “You still want to add an element of physicality to it but it’s about being more comfortable with other forms of tackle. Not every tackle has to be a big hit. If you look at [Bath team-mate] Francois Louw, he can put in big hits but is also a very smart defender. His consistency shows that having variety in your arsenal is more sustainable. “It’s an intelligent thing whereas a big hit is more of an emotional thing, which is hard to sustain over a season. It’s hard to always be the most aggressive player out there but you can be the smartest player consistently.” See Bath take on Leicester Tigers at Twickenham for The Clash, on Saturday 7 April.

He has missed only seven minutes of league football for Derby since his summer move from Hull City – recently completing 11 matches inside 44 days – to help guide them to second in the Championship. He is also father to a baby daughter, patron of the sexual health charity Saving Lives, the director of a clothing brand and a student at university, where he is training to become a journalist. A trip to Manchester United in the FA Cup on Friday night is just another thing to add to the list. Davies speaks articulately and with authority. It was Old Trafford where he was made West Brom’s second youngest captain in their history at the age of 20. Since then he has captained Hull City in an FA Cup final and has become a key leader in the Derby dressing room and defence, alongside Richard Keogh. “I’ve always been vocal,” Davies says. “It’s about managing people, certain people can take a hammering, others need an arm around [the shoulder]. I’m good in the dressing room. Bryan Robson was the main person to spot that in me when I was young. When a former England and Manchester United captain made me skipper, I never looked back.” At the age of 32, Davies is no stranger to big games, the biggest of which came in 2014 in the FA Cup final, in which he scored Hull’s second goal. “It was bittersweet. Arsenal had beaten us easily 3-0 at home three weeks before in the league. We were the underdogs, so when we went 1-0 up, we were in dreamland. Then I scored: 2-0. Obviously being captain, you start to think about climbing the stairs and lifting that trophy. “We ended up losing and I was going round lifting people’s heads off the floor but as I’ve looked to see Arsenal lifting the trophy, that’s when I turned into a blubbering wreck. I started crying my eyes out.” The FA Cup also holds painful memories from last year. Marco Silva had just replaced Mike Phelan as the Hull manager and while Davies was eager to impress, he was injured for much of January. “I was rushed back a bit too quick for an FA Cup game in January against Fulham,” Davies says. “I did my hamstring after eight minutes and then missed eight weeks of football. I lost my place and I wasn’t able to help against relegation. That was the biggest disappointment for me. “I hadn’t trained for that match and had been with the physios all week. But when a new manager comes to you and asks you to be in the squad, I decided to travel. But when the team was called out in the morning, I was in the starting XI. You have to play politics sometimes in football.” Two days after the injury, Silva signed Andrea Ranocchia on loan from Internazionale and Davies would play only four more times for Hull, who were relegated in May with a game still to play, after a 4-0 defeat at Crystal Palace. He has no hard feelings and is surprised by Watford’s recent slump under Silva. “He is meticulous on the training ground,” Davies says. “He would go through a throw-in 20 times until it was right. Everyone knew their own jobs and other people’s jobs as well. Even if I went to play left wing I’d know exactly what was required. That way, there was accountability for every error.” Coaching is an option when he retires but, although Davies says he plans on getting his badges, he does seem to have reservations about the potential opportunities for black, Asian and minority ethnic managers. “In football, it’s better to be a good mate than a good coach sometimes. Not many people are talking about the elephant in the room, particularly current players,” Davies says. “I understand a lot of the things [former Hull City team-mate] Liam Rosenior has been writing about the Rooney rule [and BAME coaches]. I know he’s keen to become a manager and a coach himself.” Davies, then, is also looking at other options, and has enrolled on a sports writing and broadcasting course at Staffordshire University. “I’m only in the first semester. I’ve actually got a deadline in a couple of weeks, my next essay is on ‘proactive v reactive PR in sport’. I’ve done all my rough notes, I just need to structure it, otherwise it will look like a mess.” For the moment, though, the priority remains playing the game. Davies has been included in England squads but never capped and accepts that call will probably never come again, although he is eligible to play for Sierra Leone. “I’ve thought about representing my dad’s country but the timing was wrong,” Davies says. “The team was banned from travelling to certain games because of Ebola. I remember there was a game against Seychelles that was cancelled a few years ago. There were fears anybody – a kit man or bus driver – could have passed on the disease. I would like to represent Sierra Leone before I retire but I don’t want to put my club career on the line – even if I went to the Africa Cup of Nations, I could lose my place at Derby.” With Davies at the back, only Wolves have conceded fewer than Derby in the Championship this season. County are on the up and, with United in indifferent form, the timing could be ripe for an FA Cup upset. “Playing Manchester United is a different kettle of fish to the Championship but we know we’re a team that don’t have to be the best team on the day to win. We can soak up a lot of pressure and when we get it, we’ve got good quality players that can take chances.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2018/jan/04/jose-mourinho-says-unhappy-old-trafford-garbage-news","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-04T22:40:00Z","webTitle":"José Mourinho calls claims he is unhappy at Old Trafford ‘garbage news’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jan/04/jose-mourinho-says-unhappy-old-trafford-garbage-news","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/jan/04/jose-mourinho-says-unhappy-old-trafford-garbage-news","fields":{"headline":"José Mourinho calls claims he is unhappy at Old Trafford ‘garbage news’","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"José Mourinho has responded to speculation that he is unhappy at Manchester United, insisting he will be at the club next season and hopes to extend his stay beyond three years. Launching something of a charm offensive in comparison with his sour demeanour at recent press conferences, the United manager described reports of a rift between him and the board as “garbage news”, adding that the owners and the board were happy with his work. “I can’t find a better word than garbage to define the [recent] talk,” Mourinho said in the buildup to Friday’s FA Cup game at home to Derby. “If you want to ask me directly, I see myself next season at Manchester United. I will leave when the club wants me to leave; at the moment I have no intention to leave at all. I want to stay, I don’t see any reason not to stay. “I still have a contract – in fact I am only in the middle of my contract, not in the last couple of months. My desire is to stay until the board and the owners are happy with my work. The worst thing about the garbage news is that it puts doubt on my professionalism, and that affects me because it is something I don’t admit. I hope by the end of my contract the board are happy enough with my contribution to want me to stay. Whether I get a new contract or not depends on the club but my commitment is total and I want to stay.” Mourinho went on to dispute the theory that his body language of late has suggested someone disenchanted with his job, even taking a swipe at one or two fellow managers in the process. “Just because I don’t behave like a clown on the touchline it doesn’t mean I have lost my passion.,” he said. “I prefer to behave as I am, more mature; it’s better for myself and the team. You don’t have to behave like a crazy guy to be a good manager – it’s not all about what you do in front of the cameras.” Perhaps aware of the need to lighten the mood following public gripes over Paul Scholes’ punditry and the club’s spending, Mourinho offered a jokey response to the suggestion that he could show a greater commitment to Manchester by moving to the area. “If the fans want me to be comfortable, that’s the way I feel comfortable,” he said. “I am very lazy, I like to arrive in the hotel . I don’t want anyone to worry about me, because I am not living in a two-square-metres room. I have an apartment within the hotel where I have all the comfort and support I need. If I was in a house that I didn’t like, lonely and away from my assistants, then I would be a sad guy – and sad guys don’t work well.” Mourinho insisted he is emotionally connected with United in the same way he has been at all his previous clubs – “everyone knows in Italy I am Inter, in Spain I am Real Madrid” – though admitted he may struggle at his present club to top his achievements with Chelsea. “The difference between Chelsea and United is that I really belong to Chelsea history,” he said. “I won three titles there, their first Premier League, cups, lots of things. At United we won the only trophy the club had never won, though I know the Europa League is not the Eldorado of football. It might be that I have come here in a moment when it is more difficult to make history. The Premier League now is completely different from 10 or 20 years ago. There used to be two big forces or perhaps a maximum three, but now you have clubs not fighting for the title or even the top four and their spending is amazing, even higher than ours. Everything changes, the nature of the job changes too, but my dedication to my work remains total.” Mourinho confirmed he would name a strong team to face Derby, because he regards them as a Premier League-standard side. “I’m going to play Sergio Romero because he’s a top keeper and he deserves to play – he will be Argentina’s goalkeeper in the summer [at the World Cup] and David de Gea needs a rest. But otherwise I will go with a strong team with first-team players.” Romelu Lukaku will be back after missing the game at Everton as a precaution after being concussed, and Marouane Fellaini is also available should Mourinho wish to make changes in midfield."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"film/2018/jan/04/father-of-slender-man-attacker-calls-new-movie-extremely-distasteful","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-04T16:48:26Z","webTitle":"Father of Slender Man attacker calls new movie 'extremely distasteful'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/jan/04/father-of-slender-man-attacker-calls-new-movie-extremely-distasteful","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/jan/04/father-of-slender-man-attacker-calls-new-movie-extremely-distasteful","fields":{"headline":"Father of Slender Man attacker calls new movie 'extremely distasteful'","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The father of a girl who violently attacked a classmate after being inspired by the fictional character Slender Man has criticized a new horror film of the same name as being “extremely distasteful”. Bill Weier, whose 12-year-old daughter, Anissa, stabbed another girl with the help of a friend, has spoken out about the forthcoming Sony Pictures release Slender Man, after a trailer was released online. “It’s absurd they want to make a movie like this,” he told the Associated Press. “It’s popularizing a tragedy, is what it’s doing. I’m not surprised, but in my opinion it’s extremely distasteful. All we’re doing is extending the pain all three of these families have gone through.” Weier’s daughter, now 16, was sentenced to 25 years in a mental institution last month. She claimed that the attack was to please Slender Man, a character created in 2009 by Eric Knudsen as part of a Photoshop contest. The victim, Payton Leutner, survived the attack. It’s unclear as to whether Sony’s film, released in May, will include details from the case although the trailer features schoolgirls haunted by the figure and one stabbing herself in the eye. It is from the film-maker Sylvain White, whose credits also include the slasher sequel I’ll Always Know What You Did Last Summer. The story has already been the subject of an HBO documentary, Beware the Slenderman, which featured interviews with the families of the girls involved. Sony has yet to respond to Weier’s comments."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jan/05/nhs-doctor-let-patients-down-crisis","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-05T10:00:09Z","webTitle":"I’m an A&E doctor.

This is how we’re forced to let our patients down","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"I’ve arrived five minutes early for my shift in a hospital A&amp;E department. I walk through the corridor behind the department, already crammed with hospital trolleys. I shut them out of my mind. I’ve still got five minutes of breathing space before they become my immediate reality. The trolleys are staffed by paramedics. They brought the patients in, there’s nowhere for them to go, and there are no hospital staff to look after them. So the paramedics wait with the patients, checking on their pain and repeating their vital signs – instead of being out there responding to the soaring number of emergency calls. Most of the patients in the corridor today are elderly. Some clearly have dementia, and are confused as to where they are. There’s no dignity, no warmth and a very long wait ahead before the hospital starts seeing and treating them. It turns out that I didn’t manage to shut them out of my mind at all. As I walk into the changing rooms there is chaos everywhere. A crisis has hit all the staff. The cleaners have needed to help with getting cubicles and bed areas turned around faster and faster, so the staff areas have moved to the bottom of their list. There are literally no clean scrubs or uniforms left for any of us to wear. “Don’t worry, whatever you’ve got on is fine, just start seeing patients.” The bosses are as stretched and as desperate as anyone else. I am allocated to the “minors” area. This area was designed for ambulatory patients who could be walked into a room, seen and walked back out to the waiting room to wait for results. It is already full of patients on hospital beds, pushed two together in three out of the five consultation rooms. Some are elderly, confused, alone. Some are young, injured or very unwell. One is a mental health patient with severe anxiety. This is not the place to make her feel better. Far from it. Over the PA system, pre-alerts for ambulances carrying critically unwell patients are announced – the ones whose condition is life-threatening. In 11 minutes, four ambulances carrying patients who need immediate resuscitation arrive. This would saturate the system on a good day. Today they have nowhere else to go. I hear a call for “security urgently” over the PA system. The call is repeated two minutes later. We all know it’s for show. The security team are stretched and scattered all over the hospital, and can rarely answer those calls. This time a staff member had been attacked by an intoxicated patient. As I walk back down the jammed corridor, increasing numbers of screaming and crying patients line the lanes, creating an emotional and physical obstacle course that every staff member walks down. It’s truly sickening. What’s worse is that this situation was entirely predictable. The inadequate care we are providing is the inevitable reality of the government’s funding decisions. If you strip back funding, force hospitals to make savings they can’t afford, devastate primary and social care, and fail to invest in staffing or resources to match demand, we are forced to tell our patients: “I’m so sorry, we can’t look after you safely today.” And for many of us, we’re tired of apologising on behalf of the ministers who have made these decisions. It’s just too much. We are too tired to keep trying to smile. We are struggling to try to make it work. We’re sorry we’ve let you down, but we’re broken and we need your help. • The anonymous writer is an A&amp;E doctor who works in a hospital in south-east England"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"football/2018/jan/04/jack-wilshere-dairy-gluten-arsenal","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-04T22:36:00Z","webTitle":"Jack Wilshere says cutting out dairy and gluten means he lasts longer","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jan/04/jack-wilshere-dairy-gluten-arsenal","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/jan/04/jack-wilshere-dairy-gluten-arsenal","fields":{"headline":"Jack Wilshere says cutting out dairy and gluten means he lasts longer","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Jack Wilshere is ticking off the important markers in his recovery towards the level of football he wants to be at consistently – and he credits part of that to a change in diet. The midfielder, who has played six full games in three weeks and scored in the 2-2 draw against Chelsea on Wednesday, said: “I’ve been dairy- and gluten-free for six weeks. My kids since birth gave been dairy- and gluten-free. The few times I’ve had dairy in the hotel I’ve had an upset stomach. “But I just cut it out completely and I think I look better. I’ve certainly lost a little bit of weight. I’m leaner and probably a little bit fitter as well. I feel I can last longer. At the end [of the draw against Chelsea] when we scored the second goal I thought: ‘Come on, we can go again.’ I felt good.” The two-games-a-week schedule may feel onerous and pressured for many but Wilshere has a big appetite for playing for 90 minutes twice a week. It was significant for him to rattle through that kind of fixture list playing well and feeling strong, and when he walked off the pitch with a goal, a performance and a salvaged point against Chelsea, it spoke volumes that he wants more football rather than a rest. “For myself it’s good to know,” he said. “It gives me belief in my body. I’ve never questioned it. I’ve never thought before the game: ‘I’m a bit tired today’ and this is the third game in six days. I was ready to go. I know my body well. I know the right foods to eat. I know the best way to recover and get the right amount of sleep. I’ve done that over the years and I think now that I am in the best shape that I have ever been.” He will probably sit out one or both of Arsenal’s cup games coming up, with Nottingham Forest in the FA Cup at the weekend followed by a League Cup semi-final first-leg against Chelsea. Having got back to regular Premier League football and scoring and making goals, he hopes the message is getting through to Gareth Southgate that his fitness deserves to be trusted for an England call-up. “I heard what the England manager said before the last squad was announced. He said we need to be playing in the Premier League week in, week out and I am doing that now. Hopefully it can continue.” Wilshere remains hopeful a new Arsenal contract will materialise soon. There has been no progress during the hectic winter schedule. “No date planned,” he said, “but I see the boss every day, so we will see.” Arsenal sign young centre-back Mavropanos Arsenal have completed a deal to sign Greek defender Konstantinos Mavropanos. The Guardian reported on Wednesday that the 20-year-old had travelled to London to complete a £1.9m (€2.1m) move, and the club confirmed the signing on Thursday. “Young Greek defender Konstantinos Mavropanos has signed for us,” an official club statement read. “He arrives from PAS Giannina, where he has made 16 Greek Super League appearances since breaking into the first team last season. We’d like to welcome Konstantinos to the club and wish him well for the future.” Mavropanos is regarded as one of the best defenders to emerge in Greece in the past 10 years, but is expected to be loaned out in the January window to gain experience, with a view to potentially challenging for a first-team place next season.

Michelle Terry announced a new season opening with Hamlet and As You Like It. Eye-catchingly, none of the actors turning up for rehearsals will know which role they are taking, with the whole ensemble choosing who plays whom. In a similar vein, when the plays The Merchant of Venice, The Taming of the Shrew and Twelfth Night go on tour, some audiences will be able to choose which one they want to see that night. Terry was announced as the new boss of Shakespeare’s Globe in the summer, succeeding Emma Rice, who was ousted from the job after two seasons. Some eyebrows were raised because Terry, while a hugely accomplished Shakespearean actor, has never directed. On Thursday Terry said theatre culture was too “director-centric” with “too much responsibility on one person”. She said there was too much pressure on a director to “solve the plays … Actors are amazing dramaturgs. They will tell you about what works in a play.” Terry said she wanted to dismantle hierarchies. “It is unfair that everything gets dumped on the director’s shoulders and actually it is a really collaborative process, especially for our theatre, which is one of the most democratic and egalitarian spaces that we’ve got.” The first two plays will be presented by a Globe ensemble of 12 actors, two co-directors and one designer. The ensemble will decide who plays, for example, Hamlet or Rosalind. Terry said she had chosen Hamlet and As You Like It because they were both written around 1599, the year the original Globe was built, and were conceived with its architecture in mind. The democratisation will continue later in the season when one group of eight actors will have to learn three plays. Audiences “every now and then” will be able to choose which play they want to see. How that works remained to be decided, Terry said. Other productions in the summer 2018 season include Othello, with the American actor André Holland in the lead role alongside Sir Mark Rylance, the Globe’s founding artistic director, as Iago. Rylance’s wife, Claire van Kampen, will direct. There will also be The Two Noble Kinsmen, directed by Barrie Rutter; The Winter’s Tale, directed by Blanche McIntyre; and Love’s Labour’s Lost, directed by Nick Bagnall. Terry promised diversity across the organisation, with the bottom line being: “We just have to do it. We can’t keep talking about it.” There will be a 50-50 gender split across the season, but at present there are no targets for other areas. “I can’t give you a policy for diversity because it is too complicated, it is too complex,” Terry said. “Actually it is about data collection and some people don’t want to tell you which socio-economic background they are from or what sexuality they are because they have fought their whole lives to not be seen like that. “If our job is to hold a mirror up to nature then we’ve got to truly reflect the society in which we live.” Other new measures include allowing people into rehearsals, particularly school parties who might be heartened to see that even the actors don’t understand what some words and lines might mean. The Globe’s reputation has been somewhat battered by the Rice affair. Rice staged productions that were less traditional, often loud and leftfield. The Globe decided it wanted to return to its core values and have, for example, no amplified sound. Why hire her in the first place, asked some. Terry said it had been a painful process but many positives could be taken. “I personally think Emma Rice was the best thing ever to have happened to the Globe because it has forced an organisation to really go through what is the most healthy process, it has afforded a time of unbelievable self-reflection for all of us.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"artanddesign/2018/jan/07/from-ear-to-ear-to-eye-sounds-stories-across-arab-world-review-nottingham-contemporary","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-07T08:00:05Z","webTitle":"From Ear to Ear to Eye review – voices of battle and the bazaar","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/jan/07/from-ear-to-ear-to-eye-sounds-stories-across-arab-world-review-nottingham-contemporary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2018/jan/07/from-ear-to-ear-to-eye-sounds-stories-across-arab-world-review-nottingham-contemporary","fields":{"headline":"From Ear to Ear to Eye review – voices of battle and the bazaar","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"In the spring of 2014, in one of the most controversial crimes of recent times, Israeli border guards shot dead two Palestinian teenagers in the West Bank town of Beitunia. CNN reporters captured the deaths on camera, disproving the soldiers’ claim that they were quelling a riot; but still the Israeli government defended its own. In the chaotic investigation that followed, audio-ballistic spectrograms of the event produced by the Amman-born artist and “audio investigator” Lawrence Abu Hamdan proved crucial. He was asked – as we are now, in his immensely powerful installation at Nottingham Contemporary – to listen rather than look. The spectrograms hang before you like targets in a shooting gallery. Each represents a different kind of gunshot, plucked from the soundtrack of carnage; and each approaches or recedes according to the trial unfolding in transcript on a screen below. Were the soldiers firing live ammunition or rubber bullets, as they insisted? Or were they in fact trying to disguise the fatal shots to make them sound like rubber bullets, with murderous intent? Hamdan gave the clinching evidence; but what strikes is the eerie silence of his installation. The case appears more horrifying as the lies and distortions are laid bare on screen, uninflected by the mollifying tones of human voices. The bodies of evidence hang in the air, ghosts of the speechless victims. Hamdan’s Earshot, recently bought for the nation by Tate Modern and shown in museums all over the world, fills the first gallery in Nottingham and is in many ways the key to the whole exhibition. Everything here is a form of testimony or evidence, a witness to life in the Arab world. Here is a bird’s-eye impression of Cairo after the Egyptian revolution and a photographic sweep through the streets of contemporary Beirut; here is a phone film of a protest in Kurdish Iran and the music of cafe life in Istanbul. One of the largest surveys of Arab art ever mounted in Britain, curated by the museum’s director Sam Thorne, this is a huge coup for Nottingham Contemporary. The show’s title comes, in part, from another profound installation, by the Beirut-based artist and composer Joe Namy, where the viewer sits on a steel bench bathed in purple light before a screen of spooling words, all of them attempts to describe the indescribable. One is the testimony of a translator working on the subtitles to an underground film by the Syrian “emergency cinema” collective Abounaddara, in which anonymous witnesses tell of the brutal execution of a prisoner, his neck slashed from ear to ear. The translator tries to think how to reproduce this phrase without the obvious allusion to smiling, and fails. Since the murder was a hidden horror, there are no images; words therefore matter even more. For some of these artists, images and words are both equally limiting. The Iranian artist Shirin Yousefi conceals diffusers at sporadic intervals through the show, emitting a spectrum of scents – the spicy perfume of bazaars, the grassiness of upland pastures – that trail an olfactory journey through the Kurdish regions of Turkey, Syria, Iran and Iraq. Malak Helmy fills the museum stairwell with a swelling flood of wild track recorded by a homing pigeon swooping over Egypt from Alexandria to El Alamein. The music of legendary Lebanese singers circles in the air. Certain works cannot have quite the same meaning here, perhaps, as they would to viewers in the Arab world. One film records, with stultifying slowness, the evolution of a landfill site outside Beirut and its political significance in the years following the Lebanese civil war. Others centre on family photograph albums, reprised in the form of videos, embroideries or prints, commemorating individual members and their mysterious fate. I could make little sense of Ania Dabrowska’s random archive of found snapshots from Lebanon and beyond, and I’m not sure that the artist has either. But others return to more traditional means. One of the show’s stars is Haig Aivazian, whose sculptures take the life of a Turkish-Armenian musician and turn it into a resounding metaphor. Aivazian’s beautifully shaped objects have the force of personality in their own right – the long necks of mandolins pulled to the limit on black racks; musical strings stretched to breaking point across the full length of the gallery wall; above all the immensely elongated oud, neckless, its holes like a mouth and two staring eyes, lying on a black case: a body upon its bier. Together, these sculptures form an elegy for a lost culture and its vanished artists; no longer instruments of music so much as torture. Almost inevitably, this very powerful show must turn upon politics. This can be as light as a calligraphic scroll by the cherished Lebanese poet Etel Adnan, now in her 90s; or as rough as the phone film of the Kurdish artist Hiwa K, who travelled to Europe on foot to escape Iraq in the 1990s. In 2011, Hiwa returned to his hometown, Sulaymaniyah, where he and a pal are filmed playing a haunting Ennio Morricone theme from Once Upon a Time in the West on mouth organ and guitar as they fight their way through a march against the use of teargas. All around them, people keep rallying in the midst of smoke and dust, squeezing lemon juice into their mouths against this very gas, turned upon them once more. This is performance art become living protest. Which is what marks this show as momentous – its presentation of a time and place where art may have become the only place to speak. This is literally the case with Hamdan, whose testimony proved crucial in life as in art. And it is especially so with a devastating film made by the Forensic Oceanography research group, charting the fate of a migrant boat adrift between Tripoli and Lampedusa for 14 days. The vessel is a twinkling light in a liquid blue swirl on the glowing screen before you. Other lights come and go in brilliant constellations. These are the positions of all the many planes, helicopters, Nato vessels and fishermen’s boats that flicker around the migrants but never draw close. A thousand documents could not say as much as this brief and sorrowfully beautiful film in which all the lights fade, leaving only the one little spark which eventually dies away, emblem of what is now known as the Left-to-Die Boat.. • From Ear to Ear to Eye is at Nottingham Contemporary until 4 March"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"global-development/2018/jan/05/ebola-survivors-sue-sierra-leone-government-over-missing-ebola-millions","type":"article","sectionId":"global-development","sectionName":"Global development","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-05T07:00:06Z","webTitle":"Ebola survivors sue government of Sierra Leone over missing millions","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2018/jan/05/ebola-survivors-sue-sierra-leone-government-over-missing-ebola-millions","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2018/jan/05/ebola-survivors-sue-sierra-leone-government-over-missing-ebola-millions","fields":{"headline":"Ebola survivors sue government of Sierra Leone over missing millions","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Two Ebola survivors are to sue the government of Sierra Leone in the first international court case intended to throw light on what happened to some of the millions of dollars siphoned off from funding to help fight the disease. The case, filed with the regional west African court in Nigeria, alleges that a lack of government accountability allowed the disappearance of almost a third of the money that came into the country during the early months of the Ebola outbreak in 2014. It claims that this led to violations of survivors’ rights to health and life. An audit of the first six months of the outbreak showed that more than $15m (£11m) worth of resources donated to the government went unaccounted for – more than 30% of what came into the country over that period. Lara Taylor-Pearce, Sierra Leone’s auditor general, said in an interview with the Africa Research Institute that she felt justice was needed for Sierra Leoneans over the missing millions: “For serious breaches of financial management procedure I would support forcing the individuals responsible to pay back the money. It would send a strong message. But currently this does not happen. People continue to get away with transgressions.” Sierra Leone recorded more than 14,000 cases of Ebola in two years, and about 250 health workers died. Officials promised survivors free healthcare and a small financial package, while surviving heath workers were told they would receive up to $5,000. But the president of the Sierra Leone Association for Ebola Survivors, Yusuf Kabbah, said those vows were broken. “When we were admitted to the treatment centres they burned all our clothes as a means to fight the virus, promising money for new ones. They promised us that after everything they would provide three things: livelihood, healthcare, and psychosocial support,” he said. “Now our members are dying because they don’t have any of those things.” After a slow international response, especially from the World Health Organization, foreign donors and governments eventually poured millions into Sierra Leone to combat the outbreak, which claimed nearly 11,000 lives in three countries over the course of 2014 and 2015. The Red Cross admitted in November that about $5m of their Ebola relief funding was lost to misappropriation across the infected countries of Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia before the outbreak was declared over in 2015. Kabbah said that there is more than enough physical evidence to support the claims made by survivors, but that international attention is needed to ensure the government takes the case seriously. Some critics worry that, even should a ruling be made in favour of the Ebola survivors, government officials could simply choose not to recognise the decision. “We need the international community’s tireless attention, because otherwise everything’s left with the government,” Kabbah said. “Then it will be an issue of justice denied. But if we get everyone’s attention, we get their support, we know justice will prevail. The truth is on our side.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2018/jan/04/meltdown-spectre-computer-processor-intel-security-flaws-explainer","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-04T14:20:09Z","webTitle":"Spectre and Meltdown processor security flaws – explained","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/jan/04/meltdown-spectre-computer-processor-intel-security-flaws-explainer","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2018/jan/04/meltdown-spectre-computer-processor-intel-security-flaws-explainer","fields":{"headline":"Spectre and Meltdown processor security flaws – explained","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Meltdown and Spectre are the names of two serious security flaws that have been found within computer processors. They could allow hackers to steal sensitive data without users knowing, one of them affecting chips made as far back as 1995. What are Meltdown and Spectre? Meltdown is a security flaw that could allow hackers to bypass the hardware barrier between applications run by users and the computer’s core memory, which is normally highly protected. Spectre is slightly different. It potentially allows hackers to trick otherwise error-free applications into giving up secret information. Is it serious? Yes. Meltdown is “probably one of the worst CPU bugs ever found” according to Daniel Gruss, one of the researchers at Graz University of Technology who discovered the flaw. It is very serious in the short term and needs immediate attention. The problem with Meltdown is that anything that runs as an application could in theory steal your data, including simple things such as javascript from a web page viewed in a browser. Spectre, on the other hand, is harder for hackers to take advantage of but is also more difficult to fix and is expected to be a bigger problem in the long term. What kinds of devices are affected? Practically every computing device affected by Spectre, including laptops, desktops, tablets, smartphones and even cloud computing systems. A few lower power devices, such as certain Internet of Things gadgets, are unaffected. What is a processor? The processor, or central processing unit (CPU), is the primary chip in a computer that carries out the instructions of a computer program – in essence, the brain of the computer. When you command a program to do something, it is the processor that carries out that command, co-operating with the rest of the system to perform whatever task is needed. There are other types of processors, including graphics processing units (GPU) or graphics cards, co-processors such as sensor chips that detect motion or similar physical conditions, but the term “processor” without a caveat is generally exclusively used to describe the CPU. Does it only affect Intel processors? Spectre affects all modern processors, including those designed by Intel, AMD and ARM, but Meltdown is currently thought only to affect Intel chips manufactured since 1995, with the exception of the Itanium and Atom chips made before 2013. What can be stolen? The core system, known as the kernel, stores all types of sensitive information in memory. This means banking records, credit cards, financial data, communications, logins, passwords and secret information could which is all be at risk due to Meltdown. Spectre can be used to trick normal applications into giving up sensitive data, which potentially means anything processed by an application can be stolen, including passwords and other data. Is it already being used to steal data? The UK’s National Cyber Security Centre said that there is no evidence that Meltdown and Spectre are actively being used to steal data at the moment, but the nature of the attacks make them difficult to detect. Experts expect that hackers will quickly develop programs to launch attacks now that the information is available. Dan Guido, chief executive of cybersecurity consulting firm Trail of Bits, said: “Exploits for these bugs will be added to hackers’ standard toolkits.” What can I do about it? Users can do little to avoid the security flaws apart from update their computers with the latest security fixes as soon as possible. Fixes for Linux and Windows are already available. Chromebooks updated to Chrome OS 63, which started rolling out in mid-December, are already protected. Android devices running the latest security update, including Google’s Nexus and Pixel smartphones, are already protected. Updates are expected to be delivered soon. Users of other devices will have to wait for the updates to be pushed out by third-party manufacturers, including Samsung, Huawei and OnePlus. On Thursday night, Apple advised customers in a blog post to update their devices’ operating systems and only download software from “trusted sources such as the App Store”. The company also said that “there are no known exploits impacting customers at this time”. Will the fixes slow my computer? While the fixes for Spectre are not expected to have much immediate impact on the performance of computers, the nature of the fixes needed to protect against Meltdown could have a significant impact. That’s due to the separation of the application and kernel memory required by the various operating systems to prevent the flaw being used to access protected data. Separating the two memory systems like this means that tasks that constantly require the kernel do to things, such as writing files to disk or sending data over a network, could be significantly slower due to the increased time it will take for the processor to switch between the application memory and the kernel memory. Some early estimates predict up to 30% slower performance in some tasks. Whether users will notice a difference on their computers will depend on the task they are trying to do. Gaming, browsing and general computing activities are unlikely to be affected, but those that involve lots of writing files may become slower. Some technologies, such as Intel’s Process-Context Identifiers (PCID) that was included with the company’s processors since 2013, can lessen the impact of the fixes if taken advantage of in the operating system. Who found it? Meltdown was independently discovered and reported by three teams, including Jann Horn from Google’s Project Zero, Werner Haas and Thomas Prescher from Cyberus Technology and Daniel Gruss, Moritz Lipp, Stefan Mangard and Michael Schwarz from Graz University of Technology in Austria. Spectre was independently discovered by two people, including Horn and Paul Kocher, who worked in collaboration with Daniel Genkin, from University of Pennsylvania and University of Maryland, Mike Hamburg from tech firm Rambus, Lipp, and Yuval Yarom from the University of Adelaide and Data61. What about cloud services? The problem is magnified for cloud services such as Amazon’s Web Services and Google’s Cloud Platform, due to the scale of their computing resources and the potential impact on performance of the fixes. Amazon said it was in the process of patching systems with all but a “small single-digit percentage” of its Amazon Web Services EC2 systems already protected, but that “customers must also patch their instance operating systems” to be fully protected. Google also said that the majority of its systems were updated, but that some additional customer action may be needed for its Compute Engine and other Cloud Platform systems. Microsoft said it was in the process of deploying fixes to its cloud systems.

Where possible, he avoided attending them – if they proved inescapable, his mood would darken for hours afterwards. The whole subject of mortality appalled him. Before he died in 1966, he would tell his daughter Diane he wanted no funeral at all. He should, he insisted, be remembered only as he had been in life, a wish that takes on a certain poignancy given the world then spent half a century speculating about his place in a cryogenic freezer. Strange, too, that so many of the films he made said so much about death. For generations, children’s movies – and Disney movies most of all – have been breaking the very worst of bad news to the young, arriving under cover of a U certificate to reveal the random cruelty and finality of it all. The hunter’s gunshot that left Bambi motherless rings out into the present day. Just a few recent additions to the Disney graveyard would include the noble Mufasa, slain during The Lion King, poor Ellie Fredriksen passing on in the opening sequence of Up, and the royal couple whose drowning kickstarts Frozen. Peer beneath the cowl of the Grim Reaper and you will surely find a pair of mouse ears. And now there is Coco, a charming animated frolic rooted in the Mexican tradition of Día de Muertos (the Day of the Dead). For producers Pixar – a wholly owned Disney subsidiary since 2006 – the film has been box-office gold, drawing vast global crowds of children to a film entirely bound up with death (the film gets its UK release later in January). The hero is Miguel, a sweet-natured 12-year-old who quarrels with his family and finds himself marooned in the Land of the Dead – a freewheeling hereafter filled with happy skeletal citizens. But under the romp lurks something sombre. As Miguel discovers, the dead can only enjoy the next world while they remain in the memories of the living, the place of at least one character imperilled by a case of advancing dementia. If the notion of an afterlife seems like sugaring the pill, bleak is the fate of the forgotten, vanishing into what Coco calls “the final death”. In a film pitched at such young audiences, its visualisation brings a genuine shudder – death as we all fear it, a lonely plunge into an unknowable void. It could have been worse. The connection to the dark heart of Disney storytelling was to have been even more direct: an earlier version of the script took place in the wake of Miguel’s mother dying, a narrative device that might best be called the Full Bambi. However well we think we know Bambi, a re-watch can be useful purely as a reminder of its impossible brutality. Behold the woodland idyll, the loving bond between mother and fawn, all of it adorably brought to life by Disney artist Tyrus Wong – and then the hunter, the wide-eyed terror, the violence, the loss, utter abandonment in a cold world. Nothing by Michael Haneke comes close. No wonder so many adults instantly wince at the mention of the title (Stephen King traces his formative contact with horror back to it). The scale of shock Bambi springs on viewers has few rivals – the closest thing in Hollywood history is another out-of-nowhere killing, the shower scene in Psycho. And just as events at the Bates motel echoed on after the credits to change the course of movies, dividing every thriller into Before and After, so the death of Bambi’s mother transformed cinema. The film blew the whistle on mortality for kids for ever. Death was now part of what children’s movies were. But the medicine took a while to go down. Bambi came out in US cinemas in the summer of 1942, only months after America entered the second world war. As Hollywood set to cranking out propaganda, the most honest movie in cinemas about death was aimed at children, many of whose parents would be away fighting. Small wonder that, first time round, business was slow. Among shattered audiences was Diane Disney, then eight, who demanded to know, through sobs, why her father had chosen not to save Bambi’s mother. The timing was interesting in other senses, too. In 1938, buoyed by the triumph of Snow White and the Seven Dwarves, Disney bought a handsome house in north Hollywood for his elderly parents, Flora and Elias. When they complained of fumes caused by a faulty gas furnace, studio handymen were sent to make repairs. Days later, Flora was found dead from asphyxiation. Her son, the story goes, blamed himself. Bambi went into production the next year. If the film was part-fuelled by filial guilt, not even Bambi could exorcise it. Given the box office, the assumption might be that the film would remain a grim anomaly in movie history and the life of Walt Disney. Instead, he made Old Yeller, a 1957 tearjerker that seemed to take Bambi as a challenge, the entire story of Texan scamp Travis Coates and his faithful mutt building to the famous climax when – look away, spoilerphobes and dog lovers – a rabies outbreak demands he take a rifle to it. For animal actors, it was the point after which it became advisable to always read the script before committing to a role. For everyone else, a tradition took shape. Children who had learned about the realities of death from Bambi now had kids of their own to traumatise with Old Yeller – and as both films found their audience through the second lives of television and video, the pattern repeated down the generations. Watching the rites of passage suffered through by Bambi and Travis Coates became its own rites of passage. Other films took up the gauntlet. Beyond Disney, many of our most beloved children’s movies have been soaked in death. Few British childhoods remain unmarked by the savagery of Watership Down. From Japan came the howlingly sad Grave of the Fireflies, the story of a boy and his younger sister in the ruined last days of second world war. Even before the company was bought by Disney, Pixar made Finding Nemo as an aquatic nod to Bambi, with a male lead whose mother is dinner for a barracuda. All of which has thrown up ironies. Films made for children wilfully leave them distraught, while Hollywood movies treat adults like kids. The gulf is never more visible than in action movie shoot ’em ups, where body counts stack high and anonymous, grieving families left off-screen, death the pretext for a scriptwriter’s quip. But the mix of the glib and the mawkish is really just the movies reflecting the world outside the cinema. While the ubiquitous colourful skulls on high street leisurewear and kids’ stationery were borrowed from the Day of the Dead long before Coco, in the west we have no similar celebration of the role of death in our lives. As a society, we are all Walt Disney, avoiding funerals and keeping death walled-off. The only thing we dread more than dying is having to talk about it. Cue Bambi, Old Yeller and Nemo. For years, the implicit pact we have made with the movies has been one of outsourcing – subcontracting the awful business of telling our kids about death. Who could blame us? As any parent knows, it is seldom the right moment to tell a child that in an arbitrary finger-click a loved one can – no, will – disappear and never come back, just as one day the child itself will too. And with that comes the whole existential shooting match, the gnawing knowledge of mortality, the endless thrum of fear and futility, the tears on a small face smeared with melted Maltesers. To do all that and still aim for a happy ending takes a certain strength of nerve. And that’s what we pay Walt Disney for. Coco is released in the UK on 19 January."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2018/jan/05/a-house-through-time-review-a-compelling-way-to-trace-social-history","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-05T07:00:06Z","webTitle":"A House Through Time review – a compelling way to trace social history","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/jan/05/a-house-through-time-review-a-compelling-way-to-trace-social-history","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2018/jan/05/a-house-through-time-review-a-compelling-way-to-trace-social-history","fields":{"headline":"A House Through Time review – a compelling way to trace social history","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"In his new series, the historian David Olusoga has hit upon a compelling way to trace the social and political landscape of Britain across a span of 180 years – focusing on just one building. A House Through Time (BBC Two) explores the varied and changing inhabitants of a single dwelling in Liverpool, from its construction to the present day. There are some obvious parallels between this and the long-running series Who Do You Think You Are?, except that in this case the people whose histories are investigated are under no obligation to be related to the same celebrity, as long as they all had the same address. “Every house in Britain has a story to tell,” said Olusoga. This is undoubtedly true, although I’m not sure it means that every house has a story worth telling. I don’t know how they settled on 62 Falkner Street, but it was clear from the outset that a lack of incident wasn’t going to be a problem. These days working mum Gaynor and her two children, Rosie and Tom, live there, in what seems a highly desirable area, but the terrace that holds No 62 has never stayed the same place for long. Once, of course, it was all fields, a country lane running alongside land belonging to a Mr Falkner. The street was developed piecemeal, which played havoc with the numbering: 62 used to be 58. The house was complete by 1841 and, priced at about £1,000, would have been intended for the city’s wealthy new middle class. Its history, however, is not that straightforward. The first known inhabitant, Richard Glenton, was a lowly customs clerk who probably never earned more than £50 a year and took in lodgers to make ends meet. Next came the Orrs, a couple who began life in service and finished up rich, moving on to even bigger things. The central story belonged to Wilfred Steele, a wealthy cotton broker who was ruined by the “panic” of 1857 – the first global economic crisis – and who eventually ended up in debtor’s prison. Although careful not to overindulge in speculation when the historical trail grows faint, Olusoga has a knack for conjuring characters out of old documents, and he was not about to shed a tear for a man whose lost fortune was founded on the slave trade. “I really wish I could feel sorry for Wilfrid Steele,” he said. “But I don’t.” Olusoga was probably right not to: Steele got out of prison, married, then abandoned his family to go off and start another one in the States, leaving two stepdaughters to the workhouse. There was also a creepy painting of Steele in his younger days – atop a horse, recreating some Scottish legend – which let you judge the book by its cover. On the strength of this opener – there are three more to come – I am now fully prepared to believe that every house has not just one, but many stories to tell. But I wouldn’t pit my house against 62 Falkner Street in any given decade. “My name is Erin Quinn. I’m 16 years old and I come from a place called Derry.” This narrated introduction to Derry Girls (C4) is not all it seems: Erin’s weird cousin Orla was reading aloud from Erin’s purloined diary, much to Erin’s consternation. Set in 1990s Northern Ireland and loosely based on the teen years of writer Lisa McGee (Being Human), Derry Girls is such a fresh look at growing up with the Troubles as a constant backdrop that it sometimes unsettles, although it mostly stays on the charming side of wicked. Erin (Saoirse Monica Jackson) and her friends long to break free from the conformity of their convent school, but lack the resolve for even minor defiance. “I’m not being individual on me own,” says Clare. Rounding out the group is loudmouth loose cannon Michele, who turns up to the first day of school with her English cousin James, the son of her aunt Cathy. “She went to England to get an abortion and never came back,” said Michele. “Never had the abortion either.” Such difficulties as the girls face spring as much from their desire to fit in as from their attempts at rebellion, and the Troubles are presented, so far, as an inconvenience – soldiers boarding school buses, bombed bridges ruining plans – far less frightening than stone-faced headmistress Sister Michael. You couldn’t call Derry Girls nostalgic, exactly; it doesn’t make me long to be the only English boy in a 90s Irish girls’ school without any men’s loos. But the period is recreated with care, and the script is affectionate, foul-mouthed and funny. I’m looking forward to next week."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"sport/live/2018/jan/04/ashes-2017-18-australia-v-england-fifth-test-day-two-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-05T06:46:38Z","webTitle":"Ashes 2017-18: Australia v England, fifth Test, day two – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2018/jan/04/ashes-2017-18-australia-v-england-fifth-test-day-two-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/live/2018/jan/04/ashes-2017-18-australia-v-england-fifth-test-day-two-live","fields":{"headline":"Ashes 2017-18: Australia v England, fifth Test, day two – as it happened","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"That was another good day for Australia, who are well set to complete a 4-0 series victory after fine batting from Warner, Khawaja and the inevitable Smith. England bowled pretty well on a flat pitch, with Mason Crane doing enough to stir excitement in those with an ounce of soul, but they don’t have enough runs to play with. It will take something pretty special for them to win the match from here. I’ll leave you with an email from Ben Parker. Thanks for your company; night! “As OBOers love stats and cynicism,” says Ben, “I’d like to point out that only two players average over 150 in this series. Steve Smith (162) and Moeen Ali (151.66).” 67th over: Australia 193-2 (Khawaja 91, Smith 44) Joe Root brings himself on for the last over of the day. I’d like to see him bowl a bit more, particularly when Moeen’s confidence is through the floor. Root’s first ball is filth, a long hop that Khawaja pulls for four to move into the nineties. Those are the last runs of the day. Khawaja will start tomorrow needing nine for his century, having played with increasing fluency in this innings. 66th over: Australia 189-2 (Khawaja 87, Smith 44) Smith works Crane round the corner for two to bring up a low-key, high-class hundred partnership that has put Australia in a very strong position. Crane’s day ends with figures of 17-0-58-0. 65th over: Australia 185-2 (Khawaja 86, Smith 41) Smith works Moeen for a single to move within 159 of his double hundred. You think I’m joking. 64th over: Australia 184-2 (Khawaja 86, Smith 40) Mason Crane changes ends to replace Anderson, and is milked for a couple of runs. There was mayhem just before the close yesterday. Tonight, all is calm. “I might be an Aussie in Sydney, but I can’t help feeling that England still have a big chance to win this Test,” says Martin Gillam. “It looks like one of those wickets that don’t come on to the bat, and Smith has been at his least impressive of the series. Australia will need to get 100+ in front, no certainty, because we know what it’s like chasing in Sydney against spin in the fourth innings.” Look, Martin, you’ve won the Ashes. You’re not allowed to take our pessimism as well. 63rd over: Australia 181-2 (Khawaja 85, Smith 38) There are five overs remaining. Australia don’t look like losing a wicket. Since the first innings at Brisbane, when he bowled well, Moeen has taken one wicket for 381 runs. Oof. 62nd over: Australia 177-2 (Khawaja 84, Smith 35) Khawaja waves Anderson through the covers for three, a classy stroke at the end of a long day. “Good to hear Crane bowling well on his debut,” says Kevin Wilson. “Seeing as Hampshire seem reluctant to play him, picking Dawson as their main spinner, what can be done to increase his playing time?” CAN YOU STOP TALKING ABOUT MASON CRANE YOU EFFING JINGOIST. Erm, send him to Somerset. It’s a worry: the two things England need – pace and quality spin – are not exactly encouraged by county cricket. It’ll take a while to change the culture, but I’m sure Andrew Strauss will at least try to do so. 61st over: Australia 172-2 (Khawaja 81, Smith 33) Moeen Ali replaces Mason Crane, who has had a promising first day as a Test bowler. Poor Moeen: his allrounder quotient for this series (batting average minus bowling average) is now minus 129. I was sure he’d have a poor series in Australia, but I didn’t expect averages of 21 with the bat and 150 with the ball. Moeen reminds us of his ability with a jaffa that spits past Khawaja’s outside edge. “And you wonder why the website is continually pleading for memberships and subscriptions,” says Steven McKiernan, “because I’m not buying your response.” Well that escalated quickly. 60th over: Australia 170-2 (Khawaja 80, Smith 32) Root has put a helmet on so he can stand closer at second slip when Anderson is bowling. Khawaja, who has surely secured a tour to South Africa with this innings, carefully plays out another maiden. “So much effort lauding Crane, and very little about the 80-run-and-counting partnership,” says Steven McKiernan. “Your bias is showing.” It’s a blog, Steven, not a judicial review. And believe me, when I lose myself in an orgy of jingoism, you’ll know about it. 59th over: Australia 170-2 (Khawaja 80, Smith 32) A googly from Crane is jabbed to leg by Smith. Australia are 17 minutes’ away for completing another very good day. England need a wicket or eight. 58th over: Australia 164-2 (Khawaja 76, Smith 30) This match is starting to go a bit Perth, and tomorrow could be a day of the hardest yakka for England’s bowlers. Anderson is definitely getting a bit of reverse here, and Khawaja respectfully plays out a maiden. 57th over: Australia 164-2 (Khawaja 76, Smith 30) “Delightful as it is to learn via TMS — and you — that Crane is being lauded by the great and the good, even an old wizened Aussie (me) knows that one should look at Crane with a more writerly aspect,” says Sarah Bacon. “Don’t kill this darling. He’s doing beautifully, he should grow naturally, be nurtured sensibly. Let Crane be Crane. At 20, there is a great deal to appreciate, but don’t use him up, wear him out, and generally do what too many have had done to them in England’s cricketing past. Please.” That appeal to Joe Bloggs’s better nature is as lovely as it is misplaced. 56th over: Australia 163-2 (Khawaja 75, Smith 30) Jimmy Anderson replaces Stuart Broad (10-2-28-1). For a 35-year-old who is allergic to the Kookaburra, he’d had some series: 17 wickets at 25.52, with an economy rate of 2.17. If his body holds up, he should be around for one last Ashes series in 2019. Three from this over, with a slight suggestion of reverse swing. Here’s Ian Copestake. “In the words of the sage, ‘Cool your boots, man. Find your neutral space away from Twitter’.” They made me do it. 55th over: Australia 160-2 (Khawaja 72, Smith 30) Khawaja, trying to go downtown, drags Crane short of deep midwicket. There have been enough false strokes, most of them forced errors, for this to constitute a good day for Crane, even if figures are 13-0-45-0 are nothing to tweet about. “Morning Rob,” says Kim Thonger. “In years to come, when young Mason Crane is fully established, we shall need a word to describe his bowling style. May I suggest Cranuscular?” Not at this hour, please. 54th over: Australia 159-2 (Khawaja 71, Smith 30) Smith again edges Broad for four, with the ball falling just short of first slip. Soft hands saved him. This is a good spell from Broad, who has been close to his best in the last two Tests. 53rd over: Australia 154-2 (Khawaja 70, Smith 26) England need at least one more wicket before the close, ideally Smith. He has just pulled Crane for a single to reach 6,000 Test runs in his 61st match. It’s his 111st innings, which makes him joint second-fastest to the milestone alongside Sir Garry Sobers. That’s just staggering. 52nd over: Australia 152-2 (Khawaja 69, Smith 25) Another bit of fortune for Smith, who edges Broad just short and wide of the diving Root at second slip. The ball runs away for four. That’s two false strokes in as many overs from Smith. He’s all over the show; it’s sad to watch a once great player fall so far. I think Broad is starting to get a bit of reverse: later in the over Khawaja leaves a ball that tails back and almost hits the off stump. 51st over: Australia 147-2 (Khawaja 69, Smith 20) I’m not sure why but I decided to type ‘Mason Crane’ into Twitter just now. The amount of ignorant sneering is staggering. What the hell is wrong with people? He’s a 20-year-old kid, bowling pretty well on his Test debut and earning warm praise from, among others, Brett Lee, Mike Hussey, Graeme Swann, Geoff Boycott, Alison Mitchell and Michael Vaughan. That’s not good enough for life’s great achievers, the social-media sne’er-do-wells. On reflection, Twitter might be even more disgusting than morning people. While I was typing the above, Crane almost dismissed both batsmen in an excellent over. Smith edged just short of slip; then Khawaja pad-gloved the ball up in the air, only for it to bisect Crane and Stoneman as they charged towards it. 50th over: Australia 145-2 (Khawaja 68, Smith 19) Broad replaces Curran, who bowled an effervescent but unthreatening spell. He’s on 399 Test wickets. Smith ignores a few wide tempters, and Broad’s first over back is a maiden. 49th over: Australia 145-2 (Khawaja 68, Smith 19) All the BT Sport pundits have been impressed with Crane, particularly Graeme Swann. He draws an edge from Khawaja that goes straight between Bairstow and Root at catchable height. It was too sharp for Bairstow and I suspect Root was unsighted. There are a few jeers when Crane stops twice in his delivery stride. When he finally sends the next delivery down, it’s a high full toss that Smith wallops for four. Imagine the mental strain of being a legspinner in an Ashes Test at the age of 20. At the same age I could barely cope with eye contact. 48th over: Australia 136-2 (Khawaja 65, Smith 13) A good maiden from Curran to Khawaja. 47th over: Australia 136-2 (Khawaja 65, Smith 13) Lovely batting from Khawaja, who dumps Crane back over his head for four. A single brings up an assured fifty partnership, dominated by Khawaja. 46th over: Australia 131-2 (Khawaja 60, Smith 13) An attempted slower ball from Curran comes out as a loopy full toss that Smith fails to put away. A maiden. England have control of the scoring rate, even if they don’t particularly look like taking a wicket. 45th over: Australia 131-2 (Khawaja 60, Smith 13) Khawaja bat-pads Crane fractionally short of Stoneman at a deepish short leg. That was the closest Crane has come to a wicket so far. Had Stoneman been in an orthodox short-leg position that would probably have been a comfortable catch. “Hi Rob,” says Jim Fitz. “I think Ireland could give England a go in Malahide right now. Everything depends on Cook. He creates the tempo and gives or takes the hope. Who can replace him, and is this Aussie team the next team to dominate?” Haseeb Hameed should be Cook’s replacement. All things being equal, he’ll score 10,000 Test runs. As for the Aussie team, I don’t think so. I doubt any team will dominate because they are all pretty poor away from home. Australia’s attack will do damage anywhere in the world but I’m not sure about their top six. It’ll be fascinating to see how India – who have been invincible at home in the last few years - get on in South Africa (starting today), England and Australia in the next 12 months. I suspect they will lose all three series and be reappraised accordingly. 44th over: Australia 127-2 (Khawaja 57, Smith 12) At some point in the next few months, Tom Curran is going to wake up from a Steve Smith dream, shaking with fear and babbling: “He’s middling everything! He’s middling everything!” Smith looks so good already and is surely nailed-on for a hundred. He’s 12 not out. “Morning, Rob,” says Sarah Bacon. “Interesting that you note that the unorthodoxy of Curran might bear fruit when Australia’s most consistent, yet UN-orthodox batsmen has all the orthodox bases covered. How does that work exactly? Asking for a friend.” Sarah, as you may have discerned, it’s 5.01am and I am spouting rot. Erm, think of it like rock/paper/scissors, but with only two objects, and negotiable rules. 43rd over: Australia 126-2 (Khawaja 56, Smith 12) Crane has his first bowl to Smith. He’s already dismissed AB de Villiers in international cricket, so what’s the worst than can happen? Oh. Smith has a respectful look at a couple of deliveries and then cuts a single. Crane has shown plenty of promise today. He has so much going for him at the age of 20. “Rowan Sweeney (over 28) wondered why Johnny Watkins’ brief stint was so famously bad,” says Gervase Greene. “He was picked from utter obscurity, to the befuddlement of all, and then lived down to that expectation. The poor guy was so nervous his first three balls were wides. And so wide they should have counted as 2 or more runs each. The umpire called the first few and then politely demurred for most of the rest, which were just as bad. Two overs of utter agony. Even the batsman - might have been the majestic Majid Khan or Mushtaq Mohammed, both of whom ate leg-spin for tiffin - chose to just let the slow car-crash slide without plundering, to their very great credit.” 42nd over: Australia 124-2 (Khawaja 55, Smith 11) “Rob,” says Mac Millings. “Just tuning in, and your 37th-over entry was posted four times. Weirdest thing was, the 4th one said “38th over”. Now, I’m a little the worse for celebration, what with Snowmageddon having cancelled my last three days of school (I’m a teacher, though not a good one), but that does seem odd. Nothing further to add. I’m a little tipsy, is all.” It’s not me, Millings, it’s you. It’s always you. 41st over: Australia 121-2 (Khawaja 55, Smith 8) Mason Crane replaces Moeen Ali, whose series bowling average is now 149.66. His first ball brings an unsuccessful LBW shout against Khawaja, who pushed around his pad at a legspinner. England considered a review but Crane suggested it was going down the leg side; he was right. A good over is spoiled by a poor final delivery that Khawaja bashes through extra cover for four. 40th over: Australia 116-2 (Khawaja 51, Smith 8) Tom Curran replaces Jimmy Anderson (10-2-17-1). Smith, surprised by a bit of extra bounce, jerks his head back in surprise as he plays a back-defensive stroke. Curran’s occasional unorthodoxy might be a useful weapon against Smith, who seems to have all the orthodox bases covered. A good over, two from it. 39th over: Australia 114-2 (Khawaja 51, Smith 6) Moeen continues to Smith, the wrong tactic in ma opinion but not Joe Root’s. Smith dumps a slog sweep into the leg of Stoneman at short leg, with the ball rebounding for a single. And then Khawaja reaches his fifty in style, driving Moeen for a sweet straight six! In the personal circumstances it’s been an admirable knock. 38th over: Australia 107-2 (Khawaja 45, Smith 5) Smith starts his innings with the certainty of a man who’s already on 50. It must be soul-crushing for bowlers. 37th over: Australia 106-2 (Khawaja 45, Smith 4) I’d like to see Crane bowl before Smith gets his eye in. Moeen is always a good option to Khawaja but Smith is the priority. Khawaja continues to use his feet to Moeen, dancing down the track to whip a low full toss for four. 36th over: Australia 101-2 (Khawaja 41, Smith 3) A short ball from Anderson is pulled swaggeringly for four by Khawaja. Shot! “Crepuscular is a word that is only used by people who get up really early,” says Ian Copestake. “I want no more to do with it.” There’s plenty wrong with society these days, so much deviancy to lament. But there’s nothing quite as disgusting or diabolical as morning people. 35th over: Australia 97-2 (Khawaja 37, Smith 3) Moeen Ali starts with a poor over after tea. Only one from it, but he got away with a dreadful long hop to Smith. “Hi Rob,” says Ben Parker. “I won £220 on my first ever cricket bet last year - backing Windies at 11-1 to win at Headingley. Buoyed by my success I followed some professional cricket writer’s tip: ‘If you have a spare mortgage, put it on Warner making another SCG hundred’ and am now down £217,000 for the year.” Don’t be too hard on yourself, Ben. You can’t win them all. 34th over: Australia 96-2 (Khawaja 36, Smith 3) Steve Smith gets off the mark with a confident drive through extra cover for three off Anderson. A BT Sport graphic tells us that he has scored more runs after 60 Tests than any player in history. Donald Bradman is not even in the top 10, which again shows how overrated he was. Anyway, that’s tea. England did well to stay in the game on a flat pitch, with Anderson and Broad (combined figures 15-3-30-2) showing their class in what will probably be their last Test in Australia. Warner played beautifully, Khawaja scrapped admirably and Steve Smith looks nailed-on for a hundred. He’s three not out. See you in 15 minutes for the evening session. 33rd over: Australia 92-2 (Khawaja 35, Smith 0) A poor ball from Moeen is cut easily for four by Khawaja. “Please pass on my thanks to Ian Copestake!” says Rowan Sweeney. “My excruciatingly self-righteous father uses the word ‘crepuscular’ like mad. I only just looked it up. Doesn’t mean what I thought it would...” I was going to ask what you thought it meant, but I’m not sure I want to know. 32nd over: Australia 86-2 (Khawaja 29, Smith 0) The good news for England is they’ve dismissed David Warner. The bad news is that somebody has to replace him. “Morning Rob,” says James Lane. “It’s a glorious winter morning in the foothills of the Himalayas, punctuated only by the sound of shrieking monkeys being chased off by my neighbour (she’s a policewoman with a big stick). Your particular brand of dry despair is especially tickling today. Why do the English deal with losing so much better than everybody else?” Practice makes perfect. Ah that’s lovely bowling from Jimmy Anderson. Warner fiddled at a fine leg-cutter that moved sharply off the pitch to take the edge, and Bairstow took a nice low catch. That’s a vital wicket because Warner was playing with formidable certainty. 31st over: Australia 84-1 (Warner 54, Khawaja 29) Khawaja, who has looked unconvincing against Moeen all day, charges down the pitch and drives airily past the diving Cook at absurd mid-off. Moeen then beats the outside edge with a classical off-spinner. While he’s still nowhere near his best, Moeen is bowling better than at any stage since the first innings in Brisbane. 30th over: Australia 84-1 (Warner 54, Khawaja 29) Anderson bursts one past Warner’s outside edge. England have bowled well enough on what is a very flat pitch. SMIYTYHTOB, but they simply didn’t make enough runs. 29th over: Australia 83-1 (Warner 54, Khawaja 28) The ball is being changed by the umpires. BREAKING NEWS: ENGLAND ROCKED BY FRESH BALL-TAMPERING SCANDAL. Warner treats the new ball as he did the old, thumping Moeen for four. He is playing with total authority. “Morning,” says Ian Copestake. “Am at an excruciatingly self-righteous academic conference and desperately need you to lift our boys so they can get the bacon delivered and I can erase from memory having heard someone use the word ‘crepuscular’.” 28th over: Australia 79-1 (Warner 50, Khawaja 28) Here comes Jimmy, on to replace the excellent Broad (7-1-18-1). Warner touches him for a single to reach a masterful half-century. If you have a spare mortgage, put it on Warner making another SCG hundred. “What was wrong with Johnny Watkins’ debut (22nd over)?” says Rowan Sweeney. “His figures of 6-1-21-0 don’t look terrible...? What am I missing?” I assume there were loads of unpunished full tosses and long hops. 27th over: Australia 78-1 (Warner 49, Khawaja 28) A flighted half-volley from Moeen is driven majestically for four by Warner. Khawaja then survives a big LBW shout after missing a premeditated lap. I thought it was outside the line, though it was close. Replays show it was umpire’s call on point of contact with both the pad and the stumps, so England were right not to review. 26th over: Australia 73-1 (Warner 44, Khawaja 28) Broad bowls a maiden to Khawaja. There have been a few innings in this series when Jimmy Anderson has been underused early in the innings, and this is another: he’s bowled four out of 26 overs so far. 25th over: Australia 73-1 (Warner 44, Khawaja 28) This is an important innings for Khawaja, with the South Africa series in mind. I’d take him regardless, given the nature of the pitches and the challenge. Bancroft and Mitch Marsh are the two who would worry me. Moeen, on for Crane, beats Khawaja with his first ball. 24th over: Australia 70-1 (Warner 44, Khawaja 25) Warner edges Broad this far short of Root at second slip. There was just enough seam movement to take the edge, though Warner did well to soften his hands and ensure it fell short of slip. 23rd over: Australia 69-1 (Warner 44, Khawaja 24) Khawaja bat-pads Crane safely into the leg side. Crane seems to be enjoying himself, which is an achievement in itself. If I was a 20-year-old English legspinner making my Test debut in Australia, enjoyment would be a long way down the list of dominant feelings. 22nd over: Australia 68-1 (Warner 44, Khawaja 23) Broad replaces Moeen (6-2-13-0). There is a very little happening for England, with no sign of swing, reverse swing, seam movement or hope. “After young Crane’s first three balls I thought we were set for a repeat of the Johnny Watkins debut (and only) Test match, against Pakistan in 1973-74,” says Gervase Greene. “To this day the most excruciating two overs I have ever seen in cricket. Not even ‘watch-through-both-set-of-fingers’ stuff. Glad he made it through to the other side. Only other leggies could ever really understand.” Bryce McGain could understand. 21st over: Australia 65-1 (Warner 44, Khawaja 20) Australia are milking the spinners a bit too easily, and England might need to go back to Anderson or Broad pretty soon. Warner defends a nice googly from Crane. 20th over: Australia 61-1 (Warner 41, Khawaja 19) Warner rifles Moeen down the ground, a lovely shot for one. He looks in charge out there, the game being played on his terms. It feels like he’s had a relatively quiet series, yet he’s averaging 71. I suppose that perception is more down to his relatively slow strike-rate of 53, easily his lowest in a home series. 19th over: Australia 58-1 (Warner 39, Khawaja 18) Crane is worked for three singles. He has started promisingly, and has an optimistic LBW appeal turned down when Khawaja pushes forward with bat and pad close together. I’m not sure it hit the pad first; even if it did, it was probably outside the line. 18th over: Australia 55-1 (Warner 37, Khawaja 17) Thanks Adam, hello all. While I ease into the chair, Moeen hurries through an uneventful over; one from it. Warner, who has made hundreds in the last three Sydney Tests, looks ominously set. 17th over: Australia 53-1 (Warner 36, Khawaja 16) Crane’s second over didn’t get a lot of turn, but he’s found his range. Warner down the ground to begin, then a bye, moving the partnership to 50. When Crane drops short there is an audible “oooh” through the press box, but instead of clobbering it the Australian opener punches in front of point for a comfortable two. “He has quite an aggressive run up,” observes Vic Marks on radio. “He’s looked OK. But the margin for error is not huge.” It being drinks, that’s time for me to say goodbye. Rob Smyth with you for the rest of the day. Thanks for your company. New Yorkers: please find a room for John Harrison. I’m off to a text a few mates about that right now. Speak to you again on Sunday. 16th over: Australia 49-1 (Warner 33, Khawaja 16) Moeen returns having switched ends. Khawaja grabs one behind square off his pads early. Warner has a look at a couple before driving the final ball down the ground for a single. I’m sure he will want the strike to get another early bite at Crane before the new man settles in at the bowling crease. 15th over: Australia 47-1 (Warner 32, Khawaja 15) As I’m sure you can tell as astute OBO readers, often you are still very much writing about the previous over when the next is being bowled. Then, I was quite distracted by Mason Crane’s first trundle in Test cricket. He got through it OK, conceding three. But that could have been six from the first ball when dropping short to Khawaja, who elected instead to pull out to the sweeper. Next, he failed to leg the ball go stopping in his approach. Then a misfire down the legside. But well played by the young man finding his way into the over, landing the last few to Warner, who defended him with respect before driving the final delivery through cover for a couple. He’s away. 14th over: Australia 44-1 (Warner 30, Khawaja 14) Warner wants nothing of the 20s, racing through in the space of four Curran deliveries. Four, four, four. Cover drive, fine clip, straight drive. Buckle up, Davey is here. 13th over: Australia 32-1 (Warner 18, Khawaja 14) Been a while since our last dose of Usmania. I miss it. Maybe today? Dances, drives. Beautiful. Moeen’s string of dots broken in the process. And he’s into double figures. 12th over: Australia 26-1 (Warner 17, Khawaja 9) The Richies are singing the national anthem again. Onya, guys. On the field, the Australian pair score from four of Curran’s deliveries - Khawaja driving then flicking then Warner stroking to cover. Both are in decent nick. 11th over: Australia 21-1 (Warner 16, Khawaja 5) Moeen back to back maidens? Including one at David Warner? Is this a dream? Probably not. My last two cricket dreams were enough for one summer. One had me bowling in tandem with Greg Matthews. In the other, I was umpiring my first Test Match. And a good afternoon to my psychologist, if she’s reading on. 10th over: Australia 21-1 (Warner 16, Khawaja 5) Double change, Curran on from the Paddington End. Warner pulls his first offering for a couple. Short again to begin at Warner. Not sure about that. Gets it up later in the set, driven down the ground. He’ll keep the strike. Good statto work here from Ric Finlay. 9th over: Australia 18-1 (Warner 13, Khawaja 5) Moeen Ali gets a jam roll before Mason Crane. Khawaja plays him respectfully. Probably says more about the batsman’s current run of than the bowler’s that he hasn’t immediately gone straight at him as Australia have tended to. A maiden. From Moeen. To begin. As I live and breathe. 8th over: Australia 18-1 (Warner 13, Khawaja 5) Brief wifi saga in the press box. So let’s do this quickly. Khawaja picked up one from Broad through midwicket then Warner a located couple in that general direction as well to finish the set. 7th over: Australia 15-1 (Warner 11, Khawaja 4) Had a great time watching Anderson and Broad in the second dig last week, before the life was sucked out of the game. Shaping up as another good stoush between the two here. The England top dog is relentless, Warner forced to defend throughout. Until the final delivery of the over, which the opener pushes for two through cover. Our Vic Marks on TMS doing his thing. Asked about Bancroft, who has been picked up by his club for the 2018 Championship. “He’s been signed by Somerset as an opening batsman. And he’s just missed a straight one. But I think the chances of him getting a call from Cricket Australia in winter saying he’s required for are now reduced.” Pádraig Collins on the Guardian sports desk in Sydney has an idea for John Harrison. Head into Manhattan and grab yourself a pint here. I still want a bed for him. 6th over: Australia 13-1 (Warner 9, Khawaja 4) Warner’s first boundary of the day isn’t making any highlight packages, an inside edge onto his pad then down to the rope. Broad wins his inside edge a second time in the over. Both England quicks looking the part, Khawaja leaving very close to his off-stump. 5th over: Australia 8-1 (Warner 4, Khawaja 4) Nice. Khawaja unfurls his first proper drive of the day, but without a lot of power. Two down the ground the result. Anderson straight back on it though, beating the left-hander’s bat for the first time. Khawaja respectful thereafter. 4th over: Australia 6-1 (Warner 4, Khawaja 2) Warner looking set nice and early here, hitting mid-off a couple of times with firm drives. Grabs a single to midwicket when Broad is too straight, Khawaja then gets his second run from a push past cover. Here is Robert James Lee Hawke doing his trick, by the way. Gotta say, I liked it better when this wasn’t a made-for-TV annual event. 3rd over: Australia 4-1 (Warner 3, Khawaja 1) Anderson sends down a second maiden, to Khawaja this time. Defends the first five deliveries before leaving the last. Also a big day for Khawaja. 2nd over: Australia 4-1 (Warner 3, Khawaja 1) Bancroft’s Test career may very well be over. Simple as that. I’m not advocating for it to be that way, but after what happened to Renshaw, would anyone be surprised? Khawaja away through midwicket with one. Warner pushes a couple from the middle of the bat. “We (two brits and an Aussie) are stranded at JFK due to the snow,” Oh no!. “Do any OBObers know of a bar in Brooklyn that will be showing the cricket?” Someone help John Harrison, please. “PS do any OBObers in the Brooklyn area also have 3 spare beds for the night?” Surely, surely we can make this work and locate him a Brooklyn bed? First ball from Broad to Bancroft, through the gate and crashing into middle stump! In from over the wicket, full, missing. Broad has 399 Test wickets! 1st over: Australia 0-0 (Bancroft 0, Warner 0) A maiden from Jimmy to Bancroft. Careful in defence. Can’t overstate what a huge day it is for the West Australian. They’ll punt him if he fails, make no mistake. I said I would explain the Bob Hawke thing for UK readers. In short, Australia’s longest serving Labor PM (1983-91) comes to the SCG each year and skols a beer on the big screen. There’s context. In his Oxford days as a Rhodes Scholar, he knocked over a yard glass in world record time. When PM, he said that the feat was more important than any other in getting him into the top job. The players are back on the field. England starting with three slips and a gully for Jimmy. Bancroft is on strike, for perhaps his biggest innings yet as an Australian player. Play. England are dismissed but won the morning, adding 113 for their final five wickets. That’s well above par relative to what we have seen from their bottom half this series. A bit of Smith fielding magic got the home side going, taking a blinding catch at second slip to remove Malan just as the Middlesex man looked a lock for a second Ashes ton. But the opposite was true when Hazlewood and Cummins put down Curran and Moeen in consecutive overs shortly thereafter. Both shocking drops. The latter didn’t last much longer in any case, beaten by a Cummins brute. The former, though, hung around for a very handy 39 at number eight. Broad did likewise at nine, adding 31 in 32 balls, twice clearing the square leg rope as he punished Australia for going too short for too long. It ended in a hurry, but no complaints. They did well. Mix-up, Crane desperately trying to get back to the bowlers’ end with a dive, but Mitch Marsh’s throw to Bancroft is sufficient. England all out. 112th over: England 346-9 (Crane 4, Anderson 0) They crossed, so Crane has the last couple to see off from Lyon. Defends well. Meanwhile, all the chat at the SCG is about Bob Hawke skoling a beer. This is a bit hard to explain to UK readers. I’ll give it a crack at the interval. At last, Australia get the bloke who annoys them more than any other. Lyon wins the top edge, straight in the air, Smith jumps around to complete the catch. 111th over: England 344-8 (Broad 29, Crane 4) Crane does well to keep his nerve in response to a short ball on his body, working it fine for one. Over the wicket Cummins goes now to Broad, and sends a bouncer too high over his head. A wide is called. That’ll annoy the captain. As will Broad having enough time to again swat him across the line, albeit only for one this time. Fuller to Crane, he grabs a couple to midwicket. Neato. “I think these two tests should go down in the annals of Australian cricket as the Butterfingers Brace,” writes Andrew Benton. “What d’you think? The ball’s been pretty slippery for Australia since Perth.” Ric Finlay reports that Australia have put down 11 chances in the series. 110th over: England 339-8 (Broad 28, Crane 1) Lyon to Broad. He’s trying to sweep, unsuccessfully. Then defending. He does make contact sweeping behind square in the air, but Bancroft can’t complete what would have been a spectacular diving catch. About a metre away from it, to be fair. Broad beaten by the last ball of the over. Probably five overs left until the lunch break. 109th over: England 337-8 (Broad 26, Crane 1) Mason Crane is off the mark from his first ball via an inside edge. Just past Bancroft at short leg, but he won’t mind. He’s away in Test cricket. “The cricket is certainly entertaining,” notes the great Jim Maxwell on ABC. Broad has a go as well, down to fine leg off the top edge, they take a single to finish the eventful over. A handy cameo comes to an end with some catching practice for Bancroft at short leg. Straight off the splice of the bat from the Cummins short ball, into the hands without having to move. Well played, Tom Curran. 108th over: England 334-7 (Curran 39, Broad 24) “The Australians haven’t even tried a yorker to use the element of surprise,” notes Simon Katich. They are trying Nathan Lyon, who slows the run rate down at least. Three singles. Broad keeps the strike, so he’ll resume his stoush with Cummins assuming the Aussie quick hasn’t been dragged. 107th over: England 331-7 (Curran 38, Broad 22) Disco Stuart Broad! Cummins is getting rather predicable with the short ball, the England villain able to navigate a slap over mid-on instead of taking on the fielders behind square. Four more for that. But then he decides to take on the catchers, doing it with a smashed pull across the line for a second six! This is fantastic stuff. 106th over: England 320-7 (Curran 38, Broad 11) Marsh to his new Surrey teammate and childhood pal Tom Curran. But just as he did in the previous over, he is more than happy having a crack at the first ball, getting just enough on it through backward point for another boundary. He cops a whack from a shorter one, but keeps going. Awkward singles exchanged later in the over before Curran pulls the last ball with power to the square leg rope. That’s the shot of a top six bat. Ten from the over. Very much England’s morning. Australia have 38 minutes to finish the job before lunch. 105th over: England 310-7 (Curran 29, Broad 10) Ha! Cummins, the meanest quick in all the land, bowls a series of bumpers at Broad. Of course he does. But the Englishman, well aware of what is coming to finish, only goes and nails the most lovely pull shot over square leg and into the crowd! Superb work. At various times during the over it looked like the partnership would be broken, but Broad is coming off a half-century at the MCG and seeing them well. Go you good thing. 104th over: England 300-7 (Curran 28, Broad 1) Mitch Marsh gets a twist for the first time today. Not Starc? Interesting. Curran doesn’t mind, flaying at the first ball in a sign that he doesn’t have much faith in the batting to come. It goes through fourth slip, but only two are in position, so he gets four runs. He pulls safely enough when the short ball comes, giving Broad the strike. He knows it is going at his body as well, so he makes room to slap over square leg to the sweeper. That beings up the England 300. “I think we have entered the entertaining phase of this innings,” says Al Nicholson on ABC radio. “Bloody hell, it’s all go out there” writes Robert Wilson. “Having got my hands on a pre-pub copy of Michael Wolff’s Trump is a Nut book, it took quite a lot to drag me away.” (I want it now). “That bonkers Smith catch did the job beautifully. I’m back in the world of moral rectitude and sledging. Speaking of which, given your political previous life, I’m sure you were always working out who you were most like on The West Wing (Josh is a slam-dunk - though Toby is always in with a chance). That was then and this is now. Can you work out who you are most like in the Trump administration. Does seeing Stephen Miller make you feel all hot and uncomfortable? (I’m Bannon, by the way, mostly because I am currently wearing two tshirts and once read half of that dopey Well of Saints book).” Rich content, as they say. I am returning to this in the innings break when there is less going on. 103rd over: England 294-7 (Curran 23, Broad 0) A fair bit of chat about whether that was the third bouncer at Moeen for the over. Decent point if the umpire already gave the signal for two above shoulder height? Surely he did given that the first two balls of the over were bumpers. Broad is here now, cue the hammed up booing. And nearly gone first ball! Jumping across his crease, he got something on it down to forward short leg, but it falls just out of the reach of Cameron Bancroft. And nearly a repeat next up! Doesn’t make it quite as close to the man under the helmet this time, though. Can be sure that’s exactly what Cummins will go with if he gets another crack at him. Meanwhile, Gary is back on the aesthetic charm (or otherwise) of Lyon’s approach. Excellent short ball from Cummins. Moeen considers leaving, ends up playing with both feet off the ground. The glove is clipped, his innings is over. Beautiful bowling. 102nd over: England 294-6 (Moeen 30, Curran 23) Lyon to Curran. Defending. Better. Then pushing one to mid-off when the spinner gives him the chance. Moeen does likewise to retain the strike. They’ve put on 43. 101st over: England 292-6 (Moeen 29, Curran 22) Cummins short again at Moeen from the get-go after the breather, but he is up to the task, pulling a couple. On reflection, not the most controlled stroke. But there is no fielder there, so play on. Oh gosh, he tries to lift the next short ball over the slips cordon. Thankfully for the left-hander, he didn’t make contact. Can’t let himself nick off here. A couple through cover to finish, which should help with his confidence against the Australian quick. Better. Sorry,” begins Rob Heath. “I won’t have that about Lyon being good to watch. I’ll give you that he delivers a nicely flighted ball with dip and arc and all that baloney, but his “run-up”, with one-and-a-half steps of running suddenly switching into a brisk walk and then back to running again, and the ridiculous windmilling of his elbows and knees immediately prior to delivery, are the most infuriating things to watch. Every single time, you think “surely he’s not going to do all that again” But he does!” Your move, Gary Naylor. 100th over: England 288-6 (Moeen 25, Curran 22) Moeen pushes to midwicket. He’s been good through that region off both pace and spin so far this morning. He’s made it to the drinks break. Not for nothing after the series he has had. Enjoy that drink. I’ll grab one too. Back in a tic. 99th over: England 287-6 (Moeen 24, Curran 22) ANOTHER DROPPED CATCH! Hazlewood this time! Top edge from Moeen to Cummins’ first ball. Maybe it serves him right after the chance he put down in the previous over. But still, goodness me. Hazlewood was running around from mid-on to midwicket. He wouldn’t have seen an easier catch in his days as an Australian player. Both England players dropped inside five balls. One brilliant chance taken by Smith, then two of the most basic put down. Curran’s now on strike, getting one to midwicket. Predicably, Cummins is back upstairs to Moeen to finish off. He grabs one off the back foot. Good batting. Scenes! “Difficult to judge the value of England’s first innings without prior knowledge of Steve Smith’s score,” writes Brian Withington. “Less than a ton for him and 300 might be very sporting. More than 150 and the same may start looking distinctly anaemic. Please pass the blood transfusion bottle, nurse.” Bit like that, isn’t it? 98th over: England 284-6 (Moeen 22, Curran 21) DROPPED CATCH! Cummins! You don’t see that. I’ve never seen him drop a catch! At mid-on, catching practice from Curran. Lyon should be in the book, but isn’t. How has he put that down? Chris Rogers cannot believe it on the radio. “You would back him to take that 100 times in 100.” Wow. Curran survives. Maiden. 97th over: England 284-6 (Moeen 22, Curran 21) Handy little stand between these two now, both players into the 20s with four balls scored from in the Hazlewood over. Moeen nudged fine, Curran hooked, Moeen on the drive for a couple. Continuing to swing the bat hard, Moeen gets a fat edge that runs through the cordon and down to the rope. Nothing pretty about it, but they’ve collected eight from the set. That’ll do. 96th over: England 276-6 (Moeen 15, Curran 20) Curran is having a lovely time! Down the track and lashing Lyon through cover for a third boundary. There are risks involved to play this way, but he’s up to 20 by the end of the over when cutting a couple more. By the standards of England players at number eight across this series, 20 is more than ample. Oh, hang on. He’s nearly ran out last ball. By Paine. He’s edged onto the pad and doesn’t ground his bat immediately. Gee, he’s lucky there. Drops his blade just over the line just in time. Concentrate! The first hour complete. England have probably won it, given the locals were operating witih the second new ball. No Cummins yet. Hmmm. John Starbuck again, on Lyon. “Gary Naylor is correct as usual, in that most really good bowlers, particularly spinners, only become so in retrospect. It’s a wonderful opportunity for humblebrags, with batsmen who faced whoever-it-is saying how difficult he was to pick, how so many of their partners he got, while ‘I was fortunate enough to get a few fifties/centuries against him but he caused problems all the way, you could never settle’. Humbug.” I remember facing Lyon in the nets quite a bit when he was 21 and club captain at Wests in Canberra. It wasn’t the spin that made me look foolish, but the drop. If cricket doesn’t work out for him later in life, he should go into the DJing caper. 95th over: England 270-6 (Moeen 15, Curran 14) Flashy! Curran drives Hazlewood on up and through the covers but only just wide of Jackson Bird who is on for Warner. For the briefest moment it looked liked his dive would be enough, but missed by about a foot. “I’m not sure about this approach,” says Ali Mitchell on the radio. He looks much better when playing the same stroke along the ground later in the over. Then keeps the strike with a clip through midwicket. “It’s a strange old innings,” adds Dirk Nannes. 94th over: England 263-6 (Moeen 15, Curran 7) The Richies have their first sing of the day, rolling out their tune about Nathan Lyon. That’s all I’ll say about them for now. The focus of their attention finds Curran’s inside edge for a second time. A big chance to go through his gate, tossing it up to encourage that mode of dismissal. The new man cuts when the spinner drops short. That’s better. Moeen defends the rest. 93rd over: England 262-6 (Moeen 15, Curran 6) Josh Hazlewood to replace Starc. Sure enough, a maiden to begin to Moeen. But with a focus on peppering Moeen’s body rather than his off-stump channel. Hits him on the side at one stage. A couple of bouncers in there too. Softening the left-hander up for Lyon? Something like that. John Starbuck is having a decent old frolic on Mason Crane’s name on the email, continuing the chat that Geoff had going as the rain fell yesterday morning. “Further to yesterday’s conjuring with Mason Crane’s name as a mortar hoist, a few others. Alastair Cook - Still on the building site, he’s the one instructed to add fresh bacon sandwiches (from an oil-drum barbie) to the tea brewing. Mark Stoneman - A gargoyle designer. Vince - add two strokes for a Shepherd’s Pie. Joe Root - Quasi-professional folk singer (or bluesman, given this series so far). Dawid Malan - no idea, but sounds a but like yachting technicals. Jonny Bairstow - keeper of wild animals. Moeen Ali - Narrow lane for storing garden equipment. Curran, T. - Purveyor of exotic eastern refreshments. Stuart Broad - Lascivious minor royal. Jimmy Anderson - narrow boat lift engineer/lives in a tin hut.Mark Wood - reserve scorer.” 92nd over: England 262-6 (Moeen 15, Curran 6) Curran looks in control on the front foot to begin, down the ground for one. Moeen does likewise, dancing to the pitch of the ball. Dragging his length back a bit, the spinner rips one at the right-handed Curran, beating him on the inside edge. Close call. Then finds the inside edge with one that also rags. “Lyon is getting more turn this morning,” says Dirk Nannes on ABC. Sure is. 91st over: England 260-6 (Moeen 14, Curran 5) Starc to Moeen. Again gets off the mark first ball. Dare I say it, he’s looking alright. Pulling on this occasion, along the carpet. Curran helps one in that direction too, albeit off his thigh pad. Moeen a thrid run from the over off the pads. Pace has improved this morning, but Starc’s line is far from consistent. Curran wants nothing to do with a bumper later in the set, but is happy to drive through cover for one to retain the strike. 90th over: England 256-6 (Moeen 12, Curran 4) Lyon to Moeen. He’s wide to begin, allowing a single to be cut through point from the man who has been his best buddy throughout the series. Curran looks far from comfortable from there, looking to score but doing so awkwardly. In saying that, he defends the last couple of balls solidly. That’ll be good for the confidence. A fair few nerves, presumably. 89th over: England 255-6 (Moeen 11, Curran 4) Curran elevated to no. 8. Massive job ahead of the man playing his second Test. And he’s slashing at Starc first ball, past point for four! Have that! Then nearly bowled next ball, Starc too quick. Haven’t had the chance to say that too often in this innings. Just got his bat down in time. Neglected to add, Moeen edged before the wicket earlier in the over, to the rope through the cordon. That pushed England above 250. “There’s no reason why 270 or so shouldn’t be a significant first innings score,” adds Adam Hirst in response to John Starbuck. Droll. Meanwhile, how about that snaffle... pop it on loop. WHAT A CATCH! WHAT A CATCH! Starc finds Malan’s edge, the left-hander stuck on the crease, but this is all about Steve Smith. Diving with his left hand low, snaffles it an inch from the ground. “One of the best catches he will ever take,” says Simon Katich on the radio. Sure was. Will dig out the vision right away. 88th over: England 244-5 (Malan 62, Moeen 4) Nathan “Nathan” Lyon into the attack for the first time today. Finds Moeen’s edge first ball, but safely to ground, a single taken. Malan more convincing, driving gracefully off the front foot through cover for his first boundary of the day. That’s a super shot. Nearly another edge to end the over, Malan beaten with a nothing shot off the back foot. Eventful start for the tweaker. 87th over: England 239-5 (Malan 58, Moeen 3) Moeen’s third run off the pads, Starc obliging with the first ball of his new over. Another on Malan’s feet too, slipping down. Poor start from the Australian attack leader. Malan then gets a chance to cut, but Khawaja does wonderfully to make the stop at backward point. Was another ball that deserved punishment. He then gets a couple down the ground, leaning on a drive. Busy over. Had looked at home in the top flight throughout the series. Good on him. “There’s no reason why 300 or so shouldn’t be a significant first innings score,” suggests my man Johnny Starbuck. “We’ve grown so used to the 400-500+ that we forget how a relatively low-scoring games can be one of the best. The pitch, the mood and experience of the bowlers, the catches dropped or taken, the idiocy of the batsmen all pay a part.” 86th over: England 236-5 (Malan 56, Moeen 2) Had a couple of colleagues inform me that THREE TIME Hawthorn Premiership player Josh Gibson is in the press box. No idea why, but welcome along you Golden God Bird. Distracted me from Big Josh’s over, if I’m honest. Malan did take one down the ground to get his day going. Moeen didn’t need his bat until Hazlewood misdirected onto his pads, clipping his second run. Sedate start from him compared to last week in Melbourne. “Starc won’t get Ali out with the new ball,” emails Yum. “He’s saving himself for Lyon.” 85th over: England 234-5 (Malan 55, Moeen 1) Starc really isn’t penetrating. A third ball on the trot down the legside to begin. Then finds his line to Moeen, if not quite his length. A bouncer blows out the cobwebs, maybe. Not a lot going on from the Randwick End. Maiden. 84th over: England 234-5 (Malan 55, Moeen 1) Malan has Hazlewood zipping it away from him then back at his pads, an inside edge located in the process. Then a really good leave just north of his off-stump. It encourages the quick to change direction from round the wicket. Malan defends then shoulders arms. Good early scrap. Maiden. A lot of chat on my twitter feed about Cummins v Rabada come March in South Africa across four Test Matches. Cannot wait for that. I’ll be there throughout, so we can continue this OBO discussion for months on end. Wouldn’t have it any other way. “So another fascinating day ahead of us,” emails Peter Rowntree. “First up can Mo do anything to start to salvage what looks to be a failing Test career? Then we will also have Mason Crane’s first Test innings to study. Many jokes about Mason’s name on here yesterday - but surely this classic beats all.” 83rd over: England 234-5 (Malan 55, Moeen 1) Pedestrian start by Starc standards, his first three deliveries comfortably below 140kph. Watchful Moeen. Sprays the last couple well down the legside. A maiden, but a wasted over with the second new ball. Yesterday, CricViz calculated for me that it was the slowest that the left-armer has ever bowled on average in a Test played in Australia. Is he fit? Not an unreasonable query. 82nd over: England 234-5 (Malan 55, Moeen 1) Good start from Moeen, clipping a single to the first ball of the day. One to come in the over, sprayed down the legside. Also liked this last night from Phil Walker at Wisden, especially the Volvo line. Fine point on Cummins. “He’ll only be the best when commentators stop pronouncing his surname with a ‘g’ at the end,” tweets Geoff Foley. WILL IT EVER END? As a radio commentator myself, I know well the risk of repeating a name wrongly time and again. Can be difficult to adjust once you have it in your muscle memory. But this one makes no sense. Anyway, the players are on the field, so we can worry about that later. Josh Hazlewood to complete his over, Moeen Ali to face his first ball. Buckle up. This could be a loose first half an hour. Righto, upstairs now. Quite the mission. But I can confirm that it is sparkling day in the harbour city. Not a cloud, not that hot. Perfect for leather versus willow. Nathan Early with the early mail to get us going. “I reckon we’ll learn a bunch about Root The Captain with his handling of Mason Crane later today,” he wrties. “Don’t hook him after 4-0-32-0.” From our parish more often than not, but writing next door at the moment, Will Mac did a lovely bit on the leggie ahead of the Test. What a day for Mason. I also enjoyed Ali Martin’s intro last night. We spent far too much time trying to find the Yabba statue with the binoculars. Worth it in the end. On what the famous sledger may have said to James Vince when he nicked off yesterday afternoon. Morning, trendsetters. So what will it be? England’s more garden-variety botching, where they end up all out 300? Or the more catastrophic version, the last seven wickets falling for 30 odd? Either way, they stuffed a decent enough day in the space of 10 deliveries last night. That’s where we resume in about half an hour from now at the SCG. Don’t change, England. Don’t change. I was pretty excited about Pat Cummins last night, so that’s where I’ll direct you to begin. The bloke we spend every other moment discussing when he should take a rest. But he’s now bowled more deliveries than any other Australian seamer in the series. 1038 to be precise. And some fine ones along the way, getting Australia going yesterday. Will he finish the year as the best quick in the world? I think so. As you have probably realised due to the name at the top of the page, it is Adam Collins with you for the first half of the day before I tag the mighty Rob Smyth. I’m currently typing from the gutter next to the Members Gate, so I better nip upstairs. But let’s chat. All day long. Email or twitter, you know how it works by now. Adam will be here shortly. Meanwhile, read Ali Martin on another maddening innings by England batsman James Vince. One wonders what Yabba would have come up with for James Vince, a touring batsman with the inbuilt capacity to both delight and infuriate in equal measure, and never more so than on the opening day of this fifth Ashes Test. For 82 minutes at the crease Vince looked the part as he so often does, dispatching the bad balls like Jardine versus the local insect population en route to a 25 that can be added to the list of magnificent yet maddening innings."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/feb/02/not-one-for-meaningless-sexual-encounters-bisexual-man","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-02T10:00:26Z","webTitle":"My life in sex: ‘Graduating from women to men wasn’t a big deal'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/feb/02/not-one-for-meaningless-sexual-encounters-bisexual-man","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/feb/02/not-one-for-meaningless-sexual-encounters-bisexual-man","fields":{"headline":"My life in sex: ‘Graduating from women to men wasn’t a big deal'","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"I came out as bisexual at 22, which really wasn’t a big deal for me, though it did surprise everyone who knew me. Five years and very few sexual partners later, I feel as if I may as well leave aside the part of me that’s interested in women; I’m only confusing myself by thinking I’m equally interested in them. I grew up thinking I was straight. But looking back at my adolescence, I see now that several of my close male friendships were crushes, and my interest in girls was just something I assumed rather than really felt. As far as I was aware, other boys felt towards each other the way I did towards them. Graduating from women to men sexually wasn’t a big deal. By the time I finally hooked up with a guy, I knew I had wanted it for so long. I’m not one for meaningless sexual encounters, which means I have far less sex than a lot of single people. Still, the partners I have had over the last few years I have mostly met through Tinder. I’d like to go to more LGBT bars, but I’ve never found anyone to go with. I’ve had a few nice relationships and some good sex, though I would describe the sex as fun rather than intense. I need an emotional connection, but it doesn’t need to be deep: I just have to like them a bit. I’ve relocated every 10 or 12 months for the last few years, leaving no real chance to seek out a serious partner. I was OK with that at 24, but not any more. I felt especially lonely last year.

I wish that David Lodge, a James aficionado, had heeded the latter part of that dictum when he was planning Writer’s Luck, the second volume of a memoir that began with Quite a Good Time to Be Born (2015). This book presents a writer who simply has no clue as to what he should leave out, or how to compress a narrative for the sake of pace. In his acknowledgements he thanks his agent, editor and others for their help, though evidently none of them troubled to tell him his book needed serious pruning. The wonder of it is that Lodge, an award-winning novelist, literary critic and professor, has such an eye for the untelling anecdote, the irrelevant detail. The warning signs are there early on when he methodically records his children’s O and A-level results, class of degree and subsequent career, as if he’s writing a round-robin Christmas card to some distant acquaintance. Family is important to him, and elsewhere he writes movingly about his third child, Christopher, born with Down’s syndrome, and about tending an ailing aunt who lived in Honolulu – he suffered bad sunburn while out there, “especially on the back of my legs”. He keeps losing the reader’s goodwill by the pointless indulgence of his accounts. From his mother he appears to have inherited an anxious and despondent nature. A good deal of the book is coloured by a mood of prickly, thin-skinned self-justification, not unusual in a writer but pretty lowering at close quarters. When Paul Theroux writes a disobliging review of How Far Can You Go? Lodge does what he often seems to do – fires off a furious letter to the offending paper (here, the New York Times). When he receives great reviews in the US for his next novel Small World he quotes them triumphantly – needily. His approach to the craft of fiction is, like everything else, meticulous, and he marks up very precisely the links between his academic itineraries and what ended up in the books, or didn’t. On a trip to Korea “there was nothing I observed that rang any bells with the themes and motifs of my novel”, though he admits the country was “not uninteresting”. Likewise, Pearl Harbor was “extremely interesting”, but “not relevant to my novel”. At a university conference in Victoria, Canada, he is disappointed by the breakfast arrangements (“no bread, only muffins”), while in Wellington, New Zealand, his hotel room was so “poorly designed and furnished” that he found his depression returning. And so, ploddingly, on. Truthfully – vulgarly – my hopes for this book rather focused on the tittle-tattle its author had accumulated in 60-odd years of the literary life. And to an extent he delivers, even if the gossip is hedged about with his personal grievances and remembered slights. His experience as chairman of the judging panel for the 1989 Booker prize is revealing: he was unhappy with the choice of judges, and felt he “mismanaged” the whole thing by not getting Martin Amis’s London Fields on the shortlist, blocked by two female judges (Helen McNeil and Maggie Gee) who deplored its “sexism”. Indeed, the chairing of the prize so dispirited him that he sought help from a counsellor specialising in stress. He is decent enough to admit that his wife Mary – a sane but shadowy figure in this narrative – advised him against it from the start. As the titles of both memoirs indicate, Lodge knows he has been blessed (“Few writers can have had such luck”) by opportunities and remuneration that are vanishingly unlikely in today’s world. And yet so much of his reminiscing is clouded with woe. After his own Booker-shortlisted disappointments in 1984 and 1988 he did win a Sunday Express prize for Nice Work – a 20 grand purse, no less – but this delight too is crimped when he is told at the award ceremony not to make a speech. While his flashes of vulnerability may soften the reader’s heart towards him, they are scant illumination amid the pedantry, the prolixity and the general moaning. Bizarrely, he attributes the failure of the TV adaptation of Small World partly to the fact that none of the cast had been to university – which is like saying that Dunkirk is a failure because none of the cast has been to war. At times I wondered whether the author had adopted an alter ego. Is he trying to hide his real self? He has certainly succeeded in hiding the nimble, accomplished comic novelist whose books I thrilled to in my younger years – The British Museum Is Falling Down, Changing Places, How Far Can You Go?, Nice Work, and even later ones such as Therapy and Thinks … But this idea of self-concealment in the end fails to persuade, for no one would choose to write something as grindingly Pooterish as this, even for fun. Somerset Maugham once advised: “A good rule for writers: do not explain overmuch.” And give the reader some room to think. Writer’s Luck is not the most insufferable memoir I’ve read from this literary generation – that would have to be Frederic Raphael’s Going Up. But it is insufferable. • Writer’s Luck is published by Hrvill Secker. To order a copy for @21.25 (RRP £25) go to guardianbookshop.com or call 0330 333 6846.

According to data from the Kennel Club, registrations of squashed-faced, or brachycephalic, breeds have shot up in recent years: while just 692 French bulldogs were registered in 2007, registrations reached 21,470 in 2016. Certain DNA variations in dogs are linked to a short skull shape. The animals’ baby-like faces with large, round, wide-set eyes and flat noses are known to be a key factor in why owners choose such breeds: over time those traits have been bred for, and in some cases have been taken to extremes. This selective breeding and prioritising appearance over health has left the breeds prone to skin disorders, eye ulcers and breathing difficulties among other problems. Now the British Veterinary Association (BVA) has launched a campaign dubbed #breedtobreathe to draw attention to the issues, revealing that a new survey of 671 vets found 75% of owners were unaware of the health problems of brachycephalic breeds before they chose their squashed-faced dog. Moreover the vets said just 10% of owners could spot health problems related to such breeds, with many thinking that problems including snorting were “normal” for such dogs. The survey also revealed that 49% of vets thought advertising and social media were among the reasons behind the surge in ownership of these dogs, while 43% said celebrity ownership was one of the driving factors. “We find that our veterinary surgeons are finding increasing numbers of flat-faced dogs are coming into their practices with problems which are related to the way these animals are made,” said John Fishwick, president of the BVA. “One of the things that is causing this increase that we have seen over the last few years appears to be celebrity endorsements and their use in advertising.” Among those criticised by the BVA are pop star Lady Gaga, who is often photographed with her French bulldogs, and YouTube star Zoella, whose pug features in her videos. Big brands are also targeted; the organisation revealed that Heinz, Costa and Halifax have all agreed to avoid using squashed-faced dogs in future advertising. The BVA is urging people to send letters to brands asking them not to use such dogs in promotional material. The campaign also aims to raise awareness of potential health problems of squashed-face breeds, and stresses the need for vets, owners, dog-show judges, breeders, researchers and others to work together to make sure the breeds are healthy. “They are lovely breeds of dog, they are very friendly and they make good pets,” said Fishwick. “The problem is a lot of them are really struggling, and we really want to make sure people understand this and encourage them to think about either going for another breed or a healthier version of these breeds – ones which have been bred to have a longer snout … or possibly even cross breeds.” The BVA warned that without action, the number of corrective surgeries needed on such animals will soar. Caroline Kisko, secretary of the Kennel Club urged owners to do their homework before buying a squashed-faced dog. “As soon as you get a market drive then the puppy farms just say ‘ooh we’ll breed those now,’” she said. But Dr Rowena Packer of the Royal Veterinary College (RVC) said the problem is not confined to new owners, with recent research from the RVC finding that more than 90% of pug, French bulldog and English bulldog owners said they would own another such dog in the future. “It is not just going to be a flash in the pan that we see this huge surge and then it goes away,” she said. It has been suggested that vets may be unwilling to speak out for fear that owners will simply take their pets elsewhere, damaging business. But Packer disagrees, saying: “I don’t think any vet went into [the job] hoping that their salary would be paid by the suffering of dogs who have been bred to effectively have problems.” Dr Crina Dragu, a London-based veterinary surgeon, noted that not all squashed-faced dogs have problems. “You see the ones that have happy lives, normal lives, and you see the ones that the minute they are born they spend their entire lives as though [they are being smothered] with a pillow all day, every day,” she said. Packer said prospective owners should be aware squashed-faced dogs can be an expensive commitment: “I think they need to be aware of both the emotional and financial hardship that they could be putting themselves and their dogs through for potentially five to 10 years.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"artanddesign/2018/jan/05/art-weekly-yorkshire-sculpture-park-peter-doig-tracey-emin","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-05T14:58:28Z","webTitle":"Yorkshire revolts and Doig paints a cracking Caribbean dreamworld – the week in art","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/jan/05/art-weekly-yorkshire-sculpture-park-peter-doig-tracey-emin","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2018/jan/05/art-weekly-yorkshire-sculpture-park-peter-doig-tracey-emin","fields":{"headline":"Yorkshire revolts and Doig paints a cracking Caribbean dreamworld – the week in art","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Exhibition of the week Revolt and Revolution Protest art from the Arts Council collection brings a radical start to the year on the rolling dales of Britain’s grandest sculpture park. • Yorkshire Sculpture Park from 6 January until 15 April.

Masterpiece of the Week El Médico (The Doctor), 1779, Francisco de Goya This is one of the great images of winter. Goya may even have intended it as an allegory of the season, for it is a design for a tapestry to hang in the Spanish royal palace El Pardo, part of a series of such designs that were his first major commissions. The young Goya’s brightly coloured tapestry designs rejoice in (apparently) simple evocations of seasonal fun and festivals, like this portrayal of a country doctor warming his hands over a dish of hot coals while his two students huddle by him in the bleak midwinter. The fiery red of the doctor’s cloak contrasts brilliantly with a stark leafless tree behind him, while warm russet faces look out of the picture with a glow of winter cheer. This is an optimistic painting. It is not only an evocation of winter but of reason. Goya believed fervently in the scientific ideals of the European Enlightenment, which held that education and technology could improve life. When he painted this early work there were real hopes of the Enlightenment spreading to Spain. This doctor can stand the cold because he is warmed by reason, in the shape of the medical books that lie open in front of him. Goya would later see reason destroyed by war and smothered by superstition but in this heartwarming work he expresses his hope for humanity. • Scottish National Gallery, Edinburgh.

As details from Fire and Fury, Michael Wolff’s book, poured out, hearing Bannon describe Trump’s son as “treasonous” and daughter Ivanka as “dumb as a brick” was deeply satisfying. But it also triggered an uncomfortable response: some small surge of identification with the man. A ping of gratitude that took a second to squash, once I remembered who it was who was speaking. Bannon’s power is still real. He may have been fired from the White House and fallen foul of some of Trump’s supporters (Don Jr’s tweet on Wednesday drew attention to that barometer of national opinion, the comments section on Breitbart, with the observation, “When Bannon has lost Breitbart, he’s left with … umm, nothing”), but the nationalist project he spearheaded has hardly gone away, and what pleasure there might have been in watching him turn on his former master was undercut by a sense of the threat Bannon continues to pose. Still, his remarks had about them that shocking, Bulworth-quality of unsayable truth that Trump himself sometimes inadvertently strays into. One of the oddest things about this presidency has been the way in which it marries bald falsehood with bald truth – if one takes the president’s unfiltered brain guff to be a kind of verisimilitude. The bizarreness of the “my button’s bigger than your button” exchange between Trump and the North Koreans this week literalised a time-old assumption that war, or threats of war, act as proxies for challenged masculinity; and for all its crassness and political risk, there was something extraordinary about watching this made explicit. Clearly, mistaking rudeness for honesty doesn’t lead anywhere good – it’s led to President Trump – but it does remind one of where Trump’s appeal lies. He is like the Jim Carrey figure in Liar Liar, whose punishment for being an evil lawyer is that he can’t tell a lie for 24 hours, and says monstrous things to everyone he loves. In the movie, he learns a valuable lesson about kindness and decorum. For Bannon, Trump and their gang, one assumes no such denouement awaits. A world of glorious words Simpler pleasures came in the form of some little-known weather terms this week, ahead of the kind of big weather the Americans do so well. I still get a thrill from “thunder snow”, which sounds like it should line up beside Lion-O and Panthro before going off to fight Mumm-Ra. As winter storms swept the eastern seaboard, the media talked of “bombogenesis”, in which “a rapid deepening of pressure creates an explosive strengthening of the storm”, or as the National Ocean Service put it, “a mid-latitude cyclone rapidly intensifies, dropping at least 24 millibars over 24 hours.” Like areas of the shipping forecast, these terms have a quality that soothes on the basis of their obscurity; there are things in this world you and I may not understand, but rest assured someone does. The mesoscale convective complex, the positive vorticity advection, and, for simplicity, the polar vortex, all carry with them the absolving idea of systems bigger than we are, and over which we have no control but the power to name. Music to my ears I’m not susceptible to diet or exercise resolutions at New Year, but I often fall for the other great cliche of 1 January: strenuous cultural improvement. For the past few days I’ve switched from news radio in the morning to WQXR, New York’s classical music station, and I’m convinced my household is in a better mood for it. Before 9am we hear nothing of Trump, or Bannon, or taxes, or disaster. Instead, a nice man with a soothing voice tells us about things that happened in the 18th century, or when things get really racy, the 19th. It’s blissful, and the start of a whole new me. I’m going to read a book about Shostakovich. I am.

Iryna Nozdrovska’s body was discovered in a river by a passerby in a northern Kiev suburb on 1 January. The 38-year-old lawyer, who had been reported missing on 29 December, had suffered multiple stab wounds, according to reports. “There was such anger, such hatred [in the attack],” her daughter, Anastasiya, told Ukrainian media. The Ukrainian foreign minister, Pavlo Klimkin, has described the murder as a “challenge to the state” and the case as “a test of our society’s ability to protect female activists and to ensure justice as a whole”. The US embassy in Ukraine expressed shock over the killing and said those responsible for Nozdrovska’s death must be brought to justice. Nozdrovska disappeared just two days after she had helped block the release from prison of Dmytro Rossoshansky, the nephew of an influential judge. Rossoshansky was jailed in May for seven years for running down and killing Nozdrovska’s sister, Svitlana Sapatanyska, in his car while under the influence of drugs and alcohol in September 2015. Rossoshansky’s application for an amnesty after serving eight months of his sentence was rejected on 27 December by a court in Kiev. Nozdrovska had headed a public campaign to raise awareness of the case. Nozdrovska received numerous death threats both before and after May’s trial, as well as during December’s appeal hearing. Her daughter was also assaulted by unknown assailants in 2016 in an attack that Nozdrovska said was intended to warn her to drop the case.Police say a special team has been set up to investigate Nozdrovska’s death, and officers are reportedly examining a possible link with the Rossoshansky case. The Rossoshansky family have not commented on the case. Hundreds of people rallied outside a police headquarters in Kiev on 2 January to demand justice for Nozdrovska and call for the resignation of the interior minister, Arsen Avakov. The authorities’ response to Nozdrovska’s killing is being watched closely by supporters of the 2014 Maidan revolution, whose goals included eradicating the corruption and nepotism that has plagued post-Soviet Ukraine. “People have seen very many recent cases where criminals, killers, have been freed by corrupt courts. This makes people very angry. They are asking: where is justice?” said Mustafa Nayyem, an MP who was a leading figure during the Maidan protests. “People have very little faith in law enforcement agencies right now. This case is a concrete test of the ideas of Maidan.” Mikheil Saakashvili, the former Georgian president turned Ukrainian opposition figure, said Nozdrovska was killed by a “criminal system”. Nozdrovska’s death came after she had publicly celebrated the court’s decision to deny Rossoshansky’s early release, and thanked supporters. “The rest of my life, whatever time I have left to live, won’t be enough to thank you all,” she wrote on Facebook two days before she vanished."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2018/jan/04/hollywood-diversity-sees-no-improvement-in-2017-report-finds","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-04T17:31:05Z","webTitle":"One female director for every 22 men: Hollywood's stark diversity problem","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/jan/04/hollywood-diversity-sees-no-improvement-in-2017-report-finds","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/jan/04/hollywood-diversity-sees-no-improvement-in-2017-report-finds","fields":{"headline":"One female director for every 22 men: Hollywood's stark diversity problem","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The film industry has had momentous upheavals over the last 12 months, but an annual diversity survey has found that the US movie industry is no more diverse than it was a decade ago, and “there was no meaningful or sustained change in 2017” for female, black or Asian directors in Hollywood. The report, commissioned by the University of Southern California’s Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism, surveyed 1,100 films made in the last 11 years, and found that just 4% were directed by women – which equates to 22 male directors hired for every woman. The study found that female directors typically had shorter careers. On average they started later and ended earlier than those of men, and 83.7% of women never directed a second movie, as opposed to 55.3% of men. Women were more likely to face a “fiscal cliff”, finding it significantly harder to graduate from independent, low-budget features and television to higher-grossing movies. Furthermore, just 5.2% of all directors – male and female – were black or African American, and 3.2% were Asian. Of the 43 female directors who made movies between 2007 and 2017, four have been black, two Asian and one Hispanic (Mexico’s Patricia Riggen, director of Chilean mining disaster dramatisation The 33). “Hollywood’s ‘female director problem’ has been the source of much dialogue over the past several years,” says the report’s author, Stacy L Smith. “The evidence reveals that despite the increased attention, there has been no change for women behind the camera. Mere conversation is not the answer to these problems – and the time for conversation is up. Until major media companies take concrete steps to address the biases that impede hiring, nothing will change.” The findings will disappoint those hopeful for change in the film industry, after a year marked by dramatic revelations of sexual predation and harassment, and the subsequent #MeToo social media campaign. It appears these developments have yet to make an appreciable impact on the industry’s power structures. “Some of the largest media companies in the world continue to underperform when it comes to hiring diverse directors and that inequality begins at the top,” the report states. More than 82% of senior executives at the seven top media companies were male, the survey found, and of the women, a mere four were from underrepresented racial/ethnic groups. On the directors’ boards, under 20% of positions were filled by women, and four of the seven companies – 21st Century Fox, Sony, Comcast (parent company of Universal) and Lionsgate – had only one woman on their boards. The report warns of a potentially damaging disconnect between progress on diversity in the industry and public sentiment. “Consumers have voted with their dollars in extraordinary ways this year, propelling films like Wonder Woman and Beauty and the Beast to the top of the box office charts,” it states. “They have also turned away from film and to other platforms and different content to fulfil entertainment needs – issuing a strong warning to the film industry that business as usual is simply unacceptable.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2018/jan/04/daring-doges-palace-jewel-theft-police-expert-help-venice","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-04T15:20:48Z","webTitle":"Daring Doge's Palace jewel theft forces police to seek expert help","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jan/04/daring-doges-palace-jewel-theft-police-expert-help-venice","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jan/04/daring-doges-palace-jewel-theft-police-expert-help-venice","fields":{"headline":"Daring Doge's Palace jewel theft forces police to seek expert help","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Italian police are trying to piece together how two audacious thieves stole millions of pounds of jewellery from a reinforced case at the Doge’s Palace in Venice before blending into crowds and making their escape. The pair made off with earrings and a brooch owned by a member of Qatar’s royal family on the final day of the four-month Treasures of the Mughals and the Maharajahs exhibition, which brought together a collection of five centuries of Indian craftsmanship. Local police have called on the help of experts in Rome to try to establish how the pair managed to pull off the meticulously planned theft early on Wednesday, which involved deactivating an alarm system. The alarm was only raised several hours later at Palazzo Ducale in St Mark’s Square. Marco Odorisio, the police chief, said he suspected the thieves had previously scoped out the vast premises of the palace, which was once the residence of the former republic of Venice’s doges (rulers) and now attracts up to 4,000 visitors a day, before seizing their moment. The declared value of the stolen items on customs forms was about €30,000 (£27,000), but police sources told Italian media they were probably worth millions. “It was probably not an impromptu gesture,” Odorisio said. “The cases were supposed to be inaccessible and for this reason we need to understand the weaknesses [in the security system] in order to establish how they were able to commit the theft.” One weakness could be the case, which was provided by the show’s Qatari curators. Vito Gagliardi, the chief police commissioner, said the case had been opened “as if it was a tin can”. “We are clearly dealing here with two skilled professionals who managed to pull off their feat despite all the display rooms being fitted with a … highly sophisticated [alarm] system,” he said. The al-Thani collection comprises 270 pieces of Indian and Indian-inspired jewellery and precious stones, spanning 400 years from the Mughal period to the present. It was assembled by Sheikh Hamad bin Abdullah al-Thani. The exhibition was due to close on Wednesday, the latest stop in a tour that has brought the collection to the Grand Palais in Paris, the V&amp;A in London, the Metropolitan in New York and the Miho Museum near Kyoto, Japan. A source working for the authority that manages museums across Venice said cutbacks in security had left the city’s cultural heritage vulnerable. “This particular collection of jewels was delicious for the thieves. They waited for the very last day, which was the perfect time to act,” the source said. “But it is something that could happen every day in every museum in Venice, as security is lacking. Yes, we have all the devices and systems in place, but security has been compromised in recent years. Staff are under lots of pressure, but we need stronger vigilance.” Marco Gasparinetti, who runs a residents’ group in Venice, suggested the thieves might have been inspired by Vincenzo Pipino, the only other person to have successfully pulled off a Doge’s Palace heist, in 1991. Pipino, 74, nicknamed “the gentleman thief”, was jailed for 25 years for 3,000 art thefts across Venice. “He was a kind of genius, always able to find his way into the most secure properties,” Gasparinetti said. “What happened on Wednesday required a deep knowledge of the palace and security measures. It was similar to a Pipino performance – no violence, very discrete and successful.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jan/04/donald-trump-tweets-iran-protesters-sanctions","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-04T16:06:33Z","webTitle":"How Donald Trump’s tweets help Iran’s supreme leader | Sanam Vakil","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jan/04/donald-trump-tweets-iran-protesters-sanctions","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/jan/04/donald-trump-tweets-iran-protesters-sanctions","fields":{"headline":"How Donald Trump’s tweets help Iran’s supreme leader","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Since the beginning of the Iran protests last week, Donald Trump has taken to Twitter to lend his support to Iranian demonstrators who engaged in days of nationwide protests criticising the regime for rising prices, economic mismanagement, corruption and its regional foreign policy. In a series of tweets, Trump has called on the Iranian government to “respect people’s rights”, allow free expression and stop restricting the internet and social media, warning that “the world is watching” and that it is “time for a change”. Trump sees these statements as demonstration of a robust new policy designed to curtail Tehran’s malign influence throughout the Middle East. What he fails to realise is that these strong messages of support for protesters coupled with policy shifts and increasing rounds of sanctions are just what the Islamic Republic needs to deflect attention from domestic protests. This diversionary strategy is not new but rather part of the Islamic Republic’s classic response to crises. Through these messages, Trump has sought to present himself in stark contrast to his predecessor, Barack Obama, who according to Trump and many in Washington single-mindedly supported the joint comprehensive plan of action (JCPOA), or nuclear agreement with Iran, rather than pressuring Iran over its regional foreign policy or voicing support for its 2009 green movement protests. Trump has taken a strong stance against the Islamic Republic for its support of regional proxy groups, meddling beyond its borders, its ballistic missile program and enmity of Israel. In addition to these steps, Trump has demonstrated his resolve by including Iranians in his controversial travel ban, as well as decertifying Iran’s JCPOA compliance despite repeated IAEA certification to the contrary. However, these moves have played right into the hands of the Islamic Republic, which has long played the game of blaming foreign powers for meddling in its internal affairs. This strategy has its roots in Iran’s 1979 Islamic revolution, when revolutionary slogans of “independence, freedom and the Islamic Republic” and “neither east nor west” were emblematic of Iran’s new ideological foreign policy. Drawing from its own history of interactions with the UK, Russia and the Soviet Union, and the US, where the not-so-hidden hand of outsiders obstructed domestic movements for political change (for instance during the 1905-11 constitutional revolution, the 1953 coup against the Iranian prime minister Mohammad Mosaddegh and in Mohammad Reza Shah’s relationship with the US), the new regime capitalised on longstanding popular frustrations. Over the years, it has used and abused these fears to generate a nationalism that pits Iran against the west. As tensions have ratcheted up with Saudi Arabia, Iranian leaders have also accused Riyadh of interference, particularly during the Islamic State-inspired terror attacks of June 2017. While these strategies of deflection are not lost on the Iranian population, they have in different periods succeeded in cultivating a degree of internal support. In reaction to the protests, Iran’s supreme leader, Ali Khamenei, drew on the same autocratic toolbox, blaming enemies – the US, Saudi Arabia and Israel – for stoking internal dissent. In Khamenei’s first and only statement since the protests started, he said: “All those who are at odds with the Islamic Republic have utilised various means, including money, weapons, politics and intelligence apparatuses, to create problems for the Islamic system, the Islamic Republic and the Islamic Revolution.” The head of Iran’s revolutionary guard, Mohammad Ali Jafari, echoed these sentiments in declaring an end to the protests, suggesting that forces abroad ranging from monarchists, the dissident Mojahedin-e-Khalq and foreign powers had created “riot, anarchy, insecurity and intrigue in Iran”. Both leaders could have used this opportunity to take responsibility and build bridges with the people at a time of national crisis. Not wanting to appear weak, however, Khamenei in particular sought to rally regime supporters and Iran’s factional elite around the Islamic Republic’s flag. In the next two weeks, Trump must also decide whether or not to renew sanction waivers as part of the JCPOA. In the current political climate, Trump could very well decide to not waive the sanctions as a means to further browbeat Tehran at a time of internal weakness. The hope here is that increased economic pressure would force the regime to return to the negotiating table to redress the nuclear agreement as well as its ballistic missile program and regional activities. In light of recent unrest, though, this is unlikely to happen. Rather, any reimposition of nuclear sanctions will deflect attention from the current domestic crisis, thereby allowing the regime to point to the longstanding excuse of foreign meddling as justification for its problems. This will ultimately strengthen Iran’s resistance narrative and continue to deprive Iranians of any meaningful reform. • Sanam Vakil is the James Anderson adjunct professor at Johns Hopkins University-SAIS Europe and an associate fellow covering Iran at Chatham House"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"public-leaders-network/2018/jan/08/switch-brexit-billions-ai-transform-uk-health-and-social-care","type":"article","sectionId":"public-leaders-network","sectionName":"Public Leaders Network","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-08T11:56:58Z","webTitle":"Switch Brexit billions into AI to transform UK health and social care | Colin Cram","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/public-leaders-network/2018/jan/08/switch-brexit-billions-ai-transform-uk-health-and-social-care","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/public-leaders-network/2018/jan/08/switch-brexit-billions-ai-transform-uk-health-and-social-care","fields":{"headline":"Switch Brexit billions into AI to transform UK health and social care","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The global race is on to develop artificial intelligence and it’s a race being led by China, Japan, Korea and Taiwan, according to the OECD, which says those four countries account for 70% of global AI development. China alone plans to spend £11.5bn to become the global leader in AI by 2030. Other countries are also investing in AI. Last October, the United Arab Emirates became the first nation with a government minister dedicated to AI, while Singapore is working with private firms to encourage AI development, including the development by Singapore-based Marvelstone of a major AI hub, with funding for 100 start-ups In contrast, the UK government allocated a mere £75m in the autumn budget to developing AI. That’s just 4% of the EU’s £1.9bn planned spend on AI and a tiny proportion of the Brexit divorce payment the UK is likely to make to the EU. Switching money from the Brexit process could enable the UK to become a global leader in this technology for decades to come. AI and robotics are revolutionising manufacturing, have huge military potential, and are already changing the face of transport, with driverless cars and pilotless aircraft no longer science fiction. Consultancy PWC has forecast that UK GDP could be around 10% higher in 2030 as a result of AI - the equivalent of an additional £232bn, making AI one of the biggest commercial opportunities in the economy. More importantly, AI has the potential to revolutionise public services, especially health and social care. There have been forecasts that by 2033, AI could have replaced 250,000 public sector jobs - but the technology could also enable the public sector to handle the ever-increasing demands of an ageing population. In Southend, for instance, AI’s potential is being demonstrated with trials of Pepper, a robot on the borough council’s team. Pepper is reported to be kind and endearing and the first robot with the ability to recognise principal human emotions, as well as being able to adapt its own behaviour and make independent decisions. Pepper can play videos, music and sensory games and is initially being used for community engagement, awareness raising, and to facilitate reminiscence activities Other AI equipment can be used to provide warnings of a possible heart attack and enable doctors to provide online consultations with patients. In Oxford, doctors have developed AI systems to diagnose scans for heart problems and lung cancer. AI has the potential to enable people to be cared for in their own homes and reduce the number of people in hospitals and care homes. The stakes are very high, but yet again the UK is hopelessly under-investing in its future. Even an announcement of £17.3m being invested in training looks like a rehash of a previous announcement, rather than new money. Without a dramatic increase in investment, the UK will miss the opportunity to be a leader and exporter of this technology. Instead, it will become dependent on sourcing it from overseas. So here are two suggestions for the government. If it invested just 40% of the proposed Brexit divorce bill in AI, it would enable the UK to become a global leader in this technology for decades to come. While the final divorce bill won’t be agreed until the 11th hour, it’s going to be at least £40bn. Second, take just half of the extra money that some leading Brexiteers in the government promised could be spent on the NHS and spend it on developing AI for health and social care. Giving the NHS and local government £175m a week for this technology would transform services.

Rhian Brewster’s story is about racism, plain and simple","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Type in Uefa and the word “racism” into Google, and prominent search results tell us the view of European football’s governing body. Uefa wants us to know it says no to racism. In fact, in 2013, its member associations “pledged to step up their efforts to eliminate racism from football” altogether. It’s all rather grand, but what we know is that in recent weeks Uefa’s self-congratulatory stance has been greatly undermined. Revelations from the England Under-17s World Cup-winning forward Rhian Brewster have once again highlighted the perniciousness of the problem. Brewster’s experience of racist abuse represents unacceptable treatment of a young man just trying to do his job. The player has been praised for unequivocally relating his experiences, which have been free from the euphemism so many would have preferred the shadow home secretary Diane Abbott to adopt when she shared that, last year, she had been called a “n----- bitch”. In an interview with my colleague Daniel Taylor for the Guardian, Brewster frankly outlined the racist abuse he both witnessed and suffered while playing for Liverpool in Uefa Youth League matches and for England. Called the N-word and subjected to monkey chants, the 17-year-old has understandably lost faith in Uefa, whose responses to these incidents have been pitiful or nonexistent. Uefa says it encourages referees to “stop, suspend or even abandon a game if racist incidents occur”. Players found guilty of racist behaviour can receive a 10-match suspension, and stadiums can face closure if this applies to fans. Uefa recognises the power it has to drastically change the experiences of young black players. However, for now at least, it seems disinclined to use it. It is an obvious dereliction of duty. The hope is that today – the first day its offices have been open since 22 December – the governing body will stir itself into more forceful action. Slogans, though easy to cobble together and flash at millions of people, are empty. Like a sticking plaster for a virus, their flimsiness is obvious when set against the task of healing. It is a lesson the Italian football league painfully learned last October. The president of Lazio football club, Claudio Lotito, had players wearing T-shirts declaring “no to antisemitism” accompanied by a picture of Anne Frank. An excerpt of her diary was read at every Italian league match during the same week. Yet some Lazio fans sang fascist songs while making salutes during the reading. The horrified prime minister, Paolo Gentiloni, called the scenes unacceptable. Quite. The trouble is in how governing bodies, clubs, fellow players and not least the fans act in solidarity to underscore that such behaviour is intolerable. One way to do so is by not distancing the English game, run by the FA, from the routine instances of racism experienced by black and minority-ethnic (BAME) players. To focus solely on Uefa’s failings is to miss the point of Brewster’s interventions entirely. Yes, much progress has been made: in Brewster’s interview it is clear he hasn’t experienced in England racist abuse of the kind encountered in matches against Russian and Spanish teams. Still, players continue to walk out on English pitches subjected to such abuse. Anecdotally, others refuse to sign to the youth wings of certain clubs because of the rampant racism associated with their fans. BAME players make up a quarter of players in English football’s four divisions yet account for a miserable 4% of senior coaches. It is the same footballing establishment that last October couldn’t admit it had failed in its duty of care to the England player Eniola Aluko. And it is the same leadership that couldn’t quite bring itself to find anything wrong with racist texts sent “privately” between Iain Moody, now Colchester’s head of player resources, and Malky Mackay, currently caretaker manager of Scotland and the performance director of the Scottish Football Association. The controversy eventually blew over, and both white men’s careers in football continued, once the word “banter” was used to explain their seemingly indefensible interactions. Last year, the sports anti-racism body Kick It Out reported that in the 2016-2017 season, reports of racist abuse rose by 16.7%. That was sadly predictable in the context of a record rise in race and religious hate crime following the Brexit vote. Even if Brewster were to instigate a US-style taking-a-knee stance, as has been rumoured, it leaves racism in football as primarily a problem for players to solve alone. Which isn’t good enough. Soon a backlash will, no doubt, ensue. It will bemoan bringing politics into football. Because, presumably, a much preferable scenario would be to have BAME players reconcile racist abuse and violence as an unfortunate fact of their professional lives. Anything less would be too much of an inconvenience. A 17-year-old is bearing the weight of the fight against racism, and needs support from the behemoth that is Uefa. It is an incredibly vulnerable position, one that needs more than mere platitudes about bravery and commendable behaviour to bolster it. Fans shouldn’t allow a collective responsibility to be offloaded on to the shoulders of someone who is not yet an adult. Of course we should be saying no to racism, but now we need the detail as to how this will actually be done. • Lola Okolosie is an English teacher and freelance journalist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"housing-network/2018/jan/10/national-strategy-tackle-rural-homelessness-","type":"article","sectionId":"housing-network","sectionName":"Housing Network","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-10T07:02:41Z","webTitle":"We need a national strategy to tackle rural homelessness | Charlotte Snelling","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/housing-network/2018/jan/10/national-strategy-tackle-rural-homelessness-","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/housing-network/2018/jan/10/national-strategy-tackle-rural-homelessness-","fields":{"headline":"We need a national strategy to tackle rural homelessness","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"When Storm Caroline swept across the UK in early December and large parts of the country were covered in snow, some people were happy to contemplate a white Christmas. But for many others, particularly homeless people in rural areas, the prospect of sub-zero temperatures and heavy snow is more frightening. Since 2010, the number of people sleeping rough in England has more than doubled, with 4,137 individuals recorded as rough sleepers in autumn 2016. New figures due to be released later this month by the Department for Communities and Local Government are not expected to show any improvement; if anything the figures are likely to show a worsening situation. Homelessness is not confined to the streets of towns and cities. Our recent research reported a 42% increase in rough sleeping between 2010 and 2016 in predominantly rural areas and has highlighted the particular challenges associated with being homeless in rural areas. In rural areas, shelter is limited and emergency hostels are rare, with individuals reporting sleeping in tents, barns, cars and outhouses. It can be harder to access support services provided by councils and charities; communities are more isolated and public transport is often infrequent and expensive. Outreach work is also more of a struggle for professionals working in remote locations, where resources are stretched and where there are often concerns about the safety of lone workers. These challenges increase during bad weather. Severe travel disruption can cut off entire rural communities, preventing people from reaching more sheltered locations, and essential shops and services. Plummeting temperatures are more keenly felt in the absence of the residual heat of urban centres. If central government is truly committed to reducing homelessness, as legislation passed in the Homelessness Reduction Act 2017 suggests, it must devise and implement a new national homelessness strategy that includes a thorough assessment of the scale and nature of rural homelessness.Rural authorities need more support through better resourcing and guidance to address the distinct issues and obstacles they face – including how best to prepare and deliver support during extreme weather conditions. We also believe local authorities should establish rural homelessness forums that bring together all the professionals involved in helping rough sleepers to find a home, such as the police, health services and neighbouring authorities. This would help join up services in rural areas that are often dislocated by geography. Knowing where homeless individuals are – and identifying their needs and what local provision is available – is crucial in ensuring appropriate support is given. It is easy to become swept up in idyllic images of a countryside covered in snow. But travel chaos, power cuts and flooding often hit rural areas the hardest. Hidden within these landscapes are many individuals who have been stripped of access to shelter and support by harsh winters. Prevention must remain the ultimate goal, but making it easier for those in need to get support in rural locations, particularly over the winter months, is just as important.

Imagine the outcry if that happened now. It was funny at the time though. The atmosphere was incredible. There were 54,000 inside Goodison and it was a great win for us and Gordon Lee, our manager. In the first half I’d caught Kenny Dalglish inside the box. I got away with it but he didn’t and had to be replaced by Jimmy Case at half-time. It was Case who scored Liverpool’s consolation. My tackle on Kenny was nothing out of the ordinary back then. It would be now. You gave a bit and you took a bit, especially in a derby, and the games were fierce because the tackling was allowed to be fierce. They were horrible games to play in but there was a close connection between the clubs and what the derby meant to everyone in the city. A few seasons later we were playing each other in cup finals and for league titles and we had Peter Reid, who was a red, in our midfield and they had Steve McMahon, who was a blue, in their side. The local connection is important, which is why Steven Gerrard and Jamie Carragher epitomised what the derby meant to Liverpool for so many years and why it’s nice to see Jonjoe Kenny and Tom Davies coming through now at Everton. Another tie that stands out in the FA Cup is the 4-4 in 1991. Obviously we never realised it at the time but when you look back now that game signalled a massive turnaround in Liverpool’s long-term fortunes. Kenny resigned as Liverpool manager within 48 hours and we went on to win the second replay. Maybe Kenny’s resignation had an impact on Liverpool in the second replay, which was the fourth time we’d played each other in less than three weeks, although it didn’t feel that way. We had to come from behind four times in the 4-4 and had to work just as hard to win the next game 1-0. Unfortunately it didn’t materialise into something bigger because we lost to West Ham in the quarter-finals. It felt like such a waste to go out after putting such a big effort into winning the derby. On a personal level, one thing I remember well about the 4-4 is Howard Kendall deciding to change things around and going to three at the back with a sweeper. I thought it wasn’t a bad idea as I could sweep having played that role before with Everton and Wales but he put me as a marker on the left-hand side. Howard wanted to give us some balance and he gave Martin Keown a free role. The worst thing you could do was give Martin Keown a free role. He was probably one of the best markers in the game, think of all the man-marking jobs he did brilliantly for Arsenal, but you didn’t want to give him too much to think about. I wasn’t sure about that decision, I thought: ‘Does he know how to mark space when he likes to mark people?’ but to be fair I was the one at fault for the first goal. I felt uncomfortable and I wasn’t too happy with Howard. He was asking me to mark Peter Beardsley who would drop deep and end up on the right wing. “I wasn’t happy going out there when I knew the danger was behind me but Howard wanted me to follow Beardsley. I thought we got away with it on the night. Tactically, yes it was good, but I thought we had the wrong people in the wrong positions. For the second replay he asked me to be sweeper but I’d seen my arse by then and played where I did in the 4-4. I told Howard I’d stay where I was and he didn’t have a problem with that to be honest because he was quite happy with Martin at sweeper. As good a spectacle as the 4-4 was, and while it’s a game that people always remember, it wasn’t a great match in which to be a defender. I certainly didn’t go back into the dressing room thinking I’d played well after conceding four goals. It was just relief. Hopefully Friday will have the same outcome as that tie, although for me it has come too soon. I would have liked them to play each other deeper in the competition but one benefit of the draw is that it has restored a buzz to the third round. That feeling of the FA Cup third round representing the start of something new and important has been lost but with a few thousand more Evertonians inside Anfield, and given what happened when they met the other week, I don’t think that feeling will be missing on Friday."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/2018/jan/04/dawid-malan-jonny-bairstow-nightwatchman-england-ashes","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-04T11:58:44Z","webTitle":"Dawid Malan backs Jonny Bairstow’s decision to turn down nightwatchman","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/jan/04/dawid-malan-jonny-bairstow-nightwatchman-england-ashes","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/jan/04/dawid-malan-jonny-bairstow-nightwatchman-england-ashes","fields":{"headline":"Dawid Malan backs Jonny Bairstow’s decision to turn down nightwatchman","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Dawid Malan was surprised when Jonny Bairstow rather than a nightwatchman emerged late on the opening day of the fifth Ashes Test. But, after the England wicketkeeper was removed three balls into the final over, his team-mate still defended the call. England’s policy in such instances is to let the next batsman in decide whether they would prefer a tailender to take their place before stumps. Mason Crane, on debut, was padded up ready but instead Bairstow strode out to face the second new ball after the fall of Joe Root for 83. When Bairstow edged Josh Hazlewood behind on five to leave England 233 for five at the close, it meant Australia could claim the bragging rights after a hard-fought day in which the tourists had held the aces with 10 minutes to go. “It sums up where we have been this tour,” said Malan, who was unbeaten on 55 to continue a personally promising campaign to date. “We have been on top and then we make one or two mistakes and suddenly it has let the Aussies back in.” Asked if he was surprised to see Bairstow come out, he replied: “I was a little bit. But it’s not a coach’s thing, it’s left up to the batsman that’s next in to make the decision. Jonny made it and good on him – it takes a lot of guts to go against what people normally do. He probably felt he was better suited to the new ball. “I’ll have [a nightwatchman] every time if there is an opportunity but each to their own. You can’t look back and say he shouldn’t have. He backed himself but got out.” Graeme Swann, who presented Crane with his cap before the start of play, was left bewildered by the call and questioned whether the team management should have stepped in to insist the nightwatchman was deployed. The former England spinner told BT Sport: “I’m all for Jonny Bairstow showing willing and saying: ‘No, I don’t want a nightwatchman’ and being brave but he’s got to be overruled. I’m just flummoxed. The management have got to say: ‘Don’t be daft, this is for the team,’ and the nightwatchman goes out and gets a brand‑new ball for the last two overs of the day.” Malan put on a stand of 123 with his captain, who appeared locked on for Test century No14 until, with two and a half overs to go – and the new ball freshly taken – he clipped Mitchell Starc to Mitchell Marsh at square leg and then sank down on to his haunches in disgust. Root has struggled to convert half-centuries into hundreds, with only three of his last 18 scores past 50 turned into triple figures. The England captain spoke before the fifth Test about his frustration in this regard, not least since his opposite number, Steve Smith, has made 23 Test centuries from 45 such instances. Malan said: “No one means to get out. Joe Root played fantastically well but the second new ball presents a different challenge, especially here where you don’t know if it is going to swing or skid off the wicket. Three yards either side and you say it was a great shot. “He still averages 53 in Test cricket and the day will come when he does start converting them as well as Smith does or the other greats. When that happens it will be scary to see how good he can be and how high his average can jump to.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"money/2018/jan/06/bt-price-hike-broadband-wifi-sport","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-06T06:59:06Z","webTitle":"BT’s fourth price hike in three years.

Unusually BT has chosen not to put up its landline charge this January, which means it is staying at £18.99 a month. Instead it is the company’s broadband and BT Sport customers who will be feeling the pinch this time round. This weekend’s hike is the fourth price increase imposed by the company in three years, and leaves it looking very expensive compared to rival offers. The telecoms market is now similar to the energy market in that those who do nothing pay the most. In terms of the hikes, BT customers on its basic broadband will now pay £2 a month more. That might not sound like a lot, but it equates to a 10% increase on top of what was already one of the highest broadband charges at £20 a month. Those on the faster Infinity packages will be paying an extra £2.50 a month. Customers who pay for the “anytime” unlimited calls deal will see that go up from £8.99 to £9.50 a month. Back in 2011 this cost £4.90 a month. The 1571 answerphone service, which is free at some rival operators, rises 50p to £3 a month, or £36 a year. Those who pay for each call they make will see the cost of making a call rise to a minimum of 35p from Sunday. BT Sport customers – who admittedly are getting a lot of sport for their money – will see their monthly bill rise to £10 a month (up £2.50) if they don’t watch it via BT TV. Those without BT broadband and who watch via Sky/TalkTalk will see the bill go up from £22.99 to £25.99 a month – or £312 a year. The company has frozen prices for low-income customers - those on its special BT Basic package. “We are investing more than ever in broadband, including boosting the speed, data and cloud storage of millions of customers,” insists a BT spokesman, adding: “There are also great personalised offers for our broadband customers. “They can stay on the same broadband deal for the same price as they were paying before this change, if they sign a new contract. Or they can choose to upgrade to a better product, usually offering more speed or more data, for their new price, which will be frozen for 18 months.” So what are people’s options? BT wrote to customers announcing the price hike in November and giving customers 30 days to quit penalty-free – even if they were in-contract. That date has expired, but millions of the company’s customers are free to switch supplier without penalty. Until Tuesday 9 January, Plusnet, which is owned by BT, is offering home phone and basic broadband for £19.99 a month, including landline – with £50 cashback. MoneySavingExpert.com calculates that this is the UK’s cheapest deal, as those buying their landline upfront for the 12-month contract duration at £210 can save £350 a year compared with what BT is charging. Elsewhere, Sky was this week offering a basic broadband/landline package service for £18.99 a month. There’s also a £50 pre-paid MasterCard thrown in, too, but a £19.95 set-up fee. TalkTalk has the same basic deal for £19.95 a month – the contract lasts two years but comes with the promise that prices won’t rise during the term. Other contract terms are available. If you want faster downloads, Plusnet also has a one-year fibre deal priced at £25 a month – just remember to switch or re-sign at the end of the first year. TalkTalk’s fibre deal is also £25 a month, but for two years. Another company to look at is the energy firm SSE, particularly if you are an existing energy customer. It is offering basic unlimited phone/broadband for £21 a month (or £26 a month for non-energy customers). The better-value fibre deal is £24 or £29 a month. Its anytime calls package costs £7 a month compared to BT’s £9.50. In both cases, prices are fixed for three years, but customers are on a rolling monthly contract, meaning you can leave at any time. As ever, prices are changing all the time, meaning you have to look at the companies’ websites for the latest deals. If you watch catch-up or streamed TV services, or download big files, it is worth the extra few pounds that fibre now costs. • All prices correct at time of writing"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"global-development/2018/jan/09/phone-calls-facebook-nap-life-as-a-judge-in-myanmar","type":"article","sectionId":"global-development","sectionName":"Global development","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-09T05:00:11Z","webTitle":"Phone calls, Facebook and the odd nap: life as a judge in Myanmar | Joshua Carroll","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2018/jan/09/phone-calls-facebook-nap-life-as-a-judge-in-myanmar","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2018/jan/09/phone-calls-facebook-nap-life-as-a-judge-in-myanmar","fields":{"headline":"Phone calls, Facebook and the odd nap: life as a judge in Myanmar","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Defence lawyer Zar Li Aye was eating lunch near a courthouse in Yangon, Myanmar’s largest city, when her phone rang. “Where are you?” asked a colleague. “Your client just confessed.” The client, under pressure from a police officer, had agreed to fire her and submit a false guilty plea when the judge started the hearing early. Zar Li Aye rushed back to the courtroom, but it was too late. “I’m so sorry,” the defendant sobbed. “I really didn’t want to fire you and I didn’t do that crime, but they put me under a lot of pressure.” For defendants facing government prosecutors in Myanmar, the chances of a fair trial are slim. Many judges openly presume guilt before hearing evidence, and regard putting up a defence as a waste of court time. “If you hire a lawyer, the judge will hate you,” the police officer had told Zar Li Aye’s client, who was arrested on suspicion of soliciting as a sex worker. She was imprisoned for a year; the judge said she would have received 18 months had she fought her case. It is widely acknowledged that the country’s judiciary is beholden to the military and consumed by rampant bribery. But backhanders and meddling generals are only part of the story. In many other cases, people suffer miscarriages of justice simply because of shambolic courtroom proceedings overseen by poorly trained and unprofessional judges. “I’ve seen a lot of … judges talking on their phones or using Facebook while the court is in session,” says Yee Nwe Tun, a legal aid lawyer, with a resigned chuckle. Judges sometimes take naps during hearings, or get up from the bench to have lunch, leaving the defence and the prosecution to go hungry as they continue the hearing on their own. This behaviour has gone unchecked for decades partly because independent observers have been kept out of courtrooms. But one group, emboldened by democratic reforms, recently undertook what it calls an “unprecedented” project by observing more than a thousand hearings. The resulting report by Justice Base, a non-profit aimed at improving Myanmar’s legal system, covered more than 155 cases in Yangon between 2013 and 2016. The group had to partner with defence lawyers to access the hearings, which they watched secretly – partly because court officials illegally deny access to the public, partly because the observers feared retribution from officials. Many of the hearings they attended failed to comply with local and international law on fair trial rights. Even if, say, judges were impartial, trials might still be compromised by systemic problems, such as difficulties in accessing case files, or the fact it is often impossible for lawyers to consult with their clients in private. In almost 90% of cases that Justice Base observed, defendants were not allowed a lawyer during the remand hearing, as a result of which many were probably denied bail without an argument in their defence. This practice fuelled global outrage last month when two Reuters journalists were arrested and detained while working on a story about the brutal crackdown against Rohingya Muslims in Rakhine state. The pair, who face up to 14 years in prison on official secrets charges, were held in a secret location for more than two weeks and didn’t meet their lawyer until they emerged from a van amid a throng of reporters at their second remand hearing. The Justice Base observers covered more run-of-the-mill cases such as theft, assault and sex work, rather than any overtly political ones. But even when authorities aren’t directly interfering, some judges “fear being watched”, and lawyers often fear challenging judges, said Kari Rotkin, the group’s international legal adviser. Myanmar’s criminal justice system ranks second to last in the region and near the bottom globally, according to the World Justice Project’s annual rule of law index. Aung San Suu Kyi, the country’s de facto leader, has repeatedly stressed the need for rule of law in Myanmar, but reforms since her party came to power in 2015 have been minimal. A new legal aid law enacted in 2016 would finally give suspects the right to free legal assistance, but the government has yet to implement it. Some reforms are bound to be slow, but other changes for which Justice Base is pushing, such as displaying posters in police stations informing defendants of their right to a lawyer, could be made overnight if the political will were there. Rotkin says she was encouraged by a recent meeting she and her colleagues had with members of the supreme court about their findings. The group has sent copies of the report to court officials, who she hopes will distribute them to courthouses around the country. But the recent arrests of several journalists, she added, have raised doubts about “how committed [the authorities] really are to this ‘rule of law’ term”. Myanmar’s once-celebrated political transformation seemed to provide an opening for judicial reform, she said. “But that opening might have already closed, we don’t know.” Additional reporting by Cape Diamond"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2017/dec/29/chelsea-eden-hazard-antonio-conte-real-madrid","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-29T22:30:10Z","webTitle":"Chelsea’s Conte confident of new Eden Hazard deal despite Real interest","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/dec/29/chelsea-eden-hazard-antonio-conte-real-madrid","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/dec/29/chelsea-eden-hazard-antonio-conte-real-madrid","fields":{"headline":"Chelsea’s Conte confident of new Eden Hazard deal despite Real interest","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Chelsea intend to resume contract talks with Eden Hazard in the new year aimed at extending his stay at Stamford Bridge but the player is apparently in no rush to commit his future while it is unclear whether Real Madrid will prioritise his signing this summer. Hazard, who does not operate with an agent, is contracted to 2020 but, with a new deal first mooted towards the end of last season, has held discussions with the Chelsea hierarchy over an extension on improved terms. No formal offer has been made despite claims to the contrary by Hazard’s father, Thierry, to the Belgian newspaper Le Soir. Hazard senior suggested his son had rejected an offer while he awaits an indication from the Bernabéu whether their long-standing interest is likely to prompt a bid. Chelsea have no intention of losing the Belgian international and are confident he will eventually sign a new deal. They are close to securing his compatriot, Thibaut Courtois, to a new five-year contract which will make him the highest-paid goalkeeper in the Premier League, and will follow that up with a firm contract proposal to Hazard next month. By then the head coach, Antonio Conte, hopes the champions will have demonstrated their own ambitions to the player by some early moves in the transfer market. “If you are in a great club and you trust the ambition of the club, it’s right to stay,” Conte said. “We are talking about two important players for us [Hazard and Courtois] and, for sure, it is important to continue with this type of player, especially if your ambition is to try and compete for something important. “It’s very important to try to improve your team, to strengthen your team, and not to sell the best players. But [on Hazard’s new contract] these are private conversations between the player and the club.” The Italian sees room for further improvement in Hazard’s game. “He could score more. “When you are a striker, or a No10, your speciality must be to score. I think in this aspect he has a lot of space for improvement.” Conte described the next month as “important if we are able to find the right players”, but admitted Chelsea’s manoeuvring in the winter market was in effect out of his hands. Recruitment will be overseen by the director Marina Granovskaia with heavy input from Scott McLachlan, the club’s head of international scouting, while they continue to operate without a technical director following Michael Emenalo’s resignation in November. Granovskaia intends to interview candidates for the vacant role next month, though the club could decide to disperse Emenalo’s roles among existing staff. Chelsea may have edged ahead of Tottenham Hotspur in the chase for Everton’s Ross Barkley, who opted to remain on Merseyside in August while he underwent rehabilitation for a serious hamstring injury. Conte has made clear that, having made his recommendations to the board, the club will ultimately determine which targets they pursue. “It’s very important to look at ourselves and then try to find the right way to improve,” he said. “In my hand the way to improve this team is to work. On the other hand there is the club and the transfer market. But I can only speak about my hand. “I’m a coach and I have to work with my players. My task is on the pitch. For the transfer market, there is the club. The club decide whether they want to improve the squad or the team. They take the best decision if they see we can improve with some [new] players. But I’m the coach. I am here to work on the pitch with the players the club give me.” The ramifications of missing out on European football last year have been reflected in Chelsea’s annual financial results, announced on Friday, which revealed the club had relied upon player sales to record an overall profit of £15.3m. Matchday revenues for 2016-17 fell in the absence of Uefa competition and Chelsea, who had finished 10th the previous season, recorded an operating loss, with player sales of £69.2m, the bulk of which was Oscar’s transfer to Shanghai SIPG, ensuring they reported an overall profit. Turnover grew to £361.3m, up 9.8% on the previous year, with broadcasting revenues increased as a result of winning the title, along with the commencement of the Premier League’s latest contracts with television broadcasters. The club continues to comply with Uefa’s break-even criteria under Financial Fair Play regulations, and expects revenues to grow this season as a result of their new partnership with Nike, which began in July 2017, and their return to the Champions League. Chelsea FC plc’s ultimate parent company Fordstam Limited, which is also responsible for the group’s non-footballing operations, reported a consolidated loss of £14.2m for the year which has been explained by planning costs for the redevelopment of Stamford Bridge and losses at non-football ancillary businesses."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"media/2017/dec/31/reporters-death-toll-falls-but-dangers-blood-remain","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-31T06:59:23Z","webTitle":"The death toll falls but the blood and danger remain for reporters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/dec/31/reporters-death-toll-falls-but-dangers-blood-remain","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2017/dec/31/reporters-death-toll-falls-but-dangers-blood-remain","fields":{"headline":"The death toll falls but the blood and danger remain for reporters","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Some good news – in a constrained sort of way. Some 65 working journalists were killed on duty this year, the lowest total for 14 years, Reporters Sans Frontières has said, with 326 journalists currently held in prison and 54 held hostage by non-state groups. China is the biggest jailer of journalists (52) followed by Turkey with 43, according to RSF. Syria was the deadliest country for journalists in 2017 (with 12 killed), followed by Mexico (11), Afghanistan (9) and Iraq (8). Ten of the 65 dead were female – including Daphne Caruana Galizia in Malta, Gauri Lankesh in India and Miroslava Breach Velducea in Mexico. Most of these victims were experienced investigative reporters. Despite threats, they continued to investigate and expose cases of corruption. RSF’s UK bureau director, Rebecca Vincent, says: “More journalists are being deliberately targeted for their work [60%] with the other 40% killed in the field doing their jobs. Journalists are targeted by those wishing to silence their reporting exposing political, economic or criminal interests – information that is in the public interest.” And the fall in the number of killings? “Our data shows that journalists are fleeing the most dangerous places and foreign journalists are travelling less frequently to these places. “At the same time, international attention to the issue of safety of journalists has increased, for example through a number of UN resolutions, and media outlets are taking greater care in providing training for correspondents travelling to high-risk areas.” Things – in terms of murder and the pursuit of murders – are slowly getting better, as the stories from Yemen and Syria, and the rivers of blood, continue to flow.

Channel 5 will broadcast Harlequins’ annual festive fixture at Twickenham, against Northampton, and while it may be pushing it to say the rugby revolution will be televised – not least because of the two sides’ respective form – it can be considered a seminal moment. Premiership Rugby has had its critics of late but this is a move that should be applauded. Granted, the increased exposure may help the search for sponsorship, with the existing Aviva deal set to expire at the end of the season, but there is undoubtedly a huge tranche of casual rugby fans in need of a little push; a demographic who watch the Six Nations – and a combined 11m did so for the two most popular matches of this year’s Championship on BBC and ITV – but opt against paying a subscription fee for BT Sport. Premiership Rugby announced in May its landmark agreement with Channel 5 – a four-year deal, worth more than £1m, to simultaneously broadcast five matches a season with BT Sport – and it is believed there will be one more game before the Six Nations. The three afterwards will therefore attempt to arrest the drop‑off in interest that perennially follows the Championship. It is an arrangement that suits all parties. BT Sport is happy to share its matches (end-of-season play-offs notwithstanding) in the hope of increased subscribers at a time when an average of fewer than 100,000 have been watching the Ashes on a daily basis. There has been a realisation that for all that pay-TV provides a financial boost – Premiership Rugby’s BT deal was worth £152m in 2012 and it is believed the extension until 2021, agreed in 2015, is worth considerably more than that – there must be a balance between the riches they offer and the reach of terrestrial TV. An optimistic forecast of up to 1.5 million terrestrial viewers is anticipated for any given weekend when Channel 5 broadcasts a match live, when highlights are also taken into account – considerably fewer watched the third British &amp; Irish Lions Test in July. “The pay-TV broadcasters have been brilliant with sports,” Mark McCafferty, Premiership Rugby’s chief executive, told the Guardian. “Initially Sky have done a great job for 20-plus years and more recently BT. They have invested a lot into the sport, including financially, and that has allowed those sports to develop. Typically the free-to-air broadcasters don’t have that capacity to make that financial investment but have the exposure. There is a change in approach in terms of sports looking for that optimal balance. You can’t swing too far one way or the other in this next phase.” McCafferty also believes Premiership Rugby is making the move at the right time. BT and Sky recently announced they have finally reached an agreement whereby accessing the other’s sports channels will be far easier for existing customers. While McCafferty is optimistic Premiership Rugby’s partnership with BT Sport will continue, there is an acknowledgment that the landscape is changing, with Facebook and Amazon expected to bid for the next round of Premier League rights. “We are in a media landscape where there is an increasing amount of choice with new entrants on the scene, new means of delivery and fans who consume the content over a lot of different platforms,” McCafferty said. “We’re embracing it but the timing of any of those new players into sports content is something that they are going to drive. We’re in a good position with our very stable and successful deal with BT and adjust accordingly if necessary.” Of paramount importance, however, is that the product is of high enough quality; so while this fixture – with 70,000 tickets already sold – makes obvious sense, there is no doubt a hint of nervousness, with the two sides sitting ninth and 10th in the table. “It is a shop window for us so these types of game at iconic stadiums that people can recognise and get a sense of the atmosphere is what we’ll most likely put forward,” McCafferty said. “Also, our most intense local derbies in the West Country and the Midlands – those are fruitful areas too to showcase all that is good about the Premiership.” Channel 5 also has to strike the right balance by avoiding talking down to traditional rugby fans while also appealing to those less knowledgable of the sport’s nuances.

The Texas department of public safety indicated a mechanical issue with the truck was probably to blame and reported that no one was injured. The highway lane was shut down for more than three hours, local media reported, as crews worked to put out the fire and clear the unseasoned guacamole from the roadway. The truck, which was travelling north, was most likely delivering avocados from Mexico (the world’s largest avocado exporter) to customers in the US (the world’s largest avocado consumer). The high-in-healthy-fat superfood has been steadily gaining popularity, particularly among young people, over the last 10 years. Demand has remained extremely high in the US and expanded in European and Chinese markets this year, while growers have struggled with bad weather that has pushed down yields. Production in 2017 is down approximately 50% in California and 20% in Mexico, driving the price of avocados up dramatically. According to the Financial Times, avocado prices more than doubled from January 2017 through the middle of the year. Unfortunately for home-renting debt-strapped American millennial avocado lovers, the char-roasted batch being scraped from the Texas highway will do little to lessen such costs."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2018/jan/06/tracy-letts-interview-the-post-freedom-of-speech-spielberg-meryl-streep","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-06T18:00:00Z","webTitle":"Tracy Letts: ‘Freedom of speech is under attack’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/jan/06/tracy-letts-interview-the-post-freedom-of-speech-spielberg-meryl-streep","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/jan/06/tracy-letts-interview-the-post-freedom-of-speech-spielberg-meryl-streep","fields":{"headline":"Tracy Letts: ‘Freedom of speech is under attack’","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Tracy Letts is an American playwright and actor. His play August: Osage County won him a Pulitzer prize and a Tony award in 2008, and his performance as George, in Edward Albee’s Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?, earned him another Tony in 2013. He played the duplicitous head of the CIA in Homeland, and is now in Steven Spielberg’s new film, The Post, alongside Meryl Streep and Tom Hanks. Letts plays business manager to Streep’s Katharine Graham, first female publisher of the Washington Post, and to Hanks’s Ben Bradlee, the paper’s renowned editor. The film, set in the 1970s, is about the leak to the press of US government secrets about the Vietnam war. When the New York Times was silenced by a court ruling, the Washington Post risked its existence in order to publish the story. Does The Post serve as a modern parable? The reason for the movie is where the US is right now as a country. The story it tells is about the importance of the first amendment [prohibiting any abridgement of freedom of speech]. This defines us as a country. It’s a shame that we have to keep reminding ourselves of its importance, that we have to stay so vigilant. But it cannot be taken for granted. Everybody who made the film felt an urgent need to get it out there now. How will it register in Trump’s America? Who knows? But one hopes we’re not preaching to the choir – that there is an understanding that we all are the choir. All of us make up the United States of America. It’s not about throwing rocks at the other side. It’s about reminding us to take a step back and agree that without the protection of the first amendment we cease to exist. It’s under attack in this country. People need to recognise that. In the film, you play Katharine Graham’s financier sidekick. What was it like acting alongside Meryl Streep? Fantastic. Most people who act opposite Meryl are intimidated by the sheer body of work she’s completed. And it’s not hyperbole to say she’s one of the all-time greats. But I’d worked with Meryl on the film of August: Osage County and was able to feel a little more at ease. I knew what a lovely person she is – she has charm, a sense of humour and is easy to talk to. But beyond that, the reason Meryl is so good is because she works really hard. She is very prepared and in the moment. Was it fun being part of that recreated newspaper scene. Would you have ever fancied being a journalist yourself? I’m so admiring of journalists’ hard work, but it strikes me as a gruelling and thankless profession. August: Osage County – a sweepingly dysfunctional family drama – must be a hard act to follow. What is your new play about? The Minutes has just opened with the Steppenwolf company – my home stage – in Chicago. It’s a political piece about a city council meeting in a small city. It has a cast of 11 and is 90 minutes long. I hope it will come to London. You once said that, as a writer, you like to hide. Is acting a way of doing that? As an actor I love it when people don’t know I’m in something. “You were in that?” That makes me feel I’ve done my job well. You grew up in Durant, Oklahoma, and have said it was an unhappy childhood… This idea has become overblown. I had a great relationship with my family. But I wasn’t a good fit for the town. I felt like an outsider. There was not a lot for a kid like me to do. “Don’t do anything” was one of your 10 commandments as a path to creativity. The art of doing nothing is hard, isn’t it? Very hard – it’s an act of will. But I always benefit from it. How often do you manage to do nothing? You might be surprised [laughs]. You stopped drinking 20 years ago. Do you see yourself as still having an addictive personality? And is work an addiction? Absolutely. If there is something one can be addicted to, I am addicted to it. But I’ve been in recovery for over 24 years, and hopefully will be beyond today. Am I addicted to work? Yes. I fill holes in my time and my essence with work. “Addict” is a dirty word. Would “obsessive” be fairer? Probably. When AA started in the US, one reason for the anonymity was the shame associated with addiction. It’s time we stopped demonising addiction. The truth is that many fine people have found themselves addicted. It’s not a question of the quality of a person. Your mother is a writer. Is there a writing gene? If there is, I’ve got it. Both my parents were English teachers. When my mom retired, she became a writer. When my father retired, he became an actor [starring as the grandfather in August: Osage County]. They were in their mid-50s when they started their second careers. You once said writing is better than acting… Writing is harder, but once you have the thing written, you get to go home. As a stage actor you have to stay out there, do it eight times a week. Acting is very hard in that sense. You are married to the actor Carrie Coon. Is married life good for a writer or is it easier to be solitary? Having the right partner makes everything easier. I’m lucky to be married to Carrie. I’ve written more since being married to her than previously in my life. She has freed up space for me to write. I see you as a subversive. Is this how you see yourself? Yes – it’s that outsider feeling. I still have it [laughs]. It’s my sense of humour, and the sense of humour I respond to in others. Can you answer The Post’s toughest question: “Would you go to prison to stop a war?” God – you have thrown this brutally hard conundrum at me in the last moment! I want to say I would but… I wouldn’t. • The Post is released in cinemas on 19 January"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"money/2017/dec/29/were-hardwired-to-sleep-not-to-work","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-29T17:03:21Z","webTitle":"We’re hardwired to sleep, not to work | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2017/dec/29/were-hardwired-to-sleep-not-to-work","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2017/dec/29/were-hardwired-to-sleep-not-to-work","fields":{"headline":"We’re hardwired to sleep, not to work","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Nick Boles MP states that “mankind is hardwired to work” (Tories should morally object to universal basic income, says MP, 29 December). This claim is based in ideology, not evidence. Some jobs may have associated benefits, such as physical activity (unless you are a desk worker) and social contact (unless you are a lone worker or bullied by colleagues), but the term “work” is too all-encompassing to assert that evolution has hardwired us for it. There were no oil rig workers, cardiac surgeons or train drivers when the evolution of the modern human brain was under way. By contrast, the need for sleep really is hardwired, yet the world of work does not cater for the body’s natural rhythms of sleeping and waking, and most of us depend on a psychoactive drug (caffeine) to get us through the day. Sometimes this is supplied by our employer. There would be less sickness absence if people were able to sleep more (the afternoon siesta in some cultures is related to the body’s natural rhythms). However, such is the Tories’ lack of care about real human needs that it now appears that they are planning to scrap the working time directive (Report, 18 December). Progressive thinkers should view increasing automation as an opportunity to rethink work, including an expansion of leisure time for all and a universal income to support those displaced by robots in finding new work. Dr David Hardman Trustee, London Hazards Centre • By Nick Boles’s argument, why allow anyone to inherit or accumulate enough money to “not feel the need to work”? The evidence shows that most people provided a basic income will work to improve their status. We are also hardwired to support community members, which is essential to survival for most primates. With our communities now national and global, we should focus on that part of our heritage and not draw the community boundary around our social class. Jonathan Grudin Issaquah, Washington, USA • If Nick Boles’s Tory mind revolts at the idea of giving people “summat for nowt”, maybe the handout could be renamed? In the 1980s the Conservative government introduced an Enterprise Allowance, which I understand enabled many people well-known in today’s creative industries to make a decent living. Furthermore, as the MP seems unaware of what is involved in “nurturing plants”, I invite him to help pick the sawfly larvae off my raspberry canes in summer (gloves provided if squeamish).

The old idea of the online world as a burgeoning utopia looks to have peaked around the time of the Arab spring, and is in retreat. If you want a sense of how much has changed, picture the president of the US tweeting his latest provocation in the small hours, and consider an array of words and phrases now freighted with meaning: Russia, bots, troll farms, online abuse, fake news, dark money. Another sign of how much things have shifted is a volte-face by Silicon Valley’s most powerful man. Barely more than a year ago the Facebook founder, Mark Zuckerberg, seemed still to be rejoicing in his company’s imperial phase, blithely dismissing the idea that fabricated news carried by his platform had affected the outcome of the 2016 US election as a “pretty crazy idea”. Now scarcely a week goes by without some Facebook pronouncement or other, either updating the wider world about its latest quest to put its operations beyond criticism or assuring us that its belief in an eternally upbeat, fuzzily liberal ethos is as fervent as ever. The company has reached a fascinating point in its evolution; it is as replete with importance and interest as any political party. Facebook is at once massively powerful and also suddenly defensive. Its deeply questionable tax affairs are being altered; 1,000 new employees have been hired to monitor its advertising. At the same time, it still seems unable to provide any answers to worries about its effects on the world beyond more and more Facebook. A pre-Christmas statement claimed that although “passive” use of social media could harm users, “actively interacting with people” online was linked not just to “improvements in wellbeing”, but to “joy”. In short, if Facebook does your head in, the solution is apparently not to switch off, but more Facebook. While Zuckerberg and his colleagues do ethical somersaults, there is rising noise from a group of people who made headlines towards the year’s end: the former insiders at tech giants who now loudly worry about what their innovations are doing to us. The former Facebook president Sean Parker warned in November that its platform “literally changes your relationship with society, with each other … God only knows what it’s doing to our children’s brains.” At around the same time, the former Facebook executive Chamath Palihapitiya held a public interview at Stanford University in which he did not exactly mince his words. “The short-term, dopamine-driven feedback loops that we have created are destroying how society works,” he said. “No civil discourse, no cooperation, misinformation, mistruth … So we are in a really bad state of affairs right now, in my opinion.” (Strangely, around a week later he seemed to recant, claiming he had only meant to “start an important conversation”, and that Facebook was still a company he “loved”.) Then there is Tristan Harris, a former high-up at Google who is now hailed as “the closest thing Silicon Valley has to a conscience”. Under the banner of a self-styled “movement” called Time Well Spent, he and his allies are urging software developers to tone down the compulsive elements of their inventions, and the millions who find themselves hooked to change their behaviour. What they are up against, meanwhile, is apparently personified by Nir Eyal, a Stanford lecturer and tech consultant who could be a character from the brilliant HBO sitcom Silicon Valley. In 2013 he published Hooked: How To Build Habit-Forming Products. His inspiration for the book is the behaviourist psychology pioneered by BF Skinner. Among his pearls of wisdom is one both simple and chilling: “For new behaviours to really take hold, they must occur often.” But on close inspection, even he sounds somewhat ambivalent: last April, at something called the Habit Summit, he told his audience that at home he had installed a device that cut off the internet at a set time every day. Good for him. The reality for millions of other people is a constant experience that all but buries the online world’s liberating possibilities in a mess of alerts, likes, messages, retweets and internet use so pathologically needy and frantic that it inevitably makes far too many people vulnerable to pernicious nonsense and real dangers. Thanks to manipulative ephemera, WhatsApp users anxiously await the ticks that confirm whether a message has been read by a receiver; and, a turbocharged version of the addictive dots that flash on an iPhone when a friend is replying to you, Snapchat now alerts its users when a friend starts typing a message to them. And we all know what lies around the corner: a world of Sensurround virtual reality, and an internet wired into just about every object we interact with. As the repentant Facebookers say: if we’re not careful, we will soon be at risk of being locked into mindless behavioural loops, craving distraction even from other distractions. There is a possible way out of this, of course. It resides not in some luddite fantasy of an army of people carrying old Nokia phones and writing each other letters, but the possibility of a culture that actually embraces the idea of navigating the internet with a discriminating sensibility and an emphasis on basic moderation. We now know – don’t we? – that the person who begins most social encounters by putting their phone on the table is either an addict or an idiot. There is also a mounting understanding that one of the single most important aspects of modern parenting is to be all too aware of how much social media can mess with people’s minds, and to limit our children’s screen time. This, after all, is what Bill Gates and Steve Jobs did, as evidenced by one of the latter’s most pithy statements. In 2010 he was asked about his children’s opinion of the iPad. “They haven’t used it,” he said. “We limit how much technology our kids use at home.” Two billion people actively use Facebook; at least 3.5 billion are now reckoned to be online. Their shared habits, compulsions and susceptibilities will clearly have a huge influence on the world’s progress, or lack of it. So we ought to listen to Tristan Harris and his campaign. “Religions and governments don’t have that much influence over people’s daily thoughts,” he recently told Wired magazine. “But we have three technology companies” – he meant Facebook, Google and Apple – “who have this system that frankly they don’t even have control over … Right now, 2 billion people’s minds are already jacked in to this automated system, and it’s steering people’s thoughts toward either personalised paid advertising or misinformation or conspiracy theories. And it’s all automated; the owners of the system can’t possibly monitor everything that’s going on, and they can’t control it.” And then came the kicker. “This isn’t some kind of philosophical conversation. This is an urgent concern happening right now.” Amid an ocean of corporate sophistry and doublethink, those words have the distinct ring of truth. • John Harris is a Guardian columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/dec/29/the-guardian-view-on-quantum-computing-the-new-space-race","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-29T18:28:49Z","webTitle":"The Guardian view on quantum computing: the new space race | Editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/29/the-guardian-view-on-quantum-computing-the-new-space-race","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/29/the-guardian-view-on-quantum-computing-the-new-space-race","fields":{"headline":"The Guardian view on quantum computing: the new space race","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The Washington Post’s columnist David Ignatius moonlights as a pacey novelist. His latest book, The Quantum Spy, is a thriller that touches upon the space race of our times: the great power contest to develop a quantum computer, able to work so fast that it can crack today’s uncrackable codes. Such a machine would be revolutionary. Modern e-commerce depends on encryption to protect confidential information. It is used to authenticate our identities and ensure the integrity of the data. To be able to break such codes would expose us all. Ignatius’s fiction is grounded in fact: the US National Institute of Standards and Technology thinks that within 15 years the first quantum computer will emerge to defeat the most prevalent forms of encryption. However, cryptography remains a game of cat and mouse between codemakers and codebreakers. As fast as one group creates codes, another tries to break them. Unbreakable ciphers sometimes fall short. “Post-quantum cryptography” already exists, even before quantum computers do. Earlier this year academics suggested, controversially, that they had solved the maths to make “quantum-resistant” the main cryptography used on the internet. The main use of quantum technology might not be to hack existing systems but to create unbreakable protection for communication networks of the future. China claims to have launched such a network this year. The main takeaway from Ignatius’s book is that China’s advances in quantum technologies might have the potential to undermine vital aspects of US power.

In 2018, he could even stop Brexit","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"This was the year France won and Britain lost. Emmanuel Macron emerged to transform a sclerotic political scene, dazzling the world and many in his country with a youthful energy that made French rejuvenation a buzzword. Theresa May stumbled from one hiccup to the next, rushing to Washington for an awkward meeting with Donald Trump, triggering article 50 with no plan for the aftermath, and losing her majority in parliament. Macron made headlines with slogans such as “Let’s make the planet great again”. May’s mantras – from “global Britain” to “Brexit means Brexit” – backfired or seemed to go nowhere. Macron secured a solid base in the national assembly for his upstart La Republique en Marche party. He made sweeping, lyrical speeches about Europe, heralding a new era of empowerment and European sovereignty. May went to Florence, in a worthy attempt to build bridges with Europe, despite everything. But what mostly got noted was that the UK would pay its dues to the EU – an early sign of bowing to the inevitable as her Brexit negotiating team prepared to align itself with conditions laid out by Brussels. For these two former global, colonial powers who must now grapple with a fast-changing world where punching above your weight is no longer so easy, this year surely marked Gallic triumph and British misery. But would the French be right to gloat? If things continue like this in 2018, no one will stand to gain. Granted, Europe has other powerful players, not least Germany, but the relationship between these two large neighbours across the Channel matters all the same. The French have always faced accusations of arrogance, tempted as they’ve been to see Europe as an extension of their country. And many Brits were always only half-convinced – if half-informed – about what the EU was all about in the first place (not just a single market). History and domestic politics accounts for much of this. But France has a lot to lose if Britain turns its back on Europe. To say “good riddance”, as former French prime minister Michel Rocard once said, is short-sightedness. Brexit has now become a process so tedious and drawn out that we’ve almost forgotten the shock of that morning of 24 June 2016. Parts of France’s establishment have long thought of Britain as a contrarian force in the European club. De Gaulle was right to block the British, goes that line of thought. For one thing, British-led EU enlargement to the east – in fact, Europe’s reunification – diluted France’s sense of being the indispensable cornerstone. Europe’s centre of gravity shifted to Berlin, and in the following decade, Germany did much better than France. So it has been tempting for some in Paris to relish the thought of going back to some sort of “core” Europe model: a cosy group holding close to the vision of the “founding fathers” of the 1950s. This won’t fly. The world has changed. Europe has changed. Forces that have the potential to undermine it have not dissipated – from Moscow to Ankara, from entrenched populist movements to the cyber-world, from migration to the many impacts of unregulated globalisation. For all the talk about Europe surviving (or even being galvanised by) Brexit and Trump, Britain’s current crash course out of the EU remains as damaging a move for all as it was deemed to be 18 months ago. Brexit will represent the first European breakup in 60 years – a wound whose ultimate consequences we have yet to fathom. Britain is rocked by polarisation and internal divisions, but it remains a strong democracy – carrying values that today can hardly be taken for granted. Given this, France and Britain have special responsibilities, not least in the UN, where the very principle of international cooperation is under threat. Some of those who think Brexit can be made to work will believe the cracks in the liberal order it will open up can be papered over. But there will be a cost. Authoritarians and fanatics alike are waiting to capitalise. If Macron really is the saviour of Europe he wants to be, then he should say something to help to prevent Brexit. Why couldn’t his eloquence and daring be deployed? A window of opportunity may open up next summer, when it will become increasingly clear that Brexit is a near-impossible task, both in scale and in timing. This is not to suggest France should move to carve out new conditions or exceptions for Britain – that simply won’t happen. The EU, in these Brexit talks, is focused on its self-preservation as a bloc, and that includes a big “no” to a bespoke deal that might transform the single market into gruyere cheese: full of holes. In 2016, Barack Obama, a man Macron in many ways likes to imitate, delivered a speech in Hanover addressed not to governments but to “the people of Europe”. It is striking that, as Europe’s leaders keep talking of “unity”, they mostly tend to reach out to their domestic, national constituencies. Macron has shown he can look beyond. Why not reach out to the British people in this historic moment? Why not say: we would like you to stay, we are not seeking to benefit from your departure nor to harm you, and we still have so much to achieve together? Why not say: some of the trends that led to Brexit, among them inequality and a broken social fabric, are problems France and others on the continent also have to deal with? Why not plunge into historical references in which the salvation of France was made possible thanks to Britain’s courage, and now, nearly 80 years on, show French courage in return? Yes, there are risks attached to this. Hardline Brexiters will scream about external meddling – even worse that it comes from the sneaky French. The radical left will perhaps point to Macron’s banking past. Many Britons may well just shrug. But some may also rethink, and feel that maybe Brexit doesn’t have to happen. What does Macron have to lose? At the moment, the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, can’t deliver such a speech because she is tied up with domestic uncertainties. With Germany still unclear about its choices, Macron’s eurozone reform plans have little hope of taking shape next year, if ever. But he can really make a difference – and a groundbreaking one – in becoming the first, strong continental voice to make the case for stopping Brexit’s collective wrecking ball. If that happened, 2018 would be a Franco-British success story, not a messy divorce.

Possible outgoings Jiri Skalak (loan), Jamie Murphy (loan). Estimated budget £15m. BF Burnley Burnley are in a strong position, they have a small but effective squad and have shown themselves able to compete. Money is available should Sean Dyche wish to strengthen – last January they spent a club record £13m on Robbie Brady, who is now out injured for the rest of the season – although short-term fixes are unlikely. Dyche prefers to identify targets who will fit in with the rest of the squad and bring them in when they become available. Panic buying is not Burnley’s style. Possible signings Maybe a wide player to cover for Brady’s absence. Central defence is also a potential area of concern. Possible outgoings None seem imminent. Estimated budget Up to £20m. Paul Wilson Chelsea Chelsea will effectively resume where they left off back in August, attempting to persuade Ross Barkley to join from Everton and then seeking to recruit a new left wing-back to compete with Marcos Alonso. Juventus’s Alex Sandro, targeted in the summer, may be more inclined to move now, although it is the potential pursuit of Monaco’s Thomas Lemar that is most intriguing. The France international has been courted by clubs in England and the reigning Ligue 1 champions, now with Michael Emenalo as their sporting director after he decided to leave a similar role at Stamford Bridge, may consider a sale albeit for a hefty price. Certainly, Antonio Conte will be pushing for significant reinforcements. Possible signings Ross Barkley (Everton), Thomas Lemar (Monaco), Alex Sandro (Juventus), Philipp Max (Augsburg), Alex Telles (Porto). Possible outgoings Charly Musonda, David Luiz, Michy Batshuayi. Estimated budget Roman Abramovich will find funds. Dominic Fifield Crystal Palace Palace will have to revisit their significant mid-season spending of last term if they are to stave off the threat of relegation, with transfer funds “ringfenced” according to the chairman, Steve Parish, and at least three major arrivals expected. The sporting director, Dougie Freedman, has been charged with securing the deals. The manager, Roy Hodgson, said: “We have only got two goalkeepers in the club, which is nowhere near enough for Premier League football. We have only one recognised centre-forward and, in central midfield, we don’t have the amount of cover that is necessary at this level.” Three signings would be ideal. Possible signings Tomas Holy (Gillingham), Kevin Trapp (PSG), Diego López (Espanyol), Khouma Babacar (Fiorentina), Danny Ings (Liverpool), Harry Arter (Bournemouth), Islam Slimani (Leicester), Gareth Barry (West Bromwich Albion). Possible outgoings Patrick van Aanholt, Jordon Mutch, Lee Chung-yong, Timothy Fosu-Mensah (possible loan return), Freddie Ladapo. Estimated budget The club’s major shareholders will find the funds required. DF Everton The pressure is on the director of football, Steve Walsh, to finally produce a replacement for Romelu Lukaku. Ronald Koeman made repeated calls for a proven striker to be included in Everton’s £140m overhaul of their squad in the summer and paid with his job when one did not materialise, and the team floundered. His successor, Sam Allardyce, has reiterated that request and is also seeking left-sided defensive cover – another Koeman wish – while looking to trim what he considers a bloated squad. Possible signings Cenk Tosun (Besiktas), Patrick van Aanholt (Crystal Palace), Steven N’Zonzi (Sevilla). Possible outgoings Ross Barkley, Davy Klaassen, Sandro Ramírez, Oumar Niasse, Kevin Mirallas, Muhamed Besic. Estimated budget £40m, plus player sales. Andy Hunter Huddersfield Town The club will go into January without a head of football operations, having decided there was no need to rush into an appointment after the departure of David Moss from the role in October. With most of last summer’s record outlay of £40m looking shrewd, major recruitment does not seem to be an urgent requirement, although some positions could do with strengthening. The injury to Elias Kachunga makes a dangerous wide player more of a priority. A central creator would also be welcome, given Kasey Palmer’s injury trouble so far this season, and there is also scope for improving cover for the central defensive pair of Christopher Schindler and Mathias Jorgensenin the centre of defence. Possible signings Ben Woodburn on loan (Liverpool), Terence Kongolo (Monaco). Possible outgoings None planned but interest in Christopher Schindler would be no surprise. Estimated budget £20m. Paul Doyle Leicester City After spending heavily in the summer and climbing up the table on the back of Claude Puel’s appointment in October, Leicester are under no real pressure to throw money at this window, especially as they have a new signing to come into the team in the shape of Adrien Silva, whose £22m move from Sporting Lisbon on deadline day failed to go through in time. One area where Leicester would like to strengthen is at right-back but that is more of a long-term target. Possible signings André Almeida ( Benfica). Possible outgoings Islam Slimani, Ahmed Musa. Estimated budget £15m. Stuart James Liverpool Jürgen Klopp’s patience, and Liverpool’s financial largesse, has paid off with the defensive world record £75m acquisition of Virgil van Dijk from Southampton, the manager’s backline priority from the summer. Another target from the previous window, Monaco’s Thomas Lemar, could also be revisited this month but the most important business is keeping Philippe Coutinho. Liverpool have stood firm in the face of Barcelona’s dogged pursuit and will be expected to maintain that stance with a place in the last 16 of the Champions League secure. Possible signings Thomas Lemar (Monaco). Possible outgoings Danny Ings, Daniel Sturridge, Marko Grujic, Lazar Markovic, Ben Woodburn, Harry Wilson. Estimated budget £100m, plus player sales. AH Manchester City What do you buy for the runaway, record-breaking leaders? A centre-back to cover the glaring weakness in a department that includes the chronically injured Vincent Kompany, the currently injured John Stones and the for-sale Eliaquim Mangala. Pep Guardiola is keen to recruit for the position as he continues to compete in all four competitions, including the Champions League, which the manager is intent on impressing in after last season’s dismal last-16 exit. If he fails to strengthen he will be disappointed. And might striking backup be required given the injury to Gabriel Jesus? Possible signings Jonny Evans (West Bromwich Albion), Alexis Sánchez (Arsenal). Possible outgoings Eliaquim Mangala. Estimated budget £100m-plus. Jamie Jackson Manchester United José Mourinho needs a prolific finisher to share the burden with Romelu Lukaku because of his side’s profligacy in front of goal but whether he will move in January is in the balance. He admires Arsenal’s Mesut Özil, who is out of contract in the summer, but the German is hardly renowned for his finishing. Fulham’s 17-year-old Ryan Sessegnon is another potential recruit, although he would be a signing for the future. It is worth adding that Mourinho is no fan of the winter window. Possible signings Mesut Özil (Arsenal), Ryan Sessegnon (Fulham). Possible outgoings No one, although for the right player Henrikh Mkhitaryan could be a makeweight in any deal. Estimated budget £100m-plus. JJ Newcastle United In an ideal world, Rafael Benítez would sign a goalkeeper, a left-back, a winger, a No10 and a prolific centre-forward. In reality, Newcastle United is not nirvana and Amanda Staveley’s mooted takeover is still to be completed, leaving Mike Ashley controlling the purse strings. Benítez has told the current owner that, without reinforcement, the team will be in real relegation peril this month but Ashley is a high-stakes gambler; will he heed the warning? Let alone the manager’s demand that all transfer business be completed by 20 January. Possible incomings Uncertain but expect two domestic loans, including Kenedy, the Chelsea left winger. Possible outgoings Jack Colback, Aleksandar Mitrovic. Estimated budget Unclear. Benítez was hoping for £20m but seems likely to have to settle for considerably less. Louise Taylor Southampton With Virgil van Dijk finally heading to Liverpool for a £75m fee, Mauricio Pellegrino is targeting at least two signings in a bid to avoid a relegation battle. Despite Van Dijk’s departure, the priority will be to add firepower and attacking creativity, and there are big names available who may be tempted by the chance of pre-World Cup game time. With plenty of underachievers already in his squad and dissent from supporters growing, Pellegrino must choose his new recruits wisely. Possible signings Daniel Sturridge (Liverpool), Olivier Giroud and Theo Walcott (Arsenal), Luke Shaw (Manchester United), Nicolás Gaitán (Atlético Madrid). Possible outgoings Ryan Bertrand, Matt Targett. Estimated budget £30m, with some players arriving on loan. Niall McVeigh Stoke City The club have not spent particularly heavily nor particularly well in recent transfer windows but recognise that a failure to trade smart in January would leave them at risk of relegation. They can ill afford more mistakes and they will be keen to bat off any inquiries for Joe Allen or Jack Butland. The most porous defence in the Premier League would benefit, in particular, from a solid right-back, enhanced cover in the centre and better protection from midfield. Up front Mark Hughes has long lacked a sharp striker. And there is a shortage of pace in all areas. Overall, the sense is the club will aim to solve their problems on the cheap and ultimately that will be their downfall. Possible signings Kyle Walker-Peters (Tottenham), Danny Ings (Liverpool). Possible outgoings Joe Allen, Saido Berahino. Estimated budget £15m plus loanees. PD Swansea City Favourites to be relegated, Swansea need to spend a small fortune to address all the weaknesses in their ill-equipped squad to have any chance of survival, yet the only money that will be made available in this window is the surplus cash left over from the summer. A creative midfielder, a winger and a proven striker are all priorities for the Premier League’s most toothless team. But, realistically, what calibre of player can Swansea hope to attract? Possible signings André Ayewand Diafra Sakho (West Ham), Andy Yiadom (Barnsley). Possible outgoings Alfie Mawson, Oli McBurnie, Ki Sung-yueng. Estimated budget £10m-£20m. SJ Tottenham Hotspur Mauricio Pochettino has the full complement of 17 foreign players in his Champions League squad and that is before Érik Lamela is reintegrated. It means somebody will be squeezed out, possibly Georges-Kévin Nkoudou, and that Pochettino will prioritise the English market for any signings. The manager has said he would like to use January to prepare for the more important summer window, when quick business will be essential, so he would be open to a Dele Alli-style signing with a loan-back option. Possible signings Ross Barkley (Everton), Ryan Sessegnon (Fulham). Possible outgoings Georges-Kévin Nkoudou. Estimated budget £25m. DH Watford The club will assess Nathaniel Chalobah’s recuperation from a knee injury – he is expected to return in late January – before deciding whether they need to recruit a defensive midfielder. They are also seeking alternative options in attack but are not expecting to conduct significant business unless one of their long-term targets becomes available or a particularly lucrative sale boosts their budget. They will not sell any regular members of the starting XI but fringe players are available. Possible signings Pontus Dahlberg (IFK Gothenberg). Possible outgoings Étienne Capoue, Isaac Success, Stefano Okaka, Brice Dja Djédjé. Estimated budget Less than £10m, with loans preferred unless there are significant sales. Simon Burnton West Bromwich Albion Alan Pardew will have nothing like the lavish transfer pot Tony Pulis was afforded in the summer but his priorities are clear enough. West Brom need a striker and, perhaps, someone else who can play across the frontline or in behind. Neither would come cheap and difficult decisions may be required in order to do the right deals. Jonny Evans remains sought-after and Pardew has admitted he must be “realistic” about the centre-back’s future. Grzegorz Krychowiak, a thus-far unsuccessful loan signing from PSG, could yet return six months early in order to free up more cash. Possible signings Aleksandar Mitrovic (Newcastle), Danny Ings (Liverpool), Rajiv van La Parra (Huddersfield). Possible outgoings Grzegorz Krychowiak (return to PSG from loan), Jonny Evans (Arsenal/Manchester United/Everton). Estimated budget £5m to £10m – with the potential to rise if players depart. Nick Ames West Ham United David Moyes is not happy with the balance of his squad and has told his bosses that West Ham must improve their survival hopes by making a few additions. His team have conceded 38 Premier League goals already, so it is not a surprise that Moyes wants to strengthen in defence and midfield before thinking about reinforcements in attack. However, West Ham have disappointed in recent windows. Possible signings Harry Arter (Bournemouth), Lamine Koné (Sunderland), Alfie Mawson (Swansea City), Steven N’Zonzi (Sevilla), André Schürrle (Borussia Dortmund). Possible outgoings Reece Oxford, Diafra Sakho. Estimated budget £25m – unless there are any sales.

On Friday, nine candidates including the incumbent president, Nicos Anastasiades, formally submitted bids to contest the race, the first round of which is scheduled for 28 January. After registering his nomination in Nicosia, the island’s ethnically split capital, Anastasiades told the assembled crowd he had a vision for “a fully European country, and especially a truly free and independent country”. Anastasiades, whose campaign motto is “stability and certainty”, is widely viewed as the frontrunner but not tipped to win outright in the first round, in which case a vote between the top two candidates will be held the following Sunday. The prospect of a nail-biting second round on 4 February has not been ruled out if Nikolas Papadopoulos, who heads the centre-right Diko party, beats Stavros Malas, an independent fielded by the communist party Akel, to make it through to a run-off. Papadopoulos is the son of the late former president Tassos Papadopoulos, and shares his hardline views on reunification. In 2004, Papadopoulos Sr urged Greek Cypriots to vote no in a referendum on a UN plan to bring together the two halves of the island. Addressing supporters on Friday, Papadopoulos said that if victorious, he would use his five-year term in office to “end failed policies and … restore dignity back to our people”. In an Anastasiades-Papadopoulos run-off, much would depend on which way Akel would go as kingmaker. “The big question in these elections is who Anastasiades will face in the second round,” said the veteran Cyprus expert James Ker-Lindsay. “Akel, like Anastasiades’ Disy [party], may be moderate and pro-solution but it also has a history of jumping into bed with Diko if it means winning ministerial posts.” Anastasiades, 71, has made reunification of the tiny Mediterranean island a top priority, with confidants telling the Guardian that peace negotiations would be relaunched by the summer if the leader is re-elected. Talks described as the “best chance ever” of resolving the west’s longest-running diplomatic dispute collapsed spectacularly in July last year amid angry scenes between Greek and Turkish Cypriots in the Swiss mountain resort where they were being held. “A solution is basically there,” said a local commentator, Kyriakos Pierides. “It does not require too much, just political will to sit down and finalise it.” For the first time, a far-right party, Elam, will also contest the presidential election after successfully winning two seats in the 56-seat Greek Cypriot parliament in May 2106. A copycat version of Greece’s neo-nazi party, Golden Dawn, the extremist force has moulded itself as the only authentic opponent of the bi-zonal, bi-communal federation envisaged in settlement talks between Cyprus’s two ethnic communities."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2017/dec/29/newcastle-brighton-match-preview","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-29T14:26:52Z","webTitle":"Newcastle United v Brighton & Hove Albion: match preview","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/dec/29/newcastle-brighton-match-preview","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/dec/29/newcastle-brighton-match-preview","fields":{"headline":"Newcastle United v Brighton & Hove Albion: match preview","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Last season’s Championship top two have enjoyed similar fortunes in the Premier League, with both starting well before fading and then steadying themselves with a victory just before Christmas.

Snow in winter, showers in spring, sun (or at least, sunny intervals) in summer and gales in autumn. Britain’s weather may have been changeable by the day, but the seasons were seemingly set in stone, with a reassuringly predictable regularity. That certainly suited the country’s fauna and flora. Wild animals and plants, and by extension their habitats, evolved to cope with short-term unpredictability and long-term stability. If change did occur, it happened slowly, over decades or centuries; rather than rapidly, in a single year. Now, according to the latest annual report on weather and wildlife from the National Trust, published last week, all that has changed, with the weather in 2017 more topsy-turvy than ever. One of the warmest years on record – globally as well as in the UK – made the four seasons blur into one. This led to what the trust describes as “a freak year for nature”. During the last 12 months, the strange and volatile weather has had serious consequences for wildlife. Spring flowers bloomed in autumn, birds sang in the middle of winter and our seas witnessed an invasion of thousands of portuguese man o’ war, which can give a painful – occasionally even fatal – sting. Autumnal storms hit the coastlines, while mild winter weather at both the start and the end of the year allowed many pests and parasites to run riot. These included the dreaded ash dieback disease, caused by a fungus that thrives in these warmer temperatures. The trust’s veteran nature guru Matthew Oates, who has been documenting the changes in Britain’s wildlife for more than half a century, has never seen anything like it. “Although nature has never been stable, the pace of change is now really quickening. I’m particularly worried about mild winters and damp summers generating excess growth of coarse grasses and other thuggish vegetation – and squeezing out the finer plants and myriad insects that need bare ground.” I’m worried too. I haven’t been watching wildlife as long as Oates, but I have noticed the many changes that have occurred since my own childhood. Then, only the robin regularly sang in the autumn and winter months; yet on a fine day last winter I heard no fewer than seven different species of bird in full spring song. Birds use a number of different cues to begin their breeding cycle, including the gradual increase in daylight (which of course is not affected by the weather), but they also respond to rises in temperature. Starting to breed early is unlikely to pay off: it takes only one cold snap to make food hard to find, so the chicks starve in the nest. Hibernating hedgehogs are now emerging far too early – sometimes on mild days in January or February. Once they have woken up, they are unlikely to cope when the weather turns cold again. Likewise, butterflies such as the small tortoiseshell and peacock, which spend the winter hidden away in my woodshed, are appearing far earlier than they used to, as are bumblebees and many other flying insects. Early springs are horribly risky for these vulnerable creatures. Winter 2016-17 was not all that unusual, though there were a few extended periods of frost or snow, especially in the south. Spring then came early to many parts of Britain, with wild daffodils in bloom as early as February in the south-west. Elder and dog rose – plants we usually see in bloom in June – came into flower in April, two months earlier than expected. Yet they also carried on flowering far longer than normal, with blossoms out well into the autumn. Some insects also fared badly – we may not shed a tear over the lack of wasps this spring and summer, but they are a crucial part of our balanced ecosystems, and their absence should be a cause for concern, not celebration. As Oates points out, for a while it looked as if we would enjoy the best summer for many years. “Then, the schools broke up, the clouds assembled and the UK endured one of the wettest Augusts on record.” We have always experienced autumn gales, but now that we have given each major event a name, they really do seem to be happening more frequently. In October, Storm Ophelia swept across the Atlantic and battered our western coasts. This brought the arrival of the portuguese man o’ war, which washed up in their thousands on beaches from Cumbria to Sussex. Grey seal colonies on the west coasts were hit badly, with newborn pups suffering very high mortality; fortunately, those at more sheltered east coast sites did very well. The autumn’s good news was yet another huge crop of berries, including sloes and hawthorns; but blackberries appeared so early this summer that they were virtually over by the time autumn had begun. Both the high yield and the early appearance of fruit and berries was the result of the fine, early spring. Yet in continental Europe, the seed, nut and berry crop was very poor, bringing a bonus for British birders with an invasion of the rare hawfinch. Plenty of rain in September (the wettest since 2008) meant that 2017 was also a bumper autumn for fungi – especially waxcaps, which came out in force on the Malham estate in Yorkshire. As this mixed bag of reports shows, the weird weather – and by extension generally warmer seasons – is not all bad news for wildlife. A warming climate does create opportunities for species to extend their range northwards in Britain or, for European species able to fly across the Channel, to colonise the UK for the first time. As well as the many species of waterbird now breeding on my home patch on the Somerset Levels – including great white and cattle egrets, little bittern and night heron – many insects are also making the leap across the water from France. One hot, sunny day in July, I visited Longham Lakes, a series of disused gravel pits in Dorset now converted into a thriving nature reserve. There, I spotted two rare dragonflies – lesser emperor and red-veined darter – which are on the verge of becoming permanent colonists here. Others have already beaten them to it: the willow emerald damselfly, which until a decade ago was virtually unknown in Britain, is now breeding across much of south-eastern England, while its cousin the small red-eyed damselfly has reached as far north as the Humber river. But in the longer term, the increasingly unpredictable weather, topsy-turvy seasons and overall warming trend are very bad news for many species; especially those that have evolved to survive in a specialised habitat. These rapid and unprecedented changes in our weather and climate have major implications for nature conservation, too. “Business as usual” is no longer a viable strategy. The people and organisations that manage our nature reserves – and those who look after the wider countryside – must try to predict what might happen in the next few years and then manage habitats to make them as resilient as possible. In the conclusion to his final report on the effects of the year’s weather on our wildlife, Oates strikes a warning note, but also a hopeful one. “Certain species are good at adapting, or moving around, which is great, whereas others are struggling – some of them badly. We need to give wildlife the space, time and where necessary, the support it needs, not only to survive, but also to thrive. I’m extremely worried about some species – especially some of our insects and our native ash trees – but also buoyed by success stories that emerge at National Trust places each year.” Stephen Moss’s latest book is The Robin: a Biography (Square Peg)"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/blog/2017/dec/30/talking-horses-poetic-rhythm-edges-a-small-but-strong-field-at-newbury","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-30T00:01:11Z","webTitle":"Talking Horses: Poetic Rhythm can edge a small but strong field at Newbury","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2017/dec/30/talking-horses-poetic-rhythm-edges-a-small-but-strong-field-at-newbury","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/blog/2017/dec/30/talking-horses-poetic-rhythm-edges-a-small-but-strong-field-at-newbury","fields":{"headline":"Talking Horses: Poetic Rhythm can edge a small but strong field at Newbury","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Saturday’s ITV4 races There are just half a dozen runners in the field for the Grade One Betfred Challow Hurdle at Newbury, but five were winners last time out, all are open to significant improvement and none of them can be ruled out entirely. At least three could conceivably set off as favourite, including Kilbricken Storm, who beat a small field to land a Grade Two at Cheltenham’s International meeting. He looked beaten there before stamina kicked in, however, and a drop back to two-and-a-half miles here may not be what he needs. Poetic Rhythm (3.00) is the only runner who did not win last time, but his close third behind On The Blind Side at Cheltenham was franked when the winner followed up in a strong race at Sandown. This looks like his trip and he looks an excellent bet at around 3-1 to give the up-and-coming Fergal O’Brien his first Grade One success. Newbury 1.50 Heavy ground is an unknown for the two at the top of the market, Huntsman Son and Brave Eagle, so Dynamite Dollars looks a decent alternative at around 5-1. Paul Nicholls’s runner was a close third on heavy going at Haydock in November, and ran with credit until a late mistake in a Grade Two at Sandown last time. Haydock 2.10 A gruelling slog in prospect, which should suit Emperor’s Choice ideally. He took the 2014 Welsh National winner off 131 in desperate conditions, is down to a mark of 124 now and should be sharper for his comeback run over this course and distance in November. Newbury 2.25 Back To The Thatch made an inauspicious debut over fences in November but looked like a different horse next time up as he finished a close second at Haydock. Henry Daly’s runner races off the same mark here, will hopefully improve again and the ground holds no fears. Haydock 2.45 The career of Church Hall has been interrupted by several long layoffs, but he was a ready winner on his belated chasing debut at Lingfield in November. A 10lb rise in the ratings may not be enough to stop him with improvement likely on what is just his 15th start at the age of nine. Newbury 3.35 Rocklander got no further than the first fence before unseating his rider in a Grade Two last time out, but would have a big chance on the form of his chasing debut at Ludlow, never mind some fine runs over timber. The favourite’s jumping is a worry though so the front-running Solighoster could put him under pressure, and Neil Mulholland’s runner also has three previous wins on heavy ground. Taunton 3.15 A intriguing and competitive race despite the small field. Even rank outsider She’s Gina has snippets of Flat form – sixth place in the German Oaks, for instance – that suggest she might make a decent hurdler, but Maria’s Benefit and Sunshade have the proven form over timber and the former is narrowly preferred having stopped the clock in a useful time at Ludlow earlier this month.

Standing on the edges of an artificial-turf indoor football pitch at Arsenal’s stadium complex in north London, I vainly attempt to kick a ball at the assembled huddle of Centrepoint residents, all wearing sensible kit and studded boots, while I’ve plumped for knee-high suede boots. The ball veers away wildly and one of the 24 young people jogs to retrieve it. The group are here, a few days before Christmas, for their final session of a scheme that melds employability and confidence training with sport and exercise. Once a week, for two months, the young women and men come to Arsenal in the kit provided, spending half the session in a small room, discussing interview techniques, tactics for searching for work, application skills, and building confidence. Craig, one of three trainers working with the group, says: “You can look at a benchpress and say I’m going to lift 200kg, but you’ve got to start somewhere.” Confidence is particularly important: many Centrepoint residents have been through traumatic periods, often repeatedly, and treated with disdain and even violence. Even if their personal circumstances weren’t already confidence destroying, the stigma around homelessness is endemic and can become self-defeating. Mixing jobs talk with football helps with this: as well the health benefits, even the most shy members of the group open up and shout suggestions in the complex team games on the pitch. Without teamwork and talking together their action plans to win can never be realised: being confident enough to talk to strangers is difficult for lots of young homeless people – and a job interview is precisely that, with particularly high stakes. Talisha became homeless after a breakdown in the relationship with her mother. After six months of sleeping on friends’ sofas, she found Centrepoint, the youth homeless charity and a beneficiary of the 2017 Guardian and Observer charity appeal. After completing the Arsenal training course earlier in the year, she represented England at the Homeless World Cup in Oslo. “Last year I was sheepish, but it brought me out of my shell. Now I talk to anyone,” she says, taking a break from training. “I learn new things off them, they learn new things off me.” All participants point out one of the main things is how much people share about their experiences, and how this bolsters their confidence when speaking to new people. Craig explains that for those who go on to compete in the international competitions, there’s often a lot of press attention, which can be overwhelming – they use the opportunity to do workshops on resilience, to help them consider what they can learn from such situations, and how they can use new skills to overcome problems in later life. While the course may only be eight weeks, the work between Centrepoint and Arsenal continues. All of those attending are looking for work, and Arsenal’s links with the local economy are huge: if people want to work in retailing, catering, event planning or anything around the stadium, the trainers know where to point them. But they’re realistic: when someone inevitably suggests they’d like to coach a Premier League team, the coaches point out there are very few coaching jobs in the country at all, and those that do exist are both unbelievably competitive, and take years of work to attain. Several want to look for jobs in security, and the football club and Centrepoint have the contacts and resources to ensure they can get the accredited badge for such work. But, as Craig tells the group, “if you try something and don’t like it, we won’t force you to continue down that route. That’s not going to help you.” One of the women tells me she secured a few paid trial shifts in a shop, then realised she was completely unsuited to retailing. She is now looking into youth work as a possible career path, something she hadn’t considered before coming to Arsenal and observing how the trainers helped people, but also clearly enjoyed their jobs deeply. Aidan became homeless at 20, fleeing a forced marriage. She came to Centrepoint after sofa-surfing for five months. “All the workshops have a theme: teamwork, responsibility, communication. But meeting new people is a big thing, becoming more confident. I want to go into film now,” she tells me. She is currently at college completing an animation and film-making course. Savannah says: “My big fear at the beginning was that there were loads of boys. But I just got on with it, and worked to overcome my shyness. I usually avoid big groups, but it’s made me more confident.” Charlie was reluctant to join the scheme at first: “The first fear for me was that I was told it was mandatory to wear an Arsenal top.” As an ardent Spurs fan, he’s overcome that barrier by wearing the rival team’s socks for the training session. “We work on team-work, communication skills, and I was pretty confident before but it definitely does improve your confidence, and it’s different. I’m talking about coaching and other work with youth groups now. I know the ins and outs of gangs, so I can use that knowledge for good.” Charlie clearly admires the coaches working with Centrepoint and Arsenal and wants to return the favour: throughout the team games, he encourages and chats to a woman who doesn’t seem keen to participate, but is fully involved by the end, with his gentle prodding. On completion of the course, each member is individually applauded as they collect their certificate, and an A4-size portrait of themselves taken by the official Arsenal team photographer. The photos are transformative, atmospheric and really make the men and women look fantastic. Most people pretend not to be bowled over, but furtively gaze at them in awe when they think eyes are elsewhere. But there’s one more perk: a tour of the stadium. Through the directors’ box, the changing rooms, the players’ entrance and the stands, they ask questions and take selfies and videos of themselves next to statues and team shirts. The laughter and enthusiasm is infectious: the scheme may have ended now, but they seem far happier, and have enjoyed being welcomed into places that would normally be closed to them. • Support our three chosen charities by donating here."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2017/dec/31/domestic-stories-restless-ghosts-a-house-through-time-david-olusoga-social-history","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-31T00:03:15Z","webTitle":"Slave trader’s home, slum, des res: the stories of one house raise restless ghosts","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/dec/31/domestic-stories-restless-ghosts-a-house-through-time-david-olusoga-social-history","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2017/dec/31/domestic-stories-restless-ghosts-a-house-through-time-david-olusoga-social-history","fields":{"headline":"Slave trader’s home, slum, des res: the stories of one house raise restless ghosts","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"All old houses are haunted. Not by ghosts but by the lives of others. Because to live in an old house is to share your most intimate space with the dead. Houses live longer than people and the harsh fact is that we are just passing through. Our homes, the most acutely personal places in our lives, come to us secondhand, and invisibly link us to people we have never met, people to whom we have no association other than a single shared connection to place. I have been thinking about this recently because I spent last autumn engaged in a unique television experiment. We set out to discover if it was possible to take a single house and, through old newspapers, documents in the archives and whatever other clues or scraps of evidence we could find, tell the story of all the people who live there; from the day the first resident turned the key in the front door, all the way up to today. The house selected is a Georgian-style terrace in what is now called the Georgian Quarter of Liverpool. I write “Georgian-style” because it was built in 1840, the third year of Victoria’s reign. Although large, elegant and, in the early 21st century, extremely desirable, it is not unique. There are hundreds like it in Liverpool and many thousands more across the country. But, after months of investigations, what the researchers who began this project discovered was that it was possible, in the case of 62 Falkner Street, to form a chain of human stories stretching from then to now, from the first resident to the current owner. The lives of all of the people whose stories make up the links in that chain run through the house, because, for each of them, walking through that front door meant that they were home. Across the four episodes of A House Through Time we uncover their stories, and that of the city in which they lived. More than any other British city, Liverpool’s ride on the rollercoaster of national fortune has been a bumpy one. No other city has been more buffeted by the cycles of boom and bust and, perhaps unsurprisingly, the place that once proudly saw itself as the “second city of empire” suffered more than any other when that empire suddenly evaporated. The extremes of Liverpool’s story are reflected in the lives of the occupants of 62 Falkner Street. They span the social spectrum, from the well-to-do Victorian gentlemen to the families who huddled together in single rooms during the decades after the second world war when the house degenerated into a tenement slum. Part of the aim of A House is to answer the question that everyone who has ever lived in an old house has – at some time or another – asked themselves. The thought usually comes late at night or early in the morning, when our eye is caught by what estate agents like to call an “original feature”, or a patch of peeling wallpaper or flaking paint reveals what lies beneath. Those triggers remind us that the buildings we confidently call ours once belonged to others; many and multiple others. History is about people. Historians who don’t get that tend to be the ones who struggle to get anyone to care about their work. Ultimately you have to care about the people you encounter through your research, if you want anyone else to. But it is all too easy to start caring about figures from the past if you find yourself reading the documents that record their lives while sitting in what was once their kitchen. Or having just walked up a staircase, holding the wooden banister that their hands once gripped. To read their letters from within the house in which they were written, or to hold in your hands their death certificates, while standing on their front steps or in their bedroom, is a strangely intimate experience. A close encounter between historian and subject. Reading the grim details of a Victorian domestic violence case, while walking through the rooms in which those beatings and beratings took place, felt almost voyeuristic. Too close and a little too real for comfort. To talk about the past residents of the house, to make judgments about them, to sum up their achievements or discuss their failings, from the upstairs sitting room in which they showed off their wealth and entertained their guests one and a half centuries earlier, felt a little presumptuous and almost transgressive. Historians love to talk about how we can get closer to the people of the past, but when it happens of its own volition the effects can be unnerving. There is no official register of historians. No list from which practitioners of the art can be struck off for professional misconduct. I’ve recently found myself grateful for this omission because of all the historical projects I have worked on, none has made it so easy to cross lines, or so tempting to overstep marks. I have found myself marvelling at my capacity to feel genuine dislike for men who died over a century before my birth. To pass judgment on anyone – living or dead – on the basis of a handful of letters and ledger entries is palpably unfair and arguably ridiculous, and yet, in this case, almost impossible to resist. The enmity I feel towards the trader in slave-produced cotton who lived in the house, and whose personal life was lived with as much callous disregard for others as his professional life, is real and involuntary. This is a man I know only from a cache of damning official documents and – incredibly – a surviving portrait in oil paint. Only a kangaroo court in a one-party state would pass judgment on the basis of such flimsy evidence. Yet over the months my disdain for this ghost from the archives has grown, despite my attempts at professional detachment. I have been equally surprised at my capacity to feel sympathy and empathy for the sufferings of people whom I only know from patchy documentary evidence. When I discovered that one late-Victorian resident of the house had died of heart failure, caused by years living under the shadow of a thyroid condition known as Graves’ disease, I was astonished by how emotional – rather than objective and professional – was my response to her story. By way of an excuse, and by chance, I spent four years living with the same disease. A few days after reading the 1880s death certificate of Esther Lublin I found myself alone in my office, on the top floor of my house, reading old diaries, remembering how painful it had been. I had feared that Graves’ disease would waste years of my life, before modern treatments could bring it under control. For her there were few options. She must have known that, sooner or later, the condition would kill her. Two people with the same disease. I lived, she died – because we were born in different centuries. Nothing about this can be said to be truly revelatory. We all know that until the 20th century billions died of diseases for which cures now exist. But knowing the historical facts and the bleak statistics is very different to reading of Esther Lublin’s tragic life, our shared diagnosis, her name and age – younger than I am now – scrawled on to her death certificate by a busy doctor. History, to me, is all about those shiver-down-the-spine moments. When you hold in your hands an object created hundreds of years before your birth and feel the vague presence of the hands that held it in the past. Or when your boot turns over a piece of shrapnel on a first world war battlefield and you have to stop yourself speculating about what that muddy chunk of steel might have done to flesh and bone. Many historians I admire admit to such moments, although those admissions are to be made only in private and to other similarly afflicted historians or students. But they are what draws us to the archives and set us off on early morning trips across overgrown cemeteries. Historians have to be nosy, they have to want to know what others experienced. Part of that is achieved by being open to at least trying to feel something of what they felt. If walls could talk it would be our homes – not our grand public buildings – that would have all the best stories. The real stuff of human life – love, childhood, vulnerability, intimacy, betrayal, acceptance and pain – is revealed behind closed doors and drawn curtains. It is at home, with our partners, parents and children, that we are genuinely ourselves. The version of history I was taught at school was largely one of great men and great deeds, a history that took place in palaces and battlefields. It was silent about our shared, inner and domestic histories, the stories of the rest of us, the ungreat, who live quietly and privately in anonymous terraced houses.

Remarkably, 2017 was also hotter than 2015, which at the time was by far the hottest year on record thanks in part to a strong El Niño event that year. For comparison, the neutral El Niño conditions and the level of solar activity in 1972 were quite similar to those in 2017. 45 years later, the latter was 0.9°C hotter than the former. For each type of year – La Niña, El Niño, and neutral – the global surface warming trend between 1964 and 2017 is 0.17–0.18°C per decade, which is consistent with climate model predictions. It’s déjà vu all over again I’ve been writing for the Guardian for almost 5 years now, and every year I’ve had to write a similar headline or two: 2013 was the second-hottest year without an El Niño since before 1850 Global warming made 2014 a record hot year Record hot 2015 gave us a glimpse at the future of global warming We just broke the record for hottest year, nine straight times Global warming continues; 2016 will be the hottest year ever recorded 2017 is so far the second-hottest year on record thanks to global warming Those early years were the height of the denier frenzy about the mythical global warming ‘hiatus.’ At the time, John Abraham and I frequently wrote pieces pointing out that while various factors were temporarily dampening global surface warming, the oceans (which absorb over 90% of the excess heat from the increased greenhouse effect) continued warming rapidly. Climate scientists predicted this rapid temperature rise It was only a matter of time until short-term effects stopped holding back the rise of Earth’s surface temperatures. That’s now happened, and as a result we’re seeing unleashed global warming causing record temperatures year after year. In fact, in February 2014 I wrote about a study that predicted this would happen: the [ocean] heat uptake is by no means permanent: when the trade wind strength returns to normal - as it inevitably will - our research suggests heat will quickly accumulate in the atmosphere. So global temperatures look set to rise rapidly out of the hiatus, returning to the levels projected within as little as a decade. Temperatures have in fact risen so quickly, it appears to have taken just a few years for that prediction to come true and for the denier focus on the short-term surface warming slowdown to look quite foolish. 2017 – a year of climate denial Speaking of climate denial, on the 362nd day of the hottest year on record without an El Niño, the US president tweeted this: Climate scientist Sarah Myhre aptly described the tweet as “Phenomenally dumb,” for several obvious reasons. Trump also began the process of withdrawing the US from the Paris Climate Agreement in 2017, leaving America as the only country in the world denying the urgent need to address global warming. Fortunately, every other nation is taking action to mitigate this existential threat, but there’s a shocking gap between reality and the ‘fake news’ beliefs of arguably the most powerful man in the world. Feeling the burn of climate change consequences America was also battered by climate-fueled extreme weather events in 2017. Research has already shown that global warming boosted Hurricane Harvey’s record rainfall (and associated flooding) by about 38%. California’s record wildfire season was similarly fueled by the state’s hot summer. The southwestern states were cooked by record hot summer temperatures this year, and global warming is making droughts in America and Europe worse. America was hit by 15 billion-dollar weather and climate disasters in 2017, and it will likely be the costliest such year on record once all of the hurricane damages are tallied. These extreme weather events are expensive. Until we manage to cut global carbon pollution, temperatures will continue to rise and climate change consequences will become more severe. While it broke many of today’s records, 2017 is just a taste of what’s to come."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/dec/31/look-behind-you-nadine-dorries-no-killjoys-here","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-31T00:05:15Z","webTitle":"Look behind you, Nadine Dorries.

No killjoys here","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"For the first time in many years, I spent Christmas in London, rather than travelling to a rural part of a nearby country, the Republic of Ireland. That journey, usually undertaken in a car jam-packed with presents, booze and foodstuffs not readily available to my extended family Over There – specifically, Marks &amp; Spencer yum yums and pork pies – has its own traditions: ensuring that Manic Street Preachers’ Motorcycle Emptiness is playing as we swoop past the fire-breathing chimneys of the Port Talbot steelworks, chips in the cafe at Fishguard and, once safely on the other side, prayers of gratitude to the European Union monies that have transformed the road from Rosslare up through Enniscorthy. This last, of course, is a conversation for another day. But this year was different. Marooned in the Big Smoke, I cast around for new traditions and reanimated some elderly ones. But, as the Conservative MP Nadine Dorries was all too eager to inform me, such apparently minor ambitions are slipping beyond our grasp in these wicked times. And not only that: it was my fault! Me, a leftwing snowflake, fully signed up to “killing comedy… dumbing down panto, removing Christ from Christmas and suppressing free speech”. And I thought all I wanted was a few days off in which sipping port during the day and never getting properly dressed were not only acceptable but compulsory. Naturally, the first thing I did to try to mend my ways was go to church. In fact, I went to hear the carols at Westminster Abbey, courtesy of some friends who had made me a present of two tickets, friends who are not, in fact, British nationals, but seem nonetheless capable of appreciating the capital’s historic buildings and the UK’s world-famous and much-vaunted talent for ceremony. Blow me if there didn’t still seem to be plenty of Christ around. He cropped up pretty frequently in the seven readings from the Bible and in hymns that as far as I could tell hadn’t been adapted to a modern, godless age: the lowly cattle shed was still in royal David’s city, frosty wind was still moaning in the bleak midwinter and shepherds were still being summoned to his cradle, in blatant disregard of new-fangled health and safety laws about the abandonment of sheep. For someone who normally spends her Eire-side trips being the only Protestant in the village, it was pretty hardcore Anglican. And lo! Something properly Christmassy happened as we took our seats, when a pair of complete strangers couldn’t keep to themselves the news that they had become grandparents for the first time an hour previously. “She’s telling everyone we meet,” said the woman’s husband, fondly; a couple of minutes later, he had his phone out and everyone within a 10-seat radius was cooing over blurry photographs. Admittedly, we went off-piste on Christmas Eve and visited a salt beef bar. What can I tell you, old stick in the muds? We needed latkes. On Christmas Day, we went for our traditional bracing walk in the car, which took us through a windy, grey London thronging with tourists. (“How do you know they’re tourists?” asked the wise man of our party. “Nobody’s got a dog.” Also, there were a lot of selfie sticks and cagoules.) On Tower Bridge, we saw another stalwart of British life, the ice-cream van, cheerfully dispensing extra-large cones of Mr Whippy with seasonal Flakes. If only there had been a donkey, for a full-on mash-up of traditions. But there were also moments of particularly personal significance. As a child, I didn’t see much of my dad on Christmas Days; he was busy making sure that other people got their turkey dinners in whichever restaurant or hotel he was working in at the time. When he finally came home, a condensed version of everyone else’s day – indeed, perhaps rather the better for the truncation – was enacted: presents, dinner, chocolates, cherry brandy. But Boxing Day was the real deal. In autumn, we’d start circling pantomimes and shows in the back of the London Evening Standard, finally choosing one – over the years, Winnie-the-Pooh, The Wind in the Willows, The Mousetrap. And then, we’d all put our best clothes on and travel from Essex or, latterly, the outer suburbs of south-west London, up to the West End, my dad’s pockets stuffed with Christmas tips from spirited customers. Tea was taken at the Ritz, Britvic orange juice – the height of 1970s luxury – ordered in theatre bars, black taxis taken, my parents paying it forward by themselves tipping generously at each point. This year, I revived the family custom and off we went to a musical. It wasn’t quite the same, because I am now middle aged, but it was nonetheless exuberant, decadent, over-the-top celebration. And, once again, it seemed to belong to a bygone world not yet fatally imperilled by those dour, politically correct, fun-killers who haunt our society. But finally, something entirely new entered the scene: a festive visit to Tate Modern, where – entirely gratis – we saw Cildo Meireles’s Babel, an immense tower of radios, all broadcasting different snatches of speech and music; the text of Zoe Leonard’s I Want a President, a stunning piece of polemic from 1992 that terrifies with its continuing relevance; and John Akomfrah’s The Unfinished Conversation, a film in triptych that sets the life of cultural theorist Stuart Hall against the political and social struggles of the 20th-century, with a soundscape that juxtaposes Duke Ellington and Mervyn Peake. Akomfrah’s film was one of the most powerful explorations of belonging and not belonging I’ve ever seen; painful and violent and yet filled with the hope that human beings can adapt to new circumstances and renew the world around them. “I can’t believe I lived through most of those things,” said my dad, who’ll be 80 next year. Then we queued for the giant swings in Tate’s vast turbine hall, waiting for the chance to liberate ourselves from things we already knew and swing our legs freely in the air."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"}]}}
