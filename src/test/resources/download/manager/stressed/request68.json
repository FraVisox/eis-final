But often, these musicians adore traditional music at the same time as they enjoy playing and writing in other genres. Olivia Chaney collaborated on two folk song projects last year: Nonesuch’s impressive Folk Songs compilation, featuring Natalie Merchant and Sam Amidon, and the stunning Offa Rex project with the Decemberists (Chaney does a mean Willie O’Winsbury). Chaney also sang on stage at Shirley Collins’ birthday celebrations – at the artist’s request, if the traditionalists want to take issue. “Beautiful, moving, intelligent singing,” was Collins’ spot-on assessment. Chaney’s second solo album of originals comes produced by Thomas Bartlett, whose CV includes recent work with St Vincent, Ed Sheeran and Florence Welch, as well as a tribute to Pete Seeger, and an Irish folk band project, the Gloaming. As soon as Shelter begins, you fall into its warmly drawn, welcoming world. Its terrain feels like folk territory, too. Chaney’s voice is effortless, clear and bright, a beacon burning on an ancient, rolling hill, as her modern narratives arrive, subtly couching older details. Bells bring strangers, as a mother is late to collect her daughter from school. Demons persist, while protagonists wait to “befriend and face” them. New York’s Hudson flows while the singer thinks of older rivers (“cockles and mussels, alive, alive-oh”), and the arrangements throughout, all piano and quiet guitar, are lovingly minimal. This is not to provide a blasting showcase for Chaney, as there is little ego on this record, and her talents at delivery and depth ripple through softly but persuasively. The ghosts of Sandy Denny’s early 1970s solo albums are never very far away, but what gleaming ghosts those are to carry with you. Other folk picks Toby Hay’s lush, instrumental second album, The Longest Day, is another impressive flag waved by this talented guitarist, whose last album was nominated for the Welsh music prize. The Alistair McCulloch Trio’s Off the Hook is a masterclass in traditional jigs and reels, its fiddle, bouzouki and whistle turned up to 11. Also, don’t miss Sharron Kraus’s Joy’s Reflection Is Sorrow, another fascinating release by this underrated artist, fluttering uncannily but brilliantly on the softer edges of psych-folk."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"music/2018/jun/20/anna-calvi-review-rock-star-melodrama-meets-mor","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-20T11:39:42Z","webTitle":"Anna Calvi review – rock star melodrama meets MOR","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/jun/20/anna-calvi-review-rock-star-melodrama-meets-mor","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/jun/20/anna-calvi-review-rock-star-melodrama-meets-mor","fields":{"headline":"Anna Calvi review – rock star melodrama meets MOR","bodyText":"Anna Calvi belongs to a category of uncategorisable singer-songwriters. This label could also be applied to St Vincent, Julia Holter, Bat for Lashes, Feist and Jenny Hval – musicians who march to the beats of their own drums, neither adhering particularly closely to rock and indie traditions, nor truly qualifying as pop (their music isn’t as dumbly infectious or popular enough for that). In a world of songs machine-tooled for Spotify playlist approval, this kind of idiosyncrasy is only to be applauded. But it does mean Calvi can prove a rather hard sell to the casual observer: a guitarist and singer who makes unrushed, elegiac songs sheathed in a jazz-club smokiness that often simmer with sensuality. But this evening – one of five European shows designed to preview her forthcoming third album, Hunter – her music proves easier to digest. Proceedings begin with the cave-like interior of London’s Heaven bathed in red. Calvi, in a black suit, white ankle boots and shiny red bandeau, stands at the end of a runway that juts out from the main stage, splitting the audience in two. It’s a simple, beautiful image that is also expertly designed for a visually arresting Instagram post – a sense cemented by the swathes of people with phones jostling for the perfect shot. Throughout the show, Calvi uses the runway as a spotlight, returning to its tip for moments of melodrama. On new song Indies Or Paradise she saunters down it to screamingly shred on her guitar as a retina-destroying light show plays in the background. On Alpha, also from Hunter, she hurls her instrument around her torso as it crashes and shrieks. At other moments, the guitar whirs, wheezes and wails while Calvi looks and sounds as if she’s trying to hold a panicked cat in her arms. Hunter’s lead single is Don’t Beat the Girl Out of My Boy, the latest in a series of tracks confronting gender – her debut included I’ll Be Your Man and the erotically charged Suzanne &amp; I – but perhaps her most straight-talking yet. It sees Calvi supplement her sound with moody 1980s bombast, and on the catwalk she ditches her guitar in order to do justice to the song’s vocal outro – a cacophony of orgasmic howls and Axl Rose-style yelping. The times when Calvi indulges her rock star potential are mesmerising, but other moments are rather staid and trudging in comparison. Flanked by a drummer and a keyboardist on the main stage, her default mode is one of gothic majesty, yet she creates an atmosphere for plodding drums and windy vocals. This tedium is compounded by what feels like the world’s longest encore – not the best time for endless noodling and abstract atmospherics. Thankfully, Calvi returns to high drama during her cover of Suicide’s Ghost Rider, curled up in a ball around her distortion-emitting guitar, then eventually slumping face-first on the runway, as if she’s sacrificed her life in the name of entertainment. It is a gratifying end to an evening that danced between wildly captivating and rather dull. Calvi clearly knows how to leave an audience spellbound. Now she needs to elevate the rest of her show to a mildly diverting middle ground."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"media/2018/jun/20/guardian-news-uk-telegraph-launch-advertising-business-ozone-project","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-20T10:20:32Z","webTitle":"Guardian, News UK and Telegraph launch joint advertising business","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/jun/20/guardian-news-uk-telegraph-launch-advertising-business-ozone-project","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2018/jun/20/guardian-news-uk-telegraph-launch-advertising-business-ozone-project","fields":{"headline":"Guardian, News UK and Telegraph launch joint advertising business","bodyText":"The Guardian’s parent company has joined forces with rivals News UK and the Telegraph to create an online advertising business. The Ozone Project has been launched in response to demand from advertisers for a one-stop shop to buy digital adverts across multiple leading news sites. When it launches in the autumn it will be possible for advertisers to buy online ad space on the Guardian, the Times, the Sun, and the Telegraph from a single site. The deal involves only online adverts and all the newspaper groups will continue to have their own independent sales teams, who will compete against against each other for business. There is no crossover in editorial content or journalism, and no data will be shared between the newspaper groups. The Ozone Project will be a standalone business with its own staff jointly employed by the three newspaper groups. The publishers said the project was in response to concerns about “brand safety, data governance, lack of transparency in the supply chain and ad fraud” following a number of online advertising scandals. The announcement, made during the ad industry’s annual Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity, follows years of discussions among UK newspapers about combining advertising sales teams, as money continues to divert to Google and Facebook, creating a tough financial outlook for traditional outlets. Guardian News &amp; Media is on track to break even next year after a three-year plan to reduce financial losses from £57m. “We are working together to build a better digital ecosystem for advertisers, readers and publishers,” Hamish Nicklin, GNM’s chief revenue officer. “The Ozone Project is a response to the challenges we all face and aims to facilitate the highest standard of digital advertising and ensure quality journalism and content continues to be funded.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/live/2018/jun/20/china-trump-trade-war-fears-grow-uk-factories-business-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-20T16:46:04Z","webTitle":"Markets recover but remain nervous over US-China trade dispute – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2018/jun/20/china-trump-trade-war-fears-grow-uk-factories-business-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/live/2018/jun/20/china-trump-trade-war-fears-grow-uk-factories-business-live","fields":{"headline":"Markets recover but remain nervous over US-China trade dispute – as it happened","bodyText":"The prospect of a trade war between the US and China has put markets under pressure this week, and although there was some recovery today, it was by no means convincing. As well as continuing uncertainty over the effect of the proposed tariffs, oil prices were volatile ahead of this week’s Opec meeting. Meanwhile the pound edged a little higher after the UK government won a key Brexit vote. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 23.55 points or 0.31% at 7627.40 Germany’s Dax added 0.14% to 12,695.16 France’s Cac closed down 0.34% at 5372.31 Italy’s FTSE MIB added 0.16% to 22,120.58 Spain’s Ibex ended up 0.34% to 9788.9 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down around 10 points or 0.05%. On that note, it’s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we’ll be back tomorrow. It’s been a pretty volatile day for stock markets, as well as crude. And the pound has not been left out. From a low of $1.3149 against the dollar it hit a high of $1.3215 after the UK government won a key Brexit vote. It is currently at $1.3206, up 0.21%. Our politics live blog has all the latest details on the government’s narrow success in seeing off a potential rebellion: Oil prices are edging higher ahead of the key Opec meeting which begins on Thursday and following a bigger than expected fall in US crude stocks. The oil producers are expected to agree to increase output but the key question is by how much. Meanwhile evidence of rising demand came from the weekly US figures, which saw a 5.9m barrel decline, the biggest drop since mid-January. On the other hand there was a 3.3m barrel rise in gasoline stocks compared to expectations of a 1m fall. Brent is currently up 0.19% at $75.22 a barrel. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, said: Crude oil is also in focus, with a whole raft of comments coming from OPEC member states ahead of Friday’s big production decision. Despite an initial rebuttal of a production increase proposed by Russia (via Saudi Arabia), we are seeing a gradual shift in tone which will likely see some form of rise in output come Friday. For markets, the line in the sand seems to be the 1 million barrels a day level. Anything less than that will be seen as a compromise given the Saudi target is closer to 1.5 million barrels a day. We have seen the biggest drawdown in US crude inventories since January, but the impact has been offset by a rise in gasoline supply. Here’s our first take on the David Drumm sentencing: Back with the Anglo Irish case and former chief executive David Drumm has been sentenced to eight years in jail for his part in the fraud, but will serve six with mitigating circumstances taken into account. Investor enthusiasm appears to be waning, with markets coming off their best levels. Connor Campbell, market analyst at Spreadex, said: The Dow Jones, which at one point looked like it was going to reclaim 150 points, ended up starting the US session flat, the wrong side of 24700. There was little for the index to really work with on Wednesday, beyond the ever-looming threat of a full-blown trade war between the world’s two largest economies. The Eurozone, which started the week poorly and then went downhill from there, saw its initial tame recovery gradually chipped away at until nothing was left. That means the DAX is back struggling to keep its head above 12700, while the CAC tumbled below 5400 after switching from a 0.3% rise to a 0.2% loss. Only the FTSE remained in the green with any real substance, and even then its 0.6% increase was half of the growth posted at lunchtime. Though the UK index broadly just followed the direction of trading from around the Western world, sterling’s reversal of its initial losses also helped erase some of the FTSE’s gains. The pound rose 0.1% against the dollar and the euro – granted, not a lot in the context of its recent performance – as the government appeared to come to a compromise over the ‘meaningful vote’ issue, but couldn’t gain any more momentum thanks to Thursday’s impending Bank of England meeting. US commerce secretary Wilbur Ross has been speaking about the trade dispute with China. He says President Trump’s strategy is to make it clear to China that continuing on its current path would be more painful that changing its behaviour. Back with the bids for 21st Century Fox, and Neil Wilson at Markets.com says the market is now waiting for Comcast’s next move after Disney increased its offer: As was expected, cash was added to the all-share offer as a sweetener and the deal is now worth $38 a share, up from its previous $28 offer that was worth c$55bn. This beats Comcast’s $35 all-cash, $65bn bid but we must assume that Comcast is ready to come back with an even stronger offer. This offer from Disney is probably a little bit stronger than expected and [Disney’s] Iger will be looking to kill off Comcast’s bid once and for all. However, the rationale for Comcast remains the same, the question is only how much debt it can afford to carry. If it gets its way total debt would rise to $170bn according to Moody’s, with just $6bn in cash on its books. Disney will also take on Fox’s $14bn debts, giving this bid an enterprise value of more than $85bn. Debt is a concern for investors here and points to market-top behaviour. The amount of debt both companies are prepared to assume is arguably a worry, but it’s a case of innovate or die in the face of competition. It’s a sign of just how desperately these two legacy media groups want the assets of Fox. In their attempt to contend with cord cutters like Netflix they are risking leveraging themselves up to a degree that makes them susceptible should the current benign market conditions deteriorate. Sky shares are trading up 3% today at £13.82 on the news but they could go higher if Comcast really goes big. Even it doesn’t have the appetite for all of Fox it could settle to swoop for Sky only and bag those important European subscription revs. US markets have joined in the generally positive mood after the week’s sell-offs as trade tensions between the US and China escalated. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 80 points or 0.33%, while the S&amp;P 500 opened up 0.325 and the Nasdaq Composite 0.5% better. But General Electric shares are down after the group was pushed out of the 30 share Dow after more than a century. GE, one of the original members of the Dow, will be replaced by Walgreens Boots Alliance. Back with trade disputes, and the European Union has confirmed it will begin charging import duties of 25% on a range of US products on Friday. The move is in retaliation to the US tariffs imposed on EU steel and aluminium. The EU tariffs will be placed on €2.8bn worth of goods, from Harley Davidson motor bikes to bourbon and peanuts. Over in the US, and the country’s current account deficit widened in the first quarter, but by less than forecast. Reuters reports: The Commerce Department said the current account deficit, which measures the flow of goods, services and investments into and out of the country, widened by $8.0 billion to $124.1 billion, or 2.5 percent of national economic output, in the first three months of the year. Analysts polled by Reuters had expected the current account deficit to widen to $129.0 billion from the previously reported $128.2 billion in the fourth quarter. The figures also showed that US companies brought back cash from overseas after a December 2017 tax change. Companies paid out dividends of around $305bn from foreign receipts. Newsflash: The takeover battle over Rupert Murdoch’s 21st Century Fox group has taken another twist. Disney has raised its offer for most of 21CF to $38bn per share, up from a previous offer of $28 per share. That takes the value of the offer up to around $70bn, from $52bn previously. Disney has also tweaked its offer to include a cash component - previously it was only offering shares. It beats Comcast’s rival all-cash offer of $35 per share, and seemingly puts Disney back in poll position. Over in Dublin, one of Ireland’s fallen bank bosses is being sentenced over his role in the financial crisis. David Drumm, the former CEO of Anglo Irish bank, faces a prison term after being found guilty of conspiracy to defraud and false accounting earlier this year. The case relating to banking transactions he was involved in at the height of 2008 financial crisis. By circulating deposits between Anglo and Irish Life &amp; Permanent (IL&amp;P), the bank created the impression that its deposits were €7.2bn larger than was actually the case. Tom Lyons, deputy editor of The Sunday Business Post, is tweeting from the court room. He reports that Drumm’s team is defending his actions, while also recognising that a custodial sentence is on the cards.... Lukman Otunuga, research analyst at FXTM, says investors should be cautious about joining today’s rally. He points out that the trade spat between China and the US could escalates again soon. Asian and European stocks rose today as markets attempted to shrug off trade war threats. While the improved risk appetite could elevate stock markets higher, the sustainability should be questioned as fears over trade tensions remain a key market theme. Global equity bears could transform the current rebound into a classical dead cat bounce if trade tensions between the United States and China continue to escalate. The US stock market is expected to rise when trading begins in a couple of hours, ending several days of losses. Yesterday the Dow lost 287 points, or 1.1%, wiping out its 2018 gains. The Bank of England could face a major shake-up if Labour wins the next election. Labour’s shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, is unveiling a swathe of proposed reforms to Britain’s central bank today. The headline-grabbing elements include opening an office in Birmingham, a shift away from its base at London’s Threadneedle Street. The most intriguing element - setting the Bank a productivity target, alongside its current mandate to control inflation. These ideas aren’t Labour policy yet, but they could be considered for its next manifesto: Chris Giles of the FT suggests the Bank could have some issues with a productivity target: Good news: UK factory orders have risen, helping manufacturers to boost their output. The CBI’s latest healthcheck on the sector has found that manufacturing order books recovered in the last quarter, while the volume of output increased strongly. The CBI says: 33% of manufacturers reported total order books to be above normal, and 20% said they were below normal, giving a balance of +13% 20% of firms said their export order books were above normal, and 11% said they were below normal, giving a balance of +9% 43% of businesses said the volume of output over the past three months was up, and 13% said it was down, giving a rounded balance of +29% Anna Leach, CBI Head of Economic Intelligence, believes Britain’s industrial sector may be picking up pace after a recent lull. “The recovery in orders and a return to bumper growth in production suggests the lull in manufacturing activity may be over. While risks to demand persist from Brexit and escalating global trade tensions, firms can work with the Government to nurture a pro-enterprise environment that helps UK growth to shift up a gear. UK housebuilder Berkeley has called the top of the London housing market. After some bumper years, Berkeley told shareholders that profits will drop by 30% in the 2018/19 financial year, as the sector returns to “more normal” times. Chairman Tony Pidgley says that new housing starts in London have dropped by a third in the last two years (or since the EU referendum, basically). Pidgley blames Brexit uncertainty for the drop in activity: It is telling that some funders and builders are choosing to exit the market when faced with the degree of risk and regulation that now confronts development in the capital where macro and political uncertainty, including Brexit, are leading to this caution. This is a great shame as London is a fantastic world-class city with unique attributes that will last long beyond the current hiatus which is only exacerbating the well documented under-supply. Stocks are recovering because investors are snaffling up bargains after Tuesday’s rout, says Ken Odeluga of City Index. He believes the People Bank of China’s intervention overnight is reassuring the markets: European stocks are posting solid gains with similar demand building in Dow, S&amp;P and Nasdaq contracts. This follows chunks of buying interest in Asia-Pacific shares. It looked very much like bargain-motivated flows juiced by a window of benign currency conditions, particularly in Japan, Hong Kong, S. Korea and Australia where benchmarks all added around 1%. Chinese equities also enjoyed a bounce, though to a lesser extent, with precarious sentiment capping Shanghai and Shenzhen gains as investors read the PBoC stepping in as corroborating a sense of crisis. The central bank recommended a reserve ratio requirement cut—essentially looser policy—after fresh tariff threats. Elsewhere in the markets, cryptocurrency prices are falling after another digital coin exchange was hacked. The South Korean cryptocurrency exchange Bithumb says it lost 35bn won ($31.5m) worth of virtual coins to hackers. It’s the second such breach in a week, highlighting the risks of investing in crypto (as coins are virtually anonymous, they can be almost impossible to recover). Here’s the damage: Two hours into the trading day, and European markets are all comfortably higher. Shares are up across the board, as traders shake off some of their fears about a devastating trade war. Analysts at FXPro say: Markets are taking a breath right now and retracing some of the moves over the past number of sessions. Whether this turns into a broader rally or the selloff is resumed remains to be seen. Stock markets are higher after support was found in the European session yesterday and US and Asian traders built on the foundations of that support. Sterling has hit a new seven-month low this morning, as the UK government faces another crunch vote over Brexit. Parliament will vote on the EU withdrawal bill, the government’s flagship piece of Brexit legislation, later today. And one group of MPs are refusing to drop their demand for a ‘meaningful’ vote in the scenario in which Britain can’t agree a Brexit deal. Former attorney general Dominic Grieve insists that parliament must have a chance to protect the UK economy, in the event of a no-deal. Grieve’s amendment has been been sent back to the Commons by the House of Lords, amid claims that Theresa May ‘double-crossed’ Grieve last week by promising to address his concerns, then pulling a u-turn. The vote could be close, if Grieve’s band of backbench Conservative MPs hold firm. Some pro-Brexit Labour MPs could vote with the government, though, which would be a headache for opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn..... This uncertainty has knocked the pound down by 0.2% to $1.315, the lowest since November 2017. Those calming words from the People’s Bank of China are helping markets recover from yesterday’s rout. In London the FTSE 100 has jumped by 80 points, or 1%, to 7683 (partly helped by a weaker pound). Other European markets are also higher, with Germany up 0.4% and Spain gaining 1% following the rally in Asia overnight. Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets reckons investors are “calming their fears about the current US-China trade tariff dispute”. That’s partly because neither side has actually imposed tariffs yet -- just made lots of threats. Elsa Lignos of Royal Bank of Canada explains why things might calm down: On the trade front, we’re likely to see a two month ‘hibernation’ as the US works through the legal process for the next $200bn of tariffs and China awaits the US’ formal response. The boss of Wall Street giant Goldman Sachs has predicted that China and the US still step back from a devastating trade wars. Lloyd Blankfein says that Trump’s threat to add tariffs on $200bn of Chinese imports are a negotiating tactic: That’s what you would do if it was a negotiating position, and you wanted to remind your counterparty just how much fire power you had to bring to the negotiation.” Blankfein is hopeful that Washington and Beijing won’t mutually destroy their economies. “I don’t think we’re in a suicide pact on this...“I suspect we’re not going to cause the economies to collapse with Smoot-Hawley on steroids. The protectionist Smoot–Hawley Tariff Act of 1930 imposed tariffs on more than 20,000 imported goods. It was meant to protect US workers after the Wall Street crash of 1929, but actually appears to have hurt economic growth and didn’t prevent the Great Depression. China’s stock market isn’t the only one flirting with a bear market. After days of losses, the Philippines PSI index has fallen almost 20% from its recent peak. Donald Trump’s threat to impose more tariffs on China is dominating the newspapers across Asia today. The China Daily newspaper – often a good window into Beijing’s thinking – has accuse the US of trying to hurt the Chinese economy. It says: “Faced with this heightened intimidation from the U.S., China has no choice but to fight back with targeted and direct measures aimed at persuading the U.S. to back off, since it appears that any concessions it makes will not appease the Trump administration, which wants to suck the lifeblood from the Chinese economy.” “Beijing will have to ensure that Washington is aware that there will be heavy price to pay every action it strikes against China if it is to avoid being a victim of the Trump administration’s growing blood lust.” The Global Times also put the boot in, saying Donald Trump’s administration was the world’s biggest destabilising factor. A raging fever of nationalism rising in the world’s sole super power sends an alarming signal. Nationalism is a challenge to globalization. Rising nationalism and protectionism could hinder the process of globalization and jeopardize the world order. The US often points an accusing finger at alleged economic nationalism of other countries including China, but now, the reality is that Trump’s truculent nationalism is posing the biggest threat. And in Hong Kong, the Apple Daily newspaper produced quite a front page... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Could Donald Trump really trigger a trade war with China? With neither side backing down, the markets getting nervous after yesterday’s selloff hit shares and commodities across the globe. Trump’s threat to impose new tariffs on $200bn of Chinese exports has investors worried, with Beijing already vowing to retaliate. Overnight, China’s top central banker urged people to remain strong and calm. People’s Bank of China governor Yi Gang told the Shanghai Securities Journal that China’s economy remained solid, and that there was no reason to panic. “China still has good economic fundamentals and resilient growth. The yuan is one of a few currencies that have appreciated against the US dollar this year. “I’m fully confident about the health of China’s capital market based on the fundamentals.” Yi also pledged that the PBOC would act to “fend off systemic financial risks”, and prepare for the danger of “potential external shocks” and “fend off systemic financial risks”. Yi Gang’s comments helped to stem another day of losses in China, where shares are on the brink of a bear market (down 20% from their peak). Other Asian equity markets also recovered a little, with Japan’s Topix up 0.5% and Australia’s S&amp;P 500 gaining 1.1%. European traders might also recover their poise today, after Tuesday’s selloff. Fiona Cincotta, senior market analyst at City Index, says investors fear the consequences of a trade war: Global GDP could stand to be hit by 2% - 3% should the trade war continue and spread, to put this into context the Great Recession wiped out 6% of the global GDP, so this trade spat is by no means insignificant. For weeks the market has been relatively complacent that Trump’s tough protectionist rhetoric were merely a negotiating tool; however, the realisation that the US President is willing to go ahead with his threats has sent a shiver through the markets. Trump’s strategy appears to be to raise the stakes until China is forced to capitulate, by opening up its markets to American goods and addressing intellectual property theft concerns. But if that doesn’t happen, the world economy could find itself on a rocky road. Also coming up today.... Top central bankers are gathered in Sintra, Portugal, for a conference organised by the European Central Bank.

Ana Ramírez, 34, arrived here 12 days ago from the violent coastal city of Acapulco in southern Mexico, with three children aged 11 to 17 and her 18-month-old grandson. They fled after armed men threatened to kill the family unless the oldest boy – a 14-year-old high-school student – agreed to sell drugs for their gang. The same men took away three of his classmates, who have not been seen since. Ramírez reported the threat to authorities, who advised the family to leave. Terrified, they abandoned their house, clothes, toys, her hotel job and the children’s schooling and borrowed money to fly to Tijuana. On Tuesday, the family was 400th in the asylum queue – down from more than 1,000 12 days ago. ‘If we go back they will kill us all’ Ramírez, like most of women here, was unaware of the new curbs on victims of gang violence and domestic abuse announced last week by the US attorney general. Asylum is for people fleeing persecution because of their religion, political beliefs or membership in a social group, Jeff Sessions said, not those fleeing crime. Ramírez had come prepared with a police report, which she believed would persuade US immigration authorities to grant asylum. “I have proof, if we go back, they will take my son or kill us all, I’m trying to keep my family together … I’m seeking asylum, I wouldn’t enter illegally. Before Donald Trump said on Wednesday he would end the practice, the number of children separated from their parents by his administration as part of its zero-tolerance tactic to deter migrants and asylum seekers was rising fast. Most of the families ripped apart are from Central America’s northern triangle – El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala – ranked the most dangerous region in the world outside an official war zone. Amnesty International has said the practice amounts to torture under international law. There is no coherent plan for reuniting the families. Kirstjen Nielsen, secretary of homeland security, denied that families seeking asylum through legal entry points were being separated. But 14 of 17 asylum-seeking parents recently interviewed by Amnesty who were forcibly separated from their children had entered the US legally. Ramírez had heard rumours that Honduran children were being separated from their parents, but only those over the age of 14. Shown some of the images to emerge in recent days of children in cages, she started to cry and hugged her grandson close. “I won’t let that happen, I’ll turn back.” Some have heard nothing about the unfolding controversy. Laura Ruíz, 18, from Copan, Honduras was nursing her two-year-old son who could barely keep his eyes open. They arrived after a gruelling journey, and had not seen any news or heard anything about what has been going on a few miles across the border. They planned cross irregularly, with the baby’s father who was staying at the men’s shelter next door. “We’re so close, we have to try.” Many of the women interviewed by the Guardian remained hopeful, encouraged by stories of relatives and friends who in recent months and years were given a chance to claim asylum: exactly the “loophole”the Trump administration says it is seeking to close. ‘What would you do?’ Esther Castro, 21, was travelling with her tiny but boisterous two-year-old daughter, and could not stop crying due to a mix of exhaustion, desperation and piercing back pain that she does not have the money to treat. The single mother from Michoacán has been severely depressed since being raped when she was 17. A flurry of anonymous callers in the past few weeks threatened to rape her and her daughter. She was so scared, she packed a few things and left. “I’m going to tell them my story, just like I told you, and have faith in God that they will let us pass … If they try to take my daughter, I’ll turn back, I won’t let them.” According to experts consulted by the Guardian, it is unclear if turning back would be permitted, and would likely depend on nationality, point of entry and availability of detention facilities. In an average year, Madre Assunta hosts 1,200 women or children. But in the first five months of 2018, the number rocketed to 1,560. In a complete turnaround from last year, about 80% were Mexican, mostly from the embattled states of Guerrero and Michoacán where armed groups control everything from the drug markets to avocado farms. The others mostly come from Central America, a few from African countries including Sudan and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Last year was Mexico’s most violent year on record with almost 30,000 murders. The murder rate is up 20% so far in 2018. Many at the border are willing to risk potential separation in the US over guaranteed violence at home. Mary Galvan, social worker at Madre Assunta, was horrified by the new US policy and angered by the Mexican government’s slow condemnation. “He [Trump] is the anti-Christ. But put yourself in these women’s shoes and imagine you had to choose between staying home and being killed, or crossing the border and risk your children being put into cages and treated savagely, but where there’s a tiny bit of hope.

The ACT climate change minister Shane Rattenbury told Guardian Australia he believes conservative internal critics of the policy, such as the former prime minister Tony Abbott, are intent on turning the screws on Frydenberg, the federal energy minister, as the policy enters its make-or-break stage. Rattenbury points out that another Coalition party room outbreak on the policy this week is likely a tactical ploy by opponents designed to ensure that Frydenberg is locked in to a no-compromise position with the states and territories – which could have the practical effect of scuttling the policy. “Obviously we’ve seen the push from the government backbench this week which I think is designed to ensure there is no movement,” Rattenbury said in an interview with Guardian Australia. “This puts the federal minister in a particularly difficult position I think.” On Wednesday evening, Tony Abbott joined fellow conservative Liberal Craig Kelly in signalling he was prepared to cross the floor to vote against the policy if he didn’t get the outcome he wanted. Rattenbury says over the months of talks between the Turnbull government and the states and territories over the Neg, there has been no willingness at the Commonwealth level to make any concessions, whereas the states and territories are being pressured to sign on despite significant concerns about the emissions reduction target in the scheme. “In the politics of this, we are being told in the national interest we must negotiate and make compromises, but we’ve seen no willingness from the Commonwealth to demonstrate any compromise,” the ACT minister said. “Negotiating 101 tells you you don’t put your position on the table and then say you are not moving – but that’s what the Commonwealth has done from the get go”. The policy will go to a meeting of the energy council of Coag in early August, and any individual state or territory has the power to scuttle the scheme. Implementing the Neg requires consensus across jurisdictions to change the current rules governing the national electricity market. As revealed by Guardian Australia last week, Frydenberg used a phone hook up with his state and territory counterparts to tell them he would not accept a demand by some conservative colleagues to back-end load emissions reduction in the scheme to the second half of the decade between 2020 and 2030. He said emissions reduction would be linear over the ten years. But Rattenbury raised concerns during that call about the lack of ambition in the scheme’s emissions reduction target for the electricity sector, which is a 26% reduction on 2005 levels by 2030. Many market analysts point out that target is too weak to see Australia meet its commitments under the Paris climate agreement, and will have the effect of forcing steeper abatement on other sectors of the economy, where cutting pollution is much more expensive. The ACT and the other state Labor governments have been pushing for a more ambitious target. If conservatives make that impossible for Frydenberg to deliver, then some have pushed for an obvious ratchet mechanism to ensure that future governments can scale up the target quickly. Rattenbury said he was unable to say which way the territory would go in the event that no concessions from Frydenberg were offered. But if there was no movement from the Commonwealth before August, “that is going to make it very difficult for us”. Erwin Jackson from Environment Victoria argues the latest proposal from the Commonwealth should be rejected because the Turnbull government was now trying to lock-in a 10-year emissions budget for the electricity industry. Jackson said an earlier draft of a paper setting out the emissions reduction framework for the Neg had flagged that targets could be changed with five years’ notice. But the government’s latest consultation paper, circulated to stakeholders last Friday, proposes that an emissions target trajectory be set for a decade. He characterised the decision to roll back the five-year option as “a retrograde, shortsighted and backward step that is a recipe for market chaos”. Tristan Edis from Green Energy Markets points out other flaws in the scheme. He says the current design principles provide no recognition or reward for the abatement from people and businesses that consume electricity generated by their own solar systems – which is a problem, given the growing penetration of solar panels. He’s also critical of measures that force generators to sell emission abatement to retailers in the year it is produced. Edis says that will “heavily favour the major incumbent electricity companies at the expense of pure-play renewable energy companies”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/aug/17/revealed-asylum-seekers-20-year-wait-for-home-office-ruling","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-08-17T16:00:24Z","webTitle":"Revealed: asylum seekers' 20-year wait for Home Office ruling","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/aug/17/revealed-asylum-seekers-20-year-wait-for-home-office-ruling","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/aug/17/revealed-asylum-seekers-20-year-wait-for-home-office-ruling","fields":{"headline":"Revealed: asylum seekers' 20-year wait for Home Office ruling","bodyText":"The Home Office has left some people waiting more than 20 years for decisions on their asylum claims, according to data obtained exclusively by the Guardian, in delays charities say are unacceptable and “utterly barbaric”. Seventeen people received decisions from the Home Office last year on claims they had submitted more than 15 years ago, four of whom had waited more than 20 years for a decision. The worst case was a delay of 26 years and one month after the person initially applied for asylum. The data, obtained under freedom of information rules, refers to the time the Home Office takes to make an initial decision on an asylum claim. It does not include any extra time taken for an appeal or fresh claim. Asylum seekers are not allowed to work while they wait for a decision on their claim. They are provided with an allowance of £37.75 a week. There are reports of people forgoing meals in order to afford phone bills so they can communicate with their families in their home countries, being forced to travel everywhere on foot, including to meetings with solicitors and to charities, or going without winter clothing. The Home Office provides accommodation, most often a room in a shared house with other asylum seekers, but lodgings have routinely been criticised for being of poor quality, having infestations of rats, mould and bedbugs and being located in the poorest parts of towns and cities. In a damning report last year, Yvette Cooper, the chair of the home affairs select committee, said asylum seekers’ housing conditions weredisgraceful. “Forcing some people to wait more than 15 years for a decision on their asylum claim while banned from work and living below the poverty line is utterly barbaric,” said Stephen Hale, the chief executive of Refugee Action. Of the decisions the Home Office made in 2017, 18,189 or 75% were taken within six months of application, 2,832 took between six months and a year, 3,059 between one and three years, and 243 between three and five years. Of the 40 people who waited more than five years to receive an answer, seven were granted asylum or another protection visa, 22 were refused and 11 either withdrew their application, left the country, or died while waiting for a decision. They came from a range of countries, including Afghanistan, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Eritrea, Somalia and Yemen. “This is just the wait for an initial decision,” said Maurice Wren, the chief executive of the Refugee Council. “Many people must face a lengthy appeals process if their first claim is refused.” Of the initial refusals that went to appeal last year, 35% were overturned by a judge. For some nationalities the rate of successful appeals was above 50% and for Yemenis the figure was 70%. The Home Office has a six-month target for deciding on asylum claims it deems as “straightforward”. A report by the chief inspector of borders and immigration last year revealed, however, that almost half of the claims lodged were classified as “non-straightforward”, exempting them from the six-month target. Hale said the long delays, and other failings of the asylum system caused “immense damage to people who come to this country seeking safety”. “We spoke to refugees forced to wait years for a decision on their asylum claim,” he said. “Many were being treated for anxiety and depression, as they struggle to survive on little over £5 a day for prolonged periods of uncertainty. Prevented from working or studying, they feel hopeless, isolated and excluded.” Wren said: “This is not a temporary admin problem, but the predictable outcome of a system that all too often gives little or no thought to the human consequences of its actions. “People’s lives are put on hold, forcing them to live in limbo and uncertainty. “This is totally unacceptable. These figures underline the pressing need for a major overhaul of the way we treat people seeking refugee protection in the UK.” A Home Office spokesman said: “UK Visa and Immigration aims to decide straightforward asylum claims within six months but there are some claims that raise complex issues and cannot be decided within six months for reasons outside of our control. We aim to decide these cases within 12 months. “Asylum seekers who would otherwise be destitute are provided with free, fully furnished accommodation. We also cover utility costs and provide a cash allowance to cover other essential living needs.” ‘The worst experience of my life’ Ana Asatiani, 29, left her home in a former USSR country she prefers not to name with her husband and daughter in 2013. She claimed asylum upon arrival at the airport, but waited five years for the Home Office’s decision. “Waiting all that time was the worst experience in my life,” she said. “No one took responsibility to explain why there was such a delay in our case. They have not even apologised for making us live in a limbo for a total of five years. “These years have affected me in many ways. I trained as a lawyer, but unable to work here, I feel my education is wasted. Waiting for an answer for five years destroyed my mental and physical health.” Asatiani said her experience had caused her to doubt the UK, which she had always believed was a place where human rights were protected. “So much that I always think: thank you for accepting me to this country, but please don’t make my life worse than the one I had before, when I faced persecution in my country. I don’t understand [why] the immigration system of the government is so wrong,” she said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2018/jul/04/nhs-collapse-without-them-growing-role-volunteers","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-07-04T11:41:07Z","webTitle":"'The NHS would collapse without them': the growing role of volunteers","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jul/04/nhs-collapse-without-them-growing-role-volunteers","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/jul/04/nhs-collapse-without-them-growing-role-volunteers","fields":{"headline":"'The NHS would collapse without them': the growing role of volunteers","bodyText":"“I saw one gentleman about 18 months ago, only on one occasion. About a year later, he saw me in a shop and said I was the little lady – I’m 4ft 10in – who had listened to him in the doctor’s surgery. He said it had changed his life.” Pauline Nixon, the woman in question, is not a doctor, a nurse or any other NHS professional. She is one of two volunteers who give up their time to talk with patients at a GP practice in Lancashire, discussing everything from dealing with bereavement or the stress of caring for a loved one to being diagnosed with cancer. “People often can’t talk to relatives or friends because they don’t want to upset them, and GPs only have 10 minutes,” she says. This listening service is one of a battalion of volunteer-run services without which the NHS might struggle to survive, and on which it has relied since its foundation. Nixon is one of millions of volunteers who provide invaluable support for hard-pressed NHS services. “The whole thing would collapse without [volunteers]. I saw how much good they could do,” says former barrister Kate Lampard, who in 2015 was asked by the government to report on managing volunteers in hospitals in the wake of the Jimmy Savile scandal. Volunteers are now often an integral part of patient care, but Lampard points out the wider social benefits too. Some people come into the NHS as volunteers and, after training, go on to take paid jobs in the service. Having suitable volunteers takes some of the pressure off NHS staff. And many people with mental health issues who may not be able to work in a paid capacity find a useful, active role as a volunteer, benefiting themselves, the NHS and wider society. Citizens Advice estimates that about a fifth of a GP’s time is spent on problems that have non-medical causes, such as personal relationship problems, housing and unemployment concerns or work-related issues. Many of these can be addressed through advice and support provided by volunteers. But it is vital to ensure that volunteers are properly plugged into the health service. “The circle is completely magic as long as volunteers are properly managed,” says Lampard. She recalls that in one hospital she visited, 400 volunteers were being managed by a single, part-time staff member who had no contact with senior managers – and no effective safeguarding training. No one knows how many volunteers there are in the NHS. The Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) estimates there are 3 million in health and care, while a 2016 British Social Attitudes survey said there were about 1.7 million. A report this year on volunteers in general practice by David Buck, a fellow at the King’s Fund thinktank, found a “surprising lack of knowledge” about the role and contribution of volunteers in the NHS, despite a long history of volunteering. The Royal Voluntary Service is part of that history. It was set up in 1938, 10 years before the birth of the NHS, as the Women’s Voluntary Services for Air Raid Precautions. Eighty years on, the RVS chief executive, Catherine Johnstone, says about 5,000 of the charity’s 25,000 volunteers provide support in hospitals, including in well-established roles, such as helping with patient transport and providing ward trolley services. Volunteers’ role in the NHS is expanding, according to Johnstone. “Take mobilising patients,” she says. “If you’re working on rehabilitation for older people, we know there is a big issue with people signed fit for discharge but having to wait on a ward while a social care package is organised. The NHS staff team will have worked really hard to get that person to that point where they can go home. It’s a frustrating wait and there are not enough resources because the clinical team will have moved on.” Volunteers can work with clinical staff to keep people fit for discharge by encouraging someone to get out of bed to eat lunch or teaching chair-based exercise. “That’s where there is quite significant training,” says Johnstone. “Volunteers have to be trained to a level that’s acceptable to clinical staff.” The RVS is working with clinicians and hospital trust boards to win them over. “We don’t want volunteers to be seen as a burden or yet another thing to manage,” she says. It is also partnering HelpForce, a national initiative set up in 2017 to integrate volunteers with NHS services and ease pinch points in patients’ progress through the healthcare system, from the queue at a hospital reception or delays in discharge caused by lack of transport to making someone available to collect prescriptions from the hospital pharmacy, as well as mobility support on wards, which is being piloted in Southampton. Outside hospitals, volunteers help people get to flu clinics, greet patients at surgeries and help them register or fill out paperwork. They also offer assistance to patients recently discharged from hospital. The King’s Fund report includes 10 case studies, including volunteers in Bristol and South Gloucestershire who talk to carers to help them find support networks, and those in Brighton and Hove and Christchurch who direct patients to local non-clinical services and organisations offering art activities, exercise classes and healthy eating advice. Buck says all the practices included in his report were clear about the need to manage and support volunteers. “Volunteers are not a substitute or saviour for the NHS; they largely provide additional support, which is neither free nor infinite, and requires significant investment and support,” says the report. It also notes that volunteering seems to work particularly well in general practice when there is a clear community benefit. Lampard’s review recommended proper resources for volunteer service managers. The DHSC responded with guidance on managing volunteers, but that was published only last year and the NHS does not have a comprehensive plan to integrate volunteers. However, Johnstone is positive that, despite some of the challenges, the NHS at 70 values its volunteers. Those who have received care from the NHS often want to give back, she says. As Keith Padmore, a retired dentist who is a volunteer driver for the NHS, puts it: “I just find it rewarding, to help people and to help the system a bit.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jun/22/honour-nhs-built-on-immigration-windrush","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-22T05:00:19Z","webTitle":"The NHS, Windrush and the debt we owe to immigration | Gary Younge","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/22/honour-nhs-built-on-immigration-windrush","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/22/honour-nhs-built-on-immigration-windrush","fields":{"headline":"The NHS, Windrush and the debt we owe to immigration","bodyText":"A few weeks ago, while looking for the family railcard, I found my mother’s first passport. It’s blue and hardbacked, with a lion and a unicorn perched on Latin and embossed in gold. The kind the Brexit types bang on about. The kind we will have when we get our country back. The ones that will be made in France. Only mum’s was a bit different. For above the crest it says British Passport and below, in the same gold lettering, it reads Barbados. It was issued by the governor of Barbados “in the name of Her Majesty”, and cites her nationality as “British Subject: Citizen of the United Kingdom and Colonies”. Barbados did not gain independence until 1966. My mother didn’t cross the border to come to Britain – the border crossed her. The black and white picture inside is of a teenager, just 19. High hopes, high cheeks and high hair, with dark skin against a crisp, white cotton blouse. On the penultimate page are the only two stamps. One, an entry certificate listing her as a student; the other from the immigration officer at Gatwick marked 20 August 1962 (a year later than I had previously thought). She arrived four months after the passing of the Commonwealth Immigrants Act – the first piece of legislation that sought to weaken ties and obligations with those whose colour was no longer deemed a good fit for the crest. The Labour leader at the time, Hugh Gaitskell (no radical he), branded it “cruel and brutal anti-colour legislation”. Even as Britain started trying to keep black people out, it sent for my mother, her passage paid up-front with an agreement that she would pay it back later, because the country desperately needed nurses. And so, as was the case for all my aunts who settled here, that would be her job for more than a decade. This summer will see the celebration of two 70th anniversaries – the creation of the National Health Service and the docking of the Empire Windrush, bringing with it the symbolic arrival of postwar migrants from the Caribbean. The first will honour Britain’s most cherished institution. The NHS makes us more proud to be British than the monarchy, even as we are more dissatisfied than ever with the way it is run. If there must be patriotism – and for now it appears there must – then let it be for a collective institution set up to care for everyone, regardless of their ability to pay, and paid for by everyone who is able to contribute their taxes. For the second, the nation will throw its arms awkwardly around a group of people it has relatively recently decided to revere – older Caribbean migrants – even as it seeks to avoid any substantive discussion of another, albeit related group that we continue to revile – immigrants in general. Our bigotry is both selective and fickle, but no less passionately felt for that. We pride ourselves, simultaneously, on being both tolerant and hostile: those we deport today we may dedicate a commemorative day to tomorrow. For the most part, these anniversaries will be marked separately – as though their age were the only thing they had in common. But we would grasp the historical importance and contemporary challenges of both much more clearly if we sought to understand them together, since their histories are intimately entwined. The NHS, like so much of postwar Britain, was built by immigrants and could not have survived in its current form without them. There were recruitment campaigns for nurses in Malaysia, Mauritius and elsewhere in the empire as well as the Caribbean. By 1971, 12% of British nurses were Irish nationals. By the turn of the century, 73% of the GPs in Wales’s Rhondda valley and 71% in nearby Cynon valley were south Asian. Today, roughly a third of the tier-2 visas for skilled migrants go to NHS employees. There is a certain civilising logic to this. For all the talk of national culture, ethnic diversity and racial difference, we are all human. As obvious as that may sound, (and when babies are being snatched from parents on America’s southern border or boats of refugees are being turned away from Italy the question of immigrants’ humanity has yet to be politically settled) it explains why health would be a sector that favours migration. The human body is the same the world over. Whatever sense of racial or national superiority one may harbour, it is likely to be tempered when the black foreigner in the white coat is the one charged with keeping you alive. Nonetheless, there is a contradiction that must be confronted. The institution that we value the most has been sustained by people whom we value the least. Even as the Thatcher’s rhetoric about being “swamped” by people of a different culture gained traction British lives were, literally, being saved by professionals from the swamp. If Enoch Powell’s “rivers of blood” prophecy had ever become true, the victims would have been patched up by doctors from India and Pakistan whom he invited to the country several years earlier, when he was minister of health. No claim about the strain that immigrants place on the NHS can be taken seriously without a concomitant appreciation of the strain it would be under were it not for the immigrants working in it. This is not a problem of the past. That fundamental inability to understand immigrants as people who stay and contribute, rather than as people who come and take, remains a central obstacle to any meaningful debate about immigration. Not only are we failing to have the discussion in terms of our human obligations; we are not even having it in the national interest. In few places is this clearer than the NHS. According to an NHS Improvement report, in February this year 35,000 nurse vacancies and almost 10,000 doctor posts were unfilled. There has been a growing exodus of European nursing staff since the Brexit referendum. Yet earlier this month the Financial Times reported that 2,360 visa applications by doctors from outside the European Economic Area had been refused in a five-month period. Last week the shortage forced the Home Office to exempt medical professionals from the cap on skilled workers that was set by Theresa May several years earlier. The outcry over the treatment of the Windrush generation last month shows that we are capable of both appreciating the contributions that immigrants make and protesting against the capricious and cruel state harassment that can be meted out to them. It has yet to fully sink in that what was wrong for the Windrush generation is wrong for all immigrants, and that when we argue for a more humane and less hostile environment for immigrants we do so not just for the sake of foreigners. We do it for ourselves. Our health depends on it. Seventy years after Windrush docked and the NHS was created, we should have learned by now. If we don’t watch out, our xenophobia will literally be the death of us.

It is the first time legislation stating a formal intent to negotiate a treaty or treaties with Aboriginal people has ever been adopted by an Australian parliament, and comes as a federal parliamentary committee conducts hearings to examine national options for constitutional recognition and a treaty following the Uluru statement. Other jurisdictions have also begun a treaty process, with the Northern Territory signing an agreement to begin treaty talks with four land councils last month, and the NSW opposition promising to begin the treaty process if it wins government. Treaty negotiations had begun in South Australia but were halted by the Marshall government. The Victorian Aboriginal affairs minister, Natalie Hutchins, said the passage of the legislation was a “historic moment”. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “Treaty will have benefits for all Victorians – promoting reconciliation, fostering shared pride in Aboriginal culture and helping to heal the wounds of the past,” she said in a statement. “Aboriginal Victorians will continue to be at the centre of this process, as we work towards establishing the Aboriginal Representative Body.” The Advancing the Treaty Process with Aboriginal Victorians bill 2018 establishes the framework for forming the Aboriginal Representative Body, which will in turn be tasked with setting the framework for negotiating a treaty or treaties with Aboriginal people and traditional owner groups in Victoria. It passed the legislative council on Thursday night after a five-hour debate on Thursday night, without the support of the opposition. None of the 42 amendments proposed by the Greens were adopted. Proposed amendments included a positive belief on behalf of government that Aboriginal sovereignty had never been ceded, replacing the Aboriginal working group with a clan elder’s council, inserting the definition of self-determination from the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, and appending a schedule of all known Victorian clans to the legislation. The Greens leader, Samantha Ratman, said the amendments addressed the concerns of many Aboriginal people that involvement in a state-based treaty negotiation process would undermine their sovereignty and negate their ability to participate in a potential future national treaty process. The special minister of state, Gavin Jennings, who carried the bill for the government in the upper house, said that Aboriginal sovereignty would only be lost if it was explicitly bargained away through the treaty process, a compromise to which Aboriginal people would never agree. Jennings dismissed concerns from Liberal MP Bernie Finn, who argued that the dictionary definition of a treaty was an agreement between two sovereign states and that, as Aboriginal Victorians were also Victorian citizens, Victoria was effectively proposing to sign a treaty with itself. He also argued a treaty was not necessary to address disadvantage. “What is preventing Aboriginal Australians from having the sort of empowerment to which you refer before any such legislation of the nature that we’re trying to advance today, or you’re trying to advance today, occurs?” Finn said. Jennings said the negative impact of 230 years of dispossession and systemic oppression of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples was “irrefutable” and that a treaty would go some way towards healing that damage. “It is a population-based disaster that has been imposed on Aboriginal people since European settlement,” he said. The Victorian Treaty Advancement Commission is conducting community consultation along the Murray River this week and will hold an information session in Swan Hill on Friday."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jun/22/labour-progressive-pledge-decriminilaise-drugs","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-22T08:42:29Z","webTitle":"If Labour is really progressive, it will pledge to decriminalise drugs | Michael Segalov","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/22/labour-progressive-pledge-decriminilaise-drugs","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/22/labour-progressive-pledge-decriminilaise-drugs","fields":{"headline":"If Labour is really progressive, it will pledge to decriminalise drugs","bodyText":"While discussion of drugs and drug policy often revolve around facts, figures and complex science, perhaps it’s worth reflecting on what I have witnessed at British music festivals over the past four years. Summer after summer, I arrive in fields across the UK on a mission to shine a light on how we take drugs. One year, I traipsed across campsites with DIY testing kits – helping revellers understand how pure their stashes were, and what they were cut with. I giggled as a lad pulled out a Rennie he’d purchased from a bloke in the early hours of the morning, thinking it was ecstasy; I sat with others, googling complicated sounding compounds with which their samples of ketamine, MDMA and cocaine had been mixed. Some were shocked by the revelations, while others weren’t bothered. Each, however, appreciated the opportunity to make a slightly more informed choice. It became obvious testing like this should be commonplace, but we will struggle to make it so as long as we criminalise the use of drugs. A year later I returned, keen to explore how attendees had managed to sneak their drugs through the searches, security and sniffer dogs. While the ingenuity was compelling (hiding drugs in a tampon was a highlight), once again, the risks being taken were laid bare. Those with experience and the know-how confidently snuck in their gear from a known supplier, while younger, more vulnerable users were left at the mercy of dealers on-site: their safety in the hands of unaccountable strangers. Last year I went to a festival in Dorset, to delve into the relationships fostered between drug dealers and users. Customer experience surveys and online reviews are commonplace for even the most specialist of retailers – a bad experience is shared online – they are how we make informed decisions. And yet our interactions with drug dealers – from getting in their cars in the dead of night to wilfully consuming whatever pills and powders we purchase – are very much leaps of faith. There’s no mechanism to warn others of a bad experience, and the risks are far greater than getting a sub-par pizza or a dodgy tan. On the final night of that festival, due to drug-related issues, a young woman died. There are two simple truths that need to be confronted: criminalising possession doesn’t stop people taking drugs, and the “war on drugs” has failed. Yet discussions are muted, sensible debates shrouded in misinformation and fear. So much so that Theresa May continues to argue life-changing medicine shouldn’t be available to ill children by virtue of it being derived from a cannabis plant. Meanwhile, Labour has said it would legalise the use of cannabis oil for medical purposes. Politicians are terrified of ending criminal sanctions for possession, claiming that it sends a message that taking drugs is normalised or condoned. A quick look at the 25 countries and 40+ jurisdictions that have taken this action make clear that this is not the case – an increase in usage simply hasn’t materialised. Meanwhile, nearly a third of British adults admit to having consumed an illegal substance in their lifetime, and approximately 3 million have done so in the last year. Decades of criminalisation have had little effect. It’s not just that the criminalisation is futile, it is also actively harmful. Consider Portugal, where drug decriminalisation has proved overwhelmingly successful since 2001 – the population is healthier thanks to a radical change in the law. There are now just six drug-overdose deaths per million people in Portugal, while the figure in the UK has risen to 60 per million – and drug-related deaths are rapidly increasing. Portugal also saw a 97% decrease in new HIV cases through intravenous drug use, and an 18% reduction in drug-related social costs over the first 10 years of reforms. Criminal penalties mean that asking for guidance, support and advice for recreational users becomes a risky business – and it is costing lives. Our refusal to speak openly about illegal drugs – both in schools and in society at large – means we’re failing to educate about how to engage with drugs safely, while glamourising their consumption as some sort of rebellious pursuit. Profits and public safety end up in criminal hands. Addiction is portrayed as an issue of law rather than health, with valuable resources diverted into policing and prisons rather than supporting users out of addiction. The evidence is obvious, the arguments clear, and yet our politicians refuse to take action. It’s the responsibility of government and law enforcement to help protect the population, to keep us safe. If the Tories are unwilling to take on this task in relation to drugs in Britain, it’s time the Labour party steps up. A sensible drug policy is long overdue, one that legalises cannabis, and decriminalises possession of illegal substances across the board. It creates space for a grownup debate about how best to educate the population and regulate the purchase of substances that, while illegal, will forever be accessible to those who want to find them. Enough with the jingoism, let’s start keeping people safe.

In 1964 she placed a notice on her gate, inviting people to dine in her rural home, Ballymaloe House, near Shanagarry in County Cork. Customers arrived each night in her blue dining room, called the Yeats Room after her husband’s collection of Jack Yeats paintings. Decades before the country house restaurant concept became popular, Allen served a menu that quickly gained a following. Using the best ingredients from her husband’s farm and other local sources, she set the menu for the day after the dayboat fishermen had returned from Ballycotton harbour and delivered their catch, and the best produce had been selected. Allen fostered strong relationships with suppliers, ensuring that they were paid properly for producing excellent ingredients. A selection of Irish farmhouse cheeses was served each night, at a time when artisanal cheeses were made by only a handful of independent producers across the land. Local children foraged for wild mushrooms, blackberries, elderflowers, damsons, sloes and other wild foods, which Allen incorporated into the menu. At a time when Irish food suffered from a poor reputation, Allen recognised that the ingredients on her doorstep were as good as those from anywhere in the world. Her style of cooking was simple and elegant, rooted in the farm-to-table relationship. Behind it all lay a deep respect for the land and a strong belief in nourishment through excellent food. As her unconventional business grew, the dining area was expanded and bedrooms were converted into overnight accommodation to obtain a wine licence, transforming the family home into a busy hotel and restaurant. From 1962 Allen was the cookery correspondent of the Irish Farmers Journal, combining cooking and writing. In 1975 she became the first Irish woman to receive a Michelin star, which she held for five years. The Ballymaloe Cookbook was published in 1977 and Myrtle Allen’s Cooking at Ballymaloe House in 1990. “The nice thing about Ballymaloe,” said the restaurateur and food writer Tom Jaine, “apart from the excellent cookery, proper service and handsome surroundings, was its lack of stuffy pretension. The symbiosis of farm and kitchen brought it down to earth, injecting a pleasing reality.” Daughter of Elsie (nee Stoker) and Henry Hill, Myrtle was born in Cork. Her father was an architect. At a Ballycotton lifeboat fundraising dinner in Shanagarry she met Ivan Allen, a farmer, and they married in 1943. Myrtle taught herself how to cook in order to feed her husband and then her growing family. In 1948, they bought Ballymaloe, a rambling country house built on the site of a 15th-century Anglo-Norman castle, where they brought up their six children. Ivan, a progressive farmer, created both a mixed farm and a horticultural enterprise in Shanagarry. In 1968 Darina O’Connell joined Ballymaloe and worked with Allen for several years cooking and teaching cookery classes. She married Allen’s son Tim and they went to live on a nearby farm, Kinoith, which they established as the Ballymaloe Cookery School. Darina Allen has described her mother-in-law as generous with her knowledge: “She inspired a generation of chefs.” Allen made large quantities of chutney using the tomatoes grown in her husband’s glasshouses, and this turned into a successful business in its own right: Ballymaloe Country Relish, run by her daughter Yasmin Hyde and granddaughter Maxine Hyde. Indeed, the Ballymaloe name is now a global brand and the Allen family are involved in many successful food businesses in Ireland. Allen’s daughter-in-law Hazel has managed Ballymaloe House since the 1970s. The TV cook, restaurateur and food writer Rachel Allen is a granddaughter-in-law. The menu at Ballymaloe House has changed little over the years, resisting trends. “It’s a memory that remains, as indeed does the tradition in this remarkable house,” said the chef Jeremy Lee. “The presence of Myrtle Allen ensured all was as it should be and in plentiful amounts, which included welcome, comfort and cheer.” Claudia Roden described Allen as “a great inspiration. She represented everything that was wonderful and lovable about Ireland. She created a beautiful world.” Ivan Allen died in 1998 and Mrs Allen (as she was called, even by close family) continued to live at Ballymaloe House for the rest of her life. She was regularly seen attending dinners and casting her eye over service in the kitchen. Her handwritten instructions for making the perfect porridge using stoneground Macroom oatmeal are still fixed to the kitchen wall. In 1999 she gained an honorary master’s degree from Trinity College Dublin and in 2000 an honorary doctorate from University College Cork. She received the Women and Agriculture lifetime achievement award in 2011, the Irish Food Writers’ Guild lifetime award in 2014 and, in April this year, the Hall of Fame award from touRRoir/Good Food Ireland. Allen is survived by her four daughters, Wendy, Natasha, Yasmin and Fern, two sons, Tim and Rory, 22 grandchildren and 36 great-grandchildren. • Myrtle Allen, restaurateur and food writer, born 13 March 1924; died 13 June 2018"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jun/21/eu-summit-theresa-may-brexit-decision","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-21T12:02:49Z","webTitle":"The Brexit abyss is fast approaching.

Time to apply the brakes","bodyText":"Brexit often feels like two passengers furiously arguing over the destination of someone else’s car. While the government and parliament’s rows about meaningful votes and customs relationships are significant – not least for the British constitution – they distort Brexit’s bigger picture. This car is being driven not in London but in Brussels. Next week’s EU summit has received much less attention than the government’s torturous withdrawal bill, but it could produce a far greater impact. The summit is crucial for two key reasons. First, it will determine the tone, backdrop and workload for the final months of Brexit negotiations. Despite the government’s overt ill-preparedness and frantic disarray, our withdrawal must technically be wrapped up in time for October’s European council meeting. Whatever is not agreed now must be agreed then. This leaves just 17 weeks of negotiating time, which include the arid weeks of August. A set of negative conclusions this month would represent the worst possible start. Second, and more importantly, this European council meeting represents the last opportunity for all parties to take stock of the situation, and if necessary change course. As at the December summit, the UK’s fate will depend on how seriously it takes the concerns of Ireland. Senior figures in Brussels and Dublin have spelt out the consequences of not resolving the border issue. Last month, the Irish taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, suggested that a lack of progress at this summit could precipitate a no-deal cliff-edge. That is not brinkmanship. Officials privately fret that the UK government remains in stubborn denial about the consequences of its decisions, and that after the summer it could find itself at the edge of the abyss by accident. Many observers additionally fear that businesses and EU citizens will see the writing on the wall before Theresa May, and trigger an economic shock that she will struggle to prevent or contain. The omens for a successful summit are not good. Yesterday, the EU and UK published a joint statement which outlined some progress on issues such as VAT, but no substantive developments at all on Northern Ireland. Key to this is the “backstop”, which ensures an open Irish border in all circumstances and for all time. Following the UK-EU agreement in December, the EU proposed that, as a last resort, Northern Ireland would remain permanently in both the customs union and single market for goods. The UK’s belated counter-proposal seeks to time-limit that and ignores the single market altogether – both of which make it unacceptable to the EU. The UK still has a week to revise its offer, but Irish ministers have openly expressed their pessimism. The backstop remains Brexit’s unsquareable circle. The UK will not accept a bespoke agreement for Northern Ireland because that creates a regulatory border in the Irish Sea. But the EU will not accept a UK-wide backstop as it considers that a cherry-picking of the single market. Northern Ireland can stay in just the single market for goods in order to preserve the Good Friday agreement, but the UK cannot be entitled to the same benefit. If the government wishes to implement the free movement of goods, it must also implement the free movement of people. The UK government’s fundamental choice is thus clear. Either it opts to stay in the whole single market and whole customs union, or it divides its internal market. If it chooses to leave the EU’s customs union as well as the single market, goods travelling to Northern Ireland from Great Britain will face checks not only on regulations but also on tariffs. The EU’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, recently discussed a sea border as both a realistic prospect and the necessary consequence of the government’s red lines. The government still refuses to take the threat seriously. May will almost certainly fall if she attempts either a sea border or soft Brexit, which is why she will strenuously attempt to avoid both. But while she can defer her confrontation with reality, she cannot escape it. Those are her options, and that is her problem. The government was driving the car until the moment it triggered article 50, and then it handed the keys to the EU. In reality, the vehicle contains not two passengers but 65 million British people. The government’s only power is to divert it from the cliff-edge or stop it altogether. Every day it declines to do so, the car hurtles towards a destination that none of us requested, and which will punish us all. • Jonathan Lis is deputy director of the thinktank British Influence"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"politics/2018/jun/21/uk-unveils-post-brexit-eu-citizen-settlement-scheme","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-21T11:59:58Z","webTitle":"UK unveils post-Brexit EU citizen settlement scheme","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jun/21/uk-unveils-post-brexit-eu-citizen-settlement-scheme","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/jun/21/uk-unveils-post-brexit-eu-citizen-settlement-scheme","fields":{"headline":"UK unveils post-Brexit EU citizen settlement scheme","bodyText":"The government has promised to fast-track the registration process for EU citizens who want to stay in the UK after Brexit, with decisions on applications to remain in the country reduced from six months to “a matter of days”. Unveiling details of the “settlement scheme” for EU citizens, the Home Office promised that the application process would be “short, simple and user friendly” with a default position of accepting rather than rejecting applications. Applicants will be asked to prove their identity, that they have no convictions, and that they currently live in the UK. The answers will then be compared to a database with the aim of giving the quickest answer possible. Sajid Javid, the home secretary, said: “With the scheme, we’re meeting our commitment to secure the rights of EU citizens who are already in this country, contributing in so many ways, they’re working, they’re studying, or for other reasons. “We want them to stay and we want to make that process of staying as easy as possible.” The scheme will open on a phased basis later this year and applications can be made online or smart phones, according to a 57-page “statement of intent” document published by the Home Office on Thursday. Passports and photographs can be posted or scanned in by owners of android mobiles but not iPhones. Applications will cost £65 per adult, with children half price. EU citizens will be issued with an ID number, but not a physical card, which they will be required to use for public services such as the NHS and possibly employment and property rental checks. Having faced steady criticism in the past 18 months over its treatment of EU citizens, the Home Office is promising to offer “human” contact for anyone who needs help. Caseworkers will be based in libraries and home visits will be offered to people who are housebound or in residential care. Carers, stay-at-home parents, retired people and students are eligible for settled status with no proof of income. Irish citizens will not have to apply but will have to provide proof of residency if they have non-EU spouses who want to remain in the UK. It has been estimated that the Home Office will have to process up to 4,500 applications a day to get through 3.2m applications before the programme closes in June 2021. However, numbers could be even higher, with the Home Office saying there could be anything from “3.2m to 3.8m” EU citizens eligible for the scheme. Applicants will be asked to submit their passport or ID cards along with a passport or digital photograph and the Home Office will then automatically check Revenue and Customs (HMRC), and Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) records for proof they have been living in the UK. Sources said the tax and benefits records were not a surveillance operation but “a proxy for proof of residence”. Anyone with a criminal record involving a jail sentence of more than 12 months is at risk of being rejected. Checks on the national police database and watch lists will be automatic but past crimes in the rest of Europe will not be automatic. If EU citizens do not wish to apply using their national insurance number and tax records, the Home Office will accept other proof of residence, including council tax bills, rental or mortgage statements, and utility bills. “Our default position will be to grant status,” Javid told the Lords EU justice sub-committee. “We will be looking to grant status as quickly as we can. We will not be looking for excuses at all to not grant status. It will be driven by default view, you provide this information, if you’re not going to be granted status there will have to be a very serious reason.” He said the Home Office would do everything to prevent another scandal like that around Windrush generation people. “A number of mistakes were made,” he said. “There were clearly people from the Windrush generation that were badly treated. We want to make sure we learn all the lessons from that.” The Home Office, condemned for taking six months to process applications for permanent residency, said it believed the system was now so automated with the HMRC and DWP checks that ID numbers would be issued “in a matter of days”. One of the main groups campaigning for the rights of EU citizens, the3million, urged the Home Office to think again about charging people. “If the government is really committed, it should remove all barriers including fees,” the founder, Nicolas Hatton, said. “Today’s statement will give hope to many EU citizens, but questions remain whether the Home Office will have the capacity to change the hostile environment culture to a welcoming approach.” It will be opening a contact centre with 1,500 staff, including caseworkers proactively making calls to people. “We will work with applicants to help them avoid any errors or omissions,” the Home Office said. The scheme will be launched in the late summer with specially selected test groups, and the system will be rolled out in the following months, becoming fully operational by 30 March next year. It will remain open for two and a half years, with EU citizens who arrive in the country eligible to apply right up until the end of December 2019, the proposed end of the transition period. Those in the country for less than five years will be granted “pre-settled status” which can be swapped for a full “settled status” ID after five years. The new status will also be considered a route to British citizenship, ending the need for EU citizens presently in the country to go through the permanent residency process. Close family members, defined as “spouse, civil partner, durable partner, dependent child or grandchild or dependent parent or grandparent living overseas” will be allowed to join those with settled status under a “lifetime right” of EU citizens already in the country. Labour MP Yvette Cooper, chair of the Commons home affairs committee, said “far more” answers were needed from the government “about what happens to those who aren’t registered by June 2021 through no fault of their own, such as children”. Immigration minister Caroline Nokes was also unable to guarantee the scheme would hold in the event of no deal. But Roger Casale, founder of the New Europeans campaign group, said the fact it was rolling it out before a Brexit deal is sealed “amounts to a unilateral guarantee to EU27 citizens who will now get settled status regardless of whether the withdrawal agreement is ratified or not”. The Federation of Small Business also warned the government that the cost to settle was still high for low income EU workers saying it was imperative the process was “affordable” for all to ensure workforces weren’t stripped of their EU employees."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/live/2018/jun/21/nba-draft-picks-all-teams-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-22T04:13:46Z","webTitle":"NBA draft 2018: Phoenix Suns select Deandre Ayton with No 1 pick – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2018/jun/21/nba-draft-picks-all-teams-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/live/2018/jun/21/nba-draft-picks-all-teams-live","fields":{"headline":"NBA draft 2018: Phoenix Suns select Deandre Ayton with No 1 pick – as it happened","bodyText":"Les Carpenter grades the draft: Here’s a full report of tonight’s NBA draft. Thank you so much for following along. There were lots of questions that were answered tonight, but many more that will prevail into the NBA’s free-agency signing period, which starts 6 July. With the final pick of the 2018 draft, the Sixers take the younger brother of Giannis Antetokounmpo, but, in keeping with their theme for the night, they’ve already reportedly dealt his rights to the Mavericks. King is a senior who averaged 13 points a contest out for the University of Colorado. Welsh is a seven-footer who shot above 40% from three-point range. Hervey is a 20-point-a-game scorer and the fourth player ever drafted from the University of Texas-Arlington. Spalding averaged 12 points and nine boards for the University of Louisville as a junior last year. Reaction to the Golden State Warriors’s pick of Jacob Evans Kulboka is 20-year-old from Lithuania who played one year in Italy. Milton scored 18 points a game last season for the SMU Mustangs at a .434 clip from deep. The Thunder get a standout from the University of Virginia’s constricting defense. The senior guard also shot .432 from three last season. Veteran player for Utah who played 138 games in four years for the Purdue Boilermakers. Solid get late in the second round for New Orleans as they net a 20 point scorer who shot .433 from three-point range. Johnson is a 6ft 9in forward who averaged 15 points a contest for the Missouri State Bears last season. The Spurs get a 6ft 11in forward out of USC who averaged 16 points and seven rebounds per game as a junior. Anytime you can grab a 20-point-per-game scorer this late is a good result. Bates-Diop comes out of Ohio State University. Will there be another Ball in the NBA? Very nice pick by the Lakers so late in the second round as they get a sharpshooter in Mykhailiuk who shot .444 from three at Kansas last season. The Rockets make their first pick of the night and take Melton who didn’t play at USC last season due to fraud charges. Nice. If you’re still with us, here’s some good reading on Michael Porter Jr. Solid pick for Brooklyn late in the night as they get a decent SEC guard out of Kentucky. Diallo is the fourth player from the Lexington powerhouse chosen tonight. I didn’t do my homework... Another Canadian makes it to the league Reposting this from earlier as Justin Jackson joins Shai Gilgeous-Alexander makes it two Canadians to be selected tonight! Denver adds Justin Jackson out of the University of Maryland to Michael Porter Jr from the first round. I think fans in the Mile High City will be pleased with their team’s work tonight. An OK pick for the Pistons who get a tall guard at 6ft 5in. Nice pick for the Magic who get a freshman out of Kentucky that struggled for playing time. Might be assigned to the G League to get some reps in. Yeah, I have no idea... Here you go. Sounds like Philly will stash Bonga in Germany for at least a couple of years... Another trade! But wait! Wingspan of 7ft 4 in should be a decent asset next to Kristaps Porzingis in the middle.. The Knicks are on the clock... Here’s a look at tomorrow’s sports pages in the Big Apple Third star point guard in a row as the Hawks take Devonte Graham out of the University of Kansas. Atlanta making a case for the winners of tonight’s draft. Another talented point guard goes high in the second round, as the Mavericks take the engine behind Villanova’s two championships. Will be an excellent backup to Dennis Smith Jr that should also see time on the court next to the Mavericks’s sophomore guard. Huge get for Memphis by taking Jevon Carter out of the University of West Virginia. West Virginia were the best defensive team in the nation for all four of Carter’s seasons in Morgantown, and the bulldog point guard was an instrumental part of that. Okobo was high on The Ringer’s draft board, so seems like another great pick for the Suns to add to DeAndre Ayton. At the halfway point... 30 to go! Only a couple minutes in between each of the second-round picks, which means that we can all go to bed in roughly an hour! Great pick for the Hawks, who get a 6ft 9in power forward who has the size to hold down bigs at the center position, as well as the finesse to slip to the outside for the three. I watched Spellman destroy Gonzaga back in December and definitely saw him going higher tonight. Potential steal for the Hawks who’ve had a great night so far. Brooklyn fans, this will help... Who? Yeah, me neither... According to The Ringer, Musa is a Rodney Hood-esque forward that can get hot and has the length to be a lockdown defender. If you missed it earlier, the NBA asked ESPN and Yahoo! Sports to not tip the picks before they were announced on TV. The language Woj and Chams have used to get around this all night has been hilarious... I think Woj is running out of verbs... The two-time reigning champs get a scrappy defender in Jacob Evans from the University of Cincinnati. Evans was part of an elite Bearcats defense last season and will bring great size and shooting to the West Coast. A solid pick for the Dubs. Golden State is on the clock.. The Celtics’s first pick of the night is a great one in Robert Williams, a versatile rim protector out of Texas A&amp;M. I saw Williams play back in January and he helped stall a prolific Missouri offense to just 49 points in a comfortable win. Brad Stevens always manages to find a way to get the most of his players, and there may not be a better place to land for Williams. Maybe the steal of the first round. Wichita State gets on the board! The Sixers take the Shockers’s leader in Shamet who’s a long combo guard who shot .442 from three this past season. What head coach Gregg Marshall has done for the Shockers program in the last five years is remarkable, and Shamet might end up being the best player to come out of that program. Best players still available... Moooooo! The Lakers join the party with a really fun big man in Mo Wagner, who carried the Michigan Wolverines to the NCAA Championship game this past season. Wagner can play down in the post, shoot threes and has enough positive energy to make everyone smile. Trail Blazers take Simons out of the IMG Academy in Florida, which is an alternative to the college game. Simons has plenty of flaws, but will have time to iron those out playing behind Damian Lillard and C.J McCollum in the Pacific Northwest. Interesting pick who is one for the future. A steal for Indiana who take the younger brother of Jrue and Justin Holiday (that’s one heck of a family). The former UCLA Bruin was a career .422 three-point shooter in three seasons out west, and will be able to spread the floor for Victor Oladipo to get to the basket. Love this pick. Notable No 23 picks... The Broncos of Boise State get their first player taken since 1999! Solid pick for the Bulls who take a senior that scored 20 points and almost eight rebounds a game. Nice pick up at 22. Donovan Mitchell and Grayson Allen are now teammates... Wow! Didn’t see Allen being taken this high, especially after questions surrounded his maturity and temperament for most of his four-year college career. Surprising move by the Jazz who are a young team on the rise. Pardon the cliché, but only time will tell if this one works out for Utah — it just depends on what Grayson they get. Third Dukie to be taken tonight though! Nice pick by the T’Wolves who get a 3-and-D wing that figures to play a similar role to Robert Covington of the 76ers. Okogie scored 18 points a game as a sophomore at Georgia Tech and grabbed more than six rebounds — pretty good for a 6ft 4in guard. Huerter is a sophomore out of the University of Maryland who’s a sharpshooter with a decent feel to get his teammates involved. In the new NBA, where three-point shooting is so sought after, Huerter figures to be a solid pick for the Hawks who are looking to get as many shooters around Trae Young as they can. Solid pick! The Spurs are in unfamiliar territory right now. Not only are they in the midst of a worst-case scenario with superstar Kawhi Leonard who wants to be traded, Gregg Popovich and co haven’t selected this high since they took Tim Duncan No 1 overall in 1997. In Lonnie Walker, the Spurs get an explosive guard who seems to fit the mold of the classic Spurs developmental picks of the past. Donte! The Bucks go with the star of the NCAA championship game who scored 31 points when Villanova beat Michigan back in April. DiVincenzo will provide new head coach Mike Budenholzer with yet another elite athlete, who can shoot the three, get to the basket and play lockdown defense on opposing guards. A GREAT pick that opens the floor for Giannis Antetokounmpo. Trade! Shams first on this one... Joel being Joel Interesting selection by Washington, which now raises more questions than it answers. The Wizards already have John Wall, Bradley Beal and Otto Porter Jr set as their one-two-three, and lack star talent in the front court. Brown Jr, a guard/wing, provides good shooting and defense, but an unspectacular pick. Missouri gets its highest pick in 18 years Michael Porter Jr slips to No 14 which will be a HUGE disappointment for the Missouri-native. MPJ was the top high-school recruit last year, but back surgery allowed him to play just 53 minutes for the Tigers. The medical records clearly scared teams off, but this might come back to bite a lot of teams in a place they wouldn’t want to be bitten. Clippers’s second pick in a row lands them a solid scorer whose 6ft 5in frame will allow LA great versatility on the wing. Together with the 6ft 6in Gilgeous-Alexander, the Clips could have a one-two punch that dwarfs opposing backcourts for years to come. Don’t love Miles Bridges’s decision to return to Michigan State for his sophomore year. Perhaps his intangibles improved, but his stats certainly didn’t. Was slated to be a top-5 pick last year, so that will cost him a few million in the bank account. Clippers take Miles Bridges, but will flip him to the Hornets for Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, this one reported by Shams... But wait! Canada stand up! LOVE this pick for Charlotte, who are struggling for direction with a ton of bad contracts. A new coach for next season, and now a new player that can play either the point or shooting guard. Does this mean Kemba Walker will be back on the trading block though? Sixers take the hometown kid! Mikal Bridges will play his basketball at Wells Fargo Center, about an hour from where he grew up. Oh, and his mother happens to be the vice president of human resources for the company that handles the hiring for the Philadelphia Sixers. Back to the basketball... Bridges is an EXCELLENT three-point shooter, and has the length to be a great defender. Will slot in nicely next to Ben Simmons and Joel Embiid. Some boos from Knicks fans in the crowd... Porzingis was also infamously booed, so what do they know. Knicks fans... The Knicks get another piece to build around Kristaps Prozingis. Knox was part of a solid Kentucky team this past year, though he was far from the lofty talents that have passed through Lexington in recent years. Knox is a long wing that can guard one through four and will be able to contribute immediately at Madison Square Garden. Collin Sexton likes the ball No 8 pick: Cleveland Cavaliers Select Collin Sexton The Cavs pass on Porter Jr.! That’s the first big surprise of the night as the Cavs take Collin Sexton, arguably the best guard in the draft alongside Trae Young. Sexton had one of the highest usage rates in college last year, so his NBA development will all depend on what LeBron James does in free agency... Duke gets its second player selected of the night! Carter Jr is a streaky 6ft 10in forward and was once Duke’s top prospect, until Marvin Bagley III reclassified Still, Carter Jr averaged 13 points and nine boards a game and will be a solid pick for Chicago who needs as much talent as they can get their hands on at the moment. It’s the new NBA! Strange one for Orlando, who already have Bismack Biyombo, Aaron Gordon and Nikola Vucevic up front. Still, I watched Bamba at the University of Texas in January and in person he looks a legit eight foot! Excited to see him play with Jonathan Isaac. The next Steph Curry? That’s been question stalking Trae Young all year. The dude can put the ball in from the logo, but he is more than just a shooter... But don’t get too comfortable, Mavs fans... Jaren Jackson Jr. video highlights Jaren Jackson Jr is a defensive phenom Memphis goes with Jaren Jackson Jr. who was a standout freshman at Michigan State this year. At 6ft 11in, Jackson Jr. is a premier shot blocker and rim protecter. Alongside Marc Gasol, you can expect the grit-and-grind Grizzlies to continue for a few more years to come. Dončić video highlights Who is Luka Dončić? The Hawks take one of the most mysterious players in the draft, but have reportedly agreed to trade the pick to Dallas for the fifth pick. Still, the nineteen-year-old was voted the EuroLeague’s youngest ever MVP this past season and has been compared to everyone from Magic Johnson to Kristaps Porziņģis. The doubts have crept in over the level of competition in Europe and other comparisons to Ricky Rubio might have scared Phoenix and Sacramento off. Still, a HUGE get for either the Hawks or Mavs. TRADE!!! Bagley III video highlights Here’s a look at some of Bagley’s top highlights from the past season. Duke dominates! In any case, Bagley going No 2 to the Kings is another success story for Duke, who has produced a top-three pick for five straight years. Coach K’s Blue Devils have become the premier pipeline of NBA talent in college basketball. (Sorry, UNC fans...) The Kings take Bagley! Picking second usually involves taking the next best player, but the top of this year’s draft is deep. Sacramento has had a slew of top picks in recent years, yet they still find themselves among the worst teams in the league. In Bagley, Kings fans can expect to see one of the best young offensive talents, one who averaged 21 points and 11 rebounds as a freshman at Duke this year. BUT going with Bagley means the Kings leave European sensation Luka Dončić on the board. It’ll be so Sacramento if Dončić blossoms into an all-star point guard in the future and Bagley becomes a solid starter. Ayton is an offensive juggernaut Here’s how good Ayton was on offense last year for Arizona... Ayton video highlights The Suns take Ayton! It can sometimes be tricky selecting first, but the Suns go with Ayton, who was an absolute beast on offense this season with the Arizona Wildcats and should become a decent NBA defender in due course. Let’s be honest though, Phoenix has needs all over the court, with Devin Booker the only bona fide star currently on the roster. Alongside Josh Jackson — the fourth overall pick in last year’s draft — the Suns now have a star trio with which to build from. It might be a few more years before you see them in the playoffs though... Here. We. Go. NBA commissioner Adam Silver is minutes away from appearing on stage in Brooklyn to announce the first overall pick. Who’s it going to be? My vote: DeAndre Ayton. Draymond Green petty? Never. And here is Draymond Green reeling off all 34 guys drafted before him in 2012. He’s not bothered though... Take that for data! You don’t have to pick in the top five to get a star in the draft. Just ask Darko Miličić and the Detroit Pistons. All-Stars like Jimmy Butler and Draymond Green were taken with the 30th and 35th picks, respectively, so the talented folks at The Pudding decided to re-rank every draft over the past 20 years based on each player’s career stats. The results (and visuals) are spectacular... Mo Bamba not feeling the love One player not getting much consideration for No 1 is Mohamed Bamba out of Texas. The dude is 7’1 and has a wingspan of 7’10. That’s almost eight feet of arms! Oh, and he can sling threes like Manute Bol. Hawks and Mavericks talking trade Half an hour to go until NBA commissioner Adam Silver is scheduled to step onto the stage at Barclays Center in Brooklyn. Marc Stein of the New York Times reporting a potential pick swap between Dallas and Atlanta... M-I-Z! Z-O-U! Regardless of where Michael Porter Jr. lands tonight, the impact he’s had on the University of Missouri’s basketball program has been absolutely huge. The Tigers were for years one of the worst recruiters among the big colleges, but shortly after MPJ switched his commitment from Washington to Missouri, the Tigers shot up to No 4 in ESPN’s class rankings and made the NCAA Tournament for the first time in five years. Another strong recruiting year should see them return to the dance again next year. Michael Porter Jr. to... No 12? ESPN insider Jonathan Givony has the former No 1 high-school recruit as low as No 12 on his mock draft. Did not see that one coming! MPJ this week called himself the “best player in this draft”, so it will be a big disappointment if he drops outside the top 10, but a huge steal for the Clippers who own the 12th pick tonight. Soon-to-be millionaires Don’t they all look dapper? Free-agency moves... A couple of moves that have been made over the past 24 hours, reported first by who else... Lakers enquire on Kawhi Leonard Shams Charania of Yahoo! Sports reports that the L.A. Lakers have engaged the San Antonio Spurs about Kawhi Leonard. The disgruntled superstar met with head coach Gregg Popovich in San Diego on Tuesday, but wants out! Leonard of course appeared in only nine games this season due to a mysterious quadriceps injury, resulting in disagreements between the Spurs’ doctors and Kawhi’s own group about how to treat the injury. Leonard is under team control for only one more year, leaving the Spurs in a tough position to get back enough value for the franchise-changing player. If not the Lakers then where? Preamble Hello and welcome to The Guardian’s 2018 NBA Draft Liveblog! Lots of questions will be answered tonight, but first the big news of the evening… NBA reporting-phenoms Adrian Wojnarowski and Shams Charania will not be tweeting draft picks before they’re officially announced. The NBA asked reporters from ESPN and Yahoo! Sports to refrain from revealing the picks before NBA commissioner Adam Silver. The call by the NBA means thousands of Woj’s followers (myself included) won’t have to mute him for the rest of the night. Dwight Howard has been traded, again. The Charlotte Hornets have reportedly sent Howard to the Brooklyn Nets in exchange for Timofey Mozgov, two second-round draft picks and cash considerations. One of those second-rounders will be the 45th pick in tonight’s draft, the other in 2021. The move allows Brooklyn to dump the two years and $32.7 million left on Mozgov’s deal and replace it with Howard’s expiring contract. This will mean the Nets could have enough cap space for TWO max-contracts next summer. Lakers acquire 39th pick in tonight’s draft. Magic Johnson and Rob Pelinka made their first move of the draft, which not only nets them another player, but also has implications for the upcoming free-agency period that starts 6 July. Second-round draft picks don’t count against the salary cap until after free-agency ends, which means the extra pick won’t hamper the Lakers’ salary for when they target the game’s top free agents (*cough*LeBron James *cough)."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2018/jun/25/when-good-tv-goes-bad-the-american-office-steve-carrell","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-25T12:00:02Z","webTitle":"When good TV goes bad: how the American Office downsized its comic potential","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/jun/25/when-good-tv-goes-bad-the-american-office-steve-carrell","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2018/jun/25/when-good-tv-goes-bad-the-american-office-steve-carrell","fields":{"headline":"When good TV goes bad: how the American Office downsized its comic potential","bodyText":"American remakes of British comedies are prone to disaster. Failed pilots exist for Spaced, Absolutely Fabulous, Peep Show, The Thick of It (pre-Veep), The Young Ones and The IT Crowd. YouTube provides evidence of some of these bizarre and tone-deaf interpretations. British humour loves merciless sarcasm, brutal self-deprecation and ink-black irony. It champions losers of epic proportions whose excruciating predicaments make you want to pull your teeth out. Some mainstream American comedy (certainly not all) favours sentimentality and charm, plus a seeming inability to cast any main characters who aren’t pristinely good-looking. So, in 2005, when an American version of cringe classic The Office began, expectations were in the toilet. The first episode lived down to expectations. It mirrored, often word for word, the UK version. The stapler in the jelly was there, as were the forced and antiquated “wassup” greetings. Watching it was akin to coming home to find a bunch of strangers dressed as your family. They are saying and doing the right things but you want these ill-fitting weirdos out of your house. Thankfully, the writers saw that this was leading nowhere and ditched the imitation game. Steve Carell’s Michael Scott became an entirely different character to David Brent. Less repellent and more endearing but equally needy and still someone you’d hide from if you saw them outside – or even in – work. From season two to five, the show became truly itself: developing its own cadence, introducing new characters, and creating a relationship arc between Jim and Pam (Tim and Dawn) that possessed genuine emotional weight. It was a distinctly American show built on quintessentially British foundations but it worked and, indeed, often soared. Cracks appeared in season six, as consistency dipped and plotlines ballooned. This continued throughout season seven, by the end of which Carell left. The finale looked for his replacement, teasing Jim Carrey, James Spader, Will Arnett, Catherine Tate and even Ricky Gervais, appearing as Brent in a stale, apathetic cameo. Then, Warren Buffett showed up. Gervais even called this himself, writing on his website: “If you’re going to jump a shark, jump a big one.” The original show succeeded in capturing the suffocating grey aura of the workplace, its painful interactions and insufferable banality. The American Office always had great episodes outside of those drab walls but by season eight, when there was a drunken pool party at the boss’s mansion and entire episodes set in Florida, it became clear the writers had used up the comedic possibilities of the office and therefore the show. Season nine was loaded with flops, especially one truly awful episode that was a worked-in spin-off pilot based around Dwight Schrute’s family farm. Even Carell seemed bored and awkward as he returned in the series finale, unable to bring life back to a show that was slapped with a Do Not Resuscitate order some time ago."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"books/2018/jun/29/crudo-by-olivia-laing-review","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-29T08:00:37Z","webTitle":"Crudo by Olivia Laing review – mingling the personal and political","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jun/29/crudo-by-olivia-laing-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/jun/29/crudo-by-olivia-laing-review","fields":{"headline":"Crudo by Olivia Laing review – mingling the personal and political","bodyText":"What a writer does – tentatively at first and then, as time goes on and the word count adds up, with more confidence and force – is establish a place for herself where she’s at home. She creates a writing-self in both her style and subject matter. Olivia Laing has been doing that across her three non-fiction books and now she’s trying out the novel; her writing personality feels continuous between her non-fiction and fiction. She has great curiosity and intelligence, and responds with intensity to the lives of others, especially in her sympathetic portraits of writers and artists. She sees things clearly, but her sanity is swamped with doubt, drawn to what’s on the edge, what’s dangerous. This slippery mix of reasonableness and self-doubt feels very English; at the beginning of her first book, To the River (2011), she worries that she’s “too dry in myself, too English”. The worry in itself is characteristic and appealing. In To the River she follows the River Ouse from its source to the sea, writing beautifully about the landscape and using it as a prompt for digressions personal and historical, as well as for meditations on Virginia Woolf’s drowning. In The Trip to Echo Spring she draws together six male American writers who were alcoholics, and in The Lonely City she searches in New York for the meaning of loneliness through the lives of artists – Edward Hopper, Andy Warhol, Henry Darger, David Wojnarowicz. There is always something of Laing’s own life in the mix: broken relationships with men, or years of living as a child with her mother’s alcoholic partner, or following a lover to New York where he abandoned her. The change of focus in her books, from rural England to metropolitan America, feels crucial; she instinctively knew that judicious middle-class Englishness needed an injection of American crazy. Of course ironic, inhibited Englishness isn’t any kind of inoculation against unhappiness, instability or alcoholism – far from it. But a certain English sensibility, with its dryness and know-how, can fit these days like too tight a skin; all English authors have to fight their way past that. The epigraph for Laing’s first book is from Ecclesiastes, and her Ouse journey took in the Andredesleage, a lost ancient woodland, along with the dead of the Battle of Lewes in 1264. By the time she arrives in The Lonely City she has shed that burden of ancientness and long perspectives. Her references have a new contemporaneity: Hopper’s work is about as old as it gets. So it makes sense that for her protagonist and narrator in Crudo, Laing has self-confessedly used a composite of elements from her own life and from the life of punk writer and counterculture provocateur Kathy Acker: between them these elements compose the writing persona. She calls her Kathy, too. All the crudest, most violent things in Crudo come from Acker, with borrowings acknowledged at the end: not only the language-shocks (“My life is delicate – more delicate than my cunt”), but the apparatus of extremes and disasters: family wealth, a mother’s suicide, a double mastectomy. Acker, too, stole stories from other people and used them as her own – it wasn’t cheating, it was a new way of thinking about personality and its permeability. The story in Laing’s novel is fairly minimal: Kathy, who has been wild in her youth, is in her 40s now, and perhaps it’s time for some stability – she’s going to get married to a man much older than herself. This comes from Laing’s recent past: last year she married the writer Ian Patterson, previously married to the late Jenny Diski. Kathy is in love, she’s sure her husband is a good and lovable man. He’s English, he knows things and understands things, he relays to her the funny conversations he overhears while they’re on holiday, talks to himself “in a low confiding tone, offering exhortation and encouragement” while he’s cooking. She’s excited about embarking on a new life, but also dismayed by what she might be giving up – solitude and selfishness, adventures. It’s difficult, incidentally, to imagine the real Acker choosing to marry such a man, but perhaps that’s beside the point. What an irony that bad Kathy is going to get married, of all things! Why not just try living together? The novel is almost a dialogue staged between the two parts of Laing’s writing persona, the judicious and the crazy. On the one hand, there’s the allure of a dream of perpetual youth, behaving badly and moving on to the promise of the next relationship; on the other, the relief and bathos of “growing up”, choosing furniture and paint for your home, having to take someone else into consideration all the time. Getting married is Kathy’s test, and the test must be momentous – a contract, a sacrament even – not just another whim. The wedding plans are tinged with a slightly hysterical irony, trying out a performance to see whether it can hold, whether she can not only carry it off but also mean it. (“On the original question, is Kathy nice, it’s looking like probably no.”) And they do get married, and Kathy has her moments of panic, lest it’s all been a disastrous mistake. Her husband’s sad eyes upset her but also infuriated her, she detested being responsible for anyone else’s happiness. Like can’t you just figure out what you need and get it? Why do you have to keep asking me? After a few months, however – by the end of the novel, when she embarks on a trip to America without him – she feels sure. “She waited for her flight. She loved him, she loved him. Love is the world, pain is the world.” This is a sweeter, kinder book, perhaps, than it quite wants to be. Kathy actually seems perfectly nice, or at least as nice as most of us, though she has her moments (when she and her husband come home, for instance, to find the decking has been painted the wrong colour, and she screams). At the end of The Lonely City’s exploration of urban anomie Laing is hopeful, too, and her last word on loneliness is that it’s the result of “stigma and exclusion”, not an existential condition: “What matters is solidarity.” Hopefulness and kindness are her authentic writing self, better than any parade of disabusedness. With its minimal development, Crudo perhaps feels a little thin after the satisfying thickness of Laing’s non-fiction, which is crammed so full with other people’s stories. It is story – the astonishing stuff that happens – that pegs open the space of fiction, gives it room to breathe. In Crudo her triumph, rather, is rendering on the page the texture of a very contemporary sensibility. Kathy’s observations and reactions are tumbled together in her sentences, with her dreams and her endless internet trawling, her eating and drinking and her reactions to contemporary news events – Trump’s election, the rise of the populist right – happening as the book was being written. The novel form famously struggles to represent the intersection in our lives of the personal-parochial and the political-global: here’s a way to try. And the writing is often so fresh and clever and funny. She was experiencing one of those occasional upswells of love, when she suddenly felt satiated on a neurological and also soulful level, enough and not too much pleasant information saturating the synapses in her brain.

People said to me: “Oh you’re a very kind girl, you would be a good nurse.” This stuck in my mind. Then, when the quota came from England asking the West Indian girls to come up and help the NHS in a time of short supply, I took advantage. I came over in 1966 and got a very good training at Farnham in Surrey. Then I went to London and worked at several hospitals before ending up at St George’s in Tooting, where I stayed until I retired in 2005. I liked my job very much. They were strict with us where I was trained, but very nice. If you were making the beds and the fold in the sheet was not in the centre of the mattress, God help you – you’d have to undo it and redo it in the sister’s presence, and you’d be shaking like a leaf. When I went to London it was much more relaxed, but I’m glad I had that strictness trained into me. Over my career, I did cardiac, medical and surgical nursing. The most pressurised was cardiac – you had to be very good with people with heart problems, they would be very unwell. But it’s a very nice job, because the patient comes in at death’s door, and the nurses and doctors work on them, and when you see them go through the door walking again, you feel great: we restored somebody back to their health. You really have to be inside the profession to appreciate that. I’ve noticed nursing changing over the years. When they brought in the patient’s charter in the 1990s, a lot of discipline was lost on the ward. I think nursing is all about the basics. You have to have so much education to be a nurse now, but I found that when nurses came from university, they had no practical knowledge. For me, training on the job was a good way to learn. Then you could build up your knowledge and do your research as you went along. The NHS is one of the best organisations in the world. Every country envies it. This is something we have to boast about, therefore we must work to save it. If a young person was considering becoming a nurse today, I would tell them: “You go into nursing my dear, do not listen to what anybody says” – because I tell you, it’s one of the most rewarding jobs. And the money’s not too bad now. In my day, we got hardly any money. But I enjoyed the nursing and I praise the NHS for having me here [from Grenada]. My only regret is that I had to retire. When I go back to the ward to see some old friends, the nurses say to me: “Come on Cecilia, will you get a uniform and come and help us?” • Life as an NHS nurse in the 1940s: ‘You have to forget about yourself’"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"money/2018/jun/23/holiday-money-best-cards-currency-rates-bank-charges-cash","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-23T06:00:05Z","webTitle":"Holiday money: how to find the best cards and currency rates","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2018/jun/23/holiday-money-best-cards-currency-rates-bank-charges-cash","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2018/jun/23/holiday-money-best-cards-currency-rates-bank-charges-cash","fields":{"headline":"Holiday money: how to find the best cards and currency rates","bodyText":"Picking the wrong plastic to use while on holiday abroad this summer could prove a costly mistake, but the good news is that there are a growing number of fee-free debit and credit cards available. App-based banks such as Monzo, Starling and Tandem are providing an alternative to the excessive charges often imposed by the big banks when you use their cards for purchases and withdrawing money overseas. Meanwhile, some established names, such as Halifax and Barclays, offer credit cards that can help you avoid being caught out. Some people who have high-charging cards may feel they can’t be bothered to take out another card or open a current account simply to avoid the fees, but if you are heading off in July or August, it’s not too late to apply for a card that can enable you to escape unnecessary charges and poor exchange rates. With contactless card usage growing rapidly in France, Spain and other countries, it is important for holidaymakers to be aware that with some cards, making lots of small wave-and-pay purchases – a slice of pizza here, a beer there – can end up generating a big bill. That’s because some cards apply a purchase fee on each transaction, which is in addition to the “currency conversion” – or non-sterling transaction fee – imposed when you buy something in anything other than pounds. Financial information firm Defaqto warns: “Using a debit card for small payments, such as contactless to buy a coffee, can be very expensive.” It adds that a daily €5 (£4.37) breakfast of a coffee and croissant over a fortnight could end up incurring up to £21 in fees, on top of the £61 total cost of the breakfasts. For example, with Santander’s debit card, each one of those €5 breakfasts would cost you an extra £1.37, made up of a £1.25 “purchase fee” and 12p currency conversion charge per transaction. Meanwhile, watch out for cash machine charges. For example, some banks, including NatWest and HSBC, charge their standard current account holders £9.50 for a £200 withdrawal from an overseas ATM. One of the big problems for consumers is that the fees for using plastic abroad are often complex. Charges at shops and restaurants Most people using a debit card from a major UK bank to pay for purchases overseas will typically be charged a little under 3% for the privilege in the form of a non-sterling transaction fee. For standard current account holders at Barclays, HSBC, NatWest and Santander, it is 2.75%, while at Lloyds and the Halifax it is 2.99%. Some debit cards come with an extra sting in the tail in the form of a purchase fee, which is in addition to the non-sterling transaction fee. This charge is £1.25 at Santander, £1 at TSB and 50p at Lloyds and Halifax (though some accounts at banks are exempt). Avoid using these cards if you make lots of small payments. Charges for using ATMs The majority of Britons using a debit card at a foreign ATM will be charged a 2.75% or 2.99% non-sterling transaction fee. In the case of Barclays, HSBC and NatWest, the typical charge is 2.75%, while at Lloyds, Halifax and TSB it is 2.99%. On top of that there is often a separate ATM fee, which is sometimes expressed as a percentage of the amount taken out. At Barclays, Lloyds and Halifax it is £1.50, at TSB it is 1.5% and at HSBC and NatWest it is 2%. Watch out for ATM providers applying their own charges too. Cutting costs with the new players There are a number of cards that won’t charge you a penny in foreign exchange fees or other bank charges when you use them in shops, hotels and restaurants, or to withdraw money from cash machines. This is one of the areas where the hi-tech new arrivals to UK banking are making a name for themselves. Monzo is particularly popular among the under-30s. It started out offering a prepaid debit card before switching customers to a full current account. Payments abroad are free, with no added fees. If you are taking out cash overseas, you can withdraw up to £200 from ATMs in any 30-day period without fees. After that, Monzo charges 3% of the total amount you withdraw above £200. Starling also offers a mobile-based current account that comes with a debit card. It won’t charge you to use your card abroad or to withdraw cash from ATMs. Tandem offers a cashback credit card that has no fees for making purchases or withdrawing cash abroad. Cardholders earn 0.5% cashback on purchases anywhere in the world. Similarly, Revolut, which launched in 2015 and markets itself as a “banking alternative”, offers a free current account with a card that customers can use overseas in more than 150 currencies with no fees. They can also withdraw £200/€200 per month free from ATMs, or £400/€400 per month if they sign up for Revolut’s £6.99-a-month premium account. Then there is the Loot current account, which offers a card you can use in more than 210 countries without fees. Overseas ATM withdrawals are free for the first two each month, then £1 per use. Other options for cutting costs In terms of other banks, Metro offers a decent deal: you don’t have to pay any fees when you use its debit card to make purchases or withdraw money in Europe. And the Cumberland, a building society based in Carlisle, has a current account where you can use your debit card for free worldwide. But to apply, you have to live within its branch operating area. There are also several fee-free credit cards from traditional players. Halifax Clarity is one of the best-known and has no usage fees however you use it. Whatever you spend abroad is converted to sterling at a rate set by Mastercard. Halifax is currently running a £20 cashback promotion to tempt people to sign up before 31 August. Other credit cards that have no fees on purchases and/or cash withdrawals abroad include Santander’s Zero, Creation’s Everyday, Barclaycard’s Platinum Travel (with this, there are no fees on spending and withdrawals until 31 August 2022), Nationwide’s Select and Virgin Money’s Travel card. Prepaid currency cards These are another option for people who want to budget on holiday or avoid taking cash. They are loaded with the foreign currency of your choice, so you can only ever spend the balance on the card and it can be topped up on the go. However, Defaqto says many prepaid cards have high fees or other catches, such as loading or renewal fees. It adds that many of them cannot be used for car hire, and customers might also have difficulties at places such as petrol stations. Your travel money checklist • If you’ve still got several weeks to go until you set off on holiday, consider applying for a fee-free card or account in time for the summer. • If that sounds like too much aggravation, or you haven’t got time, check the overseas charges that apply to your debit/credit card before you set off. At least if you are aware of the costs you face, you can adapt your spending accordingly. • Think about a prepaid currency card. These can be a good option for people on a tight budget or who don’t want to carry lots of cash. But it’s vital to check the fees and charges that apply. • If you plan to take some foreign currency with you, use a site such as TravelMoneyMax. It lets you put in your postcode and find the cheapest deals near you. • If you’re picking up a hire car, make sure your credit card has enough credit. Car hire desks will often seek to block a sizeable sum on your card for the duration of the rental if you don’t buy their excess insurance. • When paying by card overseas, watch out for the dynamic currency conversion trick at restaurants, shops, hotels and so on. The general advice is to always pay in the local currency. • When using ATMs on holiday abroad, it’s usually better to make one or two larger withdrawals rather than lots of smaller ones. Buying before you go Want the security of some euros in your hands before you go abroad? Whatever you do, don’t pop into your local bank – they are nearly always the most expensive way to change money – and never use an airport exchange desk unless you are desperate. The general rule of thumb is that those tatty-looking bureaux de change near train stations are the best value, while outlets in the likes of Tesco, Marks &amp; Spencer and Debenhams offer rates significantly better than high street banks. And if you must use airport bureaux, at least book the money in advance for collection. You have three options: delivery to your home, collection from a bureau or changing at the airport, and each one offers different rates. A useful starting point is the TravelMoneyMax website by MoneySavingExpert, which lets you compare providers and put your postcode in to find the best local suppliers. Delivery This is a sensible option for those living some distance from a bank or bureau de change, although delivery fees make it better value for large amounts of currency. According to TravelMoneyMax, the best value for delivery when Guardian Money checked earlier this week were BestForeignExchange.com and TravelMoneyClub.co.uk. They would give us around €566 for £500, delivered to our door. For those who want the security of a big-name firm, Tesco Bank scores highly. The supermarket group would give us €561 for our £500, including next-day delivery. It also lets you collect the foreign currency at any of 400 stores. If you are buying less than £500 worth of foreign currency, there’s a delivery charge of £3.95. Sainsbury’s Bank, Asda and Debenhams were not far behind Tesco in price. By comparison, even the best high street bank offer, from HSBC, left travellers £15 worse off than Tesco when changing £500. Collection This is where city centre bureaux de change offer the best value. In our test to change £200 into euros, we were offered €226 on the day at Ice, Thomas and Best Foreign Exchange bureaux across London. Debenhams was not far behind at €225, while Tesco and Asda offered us €224. At the airport The walk-up exchange rates at airport bureaux de change are poor. A bureau at Cardiff airport had the dubious honour of recording the worst exchange rates for holidaymakers last summer after sterling dipped heavily against the euro follwing the Brexit referendum. When Guardian Money spoke to Forexchange at Cardiff airport this week, it said it would offer just €0.91 for each £1. At Gatwick airport, rates are a little better: Moneycorp told us that it would give €0.96 per £1 for walk-up customers. In other words, if you were changing £500 at Gatwick you would receive just €480 – €86 less than the best rate we were able to get by planning ahead. Both Forexchange and Moneycorp workers at the airports told us it was far better to go online to their sites a day or two before travelling and book the money to collect at the airport. The rate customers would get by doing this would be closer to €1.10 per £1. Beware bad conversion rates If you have not ventured abroad for some time, you may be surprised at the number of hotels and restaurants (and even ATMs) that ask customers paying by card whether they would like to be billed in sterling rather than in the local currency. The option is typically presented on the card terminal and users must pick which currency they wish to be billed in before keying in their pin. These businesses are not being helpful – in most cases they have introduced “dynamic currency conversion” to make extra money by offering you a less favourable exchange rate than you would get from your bank or card provider. If you choose sterling, the charge is often 4% more than it would have been and is on top of any normal fees your card provider levies. The practice is particularly prevalent in Spain, but is seen across Europe and further afield. It is now routine at many ATMs too. In almost every case, consumers opting to pay a hotel bill in pounds rather than the originally quoted euros (or other currency) will pay more by accepting the converted amount. The advice is to always pay in the local currency. A few years ago, some restaurants claimed you could only pay in the converted currency, but this appears to have been outlawed. You are within your rights to insist on paying in the local currency and should refuse to go ahead if you are not offered the choice."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jun/25/trans-equality-class-struggle-obsessive-arguments-boundaries-identity","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-25T08:00:02Z","webTitle":"The fight for trans equality must be recognised as a class struggle | Shon Faye","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/25/trans-equality-class-struggle-obsessive-arguments-boundaries-identity","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/25/trans-equality-class-struggle-obsessive-arguments-boundaries-identity","fields":{"headline":"The fight for trans equality must be recognised as a class struggle","bodyText":"A third of UK employers are less likely to hire a trans worker, according to a new survey. This is hardly news to those of us in the trans community. People are much more transphobic than they think they are, according to the British Social Attitudes survey. Yes, 82% of people say they are not prejudiced against transgender people “at all”. But according to the same survey only 41% of Britons think trans people should “definitely”’ be able to teach kids. And only 43% are happy to confirm that trans people should be police officers. Prejudice – much of it unconscious – makes employers less likely to hire a trans person. The fact that policing and teaching are specific areas where people don’t trust us is telling – in the public psyche, these are both considered positions of authority. It’s certainly easy to wonder if the persistent misrepresentation of trans people as deluded or deceitful has infected the minds of those who quietly decide not to hire them. Trans unemployment is not monitored in the UK – but in Ireland it’s at 50%. In the UK, it’s certainly much higher than the national average. Half of those trans people who do manage to find employment have to hide the fact they are trans – either they are closeted and unable to transition, or they transitioned some years ago and are able to hide their history (though unchangeable physical traits will permit only some trans people to do this). If you are in work and not hiding the fact that you’re trans, you’re at risk of workplace harassment, which can run from procedural injustice to verbal taunts or violence – one in eight British trans people have been physically attacked at work. Even when trans people are able to be out in work, not all the work available to them is good. I still remember the first time I ever knowingly spoke to a trans woman. I was about 20 years old. In my summer vacations as a student, I worked in one of the many call centres in my home town of Bristol. It was cold calling: a truly thankless and lowly paid job on a zero-hours contract, where the time you are away from your desk on a toilet break is recorded and, if deemed too long, flagged to a manager who sternly tells you to urinate more quickly in future. The office demographic was unlike anywhere else I have worked, in that two minority groups were overrepresented: visibly trans women, and women from Bristol’s Somali community. A customer service role where you didn’t have to face the customer in a wig or a hijab was no doubt a common incentive for both sets of women, who are also over-represented in Bristol’s hate crime statistics In the end, I was caught smoking by a manager during work time and simply never offered any more hours – employers can in effect “sack” you with impunity when you’re on such a precarious contract. For the trans women I worked alongside, I can’t imagine it was easy to get time off for critical medical appointments, which are handed down on high from the NHS gender identity clinics with little room for negotiation. Physical transition is expensive and traps trans people in a vicious circle – the more you look like society’s idea of an acceptable or conforming man or woman, the more likely you are to get employment opportunities. But to achieve this appearance usually requires subsidy. The NHS does offer up to eight sessions of free laser hair removal on your face – but only after languishing on a waiting list for anything up to two years. I didn’t wait, and needed about 20 sessions; it cost me well over a thousand pounds. I paid because I knew that if I didn’t have a beard shadow, street harassment would diminish and employment prospects would increase. It worked. Most trans people are not middle-class writers, however, and most are not able to move in with family for long stretches as I did to help finance my transition. Instead, the answer for many is sex work. Too much of mainstream British feminism is still stuck in a self-righteous paroxysm of disgust to seriously consider sex work a form of labour. Yet it is labour in which the workers have no legal protection, and no union – and they risk criminal prosecution, as well as putting their own personal safety at risk, to earn money. In the trans community particularly, sex work has become a necessary, if precarious, financial lifeline for those who have been frozen out of the labour market. Sex worker emancipation and trans politics are intimately connected – not because sex work is “empowering” but because they overlap in their analysis of labour relations, workplace safety and dignity. Both movements demand better healthcare, less social stigma, fairer distribution of public resources and evidence-based policy. The trans movement is easily infantilised as amounting to the whinges and navel-gazing of trendy middle-class students who have OD’d on Judith Butler. But the idea that trans equality is a kind of middle-class liberalism, a luxury unconnected to the “real” politics of class and labour, is a media myth. Class is determined by your ownership of assets or capacity for acquiring them. The vast majority of trans people in the UK score low on both counts – they are by definition working class and have little agency over whether they can sell their labour, the kind of labour performed or the conditions in which they work. To move forward, trans liberation must be recognised as a class struggle as well as a feminist and anti-racist endeavour. The time for vicious and obsessive arguments about the boundaries of identity has passed. • Shon Faye is a writer, artist and standup comedian"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"books/2018/jun/27/the-occasional-virgin-by-hanan-al-shaykh","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-27T11:00:37Z","webTitle":"The Occasional Virgin by Hanan al-Shaykh review – farce, faith and sexual revenge","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jun/27/the-occasional-virgin-by-hanan-al-shaykh","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/jun/27/the-occasional-virgin-by-hanan-al-shaykh","fields":{"headline":"The Occasional Virgin by Hanan al-Shaykh review – farce, faith and sexual revenge","bodyText":"Lebanese-born Hanan al-Shaykh has never shied away from depicting female sexuality in her fiction: she did it in her earliest novels and in her ribald retelling of One Thousand and One Nights in 2011. What worked so well in that fabular setting is less successful in the modern day of The Occasional Virgin, which features two friends who fled the conflict in Lebanon 20 years previously. Huda is a Muslim and lives in Canada; Yvonne, who lives in London, is Christian. Both are independent and successful, but grew up in households weighted in favour of men, with difficult mothers to contend with, and this past comes in flashbacks after they meet for a holiday on the Italian coast. They are also single, and it is clear that they are sexual adventurers on this trip abroad: Yvonne flirts aggressively with an Italian student while Huda goes on a date with a gardener. The novel shows some early promise – a discussion of their displacement from Lebanon is illuminating, and contrasts are set up between the friends’ faiths - but sadly this is not explored with any degree of depth. Instead, indirect inner monologues create flat and binary characters: Yvonne is 37 and her thoughts whirl around ways to ensnare a husband and have children before it is too late. In one typical scene, she appraises a stranger: “Yvonne hurries over to introduce herself to the young Arab man, thinking to herself Arab men don’t bother withdrawing before they come, relying on women to take precautions.”Huda is less desperate, but her sexual ambition is fuelled by spite. On a trip to London, she meets a hardline Muslim man at Speakers’ Corner, who undermines her in a short conversation about Islam, suggesting that she isn’t pious enough. She decides to seduce him, and the secret weapon in her conquest, it turns out, is a strawberry that she inserts into her vagina before they have sex: “All I’m going to think about is the strawberry waiting to explode, and the satisfaction of having my revenge on him when he sees my virginal blood and his arrogance and self-righteousness melt away.” Every step of her seduction, and what comes after, feels wholly implausible, as well as her original motivation for sexual revenge. The language, translated into English by Catherine Cobham, also jars – “The waters of the Mediterranean groaned in pain, like a giraffe with backache”, for example, or “sadness rises like bile in her throat and bewilderment is an octopus extending its tentacles inside her head”. Yvonne and Huda ultimately inhabit the cliche of scheming, avenging women. If it were straightforward comedy or farce, it might be a more coherent work, but the tone wavers between the comic, dramatic and potentially tragic. By the end, the novel reads as if it is still circling around its characters, still trying to find its voice. • The Occasional Virgin by Hanan al-Shaykh (Bloomsbury, £16.99).

My imagination was always fired by her stories, so I went to Edinburgh University to study nursing. The university pioneered teaching of the subject as a graduate profession, although there was a real prejudice back then that nurses shouldn’t be educated. We were “too posh to wash” or “too clever to care”. Nursing’s been a passport to me working all over the world, practically and academically, punting both boats at the same time. What other careers can give you that? Role models are very important in nursing. Mine was a sister, Elise Nielsen – I worked with her in a specialised surgical ward in my early 20s. She’d encourage us to ask questions and challenge, and she’d do the same with us, constantly. She also made herself available for patients’ families in the ward, pretending to be fiddling at her locker, just so they knew they had access to her. She was a first-class communicator, which is what great nursing is all about. One patient that’s stayed with me is a man I was in charge of when I was a first-year student nurse. He was in hospital for a lower-leg amputation; he got through the operation well, but one morning I went to see him, eating his porridge, and he looked awful. He’d had an internal bleed unrelated to his surgery, and he started to deteriorate after that, and he died. I was wrecked. But situations like that are important because they deepen your sense of empathy, and your need to provide and receive support and solidarity. They make you realise how important team spirit is in those situations. Female-dominated professions like nursing and primary school teaching have long lagged behind in terms of career prospects and training, and now we have cuts to continuing professional development. There’s also been the removal of bursaries to support nursing training places in recent years, while the recruitment of medical consultants has gone up by 25%. The double standards are very clear. Planning blight makes things worse. In Australia, they’ve boosted nurse recruitment over the last decade in response to the expanding numbers of elderly patients. We haven’t. Last year, the number of nurses leaving rather than joining the NHS tripped over into negative balance for the first time. The nursing shortage at the inception of the NHS was recognised by Aneurin Bevan as being so serious he described it as a “national disaster” – it threatened the very viability of the early service. Our profession needs emergency policy action and intensive care if we are to staunch the haemorrhage of staff and hold off the impending crisis. The idea of the NHS as a drain on society has grown, too, when it should be seen as our biggest asset. Its existence is not just about the provision of healthcare on an obvious level – it’s also a huge employer, the fifth largest in the world. One of the best ways to maintain the health of a society is to keep it in employment, and the upkeep of the NHS is the bedrock of our social security in so many ways. Also, if you educate a nurse, you educate their family, and their community. We need to think of the wider effects, which go far beyond the front door of the A&amp;E department. • Life as an NHS nurse in the 1950s: ‘Patients never had to wait on trolleys’"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2018/jul/09/is-the-truth-of-sex-work-finally-being-told-in-fiction","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-07-09T15:01:53Z","webTitle":"Is the truth of sex work finally being told in fiction?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jul/09/is-the-truth-of-sex-work-finally-being-told-in-fiction","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/jul/09/is-the-truth-of-sex-work-finally-being-told-in-fiction","fields":{"headline":"Is the truth of sex work finally being told in fiction?","bodyText":"Rachel Kushner’s new novel, The Mars Room, is named for the strip club where her protagonist Romy Hall dances, and not the prison where she’s incarcerated and most of the story takes place. “There isn’t any status in it unless you’d be impressed to know that the Mars Room is not a middling or mediocre strip club,” Romy tells us, “but definitely the worst and most notorious, the very seediest and most circuslike place there is.” Tucked in San Francisco’s underbelly, the Mars Room club is quietly extreme; in the arc of fiction more widely, The Mars Room novel is quietly disruptive. In Romy, we have an American woman, a stripper, and single mother working during the 9/11 era, telling us her own history and teaching most readers something about the realities of the sex industry and the justice system. In the company of a handful of recent novels, Kushner’s indicates that fiction about sex workers is finally going beyond the tropes. Writers have been fascinated with sex work for as long as the two professions have existed. The harlot who is half-oracle, half-fallen woman was established by mostly male writers: if we start with Shakespeare, the likes of Defoe, Balzac, Hugo, and Zola bring us swiftly through the centuries. By the 20th century, we have the brothels and clubs of Steinbeck, Kerouac, Llosa – where the fictive prostitute is still sibylline, and still weighed down by the heaviest of male gazes. By the 80s and 90s, most of the novels that prominently feature sex workers are still by men: JG Sandom, William T Vollman, Carl Hiaasen, Arthur Golden. Comparable work by female writers came in the early 2000s – Slammerkin by Emma Donoghue, The Walworth Beauty by Michele Roberts – but most novels still avoided the realities of the contemporary sex industry, writing velvety historical fiction that remained rooted in the tropes of yesteryear. Even though most sex workers through history have been women, few have told their own stories in literary fiction. This is a quick scan of hundreds of years of literature, but it’s enough to demonstrate the trends. There’s the narrative that belongs to a historical prostitute; her life is sepia-toned, told with the soft-focus of nostalgia and tragedy. There are the prostitutes and strippers of crime fiction, stories about men who do gritty drug deals while the women are mostly just bodies in the background, on a lap, and probably later in the morgue. A near relative is the self-consciously serious fiction written by respectable men, such as the late Tom Wolfe who once described a stripper with her “tail” and “cloven melons … thrust up like a bonobo’s or a chimpanzee’s”. But worst of all, there’s the literary fiction written by men who have certainly done “research” but have become the customers who, as Kushner’s Romy Hall puts it, “believe that the girls choose the rhinestones and stilettos because they are the type to wear them”. The female perspective on the sex industry has mostly been told through memoir, from Colette to Belle de Jour. But in the last few years, female novelists have begun to explore contemporary reality of the industry, placing sex workers at the forefront of stories and experiences that shouldn’t be owned by the customer. Katherine Faw’s novel Ultraluminous is a sharp portrait of K, a prostitute-as-businesswoman. In Leopoldine Core’s story Hog for Sorrow, in her collection When Watched, Lucy and Kit work for a boutique agency where the narrative of an underprivileged woman forced to sell herself is subverted. “All anyone wanted to do was get plastered and sleep around,” Kit tells us, explaining that she only dropped out of college due to boredom. “It was a lot like being a prostitute, she thought, only she had never gotten paid.” Along with Kushner’s, these books add up to a new trend: fiction that gives dimension to sex workers, books that explore the economic frameworks that shape their work, books that give the women compelling interiority. These authors are using fiction to achieve something that reportage can’t: they give us stories about women that are, in some ways, more true because there’s no distance between writer and subject. We get the woman’s full story, free from self-conscious guard or journalistic distance. They also upend any idea of fantasy in the work. “Money is money. The great neutraliser,” Romy tells us when recalling a particularly odious regular. “I pushed my ass into his clothed lap, to empty his wallet. When the wallet was empty either he would go to the bank machine in the lobby of the Mars Room and get more or he wouldn’t, but if he didn’t he would be back tomorrow.” When writing without firsthand experience, most authors do research, perhaps “embed” themselves. But that hasn’t been the case for fiction about sex workers — you can’t go back in time to an 18th-century brothel, and what’s the line between a visit to a strip club and “field work”? Whether an author is male or female, to claim that a knowledge of gender and sex is enough to write a true portrait of a sex worker glosses over of the complexities of such a role, and usually ends up perpetuating lazy myths about them. “That Daniels is considered a dumb whore on the one hand and a saviour on the other is pretty telling,” wrote children’s author and former sex worker Juniper Fitzgerald on the website Tits and Sass, about the varied responses to the Stormy Daniels story. “In our culture, we want our sex workers to occupy uncomplicated little boxes. Leftists and rightwingers alike want sex workers to fit into one of two wildly different narratives.” In an age where those sides are more unlikely than ever to meet a nuanced middle ground, books are emerging that achieve just that. Truthful portrayals of sex workers are long overdue in mainstream fiction. Perhaps because of this, the sex industry they portray remains distinctly heteronormative; in The Mars Room, sex, hookups and gender identities occur across a spectrum inside the prison, outside that diversity is gone. In Faw’s novel there’s mention of a “lesbian discount”; in Core’s, a lesbian fantasy is offered as a means to satisfy the sex worker’s closeted desires. It’s hard not to feel that some realities are being left unexamined. But literature evolves slowly – who knows what we’ll be reading in a decade? The Mars Room is published by Jonathan Cape.

My initial inquiry was ignored and, eventually, I was told that, as I had bought my tickets from Trainline, it should deal with it. I have written to Trainline three times, and each time the reply – with a more helpful tone than Virgin – asked for a 12-digit ID. I have sent this, but any sort of resolution is nowhere to be seen.

Dimbleby, 79, who has chaired the most high-profile British political TV show for 25 years, announced this week he would step down in December, sparking widespread debate over who should take over the role. During questions to the digital, culture, media and sport secretary in the Commons, Vicky Ford, the Conservative MP for Chelmsford, asked Matt Hancock’s view on Dimbleby’s replacement. “Does he agree with me that in this year, 100 years of women’s suffrage, this baton should be passed to a woman?” she said. Hancock replied: “While of course the job must go according to merit, I think it’s about time that we had a woman at the helm of Question Time.” The calls for the coveted Question Time role to be given to a woman come as the BBC has pledged to address issues including gender inequality over pay and on- and off-screen opportunities. The race to replace Dimbleby has opened up fierce competition among the potential candidates, with Samira Ahmed, the journalist and presenter of Radio 4’s Front Row programme, using Twitter to throw her hat in the ring and state her credentials. Other leading internal candidates include the Newsnight presenters Emily Maitlis and Kirsty Wark, the Radio 4 Today programme hosts Nick Robinson and Mishal Husain, and Desert Island Discs’ Kirsty Young. The BBC could choose to go for a more left-field choice such as Victoria Derbyshire, whose morning news show on BBC Two has won a series of awards, or the Radio 5 Live presenter Emma Barnett, who received plaudits after standing in for Andrew Marr on his Sunday programme this year. Outside the BBC, the Channel 4 News anchor Krishnan Guru-Murthy has been speculated as a potential candidate. Dimbleby is one of only three presenters to have hosted Question Time since it was first broadcast in 1979. The others were Robin Day and Peter Sissons. The current host has gained a cult following during his time on the programme, attracting parody Twitter accounts and even dancing competitions. “I do know there’s a Dimblebot and there’s a Dimbledance and I can do it too,” he said on the show in 2011.

If he means it, it seems he hasn’t convinced his own department. Emails from within the Department for Transport, released under the Freedom of Information Act (FoI), were handed to me by a passenger group this week. They describe our key northern routes as lacking “value” and discuss how to fob off MPs and passenger groups who raise complaints, such as being forced to “drag heavy bags between stations”, because officials in London have cancelled and diverted vital rail services without bothering to consult those of us who use them. The emails discuss how to hand a “sop” to passenger transport groups. They outline what is referred to as a “classic handling strategy … [which is to] propagate the myth that the service is closing entirely then people will rejoice at the news that it is merely being diverted”. They state clearly that key routes will be cancelled, while sending ministers and officials out to claim the opposite in public. One email is signed off “yours cynically, etc. etc”. For three years, after the Tories awarded the Northern franchise to Arriva Rail North, MPs across five northern constituencies tried to get the Department for Transport and Northern to listen to our concerns about planned changes that came into effect on 20 May this year. We warned the new timetable would force people to change trains on dangerously overcrowded platforms or leave them stranded miles from their end destination. We said it would devastate local economies and cause serious hardship. Just weeks before the changes came in, with electrification already delayed indefinitely, I wrote to Grayling, asking him to think again and delay implementation because of the serious disruption these changes would cause. I also wrote to the northern powerhouse minister, Jake Berry. He didn’t even bother to reply. The contempt towards Northern rail commuters and their representatives will come as no surprise to those who daily contend with our underfunded, outdated, unreliable public transport. Four years after we were promised station upgrades, improved capacity, new trains and electrification, promise after promise has been broken and the “northern powerhouse” lies in tatters. Our public transport system receives three times less funding than London and we are still not permitted to run our own services. Even before the current chaos, passengers were frequently left stranded because of cancellations. The trains that do turn up are older than I am. Frustrations have spilled on to social media, where passengers post pictures of trains that “rain inside”, or where corridors become sewers as toilets break down. In response, Northern’s regional director, Liam Sumpter, took to social media to abuse and patronise customers. When he was caught he apologised, but he is still inexplicably in his job. The human cost has become apparent in recent weeks. Parents who cannot get home to pick children up from school; a disabled woman left alone without carers when her husband was stranded; families running up huge bills on taxis they can’t afford to keep desperately needed jobs; and a woman on her final warning at work. Yet the culture revealed by these emails is one of officials sitting behind their desks hundreds of miles away, carving up services they have never used, with no regard for those affected and no understanding of the human cost of their failure. The response from the transport secretary shows clearly that nobody in this system believes they are accountable. Grayling says this didn’t happen on his watch, but will not release the emails relating to his time in office that would show clearly what he knew and when. He says he didn’t know about these concerns, despite two years of correspondence with me and fellow MPs and a “working group” set up to resolve them attended by his own rail minister. He says he cannot comment on “leaked” emails, despite having been informed clearly that they were released by his own department under FoI. In taking this approach, he is confirming what most Northern rail commuters already knew. Just as our rail routes “lack value” to those in power, so too do our public services, our views and our everyday lives. In such a rotten, broken system, these latest emails come as no surprise. Or, to quote government officials, “yours cynically. etc. etc”. • Lisa Nandy is the Labour MP for Wigan"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"football/2018/jun/21/morocco-nordin-amrabat-concussion-questionable-fifa-world-cup","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-21T10:44:34Z","webTitle":"Fifa: Morocco decision to play Nordin Amrabat after concussion ‘questionable’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jun/21/morocco-nordin-amrabat-concussion-questionable-fifa-world-cup","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/jun/21/morocco-nordin-amrabat-concussion-questionable-fifa-world-cup","fields":{"headline":"Fifa: Morocco decision to play Nordin Amrabat after concussion ‘questionable’","bodyText":"Fifa has described Morocco’s decision to allow Nordin Amrabat to play against Portugal only five days after he suffered a concussion as “questionable”, as they said they had written to the African nation’s team doctor to remind him of their protocols. Amrabat was taken off in Morocco’s opening Group B defeat against Iran last Friday after a clash of heads, in which he suffered memory loss and had to spend the night in hospital. “Until I woke up in the hospital, I think five, six hours totally gone,” the Watford winger said. “It’s a bit scary.” Fifa’s guidelines suggest a minimum of six days between a concussion and returning to play but they do not have the authority to enforce this. The final decision rests with the team doctors. Amrabat started the Portugal game on Wednesday in a protective scrum cap but he discarded it early on. He was excellent over the 90 minutes, although Morocco lost to exit the tournament. The manager, Hervé Renard, described him as a “warrior”. “Following the questionable handling of the concussion incident involving the Moroccan player, [Nordin] Amrabat, during the Morocco-Iran match, Fifa wrote to the Moroccan team doctor to remind him of the importance to adhere to the guidelines that have been communicated,” the governing body said in a statement. “While the assessment and case management of concussion incidents falls under the sole responsibility of the respective team doctors, Fifa will address this matter with the Moroccan FA and, speaking in general terms, Fifa will monitor closely this matter throughout the competition.” Fifa added that the Moroccan Football Federation would need to explain why Amrabat was allowed to play against Portugal. The decision sparked anger from the world players’ union, FifPro, and brain-injury experts. There were concussion incidents at the last World Cup in Brazil, including one in the final when the Germany midfielder Christoph Kramer slumped to the ground. “This is yet another alarming example of a player being put in harm’s way,” FifPro said. “Amrabat returned to action too soon according to medical guidelines. Four years on from the debacle of the last World Cup, where several players did not receive adequate care, football has not made sufficient progress in concussion management. Repeated calls to implement world-class safety standards have been overlooked.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/2018/jun/21/french-grand-prix-paul-ricard-return-racing-former-glory","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-21T11:28:34Z","webTitle":"Return to Paul Ricard the first step to recapturing glory of French racing | Giles Richards","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/jun/21/french-grand-prix-paul-ricard-return-racing-former-glory","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/jun/21/french-grand-prix-paul-ricard-return-racing-former-glory","fields":{"headline":"Return to Paul Ricard the first step to recapturing glory of French racing","bodyText":"Described at the time as an “earthquake”, the shockwaves expected by the disappearance of the French Grand Prix from the Formula One calendar have taken an awfully long time to make themselves felt. When the race finally takes place at Paul Ricard this weekend, a full decade will have passed since the last one was held at Magny-Cours. France held the first grand prix in 1906, was integral to the establishment of organised motor racing and had been host to Formula One every year bar one since the championship began. Yet in 2008 the financial realities of modern F1 afforded it no special treatment and, unthinkable as it must have seemed to French fans, the sport simply took its leave. What was expected to be a short absence became a long wait and its return is understandably being celebrated. It was that race in 1906 with its prize of 45,000 francs that gave the world the grand prix and France would host a further 85 before organisers of the F1 meeting were forced to drop it, unable to continue absorbing annual losses of close to £2m. The then president of the Fédération Française du Sport Automobile, Nicolas Deschaux, said he hoped the cancellation would “act as an earthquake and provoke some reaction from the state and private companies in France”. The reaction did not prove to be swift but with its slow gestation has come an optimism that the race has a long-term future. The event has a five-year deal and is promoted by a public-private partnership backed by the regional government, who see it as an investment. The arrangement is notably similar to the one under which Spa on Wednesday extended its contract to 2021. Renaud Muselier, president of the Région Provence-Alpes-Côte d’Azur, says he expects it to generate “almost €65m in economic benefits” and 500 direct and 1,500 indirect jobs. The mayor of Nice, Christian Estrosi, who is president of the French GP organisation, also highlighted the expected returns to “ensure a considerable uplift in our tourism economy”. They have the backing of Liberty Media too, which is keen to re-establish F1 in a market where it has previously been strong. Paul Ricard may be somewhat isolated geographically but Liberty have chosen to host this season’s second F1 Live event in, Marseille, 30 miles from the circuit. Despite its location, Ricard is a good choice. Although it hosted 17 GPs, Magny-Cours was never taken to the hearts of French fans. This weekend, the race will be run on the full, classic version of the track at Le Castellet, rather than the truncated layout used after Elio de Angelis’s death during testing in 1986. The circuit hosted 14 races between 1971 and 1990 will run to 3.63 miles, including the 1.1-mile Mistral straight, which will once again lead into the flat-out glorious Signes right-hander. The straight has been broken up by one chicane, an effort to offer a non-DRS overtaking opportunity, and the configuration was approved by Lewis Hamilton, Sebastian Vettel and Fernando Alonso when presented to them. The organisers see a future for the meeting there but France’s racing past is also rich and widespread. On a trip to visit forgotten tracks, inspired by the book Autodrome – The Lost Race Circuits of Europe, I discovered F1’s lingering legacy across the country. There was then the frankly terrifying prospect of racing round the edge of a volcano – cliffs to one side, a sheer drop to the other – in the mighty challenge of the 5.1-mile Charade circuit at Clermont-Ferrand, so demanding it provoked motion sickness in some drivers. The super-fast triangular blast of the first track to host F1 in France, at Reims-Gueux, is a series of public roads now, the pits and grandstand stand as silent sentinels beside the D27. While Rouen-Les-Essarts, considered by many drivers to be the one of the best circuits in Europe, with the majestic Virage des Six Frères sequence, can only be discerned as once hosting five GPs after some scrabbling through undergrowth. They all attracted huge crowds in their heyday and, with three French drivers as well as Renault on the grid, there is no shortage of home interest in the race’s return. Organisers are expecting to sell out their estimated 65,000 capacity at Ricard. It has been a long time coming, now all they need is a race that does justice to the wait. Renault will be under scrutiny, of course, but they will be the focus of attention before a wheel has turned after Red Bull announced they were dropping them as an engine supplier and switching to Honda next season. It marks the end of a remarkable relationship. With Renault engines Red Bull took 57 wins and most notably four drivers’ and constructors’ championship doubles between 2010 and 2013 – a period of success overshadowed by the increasingly fractious relationship of recent years. Red Bull’s decision is bold given Honda’s recent form but eam principal Christian Horner is confident the Japanese manufacturer will bridge the gap to Mercedes and Ferrari. McLaren, it must be noted, were similarly optimistic. Renault’s managing director, Cyril Abiteboul, responded by saying he hoped to make them “regret their decision”, outperforming them on track – verbal sparring that will doubtless be rejoined at Paul Ricard."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"money/2018/jun/25/virgin-active-gym-membership-cancel-pregnancy","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-25T06:00:54Z","webTitle":"Why didn’t Virgin Active freeze my membership in my maternity leave?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2018/jun/25/virgin-active-gym-membership-cancel-pregnancy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2018/jun/25/virgin-active-gym-membership-cancel-pregnancy","fields":{"headline":"Why didn’t Virgin Active freeze my membership in my maternity leave?","bodyText":"I joined Virgin Active in 2016, and in February 2017, in the late stages of my pregnancy, a staff member offered to freeze my membership, but agreed to let me swim in the pool at no cost as this was the only activity I was still capable of – and only once or twice a week.

Here, members of an almost exclusively white underclass – the excluded, the poor and those riddled with debt, drugs and drink – live without running water, sewers or electricity apart from the little they can generate with solar panels. In this photograph, Revon, 21, who occupies half of the battered, bullet-riddled bus with her 55-year-old mother (the other half is occupied by a couple with two children), meets Michael, 27, a former marine and Iraq veteran who has recently arrived in Slab City.

This series, developed from a film entitled Outremonde (Underworld) after the novel by Don DeLillo, was produced during the two months that Henno lived in Slab City in 2017. Even in an apocalyptic nightmare, Henno finds light: Revon and Michael become friends, then lovers after she introduces them, and Dave, a former drug- and alcohol-addicted evangelical pastor, creates a community vegetable patch in the desert. “I went back after a year and the bus in the picture was burned and Revon and Michael had gone their separate ways but the garden was growing,” Henno says. “There were even tomatoes.

Child’s play","bodyText":"Scampi, I remember once reading, used to be very expensive. In the 1950s, ordering scampi in a restaurant was a really swanky thing to do. To contemporary ears, the word would have the same connotations that lobster and champagne do today. It feels a bit incongruous, like Princess Grace having a cheese ploughman’s at her wedding breakfast. But there it is: scampi was a prized and pricey luxury. So what happened to it? Did it somehow get much less delicious, but still basically palatable, so restaurateurs concluded that they couldn’t charge top dollar for it any more and it became the basket-borne bar snack of the 1970s and beyond? Obviously not. It just got more plentiful and so cheaper. Because of fishing or farming or freezers, I suppose, it was suddenly possible to dish out millions more plates of it, so it lost its cachet and ceased to be a luxury item. I realise the term scampi probably now covers a wider range of marine biomass nuggets than it did in the dish’s postwar glory years. There’s scampi and there’s scampi. I mean, they were putting horse in lasagne, so I wouldn’t want to be a slow-moving walrus or squid when an unscrupulous scampi trawler breasted the horizon. But in a nice pub, where they might call it “wholetail scampi”, I imagine they’re basically dishing up the same item Noël Coward would have paid through the nose for as he handed over his ration book at the Café Royal. Most of us know how that tastes. It tastes fine. It’s OK. A bit fishy, in both senses of the adjective, but a broadly acceptable vector for tartar sauce. But I think we’re clear what we’d do if it suddenly quintupled in price: we’d just stop ordering it. We can all live with never eating scampi again – it’s just slightly gristly fish and chips that you don’t have to cut up. So what were they thinking, those people in the 1950s? Never mind all the sexism, racism and homophobia, never mind McCarthyism and Korea and Suez – that’s all very regrettable, but then people have always been absolute bastards. But what were they thinking, paying so much for scampi? I was put in mind of the cost of luxuries by reports that, according to this year’s Coutts Luxury Price Index, it’s rising way ahead of inflation. Inflation is at 2.4%, but there’s been an overall price rise of 5.5% in luxury cars, Savile Row suits, private school fees, posh boozes and other high-end items that make up the Coutts luxury basket of goods. This is one of the few baskets in which you won’t find scampi. It’s long since ceased to be a luxury food, so doesn’t qualify. But that actually raises a question about how you measure price fluctuations only in items that are incontrovertibly expensive. If their prices were to fall enough that they wouldn’t be deemed expensive anymore, would they stop qualifying for the basket and so fail to mitigate the apparent inflationary trend? The story of scampi demonstrates that all that is required to render an otherwise unremarkable thing luxurious is for it to be very expensive. That’s what drew people in the 1950s to pay so much – the simple fact that it cost so much. Its exclusive price made them keen to be included in the elite group that could afford it. They would then undoubtedly tell themselves they were eating something exceptionally delicious, as people do now with truffles, caviar, pate de foie gras and a whole host of other astronomically pricey items whose flavours range from quite nice to weird, but none of which actually tastes as good as a slice of buttered toast. There’s no schaden in any freude we might feel about the fact that the super-rich might have to pay a bit more for the ridiculous stuff they buy. The respectful solemnity with which designer clothes, luxury cars, extremely expensive watches and daft modern art works are viewed makes me well up with contempt. Whenever I see an advert for a designer watch, for example, I imagine all the stupid men looking at it, nodding and seriously muttering: “Nice watch”, aspiring to own it, or perhaps being able to buy it and add it to some prissy collection, and I am mystified at their certainty that this is a more noble use of their finite span than, say, a rampant heroin addiction. But what does this inflation really mean? Well, for Sven Balzer, head of investment strategy at Coutts, it means that “anyone looking to maintain the spending power of their wealth in the long term should consider a diversified investment portfolio alongside cash holdings”, but then he’s got products to sell. Some of the price rises are probably a sign of real economic changes and uncertainties – fluctuating currencies, Brexit, Trump’s enthusiasm for a trade war – and it’s nice to think that the jet set are copping a bit of that flak as well as everyone else. Mainly though, it just means that those who make or sell all the overpriced crap have decided to put prices up because they know people will pay them. In fact, people may be even keener to pay them because the exclusivity of the basically-just-a-bag/dress/car/watch/school/bottle of tequila/holiday is reinforced by the higher charge. These retailers aren’t looking to give their “best price” – they need this stuff to cost too much or it will start to seem normal. It’s all the inevitable consequence of the widening gap between rich and poor. As the world splits further in two, with a small plutocrat class increasingly distant and separate from the rest of the population, the luxury brands need to nail their colours firmly to the superyacht mast. These days, some people can pay anything, which means some have to charge anything. Either that or they risk going the same way as scampi."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"film/2018/jun/21/star-wars-spin-offs-solo-crashes-at-box-office-lucasfilm-episodes-franchise-results-prequel","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-21T11:56:55Z","webTitle":"Star Wars spin-offs put on hold after Solo crashes at box office","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/jun/21/star-wars-spin-offs-solo-crashes-at-box-office-lucasfilm-episodes-franchise-results-prequel","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/jun/21/star-wars-spin-offs-solo-crashes-at-box-office-lucasfilm-episodes-franchise-results-prequel","fields":{"headline":"Star Wars spin-offs put on hold after Solo crashes at box office","bodyText":"Further Star Wars spin-off movies have been put on hold after disappointing box-office results for Solo: A Star Wars Story. According to the website Collider, “sources” have revealed that Lucasfilm, the franchise’s main producer, has decided to concentrate its efforts on the official episode series and scale back development of future one-off movies, known as the anthology series. Solo’s US box office takings stand at $196.2m (£148m) after three weeks on release. By comparison, Rogue One had banked more than $455m at the same stage. Globally, Solo’s total is now $343.3m, well off the pace to match Rogue One’s final $1.06bn. Industry analysts have predicted Solo will lose at least $50m for its studio, Disney – the first time that a Star Wars film has failed financially. Star Wars’ spin-off movies were originally conceived as a way to both modulate the franchise into a Marvel-style “universe” while filling the gap between releases of the main-narrative episodes. Episode IX, directed by JJ Abrams, is in production and scheduled for release in December 2019. However, the release of the Solo prequel only a few months after The Last Jedi has led to what industry observers have called “franchise fatigue”, with Disney subsequently forced on to the back foot in terms of its strategy. The next Star Wars spin-off movie appeared to be about cult favourite Boba Fett, the bounty hunter who featured in The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi, with reports that Logan director James Mangold had been hired to work on the film. The release date was expected to be in 2020. An Obi-Wan Kenobi film was reportedly put into development in 2017, with Stephen Daldry and Ewan McGregor under consideration as director and star.

Greg Hands, whose constituency lies under the flightpath, announced he would step down so he could vote against the government’s plans for a third runway in the Commons on Monday. The announcement increased the pressure on the foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, another staunch critic of Heathrow expansion, to stand by his principles and vote against the government’s plans. The prime minister confirmed on Thursday that Johnson was scheduled to be out of the country next week, allowing him to escape having to choose between resignation and rebelling against May. Labour challenged Johnson to join Hands, the MP for Chelsea and Fulham, in opposing the plan, even if it cost him his cabinet role, suggesting he was weak for choosing to travel abroad just so that he could keep his job. The proposed £14bn Heathrow expansion is almost certain to get the backing of the Commons. Conservative MPs have been told there is a three-line whip to vote in favour, while Labour has given its MPs a free vote. May joked with reporters at a press conference on Thursday that her foreign secretary would be supporting “global Britain” in a different way. “The government is absolutely committed to increasing airport capacity at Heathrow,” she said. “This is important, it is part of our future as global Britain and the ambitions we have as a trading nation for the future. And the foreign secretary, early next week, will be what I would describe as a living embodiment of global Britain. “He will be out there showing the UK’s continued presence around the world and the work that the UK continues to do around the world, with our diplomacy, working on so many of the issues and the challenges that we face across the world today.” The prime minister did not say where Johnson would be on Monday, and no further details were expected to be released for security reasons. Early suggestions that he may be attending a meeting of EU foreign ministers in Luxembourg were ruled out when it emerged that Sir Alan Duncan, Johnson’s deputy, would attend instead. Andy McDonald, the shadow transport secretary, said: “Greg Hands’s resignation piles the pressure on Boris Johnson, who promised his constituents he would ‘lie down in front of the bulldozers’ to stop a third runway. Instead he is jetting off on Monday to avoid the vote because he is too weak to stand by his promises.” In his resignation letter to May, Hands said he was stepping down “with great regret” and promised he would “continue to be loyal” to the prime minister. “I promised my constituents at the last general election that I would vote against should the matter come to parliament and I feel strongly that politicians must have credibility to ensure public confidence in our democratic system,” he said. “My reasons for opposing the third runway are well-known and well-documented.” Hands hinted he felt unable to simply leave the country and miss the vote like the foreign secretary. “I intend to keep my promise to my constituents and vote against the proposal, and with it now being a whipped vote, I must therefore resign.” In her reply to Hands, May said she understood the desire to fulfil his promise. She said the government was committed to expansion, but added: “I understand, however, that this is an issue which raises concerns for some of your constituents.” The former transport secretary Justine Greening, a fierce opponent of Heathrow expansion, said she was “very sad” that Hands had been forced to quit. “It’s totally wrong that Conservative MPs are not allowed a free vote to represent their local longstanding concerns on Heathrow pollution,” she said. “Other Conservative MPs have also voiced concerns to me about Heathrow expansion more broadly. If the secretary of state for transport was confident of his case he should allow a free vote. Because that’s not the case, the government has lost a very capable minister.” May faced a further headache after Greening wrote to MPs on Thursday to warn them that regional airports across the north of England would lose more than 28,000 international flights a year by 2030 as a direct result of the expansion plans. Doncaster would lose 25% of its international flights, Newcastle would lose 14%, Manchester and Leeds Bradford airports would each lose 11% and Liverpool would lose 7%, according to analysis of Department for Transport data. “To use taxpayers’ money to support a private company to become more like a monopoly to grow and stifle competition everywhere else in the country seems nonsensical. To have a strategy that centres on London at the direct expense of connections for the rest of the country also seems wrong,” Greening wrote. Labour MPs, especially those in northern England, have argued that the plans are crucial to connectivity from regional airports, and expansion is likely to be supported by the majority of SNP MPs for similar reasons. Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, said that he would join legal action if MPs backed a third runway. “While I believe in a better Heathrow, I do not believe a bigger Heathrow is the right answer for London and I remain committed to opposing such a short-sighted decision,” he said. “There are no plans on how to deal with the valid concerns about Heathrow expansion.” Last year, the mayor directed Transport for London to provide advice and assistance to affected borough councils including Hillingdon, Richmond, Wandsworth and Windsor and Maidenhead as they prepared for a joint legal challenge with Greenpeace against the Heathrow plan. On Wednesday, Jeremy Corbyn said he would not whip Labour MPs to vote against the national policy statement, which contains the principles for the airport expansion plans, though Labour has said it does not meet the party’s four tests on issues such as air pollution and jobs. Up to 100 Labour MPs and large trade unions are in favour of expansion but there is also likely to be significant opposition, including from Corbyn and the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell. Only a handful of Tory MPs are expected rebel, including Hands, Greening and Zac Goldsmith. May has allowed ministers a “waiver” from collective responsibility on the policy. Ministers who oppose Heathrow, such as Johnson, have been permitted to express opposition but only to local media. If the MPs approve the statement, the next stage is a public consultation and judicial review, after which the government can then give planning permission, known as a development consent order."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"money/2018/jun/21/trader-1bn-deals-voided-after-training-platform-mix-up","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-21T13:07:14Z","webTitle":"Trader's €1bn deals voided after 'demo' platform mix-up","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2018/jun/21/trader-1bn-deals-voided-after-training-platform-mix-up","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2018/jun/21/trader-1bn-deals-voided-after-training-platform-mix-up","fields":{"headline":"Trader's €1bn deals voided after 'demo' platform mix-up","bodyText":"A share trader from France who racked up a €10m (£8.8m) profit using a British brokerage’s platform he initially thought was a training system is suing the company after it seized his earnings. Harouna Traoré had opened a €20,000 account with Valbury Capital last summer after using a simulation of its trading software to practise dealing in equity futures, according to the Financial Times. While practising at home several weeks later, on what he believed to be the simulation programme, Traoré placed €1bn of orders for securities, realising he had been using a genuine platform only after racking up a €1m loss on his position. He continued trading in an effort to recoup his losses, which he eventually turned into a €10m profit after building up a position in US equity futures worth €5bn. When he called Valbury a few days later to tell them what had happened, he was told he had breached the terms of his contract with the company and that all of his positions were “void and cancelled”. Traoré is suing Valbury, owned by an Indonesian company, for the €10m profit he made after filing a writ against them in a French court as a consumer. According to the FT, the sum involved is roughly equivalent to the £9.9m revenue the company made in the last financial year. Valbury is expected to argue that he is a professional, which would prevent the case from being tried in France, where Traoré would enjoy greater protection as a consumer. Robert Falkner, a partner at Reed Smith, the law firm representing Valbury, told the FT: “We are familiar with the spurious allegations made by the French arcade trader Mr Traoré (a seasoned market risk analyst formerly employed by Reuters), which are strongly denied as wholly without merit and will be vigorously contested.” Traoré’s lawyers said he had no prior experience of financial markets and previously worked at Thomson Reuters, where he sold performance analysis software to investors, before he was made redundant in 2017. “This matter is now before the courts, so we consider it inappropriate to comment further,” Falkner said, adding that Valbury had kept the City regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority, informed. Valbury is expected to argue that Traoré claimed to be an experienced trader in his application to open an account. He is expected to admit that he embellished his credentials. Traoré lawyers said in a court filing that Valbury could have imposed stricter trading limits on him. They will also dispute Valbury’s claim that his trades were a clear error."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"world/2018/jun/21/matteo-salvini-threatens-to-remove-gomorrah-roberto-saviano-police-protection","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-21T10:42:21Z","webTitle":"Matteo Salvini threatens to remove Gomorrah author's police protection","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/21/matteo-salvini-threatens-to-remove-gomorrah-roberto-saviano-police-protection","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/21/matteo-salvini-threatens-to-remove-gomorrah-roberto-saviano-police-protection","fields":{"headline":"Matteo Salvini threatens to remove Gomorrah author's police protection","bodyText":"Matteo Salvini, Italy’s far-right interior minister, has threatened to remove the police protection of one of the country’s most famous writers, Roberto Saviano, who has been under threat from organised crime since his breakthrough success about the mafia, Gomorrah, was published in 2006. Saviano is one of Salvini’s toughest critics and is a constant fixture on Italian media. He is one of hundreds of journalists and writers who are under constant guard in Italy, because of current or previous threats to their safety by the mafia. Speaking in an interview on Rai Tre on Thursday morning, Salvini suggested it was time to review spending on Saviano’s police escort as part of an evaluation of how “Italians spend their money”. He pointed to the fact that Saviano spends time abroad, and that the seriousness of the threat against him had to be considered. “Roberto Saviano is the last of my problems. I’ll send him a kiss if he is watching now. He is a person who provokes so much tenderness and affection, but it is right to evaluate how Italians spend their money,” Salvini said. Earlier this week Saviano wrote a piece for the Guardian in which he said Italy’s war on migrants had made him fear for the future of his country. Saviano’s supporters and some leading politicians immediately criticised Salvini’s comments, saying the statement was an abuse of Salvini’s power as interior minister and threatened the country’s democratic values. Writing for the Guardian, Saviano thanked supporters for showing solidarity, but said the fight was not really about him: he was only being used as an instrument for Salvini to “destroy the rule of law”. “It would be easy for me today to fight fire with fire, but I do not want to do it. Neither do I want to turn the other cheek, I am not Christ, I am not a sacrificial lamb, I am not seeking martyrdom: forget it!,” he wrote. “But I’m not afraid of Salvini either ... he is a buffoon.” But, as with Salvini’s attack on the Roma community this week, when he called for the mass expulsion of all non-Italian Roma, some of the populist government’s supporters are likely to welcome his targeting of Saviano. Salvini’s sardonic remarks – about Saviano provoking feelings of affection – reflected the mixed feelings Italians have about the author, who is also a regular contributor to the Guardian. Saviano was heaped with praise early in his career as a writer who exposed the inner workings of the Camorra, and the fact that he required police protection – he has described his life under armed guard as “shit” – added to his mystique as a man who was willing to risk his life to fight organised crime. His hit has been followed up by a successful film, television series, and other books taking on corruption and the global drug trade. In Italy, however, his frequent commentary on television and newspaper columns, and his frequent criticism of Italian society and political corruption, has also annoyed some. In taking on Saviano, Salvini seems to be siding with those Italians who think the writer has been too critical. Salvini’s threat to remove Saviano’s protection may be seen as going too far, however. It also reinforces the breadth of Salvini’s power as interior minister. The head of the League party – or the Lega as it is known in Italy – has focused his attention on migration and the Roma community, but he also has control of Italy’s domestic security, as well as insight into police investigations and domestic surveillance. Graziano Delrio, a centre-left politician with the Democratic party (PD), said he would be willing to sacrifice his own police escort, but that Salvini ought to leave Saviano alone, according to La Repubblica. Marco Minniti, the former interior minister, told the Italian newspaper that there were strict and transparent procedures in place dictating police protection and for whom it was offered. Such decisions, the newspaper noted, were not dependent on a politician’s personal views of the subject of protection. Ettore Rosato, another PD lawmaker, said Salvini’s remarks represented an “unacceptable threat” to a man who had shed light on the country’s dangerous criminal networks. “Saviano’s escort is not a gift but the protection that the state must guarantee to those who are threatened for fighting the mafia and the Camorra,” Rosato told La Repubblica. The broadside on Saviano came as another humanitarian crisis was unfolding on the Mediterranean, where a rescue ship operated by a German NGO carrying 250 people who were rescued after a shipwreck is expected to be blocked from landing in Italy. The NGO Mission Lifeline was told to send its ship, which was allegedly operating in Libyan waters under a Dutch flag, to Holland.”Take the long route,” Salvini said. He also alleged, in a line of attack that is increasingly being used against NGOs, that rescuers had ignored Libyan coast guard orders by intervening in the rescue."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2018/jun/21/heathers-is-back-but-is-it-winona-ryders-best-film-her-top-20-ranked","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-21T12:31:04Z","webTitle":"Ranked!

Winona Ryder's 20 best films","bodyText":"20. The House of the Spirits (1993) In any career spanning three decades, there are bound to be turkeys, and Ryder has had her share. But the gloopy Autumn in New York (2000) is beaten in the too-bad-to-be-missed stakes by this laughable magical-realist clunker. Highlights include Ryder’s witless voiceover (“To me, life itself has become the most important thing”) and Meryl Streep levitating a table. 19. Simone (2001) This high-concept tale about film-maker (Al Pacino), who creates a synthetic, programmable starlet, is not as smart as it thinks. Ryder plays a leading lady prone to tantrums. 18. Mermaids (1990) The film of the No 1 single! There’s not much more to this coming-of-age comedy than The Shoop Shoop Song. Ryder was an 11th-hour replacement for Emily Lloyd as one of Cher’s daughters (Christina Ricci is the other) in a film beset with production difficulties. The credited director, Richard Benjamin, was its third after Lasse Hallström and Frank Oz. 17. How to Make an American Quilt (1995) Going straight from working with one female Australian director (Gillian Armstrong on Little Women) to another (Jocelyn Moorhouse) was a good move, even if the result second time around was less compelling. Ryder essentially spends two hours taking advice from her elders over whether to marry a DIY enthusiast. 16. Night on Earth (1991) Jim Jarmusch’s portmanteau comedy comprises five tales of taxi-cab encounters from around the globe. Unfortunately, Ryder is in the worst one. She plays the chain-smoking Corky, a cabbie who dreams of becoming a mechanic. Disagreeably wacky. 15. Great Balls of Fire! (1989) So-so Jerry Lee Lewis biopic with Ryder, 18 at the time, acquitting herself well as the 13-year-old first cousin once removed who became Lewis’s first wife. 14. Welcome Home, Roxy Carmichael (1990) Small-town drama with Ryder as an adopted girl convinced that a returning superstar is her biological mother. This is the standard early Ryder role: high-achieving outsider, dressed in black, incorrigibly odd (she oversees a menagerie housed in an upturned boat). 13. Alien: Resurrection (1997) An unfairly maligned entry in the franchise, this breakneck, Joss Whedon-scripted sequel from Jean-Pierre Jeunet (Delicatessen, Amélie) doesn’t give Ryder much to do as the android on board another doomed mission, but there is some nice rapport between her and Sigourney Weaver. 12. Bram Stoker’s Dracula (1992) Exhausted after shooting three films back-to-back, Ryder dropped out of Francis Ford Coppola’s The Godfather Part III (Sofia Coppola took her place). “Noni was fried, really fried,” said her Mermaids co-star Cher. Ryder bounced back for Coppola’s Dracula but scarcely made an impression amid the extravagant sets and barmy performances. 11. Looking for Richard (1996) Al Pacino’s lively Shakespearean documentary goes backstage as he tries to unpick Richard III with the help of assorted experts (Vanessa Redgrave, John Gielgud) and co-stars, notably Kevin Spacey, superb as Buckingham, and a very game Ryder, who makes a tender Lady Anne. 10. Reality Bites (1994) Much of this Gen X drama is cringeworthy, but Ryder emerges with dignity as the “non-practising virgin” with the “pointy little face”, whether bopping to My Sharona in the food mart or trying not to fall for Ethan Hawke. She used her clout at the time to hire co-star Ben Stiller as director. 9. The Crucible (1996) “You’ll be clapped in the stocks before you’re 20,” says John Proctor (Daniel Day-Lewis) to the impetuous Abigail (Ryder) in this high-fibre adaptation of Arthur Miller’s play. Ryder is all bulging eyes and gulping mouth, rendering the OTT camerawork entirely superfluous. 8. Girl, Interrupted (1999) There is nothing wrong with Ryder’s performance as the teenage girl holed up in a psychiatric institution – she gets to apply her repertoire of haunted, hunted facial expressions to some meaty dramatic material. But no one else in the film stands a chance next to Angelina Jolie’s Oscar-scooping turn as the rebellious Lisa, the real Jack Nicholson in this Cuckoo’s Nest. 7. Edward Scissorhands (1990) Ryder’s second film for Tim Burton and her only one with then-boyfriend Johnny Depp (he of the “Winona Forever” tattoo amended to “Wino Forever” when they split). Depp predicted in 1990 that she would be “the Lillian Gish of the next century”. She’s touching as the girl with the hots for the guy with the blades. 6. A Scanner Darkly (2006) Post-shoplifting arrest, Ryder has made some dark and interesting choices, including Richard Linklater’s brain-frazzling adaptation of Philip K Dick’s novel, rendered here in trippy rotoscope animation. She plays Donna, whose addiction to the hallucinogenic Substance D has made her averse to physical contact. 5. Beetlejuice (1988) Tim Burton’s delirious supernatural comedy has disgruntled teen Lydia (Ryder) summoning a vaudevillian bio-exorcist (Michael Keaton) from beyond the grave. Her big moment comes right at the end when she levitates up and down the stairs to Harry Belafonte’s Jump in the Line like an emo Mary Poppins. 4. Black Swan (2010) Natalie Portman won an Oscar for falling apart and sprouting swan feathers in Darren Aronofsky’s ballet freak-out, but Ryder was equally revelatory as the over-the-hill soloist who can’t accept her glory days are over. She beat Jennifer Connelly, Rachel Weisz and Parker Posey to the role. 3. Little Women (1994) An Oscar nomination came her way for playing Jo, eldest sister of the March clan, in this intelligent and underrated adaptation of Louisa May Alcott’s cherished 19th-century novel. Ryder originated the project and convinced the Australian director Gillian Armstrong (My Brilliant Career) to come aboard. The strong ensemble cast includes Claire Danes, Kirsten Dunst and Christian Bale. 2. Heathers (1988) “Fuck me gently with a chainsaw!” Arriving with a wealth of ready-made catchphrases, this acerbic black comedy found Ryder and rebel boyfriend Christian Slater killing off high-school conformists, including a coterie of mean girls all called Heather. The nastiness fizzles out eventually but until then think John-Hughes-meets-John-Waters. It’s so very. 1. The Age of Innocence (1993) To anyone who doubts that there are hidden layers to Ryder’s occasionally insipid persona, her performance in Martin Scorsese’s poised period drama is as robust a corrective as could be hoped for. She received the first of two Oscar nominations to date for playing May Welland, the delicate flower whose fiance (Daniel Day-Lewis) is smitten with her cousin (Michelle Pfeiffer). The narrator (Joanne Woodward) taunts May for her apparent vacuousness – “What if all her calm, her niceness, were just a negation, a curtain dropped in front of an emptiness?” –while Ryder reveals glimpses of clever cunning. Heathers will be rereleased on 10 August in the UK."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"music/2018/jun/21/simon-rattle-bows-out-at-berlin-with-mahler-merkel-and-standing-ovations","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-21T11:03:02Z","webTitle":"Simon Rattle bows out at Berlin with Mahler, Merkel and standing ovations","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/jun/21/simon-rattle-bows-out-at-berlin-with-mahler-merkel-and-standing-ovations","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/jun/21/simon-rattle-bows-out-at-berlin-with-mahler-merkel-and-standing-ovations","fields":{"headline":"Rattle bows out at Berlin with Mahler, Merkel and standing ovations","bodyText":"After 16 years not just at the heart of Europe but also at the head of the continent’s most prestigious symphony orchestra, Sir Simon Rattle bowed out as the chief conductor of the Berlin Philharmonic this week, in an emotional farewell concert in the German capital. The Liverpool-born conductor, who in 2002 became the first Briton ever chosen for the Berlin job, was never the traditionalists’ choice to take charge of the jewel in Germany’s musical crown. But, in his last performance in Berlin’s Philharmonie Hall before returning to the UK to take over at the helm of the London Symphony Orchestra, all that was history. Rattle received the kind of loud cheering, standing ovation and bouquets of flowers from admirers that used to be reserved for opera divas. The conductor’s final concert with the Berlin orchestra consisted of a single work, Gustav Mahler’s searing and fateful Sixth Symphony. Rattle had conducted this 80-minute work in his first engagement with the orchestra in 1987, at a time when, in his 30s, he was dragging British concert life into the modern age as chief conductor of the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra. There was no disputing the rapport between conductor and orchestra in this final performance together in their home hall. As the applause continued long into the hot Berlin night, a clearly moved Rattle made a short speech in German, addressed to “my wonderful orchestra” and “my dear Berlin public”, thanking them for their support. “Danke für alles,” he concluded. Even Germany’s politically beleaguered chancellor, Angela Merkel, a keen concertgoer, took time out from trying to keep her coalition government afloat, to attend one of the many farewell events for Rattle. During the conductor’s long stay in Berlin, Rattle seems to have won over doubters with his enthusiasm, his emphasis on modern repertoire, his involvement in educational work and his encouragement of new programming. After Rattle’s first concert in charge in 2002, the Guardian’s reviewer proudly concluded: “Our boy has well and truly arrived.” Sixteen years on, the Rattle era has not been without its ups and downs, but the 63-year-old conductor, now white-haired and balding, departs from Berlin garlanded with honours, affection and respect – not to mention regret. The political echoes are hard to miss. The Berlin Philharmonic’s house magazine contains a cartoon of a curly-haired man conducting from the stern of a ship named Britannia as it puts to sea with his orchestra on the quayside still following his baton. “Bye bye Sir Simon” says the caption. Now another ship docks. From the autumn, the Berlin Philharmonic will be led by its first Russian-born chief conductor, Kirill Petrenko, currently the music director of the Bavarian State Opera in Munich. An outstanding musician, Petrenko’s opening concert as chief conductor in September is a striking contrast to Rattle’s Berlin opener 16 years ago. Back then, Rattle began with Asyla by British composer Thomas Adès, followed by Mahler’s Fifth. In September, Petrenko opens with a more familiar programme of Beethoven and Richard Strauss. Our boy will be missed."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2018/jun/22/have-the-dutch-found-the-secret-to-happy-teenagers","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-22T11:58:40Z","webTitle":"Have the Dutch found the secret to happy teenagers?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/22/have-the-dutch-found-the-secret-to-happy-teenagers","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/22/have-the-dutch-found-the-secret-to-happy-teenagers","fields":{"headline":"Have the Dutch found the secret to happy teenagers?","bodyText":"Have we reached peak ephebiphobia? The fear of young people is everywhere, with headlines and pundits stirring up anxiety that civilised society is going to hell in a handbasket thanks to a generation of emotionally stunted, smartphone addicted, narcissistic snowflakes. And yet everywhere there are stories that restore faith, not least the eloquent and fearless students taking on the US gun lobby. So this week we present tales of teens turning the tide, and what we all can learn from them. Report after report reveals that some of the happiest young people among OECD nations are in the Netherlands, amid an uptick in depression and anxiety among teenagers in the US and UK. In Amsterdam, Senay Boztas uncovered what the Dutch are getting right. France is planning to ban mobile phones from schools from September, in response to fears that teenagers have become addicted to their screens. With similar bans being proposed around the world, Angelique Chrisafis visited a school in rural Brittany that banned the devices four years ago to see what difference the policy made – and what pupils made of it. When two successful music industry professionals set up an internship scheme at their company, only middle-class kids applied. So Nick Stillwell and David Court decided to try something different. The music school they created, Supajam, has had remarkable success with young people left behind by the education system, as Emma John discovered. Finally, Gary Younge reflected on an extraordinary year reporting on knife crime in the UK and set out how policymakers could tackle the issue - if they really want to. What we liked: This Washington Post report on the growing work opportunities for people with disabilities in the US. What we heard: Thanks for your story on Dutch teenagers. As a teacher at a Dutch secondary school, I felt you summed up nicely the reasons why Dutch kids seem so content. Personally, I’m always amazed that when they are asked during English oral exams: ‘What do you enjoy about the place where you live compared to other places?’, my students invariably talk about the sense of freedom they get from being able to go everywhere by bike and not depending on their parents to take them.

Indeed, no sooner had the European commission announced the informal meeting, to be attended by Germany, France, Italy, Greece, Spain, Malta, Bulgaria, Belgium and the Netherlands, than the recriminations began. Aimed at throwing a political lifeline to Angela Merkel in a fraught standoff between the German chancellor and her hardline interior minister, Horst Seehofer, that threatens the stability of her coalition, the measures the summit will discuss have infuriated Italy. And while Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic will not be present in Brussels on Sunday, their refusal to accept any obligatory quota or redistribution arrangements will necessarily weigh on whatever conclusions it is able to reach. The fault lines in Europe’s latest political crisis are not just national, but ideological. The commission, Merkel, the French president, Emmanuel Macron, and the new Spanish prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, continue to seek EU-wide agreement and coordinated action. Rightwingers, including Seehofer, who is demanding the right to turn back refugees and migrants arriving from other EU countries, and the Austrian chancellor, Sebastian Kurz, who has called for an “axis of the willing” to tackle illegal migration, want a radical bi- or trilateral approach. Far-right nationalists, such as Austria’s vice-chancellor, Heinz-Christian Strache, Italy’s interior minister, Matteo Salvini, who will allow no NGO-run migrant rescue ships to land, and Hungary’s Viktor Orbán, who this week pushed through laws making it a criminal offence to help asylum seekers, are prepared to go their own way. With differences so deep and the immediate practical concerns of arrival and destination states so diverse, it is hard to see significant progress being made at Sunday’s meeting, which is intended to prepare the ground for a broader debate on migration between all EU leaders at their summer summit on 28 and 29 June. Unable for the past three years to reform its Dublin regulation, which requires refugees to claim asylum in the first EU country they enter, the EU is focusing on areas where a minimum of common ground could exist, such as beefing up its external borders and cooperating more closely with countries from Turkey to Niger to stop people leaving. According to a draft joint declaration, the mini-summit will agree to spend more on building the bloc’s border and coastguard into a “genuine border police force” of 10,000 officers by 2020, and setting up controversial “protection and reception capacity” outside the EU to separate refugees seeking asylum from migrants seeking work. Participants also aim to strengthen internal controls to combat “secondary movement” of asylum seekers to other EU states, and to agree on “new joint readmission procedures” that would make it easier to send asylum seekers who cross borders back to the states where they applied. Such measures may placate the likes of Seehofer. But the German interior minister will be less enamoured of a warning that “unilateral, uncoordinated measures” – of the kind he is proposing, and Salvini has already taken – risk “severely damaging the process of European integration”. And Salvini – in principle, Seehofer’s ideological ally – has protested furiously at the very proposals most likely to find favour with the German interior minister, such as fast-track migrant returns, which he fears could turn Italy into Europe’s holding camp for irregular migrants. “If they’re thinking of sending us more migrants instead of helping us, then we shouldn’t go [to Brussels] at all,” the leader of the far-right League party said on Wednesday. Salvini continued: Macron and Sánchez “speak of goodness and generosity ... They should prove it.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2020/jun/16/how-we-made-black-box-ride-on-time","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2020-06-16T05:00:35Z","webTitle":"Black Box: how we made Ride on Time","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/jun/16/how-we-made-black-box-ride-on-time","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2020/jun/16/how-we-made-black-box-ride-on-time","fields":{"headline":"Black Box: how we made Ride on Time","bodyText":"Daniele Davoli, DJ and production I was an avid collector of disco and funk records. On my first trip to the US, I spent most of my time in secondhand vinyl shops and found Loleatta Holloway’s Love Sensation. At the time, I was playing with my Akai S900 sampler when I was DJing and searching for a cappella vocals to enrich my set. When I listened to Love Sensation, I thought: “This is good stuff.” People were using a lot of powerful vocals in their records – like The Power by Snap. My bandmate Mirko Limoni and I wanted to make the most energetic record in the world, and we were trying to collect material for that. We thought our track had potential. But when we took it to major labels, they all declined. They kept saying: “It’s obvious you’ve got talent, but this is not the style of music you should be making.” They played us Stock Aitken Waterman-style Italo Hi-NRG records: they were behind, while we wanted to embrace the future. In the end, Discomagic [then the largest disco/house/dance label in Italy] was the only one prepared to release it. They used to export a lot to Ibiza. Alfredo, who was the DJ at the Ibiza club Amnesia, bought it. Danny Rampling, Nicky Holloway and Paul Oakenfold went to Amnesia and heard the record. So Oakenfold and Rampling decided it was time to go to Rimini, which was like the Italian Ibiza, where they bought as many copies as they could to take back to England. Later, Oakenfold told me he had paid for his holiday with copies of Ride on Time he had bought in Rimini and then resold. In the meantime, the label Deconstruction called Discomagic said they really wanted to license the first track Mirko and I made together – Starlight’s Numero Uno. Discomagic said: “Unfortunately, we just licensed it to Beggars Banquet. But we’ve got something we think is even better.” Deconstruction told me they couldn’t believe their ears when they heard it. And that was Ride on Time. They knew it sampled Love Sensation and it needed clearance. They negotiated with Salsoul Records in New York and agreed $5,000, way before the release. They paid the money but someone forgot to check the signed contract got sent back. So a guy came in on a Monday and said we had to put a new a cappella on the instrumental by Wednesday. [The band got a session singer, long rumoured to be M People’s Heather Small, to re-sing Holloway’s vocal; on TV performances, model Katrin Quinol mimed to it.] I couldn’t believe my luck the first time we were on Top of the Pops. We were in the same room as Phil Collins and Eurythmics – and they were talking to us! Mirko Limoni, keyboards and production The Loleatta Holloway sample came first. Daniele played it to me and Valerio [Semplici], the third guy in Black Box. We looked at each other and said: “Wow, what’s this?” We decided to try some ways to put some music under it. The piano came quite quickly, and we played all the things together in loops of four bars or eight bars, just to understand if it could all fit together in the same record. It took a month. Our bad English was the reason it was called Ride on Time. We thought she was singing “ride on time”, but it was “right on time”. Of course it was a mistake, but the title stayed. It’s one of those mistakes that’s funny. Some people thought we were being clever. We thought we would sell a maximum of 1,000 copies for clubs. For us, that would have been like winning the London marathon. It was a big surprise when it blew up. Of course we were happy about it, but then the problems came. The same day we took the plane to England to be on Top of the Pops, we had to deal with the American lawyer threatening us. I didn’t realise, while I was living it, how big Ride on Time was. When I look back, it seems bigger than it did at the time. My best memory of it is the night we received the phone call from Deconstruction after the midweek charts to say we were going to be No 1. The record had entered the charts at 39, then went up in four or five weeks to No 1 and stayed there for six weeks. When we learned it was No 1, it was very emotional."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/jun/21/considering-not-having-children-or-decided-to-stay-child-free-share-your-experiences","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-21T14:59:42Z","webTitle":"Don't want children?

The 20-year-old Patel, an occasional bowler even for his club, took six Somerset wickets for five runs in just 11 balls with his swinging line and length. His first was Ed Byrom, who had just made a steady 50. It was to be the highest score of the innings. Rikki Clarke finished with four for 32. Somerset, following-on, were 18 for no wicket at stumps. Earlier, Ollie Pope had gone to his fourth first-class hundred in only his 12th match, dancing a jig of delight. By the time he was lbw for 117 he had overtaken his team-mate Rory Burns to become the Championship’s leading runscorer. At New Road, Lancashire took up where they left off, all out for 130, before Worcestershire knocked up 361 for four – a lead of 478 at the close. Daryl Mitchell’s 163 was his second century of the match and Martin Guptill made 111 on his Championship debut for Worcester. He had earlier hit Joe Mennie on the head with a fierce drive and the Australian was withdrawn from the game with suspected concussion to be replaced by Danny Lamb, who had been preparing for a second XI match at Old Trafford. It was the first time a concussion replacement has been used in English first-class cricket. At Chelmsford, Essex were bowled out for 206. There were four wickets each for Luke Fletcher and Matthew Carter. Nottinghamshire were 35 for one at stumps, a lead of 209. In the pink ball game at the Ageas Bowl, Hampshire closed in on Yorkshire’s 350 all out, with a an undefeated century for Jimmy Adams as they reached 245 for three. In Division Two, there were more runs at Arundel, where Sussex were bowled out for 552, with Michael Burgess out for a speedy 96. In reply Durham were 202 for four with Will Smith 90 not out. At Grace Road, Middlesex just avoided the follow-on after being bowled out for 233, with acting captain Dawid Malan unbeaten on 78. Zak Chappell took four for 65. Leicestershire lost Paul Horton before the close but lead by 194. At Tunbridge Wells, the pitch turned into a feather-bed as Kent charged to 359 for six with centuries for Sean Dickson and Joe Denly and lead Warwickshire by 431. There were four wickets for Keith Barker. It was tight at Swansea where Glamorgan squeezed another 108 runs from the last three wickets thanks largely to 72 not out from Andrew Salter. Derbyshire were 207 for three in reply, with 50s for Ben Slater and Alex Hughes. In the pink-baller at The County Ground, Gloucestershire were all out for 62, Ben Sanderson taking five for 16. They made a better fist of their second innings to ensure Northamptonshire will bat again. Division One Worcestershire 147 &amp; 361-4, Lancashire 130 Surrey 459, Somerset 180 &amp; 18-0 Essex 206, Nottinghamshire 380 &amp; 35-1 Hampshire 153-3, Yorkshire 350 (Tea, D/N match) Division Two Sussex 552, Durham 202-4 Leicestershire 427 &amp; 0-1, Middlesex 233 Kent 197 &amp; 359-6, Warwickshire 125 Glamorgan 283, Derbyshire 207-3 Northamptonshire 282, Gloucestershire 68 &amp; 155-5 (Latest, D/N match) What a day! Ollie Pope “very happy” and Ryan Patel “surreal” stand in front of the Guildford pavilion talking to the press. That’s it from me. I’ll leave you with this: Somerset survive: 18 for 0 at stumps. A long game ahead. And a little story at New Road where there has been a first ever concussion-substitute in England. Joe Mennie, who got a nasty head injury in the winter, was whacked in the head by a drive from Martin Guptill. The substitute has to be a like-for-like replacement and so Danny Lamb, who was at Old Trafford preparing for a second-team game, drove down the motorway and dashed onto the field. He will bat tomorrow. Derby trail Glamorgan by 76 with seven wicket left. Alex Hughes 67 not out. And at tea Gloucestershire 147 for 5 in their second innings, still trailing by 73. Last over here - Somerset holding on. 13/0 Jimmy Adams 76 not out against Yorkshire in the pink ball game. Smith 99 not out at the close at Arundel. Middlesex teetering at Grace Road but have just avoided the follow-on. Kent now have a lead of 429 at Tunbridge Wells. While I wasn’t looking Essex were all out for 206, four wickets each for Fletcher and Carter. Notts 35 for 1 in reply - a lead of 209 Patel doesn’t get the new ball: Morkel and Dernbach. Patel’s 6 for 5 is the best spell at Guildford since 2003. So Renshaw and Byrom head off to go again. Will Patel take the new ball? Meanwhile Higgins and Roderick battling bravely in Gloucestershire’s second innings - partnership of 68, though they still need 80 to avoid an innings defeat. Surrey’s players having a little pep talk outside the shiny new pavilion: seems they’ll enforce the follow-on. Ryan Patel, who looked terribly bashful leading the Surrey players off the field with a little waft of his cap, sips from a bottle of water. Here’s Ryan Patel’s wicket flurry. Hang on - that’s his sixth! Leach lbw for 0. Patel 6 for 5 in 3.5 overs !!!!!! Surrey lead by 279. Morkel 12 overs 0 for 39. Funny old game. And Jack Leach gets clonked on the head by Morne Morkel, a bit of plastic flies off his helmet near his ear. He’s ok though, and he is brought a new helmet out. Interesting come-back match.. Here’s the deamon bowler: Prior to today, 20 year old Ryan Patel had taken only two Championship wickets in his 8 games. ...Leach survived, but Somerset are in deep trouble -174 for 9 still trailing by 285. Young Patel doesn’t even bowl regularly for his club side. BLimey, I was trying to put a picture up and whilst I failed to do that wickets have been tumbling, tumbling, tumbling at Guildford. Four wickets for four runs in 9 balls. Davies lbw to Patel, then Josh Davey, caught at second slip also off Patel. And another! Groenewald lbw Patel who now has five wickets for four runs in 11 balls. On a hat-trick... Somerset stoop to stutter: Gregory c Borthwick for 4. 173 for 6 in what could be the Championship decider. Patel took two wickets in that over. Bess, walking out, has much to do. And Worcestershire bat on... and on.... and on... 318 for 1, lead 435. Mitchell 150 in just 199 balls. Byrom out lbw to Ryan Patel, not playing a shot, for 52, just short of his highest first-class score for Somerset in the Championship. He looks down at the ground all the way as he walks off - must have been dreaming of a hundred. Keep dreaming, kid, it will come. Jacks at short leg, is whacked on the helmet by Byrom. He seems ok, but the players take the opportunity to sup drinks on yet another gorgeous afternoon. And he’s got the helmet on again, and play continues. Gloucester, Gloucester: 72 for 5. Van Buuren gets his second duck of the day. Brett Hutton 4 for 7. Sorry about the delay, quick roundup: Gloucestershire wobbly at 69 for 3. And Denly made his hundred I see. Well played! 107 not out. Will Smith 68 not out on the red carpet at Arundel; a good second-fiddle by his captain, Collingwood, 34 not out. And no repeat glories for Vince against Yorkshire: out for 35. Essex have collapsed to 187 for 9. Bopara bowled for 69. Here at Guildford, four days after his 21st birthday, Eddie Byrom gets the second fifty of his career with a single into the off side. Slow like, 134 balls, but hey, they all count. Stirling out for 52, Middlesex 147 for 4. Malan still there, 45 not out. Dickson out for a masterful 133: Kent 261 for 3, lead Warwicks by 333. Denly 95 not out - what a game for him. And Abell walks off at Guildford, caught Pope for 26 - Clarke’s fourth! Somerset stumbling now 117 for four. The wickets just don’t stop tumbling. Essex now 130 for 7, Coles lbw for 4 to Fletcher, again. Bopara still there, 55 not out. Gloucester, dear god, now 42 for 2, still need 178 to avoid an innings defeat. Cover drive... Just looked at the Gloucester scorecard - top score 14. Northants didn’t even give them any extras. Anyway, Tea-time scores: Division One Surrey v Somerset, Guildford.

Gloucestershire 62 all out (Sanderson 5-16, Crook 3-11) and 23 for 1. Somerset 105 for 3 at tea-time. Surrey’s session. Tea scores to follow. Bopara’s made a tasty fifty as Essex crumble about him: 125 for 5. Three wickets for the hardworking Luke Fletcher Howell is caught behind off Kleinveldt to end the session: 23 for 1 following on. Just the 10 Gloucester wickets to fall in the session then. And Daryll Mitchell moves to his second century of the match! Well played that man. It’s the fourth time Mitchell has scored two hundreds in an innings for Worcs, equalling the number achieved by Graeme Hick. Gloucestershire making a better stab of their second innings: 22 for 0. And a hundred for Dickson rubbing it in against Warwickshire. He and Denly have now put on 166. And Lancashire take a wicket: Guptill out for 111. Yorkshire have an early wicket against Hampshire , Adams for 16. Which brings in Vince, in princely-form. And Martin Guptill moves to his maiden hundred for Worcestershire. Worcs 203 without loss and a tasty lead building over Lancs. Seven of the top 12 batsman in Division One (by average) are playing at Guildford. Somerset on the skids now: 63 for 3. Hildrith squared up, trying to leg glance and caught at cover point off Rikki Clarke, against his very favourite team (best bowling and best batting performances have come against Somerset) Gloucestershire 62 all out! And 0 for 0 following on... At the Ageas, Yorkshire all out for 350, which was a fine waggle from 21 for 3. Steyn 5 for 66. And at Tunbridge Wells the 20-wicket wormhole of yesterday has disappeared and Kent are now 178 for 2 with Dickson nearing a century and Denly on his second fifty of the match. Cripes, Worcestershire are whizzing along at New Road. Mitchell and Guptill both scoring at just about a run-a-ball. And another wicket here at Guildford: Bartlett lbw to one that kept a bit low from Clarke for a duck. 57 for 2. A WICKET at Guildford! Unfortunately for Somerset it was Renshaw for 39 - a smart catch by de Bruyn off Rikki Clarke. Virdi has already bowled a couple of overs, before the ball is anywhere near old. Durham lose a second wicket against Sussex, Steel c Archer b Briggs for 20: 43 for 2. Gloucestershire staring into the abyss at 43 for 7; Sanderson 5-16. Middlesex lose a wicket, Holden lbw for 16 against Abbas. 30 for 1 in reply to Leicestershire’s 427. Hmmm, a long road to travel. GLoucestershire 42 for 6 now. Essex 35 for THREE! in reply to Nottinghamshire’s 380. Cook not out 22. Yorkshire lose an early wicket, 334 for 9, Steyn 5 for 64. The Worcestershire lead over Lancashire moves to 230, with fifties for Mitchell and Guptill. And Kent’s lead over Warwickshire passes 200, Dickson 71 not out. Here’s that wristy Renshaw boundary: Surrey have had a couple of half chances pass by - Byron to Borthwick at slip and Renshaw possibly just dropped by Davies off Dernbach. He now dispatches him for a wristy boundary. Surrey 30 for 0. And Somerset have seen off Morkel, replaced by Rikki Clarke. Here’s a stat for you: Clarke has more wickets against Somerset in the 21st century than any other bowler in the country. Yikes, Gloucestershire. Make that 32 for 6, Higgins the latest to go for 3. Sanderson 4-14. Gloucestershire now 28 for 5 against the pink ball!!! Three ducks so far... Post-lunch wickets at The County Ground where Gloucestershire have already lost two, no THREE wickets against the pink ball (26 for 4) and at Chelmsford where acting captain Westley is lbw for 8. Essex 19 for 2. And this might make a good post-prandial read Just rubbed my hands on the outfield in the lunch break, it is as spiky and rough as it looks. Morkel back from the beer-tent end. Such a privilege to see him start his menacing run on a little outground in Surrey. I wonder if Sylvester Clarke ever ran in here in the 80s? I feel like I saw him one long afternoon in the school holidays but that might be my imagination .. Division One Surrey v Somerset, Guildford. Surrey 459 all out (Pope 117; Groenewald 4-85). Somerset 8-0. Worcestershire v Lancashire, New Road. Worcestershire 247 and 57 for 0. Lancashire 130 all out (Jennings 55; Barnard 5-34) Essex v Nottinghamshire, Chelmsford.

Northamptonshire v Gloucestershire, The County Ground.Day/night: play to start at 1.30pm Northants 282 all out. Gloucestershire 25 for 1. Somerset survive the mini 3-over pre-lunch session here at Guildford: 8 for 0. Morkel, who stints on nothing in his run-up, a rapid high-legged approach with his willow-like arm whirring high above his head, is hit four four by Renshaw . But he is fast. The Somerset batsmen will be lunching nervously. Lunch scores to follow. And another what-could-have-been at Grace Road, Leicestershire all out for 427, Ackermann 196 not out. And all out at Guildford: Surrey 459. Groenewald 4-85, Bess 1-50, Leach 4 overs for 19. Darn it, poor Michael Burgess out for 96 at Arundel, Sussex 552 for 9 Surrey now 447 for 9. Dernbach just caught at first slip by Leach for a duck, and Morkel bowled middle stump after a quick-fire 20. Both wickets to Groenewald who now has 4 for 84. Bess just dispatched by Clarke for six. Kent are 60 for 2 in their second innings at Tunbridge Wells with a couple of wickets to Keith Barker, who sounds like a second world war Sergeant. Sean Dickson not out 32. And wonderful stuff from Glamorgan, now 269 for 9 . Salter 61 not out. Down in division 2, Leicestershire have been quietly piling on the runs:413 for 9 with Ackermann a heroic 185 not out. Hold on there Mohammad Abbas! And without scoring another run Lancashire are all out for 130 at New Road Barnard finishes with 5 for 34. Notts’s first-innings nearly over too: 362 for 9. Eighty-seven not out for Michael Burgess at Arundel as Sussex pile on the agony against Durham: 525 for 8. Jennings gone at New Road, lbw for 55, but Mennie and Bailey digging in to produce something with the waft of respectability from a dungheap. 130 for 8. Pope out for 117, lbw Groenewald. Well played. Surrey now 411 for 7. At Arundel, a ball after the 500 comes up, Jofra Archer gets a leading edge attempting to hit the ball out of the ground and is caught for 17. At Chelmsford, Notts claim a fourth batting point with five balls to spare. Pope overtakes Rory Burns as leading Championship run-scorer with four to move onto 99. And with a pull off Gregory he reaches his hundred, dances a little jig of delight and removes his helmet. His fourth first-class hundred in only his 12th match. Bravo! A superstar in the making. Sorry missed the seventh Lancashire wicket to fall, Clark for another duck. Barnard now has 5 for 25, the third five-wicket haul of his career. (all of them this season.) Keaton Jennings following where Trott led yesterday, 53 not out. And at New Road, Lancashire lose another - Dane Vilas lbw for 3 not offering a shot to Magoffin. Two wickets in two balls for Chris Rushworth down at Arundel. First Ben Brown then David Wiese. Here is Tom Haines talking about his hundred yesterday - plus you can see some of gorgeous Arundel in the background. Moores goes early at Chelmsford, a second wicket for Porter. Notts 320 for 7. Make that more than a gentle wind, a steady-to-brisk breeze that is buffeting the awnings A WICKET second ball of the day. Jacks caught at third slip by Gregory off Davey. Surrey 352 for 6. A gentle wind blowing across Woodbridge Road as the players walk out. Umpire Nick Cook popped into the press tent to say what a lovely spirit the game has been played in. He also said that the bowlers had to be very careful to bowl on the right length and he was looking forward to seeing Morne Morkel bowling later. Hello! And welcome on longest day to the second day of this Championship round. There is something poignant about the passing of high summer, so let’s head quickly to the cricket. Huge congratulations to the young pair of Philip Salt and Tom Haines, who both scored maiden Championship centuries yesterday at Arundel where Sussex are firmly on top. Surrey too were in the runs, with three of their young guns passing fifty here at Guildford– and Ollie Pope, who passed 500 runs for the season yesterday, starting this morning not out on 73. His dad is here , “delayed” on the way to work. Hopefully we’ll see a bit more of Jack Leach bowling today too. We’ll pass over Lancashire’s early evening histrionics, to save the blood-pressure of some readers of this blog. Worcestershire, however, are on top. Yorkshire finished strongly in the pink-ball game at the Ageas with Tim Bresnan not out on 33 following in the shining example of Gary Ballance and Harry Brook. Ross Taylor’s century, and a fifty from Chris Nash, put Nottingham in a good position at Chelmsford; similarly 151 not out from Colin Ackermann at Grace Road put Leicester in a strong position, where there was a fiver-fer for Tim Murtagh. After the 20-wicket drama of yesterday, the gentil folk of Tunbridge Wells deserve a day of calm batting: Kent were 4-0 in their second innings at the close yesterday. Rain delayed proceedings yesterday at Swansea, but not before Glamorgan collapsed and then recovered thanks clever shepherding from Chris Cooke. And finally, honours start even at The County Ground where Northants scored a quick-fired 282 against the pink ball. Gloucestershire lost one early wicket and start on 25 for 1."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"society/2018/jun/22/part-privatisation-of-probation-sector-is-a-mess-mps-say","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-21T23:01:11Z","webTitle":"Part-privatisation of probation sector 'is a mess', MPs say","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jun/22/part-privatisation-of-probation-sector-is-a-mess-mps-say","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/jun/22/part-privatisation-of-probation-sector-is-a-mess-mps-say","fields":{"headline":"Part-privatisation of probation sector 'is a mess', MPs say","bodyText":"The part-privatisation of the probation sector spearheaded by Chris Grayling during his time as justice secretary is a “mess” and may never work, MPs have warned in a damning report that heavily criticises the reforms. Four years after Grayling put his “transforming rehabilitation” plan into action, a report by the justice committee, led by the Conservative MP Robert Neill, said it was unconvinced the changes would deliver an effective or viable service for managing offenders in the community. Disappointing reductions in reoffending, complicated delivery of services, a failure to open up the probation services to charities and volunteer organisations, low morale among staff and remote contact between probation workers are among some of the key criticisms levelled by the committee. The committee has recommended the Ministry of Justice review the future of the entire probation sector and consider fresh alternatives to Grayling’s reforms. The probation sector in England and Wales was overhauled in 2014 by Grayling, who broke up existing probation trusts and replaced them with a public sector service dealing with high-risk offenders and 21 privately run companies that manage low-to-medium risk offenders. He introduced a “payment by results” system based on reducing rates of reoffending and a “through the gate service (designed to help prisoners resettle in their communities)” for all offenders, regardless of length of sentence. The critical report comes at the end of a week in which Grayling faced a no-confidence motion in parliament over his ability to carry out his current role as transport secretary, following the rail timetable fiasco. MPs narrowly backed him in a vote on the motion, although few of his fellow Tories rallied to his defence. Neill said: “The transforming rehabilitation reforms had some laudable aims but these reforms have failed to meet them. We are unconvinced that transforming rehabilitation will ever deliver the kind of probation service we need. “There are major questions to be answered on a whole range of issues, including the support people get when they leave custody, the performance of probation providers, contracts with CRCs [privately-run community rehabilitation companies], poor staff morale and the involvement of the voluntary sector. “This has a negative impact on the number of individuals who go on to reoffend. Hard working and dedicated staff are doing their best with a probation system that is currently a mess.” The criticism from the justice committee echoes that from the chief inspector of probation, Dame Glenys Stacey, who in December revealed Grayling’s reforms had led to tens of thousands of offenders – up to 40% of the total – being supervised by telephone calls every six weeks instead of face-to-face meetings. Stacey warned the changes had created a “two-tier and fragmented” probation system with most private rehabilitation companies struggling to deliver. Richard Burgon, shadow justice secretary, said: “This is yet more evidence of the widespread damage that the Conservatives’ part-privatisation has caused to our probation system. “This damning report should be a wake-up call for the Conservatives to finally accept that its ideologically driven reforms have failed. “Labour is committed to returning this essential service back-in house where it can focus on reducing reoffending rather than making profits for private companies.” The justice committee has recommended a review into the long-term future and sustainability of delivering probation services under the models introduced by Grayling including comparing to fresh alternatives. The prisons and probation minister Rory Stewart said: “This was a significant programme of reform. For instance, an additional 40,000 people who would not previously have been monitored now receive support and supervision upon release. Fewer people are reoffending and there have been some innovative and impressive programs. “However, we accept that there have been challenges and it is clear that CRC services do need to improve. We are currently in commercial discussions with providers and will consider all possible options to ensure we deliver this improvement.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/jun/23/liberal-party-feminist-kelly-odwyer-sexual-harassment-is-an-economic-issue","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-22T22:11:28Z","webTitle":"Liberal party feminist Kelly O’Dwyer: sexual harassment is an economic issue","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/jun/23/liberal-party-feminist-kelly-odwyer-sexual-harassment-is-an-economic-issue","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/jun/23/liberal-party-feminist-kelly-odwyer-sexual-harassment-is-an-economic-issue","fields":{"headline":"Liberal party feminist Kelly O’Dwyer: sexual harassment is an economic issue","bodyText":"For Kelly O’Dwyer, federal minister for women, and one of only a handful of women in the Liberal party of 2018 proud to call themselves a feminist in public, the conditioning began with her mother. “My mother said to me when I was a very young girl – always be financially independent,” O’Dwyer tells Guardian Australia in an interview this week. “If you are financially independent you will be able to have choices in your life.” “That is the message I want to take to Australian women. I think building economic security ... actually gives women options and choices, and I want people to live the best life they can live, and make choices and have opportunities open to them.” As well as looking outwards at the community, empowering women also means shifting the culture and enlarging opportunity in the world O’Dwyer now inhabits – the masculine domain of politics. O’Dwyer had her two children while resolutely occupying her cabinet portfolio, determined to show colleagues and the public that the world would not end as a consequence of juggling work at the highest levels of a government and family responsibilities. She has skipped through the minefield on her own side of politics about affirmative action. Given the Liberal party won’t do what obviously needs to be done to mend its gender imbalance – implement quotas – O’Dwyer has embarked on her own program of practical action. O’Dwyer has contributed $50,000 to a new fighting fund named in honour of Enid Lyons – the first woman elected to the House of Representatives and the first woman to serve in federal cabinet – to get more Liberal women elected to parliament, and keep them there, and has challenged her cabinet colleagues to chip in. O’Dwyer is also about to launch new regular networking sessions in Parliament House for her female parliamentary colleagues, and the women who power the backrooms of the Liberal party. Malcolm Turnbull will kick off the first event. You wouldn’t think meeting other women would require any sort of structured session, but O’Dwyer says when women arrive in Canberra for the frantic parliamentary sitting weeks, they are so flat out, mixing doesn’t happen organically. “There are a lot of women who come to Canberra and do their job and don’t get a chance to get to know a lot of other people. We wanted to create an environment that would be welcoming.” She also wanted to do something more inclusive for female staff working for all political parties in parliament house, not just Liberal women, so she has pursued a new course to add to the existing professional development opportunities political staffers can access during their tours of duty. The workshop, Leadership for Women, is being run in all state capital cities, kicking off in early July. She wants the course to zero in on “how women can actually reach those leadership positions” in political offices, getting women to focus on strategic planning for career progression and developing the skills for effective mentoring, coaching and leading others. This week, O’Dwyer, along with the sex discrimination commissioner Kate Jenkins, kicked off a national inquiry into sexual harassment in Australian workplaces. Some of O’Dwyer’s colleagues have suggested to me that some eyebrows were raised internally about the foray, but she evidently prevailed, committing $500,000 to ensure the Australian Human Rights Commission can provide comprehensive data about the problem. Survey data suggests the incidences of workplace sexual harassment is increasing. O’Dwyer wants to know why, and she wants a framework for considering what can be done to counter the problem. “I think a lot of people have discussed sexual harassment as a ‘be nice to women’ issue,” she says. “I think it needs to be reframed as an economic issue, because sexual harassment not only has very significant personal consequences for the individuals concerned but it also has financial consequences. “It means a woman might be denied hours of work, might be sacked, might be forced to look for another job because it is unbearable in the workplace, might not be able to get a reference from her former employer because she’s been harassed by them or because she’s made a complaint within the organisation. “It can have very significant personal and economic impacts for that individual and obviously goes to their financial security, and it also has impacts on the business, there’s absenteeism, there might be compensation claims ... I wanted with this inquiry to have some practical solutions. “We can all admire the problem or we can focus on what some of the solutions are. I look forward to understanding this issue better.” While openly acknowledging the new inquiry is in response to the shocking revelations associated with the #MeToo movement, O’Dwyer won’t answer whether she has been sexually harassed during her periods in politics or in the private sector. “I want people focused on the issue. I don’t want to be a distraction to the core of the issue which is sexual harassment. I want to focus on the policy question. I don’t want this to be about me.” Looming later in the year is a women’s security statement, another initiative she has spent some time working up. Given her treasury and financial services portfolios, and her own professional background as a lawyer and a banker, she’s focused on improving financial literacy for women. She says surveys suggest women do not feel confident, and if women are to safeguard their own futures, this has to change. “Whether we like it or not, from the moment we enter this world until the moment we leave it, we are engaging with the financial system. At every point I want women to be empowered to make the best possible choices for themselves.” She says a standalone not-for-profit she unveiled in the May budget with a focus on improving financial capability has now got a budget of $65m. “I want this to be for financial literacy and capability what Beyond Blue has been for mental health. “It is going to live beyond governments and its going to have a very clear mandate. It’s going to be very important. It’s not going to solve all the issues with women’s financial literacy but its just one example that will help. Given the murder of the young Melbourne women Eurydice Dixon, and the public outpouring after her death, O’Dwyer shared a few thoughts about the furious debate about victim-blaming that followed comments by a senior police officer on the day Dixon’s body was found – and before an arrest was made – that people needed to “take responsibility for ... safety”. “This crime is so horrific. All of us can relate to walking home in the dark, I think most women have done that at one stage or another,” O’Dwyer says. “It was just a senseless violent crime committed by a violent man. “There is no one to blame apart from the man who perpetrated this crime. I want to be absolutely clear about that.” But she says she understood why police felt compelled to give the public warnings about situational awareness. “We tell our kids to look before they cross the road. We don’t let them just step out. “Now that’s not to blame victims. I am not saying that. But it has to be common sense. I’m always very conscious that if I’m getting into my car late at night I have my keys ready if I’m in a deserted carpark. That’s not to say I’m responsible if I don’t have my keys ready, but I’m aware. “I can understand why a lot of women got angry at the police comments. I do understand that anger is genuine and heartfelt, but I don’t think there was a bad motivation.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/jun/22/people-are-smiling-again-opposition-finds-its-voice-before-turkish-elections","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-22T04:00:18Z","webTitle":"'People are smiling again': opposition finds its voice before Turkish elections","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/22/people-are-smiling-again-opposition-finds-its-voice-before-turkish-elections","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/22/people-are-smiling-again-opposition-finds-its-voice-before-turkish-elections","fields":{"headline":"'People are smiling again': opposition finds its voice before Turkish elections","bodyText":"There are two views of Istanbul from the office of Murat Sabuncu, the editor-in-chief of Cumhuriyet, Turkey’s oldest independent newspaper and the last still publishing. The windows on one side look on to an old cemetery. Those on the other side face the courthouse. It is an apt metaphor for the newspaper, threatened with closure for daring to criticise the president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, and its editor, sentenced to seven and a half years in prison for doing his job. Turkey is the world’s biggest jailer of journalists, ahead of China and Egypt. Seventy-three were imprisoned in 2017 alone and more than 120 have been jailed since a failed coup attempt in 2016. Hundreds have lost their jobs in the aftermath of the coup, while allies of the government have bought up most of the country’s news outlets to transform the vast majority of the media into a loyalist press. “We are trying to be a newspaper that speaks the words of those who cannot speak and show the things that cannot be shown,” Sabuncu said. Cumhuriyet journalists were detained in October 2016 as part of a sweeping crackdown by the government on dissidents. Twelve were arrested in dawn raids, and the chairman of the newspaper’s board, Akın Atalay, returned from a trip to Germany to turn himself in, all accused of aiding terrorist groups. They were held for nine months without an indictment, until their trial began in July last year. The court ended up convicting 13 staff, most of whom are currently free pending appeals. An appeal hearing in Sabuncu’s case is scheduled for July. Another court case could lead to government-appointed trustees assuming control of Cumhuriyet. Turkey is days away from arguably the most important elections in its modern history. The winner of the presidential race will assume extraordinary powers that were narrowly approved in a referendum last year. Erdoğan is favoured to win. Conditions in the country hardly allow for a fair contest. The polls will take place under a state of emergency imposed almost two years ago after the failed coup. Since then tens of thousands of people have been arrested or dismissed from their jobs in the media, judiciary, police, army and bureaucracy, often with little prospect for appeal. Presidential candidates have repeatedly criticised that state media for giving much more airtime to the incumbent than his rivals. “Erdoğan didn’t buy the journalists,” said Aydın Engin, a veteran Cumhuriyet columnist who was also briefly imprisoned. “He bought out the media. The media is acting like an organ of [Erdoğan’s political party] the AKP.” A report in April by the rights watchdog Amnesty, whose Turkey chair, Taner Kılıç, has been in jail for more than a year, described a “suffocating climate of fear” in the country. It said the government had deliberately and methodically set about dismantling civil society and had nearly destroyed Turkey’s legal system in its pursuit of dissidents. But despite the perpetual state of crisis, Turkish voters have turned out in droves to opposition rallies, energising a contest whose outcome two months ago seemed to be pre-ordained. Unexpectedly dynamic campaigns by Muharrem İnce, the main challenger, and the breakaway nationalist Meral Akşener have revitalised a moribund opposition movement that has lost election after election. Selahattin Demirtaş, the charismatic Kurdish leader of the People’s Democratic party (HDP), has run his campaign from a jail cell in Edirne, communicating to supporters through his lawyers. AKP fears that it could lose control of parliament while retaining the presidency have pushed the government into promises of compromises, such as ending the state of emergency after the polls. But for many opposition activists, whether Erdoğan and his party win or not, what matters is they have once again found their voices. “I believe the people and the journalists and democrats are going to change something rather than the politicians,” said Sabuncu. “I always thought smiling is a revolutionary act. I noticed that in the last 15 or 20 days, people started smiling again.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/jun/21/japanese-worker-punished-for-starting-lunch-three-minutes-early","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-21T07:51:06Z","webTitle":"Japanese worker punished for starting lunch three minutes early","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/21/japanese-worker-punished-for-starting-lunch-three-minutes-early","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/21/japanese-worker-punished-for-starting-lunch-three-minutes-early","fields":{"headline":"Japanese worker punished for starting lunch three minutes early","bodyText":"Japan’s commitment to addressing its dismal record on work-life balance has been called into question after a civil servant was punished for “habitually” slipping away from his desk a few minutes early to buy a bento lunch. The 64-year-old, an employee of the waterworks bureau in the western city of Kobe, was fined and reprimanded after he was found to have left his desk just three minutes before the start of his designated lunch break on 26 occasions over a seven-month period. Senior officials at the bureau then called a televised news conference, where they described the man’s conduct as “deeply regrettable” and bowed in apology. A spokesman for the bureau told AFP: “The lunch break is from noon to 1pm. He left his desk before the break.” The worker had violated a public service law requiring officials to “concentrate on their jobs”, according to the bureau. Local media reported the incident soon after MPs passed a law intended to address Japan’s punishingly long working hours. Last month, the lower house passed a bill that caps overtime at 100 hours a month in response to a rise in the number of employees dying from karoshi, or death from overwork. The government was forced to act following a public outcry over the death of Matsuri Takahashi, a 24-year-old employee of the advertising giant Dentsu, who killed herself in 2015 after being forced to work more than 100 hours overtime a month, including at weekends. Takahashi’s case triggered calls to address a workplace culture that often forces employees to put in long hours to demonstrate their dedication. In its first white paper on karoshi in 2016, the government said one in five employees were at risk of death from overwork. Social media users leaped to the Kobe official’s defence, with one Twitter user pointing out that, on average, he had left his desk early just once a week. Others wondered if the rule would be applied to people who leave their desks to smoke or go to the toilet. Another said: “What about all the politicians who sleep in parliament? They ought to be fired, then.” The official’s illicit bento expeditions were uncovered after a senior colleague looked out of his office window and spotted him walking to a nearby restaurant that sells takeaway food at lunchtime. Senior management calculated how much time he had spent away from his desk and docked him half a day’s pay, according to Sora News 24. The employee, who has not been named, reportedly said that he had left the office early to buy lunch because he needed a “change of pace”. Kobe city recently suspended another official for a month for a similar misdemeanour, saying he had been absent for more than 55 hours over a six-month period.

The Health Care Complaints Commission (HCCC) also confirmed the investigation would examine management at the Manning Rural Referral hospital in Taree where Gayed worked, including whether staff working with him failed to report errors or concerns. “The commission has received a complaint from the Hunter New England Local Health District in relation to potential patients of concern arising from the treatment provided by Dr Gayed,” a spokesman said. “The commission has determined that the complaint will be investigated and this investigation is commencing. If an investigation also identifies other persons or practitioners with potential knowledge, information or involvement, the commission has powers to receive information from them, and other practitioners can also be formally added to the investigation.” Earlier in June Gayed was banned from practising medicine for three years after the HCCC accused him of professional misconduct in relation to seven patients. The new investigation follows revelations by Guardian Australia that dozens of women in and around Taree had suffered because of treatment they received by Gayed. A medical lawyer in Sydney with Carroll &amp; O’Dea, Bill Madden, said since Guardian Australia’s reports several women had approached his firm with complaints about Gayed, and that lawyers would be travelling to Taree next week to speak with them. One of the dozens of women affected by Gayed told Guardian Australia that he needlessly removed her ovaries while performing a hysterectomy on her on 18 July 2013. The woman, who can only be identified as Kelly, told Gayed she wanted to keep her fallopian tubes because she was recently married and she and her husband wanted to try to have children using a surrogate. She was 35 when Gayed performed the hysterectomy, and said she found it odd that he did not come to her bed afterwards to debrief her on the operation. “I was lying in the hospital bed feeling really really hot and sick, my hair was falling out and I was a mess,” she said. “I kept ringing Dr Gayed and he wouldn’t answer his phone. Then I got to use the nurse’s station phone and he answered. I asked him when he was coming to see me and he said he would send his other staff to come and see me, and asked what the problem was. I told him I felt hot, and I didn’t feel like me. He kept saying he really couldn’t come and see me.” A nurse later came into her room and asked her if she was OK. “She came and sat beside me and said, ‘Kelly, you don’t have your ovaries, you’re going through early menopause’,” she said. “I said to her, ‘no I’m not,’ and she said ‘yes, you are’.” “That’s when I realised … He’d taken my ovaries.” When her husband came to visit her, Kelly said she didn’t want to see him. “When we got married he said he wanted to have my babies,” she said. “I couldn’t break the news to him. I felt I’d let him down.” Four days after her surgery, Kelly was discharged from the hospital although she was still feeling severely unwell. She keeps a meticulous diary, and in it has notes of all of her hospital stays and appointments with Gayed. Her diary entry from the day she left hospital reads: “I feel really sick and hot. I have spoken to the nurse about me not feeling well. I was told I had to go home but they need my bed.” The next day she went to see Gayed in his private rooms to tell him she was not feeling well and was vomiting so much she had to bring a bucket with her to the appointment. “He told me I needed to go home and have a good fart and a shit,” Kelly said. By Thursday morning she was so unwell she was scared to be left alone by her husband. Her husband needed to run some errands and dropped Kelly off at her parents house so they could look after her while he was gone. “My husband never made it back to pick me up again,” Kelly said. “I became more unwell at my parents house and was taken by hospital to an ambulance. I couldn’t keep anything down and I smelt really, really bad.” At the hospital Kelly said as nurses took the bandage off her hysterectomy surgery wound, it “exploded”. “It started seeping out everywhere,” she said. She had developed a serious infection. Her diary entries reveal her fear, and that she was in severe pain. On 26 July Kelly wrote: “I feel really sick, the nurses are coming in and out all the time … I am in so much pain and just want to cry.” On 29 July she wrote; “I still feel like I’m dying. I have not seen Dr Gayed since I came back in here. I keep asking the nurses where he is.” On 31 July Kelly was visited by a surgeon who she described as a “guardian angel”. He told her he was taking her to theatre to clean out the infection and promised not to leave her side until she had been operated on. Kelly told him she did not want Gayed anywhere near her. After being released from hospital the next month, in August, Kelly had to travel back to the clinic every day for more than four months to have her wound cleaned. She had to wear a vacuum dressing the entire time. She was also put on antidepressants and sleeping pills as she struggled to cope with losing her ovaries and knowing she would not be able to use her eggs and find a surrogate to carry her children. She still struggles with the trauma. In August 2013, she had a follow-up appointment with Gayed in relation to her hysterectomy. Kelly said she didn’t want to go but knew it might be her only chance for her and her husband to get their questions answered. “I asked him ‘why did you take my ovaries out?’. He said he took them just in case I got cancer. The lab results found there was no cancer in my ovaries. There was nothing wrong with them. Gayed said now they were gone at least I wouldn’t be coming back to him in five to seven years with cancer.” She said Gayed told her he had been a doctor for many years and he knew what he was doing. “I said ‘I think you fucked up my hysterectomy and you know it’. He then asked me to leave. There were people in the waiting room as I left and I said to them ‘I wouldn’t see him, he’s a hacker,’ and then his secretary told me to leave too.” Kelly contacted a law firm in the town to see if she could take action against Gayed but was told they could not help her. “I was told, ‘We can’t touch him, he has been working here for over 10 years’. I was going through so much and I just thought there was no point pursuing it further. I thought I was the only one.” She said she was horrified and shocked to learn recently that so many other women had been affected by Gayed. “I don’t want money, because that won’t bring my ability to have children back,” she said. “ I want him to never practise again and for people to know what he did.” Do you know more? contact melissa.davey@theguardian.com"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/jun/21/john-lloyd-public-service-chief-investigated-for-code-of-conduct-breach","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-21T08:45:31Z","webTitle":"John Lloyd, public service chief, investigated for code of conduct breach","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/jun/21/john-lloyd-public-service-chief-investigated-for-code-of-conduct-breach","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/jun/21/john-lloyd-public-service-chief-investigated-for-code-of-conduct-breach","fields":{"headline":"John Lloyd, public service chief, investigated for code of conduct breach","bodyText":"The outgoing public service commissioner John Lloyd is being investigated for an alleged breach of the public service code of conduct, in what Labor has called an “unprecedented” move. Labor has targeted Lloyd in Senate estimates sessions over allegations of favouritism to the right-wing thinktank the Institute of Public Affairs, of which he is a longtime member and former director. At a supplementary session on Thursday, the finance and public administration committee chair, James Paterson, tabled letters showing that the acting merit protection commissioner, Mark Davidson, had announced he intended to conduct an inquiry into Lloyd’s conduct. The 14 June letter from Davidson said he would investigate an “allegation of a breach of the Australian public service code of conduct”. Sign up to receive the top stories in Australia every day at noon Asked why he is being investigated, Lloyd told the committee he would take the question on notice and said he did not want to prejudice the investigation but did not claim public interest immunity. In June Lloyd announced his retirement effective 8 August but said the decision was not influenced by “recent events”. He told the committee he resigned after consulting his family after a long working life and denied any government member had sought or canvassed his resignation. Davidson told the committee there was “no power to continue the inquiry” after Lloyd ceases to be commissioner on 8 August. Lloyd rejected a suggestion from Labor’s Doug Cameron that he should call it quits and leave immediately. Labor senator Jenny McAllister said the investigation was “unprecedented” because a public service chief had never before been investigated for an alleged breach of the code of conduct. Lloyd said he would respond to the substance of the complaint as part of the investigation: “It’s occurred, I can’t stop it.” At an October estimates session Lloyd was asked about his contact with the IPA, including an email in which he attached a document that he said “highlights some of the more generous agreement provisions applying to APS employees”. The IPA is a fierce public critic of public service conditions and in December called for 27,000 jobs to be slashed. At that hearing Lloyd defended his link to the group, rejecting the allegation that giving the information amounted to special access because the information was publicly available in public service enterprise agreements. In May it was revealed Lloyd had complained about scrutiny of his links to the IPA, writing to the IPA’s executive director, John Roskam, referring to “more publicity for the IPA including page 1 of the Canberra Times thanks to ALP questioning”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/jun/21/football-transfer-rumours-liverpool-eye-up-lascelles-and-tarkowski","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-21T06:32:47Z","webTitle":"Football transfer rumours: Liverpool eye up Lascelles and Tarkowski?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jun/21/football-transfer-rumours-liverpool-eye-up-lascelles-and-tarkowski","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/jun/21/football-transfer-rumours-liverpool-eye-up-lascelles-and-tarkowski","fields":{"headline":"Football transfer rumours: Liverpool eye up Lascelles and Tarkowski?","bodyText":"Unlike Jürgen Klopp, the Mill could not write a book about defending. But we could jot down the first line, which would read: Get good defenders. Slowly but surely Klopp is starting to implement that advice, which is why he has made a high-class centre-back his priority target for this summer, ranking it even higher than getting Liverpool a new goalkeeper (a move that, come to think of it, should be in the preface to the Big Book of Defending). You want names? How does Jamaal Lascelles grab you? What’s that, Newcastle fans, you’d prefer Liverpool looked at someone else? Well they’re also eyeing up James Tarkowski, apparently. What’s that, Burnley fans, you’d prefer they looked at someone else? Well they’re also monitoring Harry Maguire. But Manchester City also fancy the Leicester colossus, so unless Maguire thinks like Virgil van Dijk, chances are he’ll not be going to Leicester. So it’s Lascelles or Tarkowski for Liverpool, then. Having said that, Manchester City are having trouble getting anyone out of Leicester these days. The Foxes are still playing hardball over Riyad Mahrez, now demanding a fee of around £70m as well as the nifty young striker Patrick Roberts. When/if Liverpool get their hands on a new centre-back, they’ll resume their quest for a new goalkeeper. Jack Butland is said to be their first choice but Paris Saint-German’s Alphonse Areola may take their fancy and is expected to be available for less than £25m if the French club complete the signing of Gianluigi Buffon. Roma and Napoli are also keen on Areola. Manchester United are also in the market for a central defender and had a hot feeling for Sevilla’s Clément Lenglet. But he is poised to join Barcelona instead. And that only hardens United’s affection for Kalidou Koulibaly, who’s currently leading Senegal’s defence at the World Cup. His club, Napoli, won’t let him go cheaply. Anthony Limbombe isn’t in Belgium’s World Cup squad but Huddersfield are excited enough about the 23-year-old to offer £13m to try to prise him from Club Brugge. Radja Nainggolan isn’t in Belgium’s World Cup squad either but Internazionale are on the verge of luring him from Roma, with the former Newcastle player Davide Santon part of the exchange.

The pound has continued to climb, on the back of the news that three Bank of England policymakers pushed to raise interest rates at this week’s meeting. Sterling has now risen to $1.325, up three quarters of a cent today, as traders anticipate a rate rise in August (maybe). That has pulled down shares in London, though (as a stronger currency erodes the value of overseas earnings). Stock markets have also been hit by another bout of trade war jitters. Britain’s FTSE 100 shed 70 points, or nearly 1%, to 7556. That’s its lowest level since early May. In Germany, the Dax shed 1.5%, dragged down by automobile stocks following Daimler’s profits warning. David Madden of CMC Markets says: Equity markets are lower as dealers are worried about the global trade situation. The standoff between the US and China is not any closer to being resolved, and traders are fearful President Trump will turn up the heat on the EU next. Time for a recap. The Bank of England has voted to leave interest rates unchanged at 0.5%. But three policymakers, including chief economist Andy Haldane, pushed for rates to rise to 0.75%. The split vote raises the chances that interest rates are hiked in August. Some experts aren’t convinced, though, and believe borrowing costs could remain unchanged for longer. The pound jumped following the announcement, rising from a 7-month low to reach $1.325. The Bank of England also changed its guidance on quantitative easing. It now expects to start unwinding its bond-buying programme once interest rates have hit 1.5%, down from a previous goal of 2%. Britain’s public finances have improved, thanks to a rise in tax receipts. The UK borrowed £5bn to balance the books in May, the smallest amount in over a decade. Economists say the government has more flexibility to relax austerity. With borrowing below forecast, Philip Hammond has the firepower to increase spending on the NHS. Eurozone finance ministers are meeting to discuss Greece. The Eurogroup will consider how Athens will complete its bailout this summer, and what measures are needed to help it return to the financial markets. I’ll be back later when we have developments on Greece... Shares in Europe’s carmakers are sliding after Germany’s Daimler issued a profits warning, and blamed Donald Trump’s trade disputes. Daimler warned that profits would be “slightly below the previous year’s level”, and blamed the prospect of higher tariffs on US cars sold into China (Daimler has a factory in America making SUVs). Daimler shares have fallen 4%, with Fiat (-3.5%), Volkswagen (-3.2%) and BMW (-2.75%) also dragged down. In other news, the boss of Intel - Brian Krzanich - is resigning after conducting a relationship with an employee. Although the relationship was consensual, it breached the chipmaker’s ‘no fraternisation’ policy. Hannah Maundrell, Editor in Chief of money.co.uk, has some advice for savers and borrowers: “Once again you can breathe a sigh of relief if you’re on a variable rate mortgage; the Bank of England just bought you some time to get a cheaper, fixed deal sorted. You’re not out of the woods yet though. With a rate rise still expected soon the clock is ticking loudly at you especially as the vote was split this month. Check if you’re on a variable deal and speak to a decent mortgage broker about your options if so. It’s likely you’ll save a significant chunk of cash which I’m sure you could better spend elsewhere. “If your fixed mortgage ends in the next 6 months consider prebooking a mortgage now too as it can help you to lock in a lower rate. “Savers, don’t bank on a rate increase to make things better; banks are notoriously slow to pass on any rises so it’s best to take matters into your own hands. Aim to get your return as close to inflation as possible, and beat it if you can. While this is still a challenge, now inflation has tapered slightly and rates topping best buy tables are slowly started to creep up, the situation isn’t quite as dire as it was. Via Kallum Pickering of Berenberg, here’s a handy chart showing how the odds of an August rate hike have jumped to over 60% today: Pickering says Haldane’s vote has made City economists change their forecasts: Today’s surprise vote for a rate hike by the Bank of England’s chief economist Andy Haldane shifts the balance of probability for the next hike to the August meeting. Previously we had called for a November hike, with a risk of a potential move in August already. However, the minutes from the June meeting show that, despite heightened uncertainty about the global economy linked to trade tensions, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) is confident that growth has rebounded to around its trend rate in Q2 (c0.4% qoq) after a soft patch in Q1. Foreign exchange dealer Argentex suggests the next UK interest rate rise might come in the autumn, not his summer. But it all depends on whether growth picks up, after slowing to just 0.1% in January-March. An August move is still possibly too soon, but November is now far more realistic. We remain optimistic of a sterling recovery, aside from the ongoing political risks, we are moving closer to monetary tightening. We’ll need to see stronger economic fundamentals in the short-term. If the shaky first quarter was just an blip then the MPC is likely to act.” A new Brexit crisis could derail the Bank of England from raising interest rates in August, despite Haldane’s hawkish conversion. Silvia Dall’Angelo, senior economist at Hermes Investment Management, explains: The Bank seems determined to deliver one more hike in the second half of the year, justified by a tight labour market and an economy now working close to potential. However, there are several reasons to err on the side of caution. In particular, recent hard data on industrial production and surveys on economic activity suggest that the prospects of a significant rebound in economic performance are uncertain following a weak Q1. Moreover, risks of a disruptive Brexit event down the road are still high. Negotiations have stalled in recent months reflecting unresolved divisions within the UK Cabinet, and the upcoming EU council at the end of June is unlikely to deliver any progress, as other issues (not least international trade tensions) are now topping the EU leaders’ agenda. City economist Sam Tombs of Pantheon has spotted that the pound started to rally just before the Bank’s decision was published. Sterling was trading at $1.310 at 11.50am, but had snuck over $1.313 by 11.59am: The Bank actually held its meeting yesterday, and keeps its decision tightly under wraps until the official announcement. But was it tight enough?... Another development: the Bank of England has changed its guidance about when it might start unwinding its quantitative easing (QE) stimulus programme. The Bank currently holds £435bn of bonds bought through QE using newly-created electronic money. It has now decided it could start to sell some of these bonds when interest rates have risen to 1.5% (compared to 0.5% today). It had previously aimed for 2%. Neil Wilson of Markets.com thinks this shows the Bank doesn’t expect rates to hit 2% for a long time. A lower bar but whether 1.5% or 2% - neither are going to happen any time soon, so this is of marginal relevance to investors right now. It’s indeed probably an admission it doesn’t see rates hitting 2% for a very long time indeed, while 1.5% is a bit more achievable.” Neil Birrell, Chief Investment Officer at Premier Asset Management, agrees: Another significant change was in QE guidance; the bank won’t consider reducing the debt purchased until the rate reaches 1.5%, down from 2%. This suggests that they now think rates will have a lower peak this cycle than previously expected. “This is mixed news for markets. In the short term, it’s a positive for Sterling and we may see gilt yields rise modestly, but the outlook is still unclear, as is the message from the bank.” Andy Haldane’s transformation to an interest rate hawk means there is more chance of an interest rate rise in August, says Craig Erlam of trading firm OANDA. Prior to today’s meeting, investors were unconvinced by the prospect of a rate hike in August but I think today’s release will change that. Sterling rallied above 1.32 against the dollar from just above 1.31 prior to the release which suggests people’s expectations for August are being quickly revised. While a hike in November makes more sense as there’ll be more clarity – hopefully – by then, I wouldn’t be surprised if they go in August given the criticism they endured for holding off in May. The Bank’s official position is that it expects that “an ongoing tightening of monetary policy” will be appropriate over the next couple of years, if the economy performs as expected. Economics journalist Dharshini David points out that this isn’t a concrete promise to raise rates soon Today’s 6-3 split is a surprise, says Ben Brettell, senior economist at Hargreaves Lansdown: But that doesn’t mean that interest rates will definitely rise in August, he adds: There was a small element of surprise in the voting, with the Bank’s chief economist Andy Haldane joining Michael Saunders and perma-hawk Ian McCafferty in calling for an immediate rate rise. Economists had expected a 7-2 split, but in the event a forecast uptick in inflation was enough to split the committee 6-3. Sterling jumped on the news, gaining almost a cent against the dollar as traders factored in a bigger chance of a move in August. But on balance I still think we might not see a rate rise for the rest of the year - policymakers will at the very least want confirmation that the weak first-quarter growth figure was just a blip before raising borrowing costs. There is clearly a split at the Bank of England over the state of the British economy. The minutes of today’s meeting show that six members believe the UK economy isn’t strong enough to handle higher interest rates, especially with the global economy looking shakier. Those members are governor Mark Carney, deputy governors Ben Broadbent, Jon Cunliffe and Dave Ramsden, and external committee members Silvana Tenreyro and Gertjan Vlieghe. As the minutes put it: For the majority of members, an increase in Bank Rate at this meeting was not required. For these members, the news since the previous meeting had given them greater reassurance that the softness of activity in the first quarter had been largely temporary. In particular, indicators of household consumption had recovered strongly from their subdued levels at the time of the previous meeting. Set against that, the outlook for global growth had weakened somewhat, and global financial conditions had tightened, with some modest impact on UK bank funding and corporate credit spreads. Data on manufacturing output and goods exports in April had been weak, although business surveys had generally suggested steady underlying GDP growth. For these members, there was value in seeing how the data evolved from here, in order to learn more about the extent to which conditions were evolving in line with the May Inflation Report projections. But chief economist Andy Haldane disagreed! Along with external members Ian McCafferty and Michael Saunders, Haldane argued that the economy was healthy, and that growth was bouncing back from the winter slowdown. The minute say that this trio pushed for higher borrowing costs, to avoid a spike in inflation. Three members favoured an immediate increase in Bank Rate. These members had a higher degree of confidence that the slowdown in Q1 was temporary or erratic and would largely be unwound. They felt that the economy was developing broadly in line with the May Inflation Report forecasts, but the most recent indicators of labour demand and pay settlements indicated some upside risks to the expected pickup in average weekly earnings and unit wage costs. These members also felt that the benefits of waiting for additional information were limited. Rather, they judged that a modest tightening of monetary policy at this meeting could mitigate the risks of a more sustained period of above-target inflation that might ultimately necessitate a less gradual subsequent change in policy and hence a sharper adjustment in growth and employment. You can read the minutes online here. The pound is rallying, following the news that three Bank of England policymakers voted to raise interest rates today. Chief economist Andy Haldane’s conversion to a hawk makes an August interest rate rise more likely, City traders believe. This has sent sterling back up to $1.32, away from this morning’s seven-month low. Newsflash: The Bank of England has voted to leave interest rates at 0.5%. But it’s a split vote! The Bak’s chief economist Andy Haldane voted to raise borrowing costs to 0.75%, along with Ian McCafferty and Michael Saunders. The remaining six members of the MPC voted to leave rates on hold, though. More to follow! The pound is weakening, as the City braces for the Bank of England’s decision on interest rates at noon. Sterling has fallen by 0.3% today to $1.313 against the US dollar. That’s its lowest level this year. Over in Europe, the eurozone’s bailout fund has warned that Greece still faces major “challenges” before it can end its bailout programme this summer That’s an important point, as eurozone ministers gather to discuss Greece’s financial future this afternoon. Helena Smith reports from Athens “Greece has made significant progress in stabilising its economy,” the European Stability Mechanism said in its 2017 annual report. “Continuing on this path is decisive for the sovereign to regain stable market access. […] Despite strengthened market confidence, the Greek economy faces a difficult economic and financial environment. Greece must address remaining challenges before the programme concludes to ensure that it can build upon its significant programme achievements in the post-programme period.” The assessment echoes similar comments by the ESM’s managing director Klaus Regling in Athens last week. Speaking after holding talks with the Greek finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos, the ESM chief said despite the progress the debt-stricken country had made, it will continue to remain under “tight” surveillance when it exits its current bailout programme in August. Supervision is expected to be strict for several years. “Surveillance will be tight in the case of Greece,” he told reporters adding that while all bailed out euro zone economies were subject to supervision, Athens would be given especially enhanced oversight because of the unprecedented amounts of emergency bailout funding the country had received. Greece would only be a success story if it continued to implement tough economic reforms, Regling said. If it fails to do so, investor confidence will plummet and the markets will retaliate, he warned. Excluded from international capital markets, Greece has been dependent on international rescue funds since May 2010 in what has been the biggest bailout of any state in global financial history. John Hawksworth, chief economist at PwC, says the drop in UK borrowing will allow the government to relax its austerity policies. However, tax rises will still be needed to fund the increase in NHS spending announced this week, he adds: “As a share of GDP, public borrowing in 2017/18 is now estimated to be just 1.9%, the first time the budget deficit has been below 2% of GDP since 2001/2. Since the OBR estimates that the output gap in 2017/18 was close to zero, the structural budget deficit was probably also just below 2% of GDP in that year, meaning that the Chancellor has already met his medium term fiscal target set originally for 2020 with further deficit reductions likely over the next couple of years. “So the Chancellor can afford to ease off on austerity without endangering his medium term fiscal targets. We estimate that, of the proposed £25 billion of real NHS spending rises across the UK by 2023/24, around £10 billion is already implicit in current spending plans used in OBR forecasts. So we estimate that the Chancellor may only need to raise taxes or increase borrowing relative to previous plans by around £15 billion in 2023/24 to fund these plans, which is equivalent to around 0.6% of GDP in that year. A net tax rise of around 0.3% of GDP, plus a modest borrowing rise of a similar magnitude would be enough to fund the additional health spending over and above that implicit in current fiscal projections. Britain is on track to undershoot the government’s borrowing forecast by around £9bn this financial year, says Andrew Wishart of Capital Economics. He also agrees that chancellor Philip Hammond has more firepower than expected: Wishart says: While we wouldn’t place too much weight on the estimates of borrowing in the early months of the fiscal year, since they are largely based on forecasts rather than actual data, the continued improvement in the public finances suggests that the deficit will undershoot the OBR’s forecast again this year. What’s more, if the economy holds up as we expect, borrowing is likely to undershoot the OBR’s forecast by a more significant margin in subsequent years. This would allow the Chancellor to deliver the recently promised £15bn increase in health spending over the next five years while still meeting his fiscal target (for the cyclically-adjusted deficit to be less than 2% of GDP in 2020/21). Today’s UK public finance figures look “fantastic”, says Samuel Tombs of Pantheon Economics. He warns that the trend probably won’t continue, but there’s still room to increase NHS spending. We still expect full-year public borrowing to be only a little below the OBR’s Spring Statement forecast. The Chancellor, however, still will have scope to pause the fiscal consolidation at the Budget later this year, given that cyclically-adjusted borrowing as a share of GDP already will be below his 2020 target of 2% this year. Most of the likely extra borrowing, however, looks set to be earmarked for the NHS, leaving little scope for measures to boost households’ spending or business investment. Howard Archer of the EY Item Club says: The Chancellor will be heartened by the healthy start to the 2018/19 fiscal year following better-than-expected public finances in 2017/18. It suggests that he may have more room for manoeuvre in November’s Budget as he looks to find the extra funding needed for the high-profile increased spending promised for the NHS. Matt Whittaker of Resolution Foundation also believes chancellor Philip Hammond has more flexibility to boost government spending on services such as health. The improvement in the UK public finances suggests there is room to boost spending on key public services. Rupert Harrison, former advisor to the Treasury, believes the NHS (just promised a spending increase) should benefit: Harrison (now at asset manager BlackRock) tweets: The government will be delighted by today’s fall in borrowing, says Kamal Ahmed of the BBC: Fraser Munro of the Office for National Statistics points out that last year’s borrowing figures were better than expected too: The Conservative Party have welcomed the news: (yes, that’s the same Conservative Party that once hoped to eliminate the entire deficit by 2015) Newsflash: UK government borrowing fell last month as the long, slow process of fixing the public finances continues. Britain borrowed £5bn to balance the books in May, the Office for National Statistic reports. That’s down from around £7bn in May 2017 and is the lowest borrowing for any May since 2005. In April and May combined, Britain has borrowed £11.8bn. That’s £4.1bn less than a year ago, and the best start to a financial year since 2007 (before the financial crisis). This improvement is due to rising tax revenues, the ONS explains: In the latest financial year-to-date, central government received £112.9 billion in income, including £82.6 billion in taxes. This was around 3% more than in the same period in 2017. Over the same period, central government spent £123.6 billion, roughly equal to that spent in the same period in 2017. Of this amount, just below two-thirds was spent by central government departments (such as health, education and defence), around one-third on social benefits (such as pensions, unemployment payments, Child Benefit and Maternity Pay), with the remaining being spent on capital investment and interest on government’s outstanding debt. In another boost, last year’s deficit has been revised down to £39.5bn, down from £40.5bn. That’s the lowest net borrowing since the financial year ending March 2007. Overall, Britain’s national debt stands at £1.8 trillion, or around 85% of GDP. Economists are all-but certain that the Bank of England won’t raise interest rates today. City AM’s ‘shadow MPC’ of nine City experts unanimously agree that the BoE should hold borrowing costs, given recent mixed economic data and the ongoing Brexit talks. As Simon French, chief economist at Panmure Gordon put it: There are three main sources of uncertainty in the UK economy: the source of the first-quarter slowdown, the progress of Brexit negotiations and the impact of higher petrol prices. Hold bank rate while assessing these uncertainties further. Morgan Stanley predict that the Bank of England will hold interest rates today, in a 7-2 split (the same as last month). They also expect the BoE to give a hawkish message in the minutes of the meeting (which are also released at noon). MS’s Jacob Nell and Shreya Chander told clients: June to reiterate May’s wait-and-see message: As usual, we are sceptical of action at a non-Inflation Report meeting, given the lack of a new forecast, and expect an unchanged 7-2 vote to hold. Mixed data also makes it unlikely that we get any strong new guidance on August. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial market, the eurozone and business. The Bank of England is in the spotlight today as its Monetary Policy Committee meets to set interest rates. While borrowing costs probably won’t change today, the City will be looking for hints that the long-awaited hike could come in August. The key issue is whether the Bank still believes the recent weakness in UK economic growth is temporary. That slowdown scared the MPC away from raising interest rates last month, forcing investors to rethink their expectations about how fast borrowing costs will rise. The two hawkish members of the MPC, Michael Saunders and Ian McCafferty, will likely vote for a hike today. The majority, though, will (probably!) decide to leave interest rates at just 0.5%. Mike Bell of JP Morgan Asset Management argues that there’s no reason to raise interest rates yet, especially with Brexit uncertainty bubbling away: Some lead indicators suggest wage growth could soon start to accelerate, so the case for a rate hike is building. However, there’s no rush to raise to rates this week given still high political and economic uncertainty. But you never know.... It’s also an important day for Greece. The Greek bailout ends in August, so Eurozone finance ministers will discuss what debt relief measures are needed to help Athens return to the financial markets. The Greek government is hoping for substantive measures to address its debt pile, which has swelled to 180% of its GDP. Spokesman Dimitris Tzanakopoulos told reporters: “We are optimistic that we are on the verge of a solution with substance.” Full-blown debt write-offs aren’t on the agenda, but the eurozone could agree to extend the payback data on Greek debt, giving Athens more wriggle-room to recover from years of economic trauma. Tzanakopoulos argues that Greece needs debt relief in order to become an ‘ordinary’ country again: “The accepted criteria for all sides is that this solution be convincing for markets and embed the creditworthiness of our country - the final act in restoring the credibility of Greece to be able to plan for the next day like any ordinary country. The eurogroup will also discuss what ‘surveillance’ measures should be imposed on Greece, to ensure it keeps meeting its commitments even after the bailout is over. We’ll also keep an eye on Vienna, where Opec members are gathering for tomorrow’s meeting. Some oil ministers (including the Saudis) are pushing for a deal to raise oil output, but others are keener to maintain current production caps....and keep prices higher. Plus, the latest UK public finances will show how much Britain borrowed last month.

Now imagine powerful people with deep pockets and unmatched access to the halls of power realise they could potentially pocket billions of dollars if the government could be convinced to use public money to flood this same pristine location. Far from being a hypothetical situation, this is the state of play facing 65km of wild rivers and thousands of hectares of untouched bushland in the southern Blue Mountains, on the fringe of Australia’s largest city. While a battle between the environment and powerful economic interests is hardly unique, the outcome of this fight will set a precedent for the future of every piece of protected public land in the country. This is because if one of the most highly protected natural landscapes in Australia – it is world heritage listed, a national park, declared wilderness, declared wild river, national heritage status – can arbitrarily be destroyed when economically convenient, then what, if anything, is safe? First championed by the Greiner and Fahey Liberal governments nearly three decades ago, the proposal to raise Warragamba dam to mitigate downstream flooding was revived as a centrepiece in Tony Abbott’s “100 dams” plan. While it was Mike Baird who tasked WaterNSW with assembling a team of engineers to create a concept design for this new dam, it is his replacement as premier, Gladys Berejiklian, who now champions the project. The current proposal will see the dam wall raised 14m, holding back enough water to fill Sydney Harbour twice over. Up to 4,700 ha of national parks – including more than 1,000 ha that is world heritage listed – would be inundated for weeks or months at a time. The official argument for the project, which is estimated to have a direct cost to taxpayers of at least $800m, is about reducing the risks faced by people who live and work on the Hawkesbury-Nepean floodplain. A report by Infrastructure NSW following the devastating Queensland flood in 2011 proposed a range of potential responses to the risk posed by a one-in-1000-year flood to about 43,000 residents who live on the floodplain. While it ultimately recommended raising the dam wall, it acknowledged there were other infrastructure options it had not considered. The NSW government insists community safety is the only motivation for the project, however what is rarely mentioned is that several thousand hectares of the North West Growth Centre – an area it has set aside to house a quarter of a million new residents – can’t currently be developed due to the flooding risk. Some new residents in the area have already seen these flood risks add thousands to their insurance premiums, while others have been told they are uninsurable. The Berejiklian government has made its priorities abundantly clear: wilderness areas, no matter how environmentally or culturally significant, come a distant second to the needs of a growing city. Working with the federal government, she plans to pass legislation that will overturn a ban on the flooding of national parks, along with revocation of wilderness protections. While the the area can’t unilaterally be removed from its world heritage listing, the NSW government believes this is not a legal obstacle to flooding it. Ordinary taxpayers – not the property developers and insurance companies who will profit from the dam – will foot the financial bill. The environmental impacts, which will be much more substantial and lasting, will be left for future generations to deal with. Ecologists and flood experts have warned that sediment-laden floodwaters will drown some species and coat others with a suffocating layer of mud. When the water finally recedes, the landscape will be left scoured and eroded. Weeds, washed down the rivers, will sprout on the fertile flood debris. What was once internationally recognised wilderness – including the lower stretches of the Kowmung, Coxs, Nattai, Kedumba, and Wollondilly rivers – will become little more than 65km of scarred landscape, irreparably damaged to facilitate Sydney’s future growth. Among the many plants and animals that will be harmed is the threatened Camden White Gum, with approximately 40% of the trees that still survive in the wild inundated by the raised dam. While improving flood management across the Hawkesbury-Nepean Valley should be a priority for the NSW government, ample solutions that not only avoid this wholesale environmental damage – and are also more cost effective – have been ignored.

Reports say the bones of up to 250 soldiers, marines and airmen are due to be handed over at a South Korean airbase, in line with a pledge from the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, to Donald Trump at their summit in Singapore on 12 June. In a speech at a rally in Minnesota on Tuesday night, Trump claimed the bodies of 200 servicemen had already returned, saying: “We got back our great fallen heroes, the remains sent back today, already 200 got sent back.” There has been no confirmation from the White House or any government agency that this repatriation has occurred. Trump presented Kim’s offer as an unprecedented breakthrough but repatriation of remains has been happening on and off since 1990. There are 7,700 US troops still missing from the conflict – 5,300 of them lost in North Korea – and only 459 bodies have been identified from repatriated remains so far. Relatives and descendants of the Korean war dead have learned to be patient and sceptical about promises that they will finally be able to bury the long-lost bodies. John Zimmerlee was three when his father’s plane went down over North Korea in March 1952, and he was six when he listened to US army officers swear to his mother that they were actively looking for clues. “I was the one who went to the mailbox every day to see if there was any news,” Zimerlee said. He is now 69, and still waiting. “It is a big void in my life that never goes away.” The sense of uncertainty has only been heightened by his own research, which turned up reports that some of the crew members of his father’s plane may have been seen alive in North Korea after it crashed, raising the prospect his father, also named John, could have been taken prisoner. Rick Downes’ father, Hal, went missing in January 1952 when his B26 bomber was shot down, and the pursuit of information about his fate has also lasted a lifetime. “This is something that only those who experience it know what it’s like,” Downes said. “The lack of closure creates a wound that never heals. It’s just there, and it goes on for generations.” He is the president of a coalition of families of Korean and cold war prisoners of war (POWs) and soldiers missing in action (MIAs), but was taken by surprise by talk of an imminent handover of remains. This week, he emailed his contacts at the Defence POW/MIA Accounting Agency (DPAA), which is tasked with recovering the remains of the war dead, but they had not been informed of what appears to have been a hastily arranged deal in Singapore. In his joint statement with Trump, Kim offered the immediate delivery of remains which the regime says it has identified as American in recent years. Cooperative efforts to repatriate the bodies of US troops from North Korea date back to 1996, two years after the Bill Clinton administration negotiated the Agreed Framework, a denuclearisation deal with Pyongyang. Ever since, repatriation has been a hostage to fortune in bilateral relations, and exploited as a source of cash by the Korean People’s Army (KPA). The hundred billion-dollar question “Invariably they wanted to discuss price tags at the outset. Someone at one of the first meetings said the work would cost a hundred billion dollars,” said Kurt Campbell, who led the first delegation to Pyongyang to discuss repatriation in 1996. “We stayed in a guest house with security guards and this magnificent food, when the country was on the verge of the worst famine in its history,” said Campbell, who went on to become assistant secretary of state for east Asian and Pacific affairs. “We would meet with one or two folks from the foreign ministry and political officers from the military. They would just rail at us about the imperialist war and our negative global role.” Then the question of money would be raised. Technically the US could not pay for the remains but could reimburse the KPA for “legitimate costs” associated with the recovery of remains. “It was like negotiating with the mafia, which they were – a worldwide criminal network,” said Wallace “Chip” Gregson, a retired marine lieutenant general who took part in the early negotiations. In the ensuing decade there were 33 joint missions across the country, and US officers and forensic scientists brought back 229 caskets of bones and personal effects, from which 153 missing Americans have so far been identified. North Korea had unilaterally handed over 208 caskets, though many of the bones inside were not US soldiers and some were not even human. From those remains a further 181 of the war dead have been accounted for. The joint field missions were stopped in 2005 and the only repatriations since then have been seven bodies handed over to the governor of New Mexico, Bill Richardson in 2007, as a goodwill gesture. The Americans paid about a million dollars for the bodies in 2007. “They told us they had these boxes of bones from their excavations but they had collected them at tremendous cost,” said Victor Cha, a former director of Asian affairs at the national security council who was in Richardson’s delegation. “In theory we were paying for costs incurred, but basically it was a kind of pay-off.” It is unclear whether money has been a factor in the Singapore deal on repatriation. A waiting game After Barack Obama sealed a short-lived agreement with Pyongyang in 2012, there was another attempt to restart repatriation of remains, but US and South Korean military exercises led to the breakdown of both the missile deal and the repatriation effort. If the repatriation of remains agreed in Singapore goes ahead it will be the first in 11 years. But the families of the dead are not expecting it to lead to quick answers. The DPAA labs in Hawaii and in Nebraska have limited space and capacity to apply DNA identification techniques, the relatives say. There are still hundreds of bodies repatriated more than 20 years ago that have not yet been identified. “My concern is that they are not going to have the volume they will need,” said Joan Morris, whose uncle, Lieutenant Robert Schmitt was killed in the battle for Chosin Reservoir in 1950. “They have all these bones they haven’t identified and now they are going to get more bones … They need to hire some more DNA experts and get this over with.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/jun/21/jacinda-ardern-babywatch-new-zealand-media","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-21T03:28:29Z","webTitle":"Jacinda Ardern #babywatch sends New Zealand media gaga","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/21/jacinda-ardern-babywatch-new-zealand-media","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/21/jacinda-ardern-babywatch-new-zealand-media","fields":{"headline":"Jacinda Ardern #babywatch sends New Zealand media gaga","bodyText":"The media arrived at Auckland hospital in the predawn hours. They set up their cameras, notepads at the ready. Commuters exchanged knowing looks in the streets. This was the day. Nine floors up, New Zealand’s prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, was in labour. The phenomenon that has become known as #babywatch across the country had officially begun. Since Ardern announced her pregnancy, on 19 January, shortly after winning office, she has gained increasing recognition on the world stage. She appeared in countless interviews with international media and in the pages of Vogue. It would be the first time in 30 years that a nation’s leader had a child while in office. It was also the winter solstice, a good time to plant garlic a “great day for having a baby”, wrote one commentator on Twitter. The day began early with an announcement from the prime minister’s office that Ardern and her partner, Clarke Gayford, had driven themselves to hospital at 5.50am. Ardern then handed the official duties to the acting prime minister, Winston Peters. The live blogs fired up within moments – except one that had been going for several days already. In the absence of an actual baby, they recounted minutiae: the quality of scones available in the hospital canteen, the number of patients the hospital cares for each year, photographs of other politicians with other babies. The Spinoff interviewed a man called Steve, who was on a “smoko break”. Steve said he had not heard about the prime minister’s baby. “It’s a bit out of the blue,” he said. Other news outlets filled the air time with coverage of Ardern’s interactions with her nieces, her previous statements on why asking a woman in job interviews about their intentions to start a family was unacceptable and why this pregnancy meant so much to a generation of New Zealanders. One blog reported the most amusing comments from the Daily Mail’s story. The nation’s most-read Chinese-language news service produced a memorable composite image of Ardern, Gayford and a baby’s dummy. Another website compiled a playlist to welcome the infant, including the Chemical Brothers song Hey Boy, Hey Girl and Europe’s The Final Countdown. The biggest actual news was that Ardern had been texting her staff from the hospital. The content of the texts was not known but apparently did not relate to the progress of her labour. Meanwhile, the betting operator TAB had a “phantom market” of potential names inspired by famous New Zealand figures, along with some others. The country was upbeat – and the feeling seeped beyond its borders. The New York Times suggested it was a rare opportunity for New Zealanders to get excited about something. Many had taken to knitting for the incoming baby as part of a #knitforjacinda movement. Others had gifted Ardern baby clothes in preparation. At her last public outing, at an agricultural show, members of the public took to trying to rub her belly and wish her luck. Some wore their joy on their sleeve. “It felt like Christmas today on Lambton Quay,” a commentator, Morgan Godfrey, wrote on Twitter. “People were smiling at each other, the ‘you know’ kind of smile.” But beyond that some suggested this moment was worth something more than the usual celebrations of an impending child. “She’s showing that women can procreate while campaigning, negotiating coalition deals, deflecting sexist comments about babies, and just generally going about their everyday duties,” wrote a columnist, Michelle Duff. Not everyone was as enthused. The opposition National party MP Judith Collins asked for the media coverage to take a break, after learning that a security guard had moved a reporter who was filming in the wrong place. By early afternoon the baby still had not come but as the evening came Ardern posted to her Facebook page that her daughter had been born at 4.45pm. “Welcome to our village wee one,” she wrote, next to a picture of her and partner cuddling the newborn. Ardern will take six weeks of maternity leave but will be contactable if there are any urgent or major developments. Gayford will be a stay-at-home parent, or “first bloke”, as he has referred to himself. Peters told reporters at parliament that he did not consider this a historic day and said he would just be getting on with the job. He was “unfazed” when he received the news he was now acting prime minister, he said. “When you’ve been around as long as I have, nothing’s unusual.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2018/jun/21/tesla-whistleblower-sabotage-elon-musk-gigafactory-martin-tripp","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-21T20:11:57Z","webTitle":"Tesla whistleblower claims company is 'doing everything it can to silence me'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/jun/21/tesla-whistleblower-sabotage-elon-musk-gigafactory-martin-tripp","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2018/jun/21/tesla-whistleblower-sabotage-elon-musk-gigafactory-martin-tripp","fields":{"headline":"Tesla whistleblower claims company is 'doing everything it can to silence me'","bodyText":"On Wednesday morning, Martin Tripp was an out-of-work Tesla technician trying to figure out what to do next. By the end of the day, he had been sued by his former employer for alleged hacking and theft, engaged in a hostile email exchange with Elon Musk, come out as a whistleblower, and was being patted down by sheriff’s deputies over allegations that he was threatening to go to his former workplace and “shoot the place up”. “I’m a scapegoat because I provided information that is absolutely true,” Tripp told the Guardian on Wednesday evening. “This is obscene … It feels like I have no rights as a whistleblower.” On Thursday, after the local sheriff’s office had announced that there was no credible threat to the Gigafactory, Tripp commented further: “They’re trying to do everything they can to silence me and trying to set an example so that no one else will talk to the press.” Tripp’s dispute with the electric car company erupted into a high-stakes round of he-said/Tesla-said when it filed a federal lawsuit against him on Wednesday. The suit alleged that Tripp had “unlawfully hacked” Tesla’s manufacturing operating system (MOS) – writing code that would export confidential information to third parties and planting the code on three different computer systems such that other employees would be “falsely implicated as guilty parties”. The complaint also accused Tripp of making “false claims to the media about the information he stole”, and specifically referenced claims about punctured battery cells, excess scrap material and manufacturing delays. But Tripp, a former process technician at Tesla’s Gigafactory in Nevada, told the Guardian that he leaked information to a reporter at Business Insider because no one at the company was listening to his concerns. “When it’s world impactful, when you’re lying to the world and investors about the cars you’re producing and how sustainable you are, when you’re saying one thing and doing another, the righteous thing is for the world to know,” Tripp said by phone. Tesla has rejected Tripp’s claim to be a whistleblower and challenged the accuracy of the information he provided to Business Insider. In an email to the Guardian about Tripp’s whistleblower claim on Wednesday afternoon, Musk wrote that Tripp “sent me a threatening email” and that “we received a call at the Gigafactory that he was going to come back and shoot people”. Tesla subsequently released a statement saying the company had “received a phone call from a friend of Mr Tripp” warning that Tripp was going to “shoot the place up”. The company alerted the police and increased security at the factory. Sheriff’s deputies met Tripp at his hotel and questioned him. Tesla has said it would not provide further information, while the Storey county sheriff’s office said it was investigating “the threat’s origin”. The lawsuit capped an already strange news cycle for Tesla and its chief executive, Elon Musk. In an email to Tesla employees sent on Sunday evening, Musk wrote that he had just learned that a Tesla employee had engaged in “quite extensive and damaging sabotage to our operations” which included “making direct code changes” to the MOS and transferring data to third parties. Musk went on to say that the alleged saboteur could be an agent of one of the “long list of organizations that want Tesla to die”, including short-sellers, the fossil fuel industry and rival car manufacturers. In a second email sent on Monday, Musk referenced a small fire at the company’s Fremont factory and again appeared to stoke suspicions of sabotage, writing: “Could just be a random event, but as Andy Grove said, ‘Only the paranoid survive.’” The emails were first reported by CNBC. Though Musk never named Tripp in his emails, the allegations of hacking the MOS are similar, and many news outlets identified Tripp as the “alleged saboteur” once the lawsuit was filed. Tripp says that any suggestions that he was a saboteur are “flat-out lies”. “I’ve never gone to any outside company, any oil industry people,” he added. “I care about the public and safety.” A 40-year-old US navy veteran, Tripp started working for Tesla in October 2017. “I left a really god job and condo in Milwaukee … because I thought I was going to do something good for the world, accelerating the world’s sustainability,” he said, referencing Tesla’s corporate mission. Tripp conceded that he had difficulty adjusting to Tesla’s workplace culture, but he denied a claim by Musk that he had acted out of anger over not receiving a promotion. Instead, he said, he grew increasingly concerned about a range of issues that were eventually reported on by Business Insider, including high rates of “nonconforming material” that ended up being wasted and a batch of battery cells that were mistakenly punctured. “I kept bringing this up to management, supervisors, anyone who would listen,” Tripp said. “Everyone just said, ‘Yeah, whatever.’” Tripp acknowledged that he provided information from Tesla’s MOS to Business Insider, but said that there was no “hacking” involved; he claimed that he simply queried the database to provide verification of his claims to the reporter. “I’m not that smart,” Tripp said. “I don’t know how to code. I tried to teach myself to code and I don’t have the patience.” Tripp also said he did not understand a claim by Tesla that he tried to implicate other employees by planting code on different computers – allegations he said were made to him during Tesla’s investigation. The accusations came up again in the heated email exchange shared by both Musk and Tripp with the Guardian, after Tripp found out that he was being sued. Tripp: “Don’t worry, you have what’s coming to you for the lies you have told to the public and investors.” Musk: “Threatening me only makes it worse for you” Tripp: “I never made a threat. I simply told you that you have what’s coming. Thank you for this gift!!!!” Musk: “You should be ashamed of yourself for framing other people. You’re a horrible human being.” Tripp: “I NEVER ‘framed’ anyone else or even insinuated anyone else as being involved in my production of documents of your MILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF WASTE, Safety concerns, lying to investors/the WORLD. Putting cars on the road with safety issues is being a horrible human being!” Musk: “There are literally injuries[sic] with Model 3. It is by far the safest car in the world for any midsize vehicle. And of course a company with billions of dollars in product is going to have millions of dollars in scrap. This is not news. “However, betraying your word of honor, breaking the deal you had when Tesla gave you a job and framing your colleagues are wrong and some come with legal penalties. So it goes. Be well.” Musk told the Guardian by email: “He initiated the email exchange this morning at 8.57am. I certainly would not have initiated contact, nor would I even know his personal email address, and it was probably unwise for me to have responded.” Tripp said that he did not intend his email as a threat. “All I meant by ‘you’re going to get what you have coming’ is that the truth is going to come out.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2018/jun/20/guns-american-outdoor-brands-sales-drop-smith-wesson","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-20T22:26:38Z","webTitle":"'Trump slump': gunmaker American Outdoor Brands hit by sharp sales drop","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jun/20/guns-american-outdoor-brands-sales-drop-smith-wesson","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/jun/20/guns-american-outdoor-brands-sales-drop-smith-wesson","fields":{"headline":"'Trump slump': gunmaker American Outdoor Brands hit by sharp sales drop","bodyText":"The “Trump slump” struck again on Wednesday as American Outdoor Brands Corporation, the gunmaker formerly known as Smith &amp; Wesson, reported another sharp drop in sales. Full year net sales were $606.9m compared with $903.2m a year ago, a decrease of 32.8%. Firearms sales alone were even harder hit, dropping more than 40%. The results followed an established trend set during the Trump era. Gun sales have tumbled as the threat of tighter gun laws have receded under the pro-gun lobby president, leaving the companies with too much inventory on their hands and falling revenues. Sales – and gun company share prices – hit record highs under Barack Obama, who tried, but failed, to bring in tighter gun laws. Following Obama’s comments after a series of mass shootings gun owners stocked up ahead of a feared crackdown. “Fiscal 2018 was a year characterized by lower consumer demand for firearms, heightened levels of inventory in the consumer channel, and a host of aggressive, industry-wide promotions,” said James Debney, American Outdoor Brands’ chief executive officer. Despite the drop, investors reacted warmly to the results, pushing shares in American Outdoor up 5.8%. The company said it anticipated higher earnings toward the end of the year as it cleared out existing inventory and cut firearm production. In December, American Outdoor Brands reported that its profits had fallen 90% year over year, from $32m to just $3.2m. Sales fell 36%. Last October, Sturm Ruger, the US’s largest firearm manufacturer, announced its quarterly revenues had fallen 35%. Both companies will report their latest results shortly but neither is expected to announce a dramatic increase in sales. Remington, the oldest US gun maker, is using the US’s chapter 11 bankruptcy law to offload $700m of its $950m in debt, and to restructure the company."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/live/2018/jun/21/world-cup-2018-day-seven-buildup-australia-denmark-france-argentina-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-21T11:31:55Z","webTitle":"England team hints, day eight buildup: World Cup 2018 – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2018/jun/21/world-cup-2018-day-seven-buildup-australia-denmark-france-argentina-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/live/2018/jun/21/world-cup-2018-day-seven-buildup-australia-denmark-france-argentina-live","fields":{"headline":"England team hints, day eight buildup: World Cup 2018 – as it happened","bodyText":"Last-ditch essential reading: Thanks for your company, do join us again tomorrow. Bye! Judging by Steve Holland’s scribbled notes, Raheem Sterling could be dropped to the bench for England’s game with Panama on Sunday, with Marcus Rashford assuming his place. Here’s Dominic Fifield with more from Repino: Transfer nugget: Lucas Torreira has not exactly given much of an update on his future, with the Uruguay midfielder stumbling through questions about joining Arsenal. The Sampdoria president, Massimo Ferrero, said Torreira had left the club for €30m but the player himself says he is still in the dark over a move. “No, I don’t know,” Torreira said. “At the moment , the most important thing is playing for my country. Arsenal are a good team, one of the most important in the world, but I am focused on playing for my country.” For updates from the first game of the day, look no further: More now on how we started proceedings, with Fifa taking a dim view of Morocco’s decision to play Nordin Amrabat five days after he suffered concussion. A statement from the governing body reads: Following the questionable handling of the concussion incident involving the Moroccan player, [Nordin] Amrabat, during the Morocco-Iran match, Fifa wrote to the Moroccan team doctor to remind him of the importance to adhere to the guidelines that have been communicated. Some semi-essential day eight reading ... Sergio Ramos has weighed in with his two-pennies’ worth, responding to some flak from all quarters with a couple of playground insults, namely dissing Diego. Remember you can rate every performance in Russia this summer. So far, things are looking pretty good for Artem Dzyuba and Cristiano Ronaldo, but not quite so rosy for Lucas Vázquez: Joint-top of the player ratings are Ronaldo, and Alireza Beiranvand: This is a wonderful tale on Beiranvand’s journey to Russia: Dedryck Boyata has been waxing lyrical about growing up alongside Vincent Kompany for club and country. The 27-year-old Celtic defender played with Kompany at Manchester City and deputised for him in Belgium’s 3-0 win against Panama on Monday. “I’d rather keep to myself what Vincent had to say to me after my performance, but he really touched my heart,” Boyata says. Sepp Blatter is in town, in a five-star Moscow hotel to be precise. “I am suspended by Fifa but not to attend matches,” he said last night. “I am suspended as a president but I am here as a fan and I can go everywhere in the world to watch football.” Blatter has reportedly been given an open invite by Russian president Vladimir Putin to attend any game he pleases. Lovely stuff. The Newcastle United defender Ciaran Clark has been attacked in a Spanish bar, police have confirmed. A British man in his 30s was arrested after punching the Republic of Ireland international at Crystal’s Bar in Magaluf, at around 2am (BST) on Sunday. Clark was left unconscious and taken to hospital after an argument between him and the suspect broke out on the dance floor. The 28-year-old suffered cuts and bruises to his face and was taken to Son Espases hospital in Palma. From humble beginnings in 1930, to the Jabulani™ and beyond: With Australia v Denmark first up on another blockbuster three-game day, a reminder that Tim Cahill can make history in Samara. If the 38-year-old gets on the scoresheet – most likely after coming off the bench – he’ll become just the fifth man in history to find the net at four different World Cups. The others are Uwe Seeler, Miroslav Klose, Cristiano Ronaldo and Pelé, of course. England news: some nifty undercover work appears to have uncovered Gareth Southgate’s planned starting lineup for Sunday’s game with Panama. An image, taken by the Daily Mirror, seemingly shows a, by now standard 3-5-2, but most intriguing is that Raheem Sterling’s name appears beneath Ruben Loftus-Cheek, while Marcus Rashford looks to appear alongside Harry Kane up front. Trent Alexander-Arnold’s name, for example, appears beneath Kieran Trippier’s, Jordan Henderson above Eric Dier and Jesse Lingard above Fabian Delph. The notes, dated 21 June, also suggest Dele Alli, as expected, will not be risked because of that thigh injury. Smooth-talking Timo Werner is not getting sucked into any of that Germany crisis talk. Oh no, he’s still talking them up as potential winners, and who can blame him, really? “Of course we can still win the World Cup,” the RB Leipzig striker mused. “Spain lost their first match at the World Cup in South Africa [to Switzerland] and ended up being champions. Now what we have to do is win the next match against Sweden [on Saturday].” Here’s a longish read on England, by Daniel Taylor: While England are out training, Panama’s Luis Ovalle has been speaking to the gathered press in Saransk. Asked about how others take a dim view of their team, he said: “It’s normal to see us in that way as our first World Cup, but on the pitch the millions do not play, we are 11 against 11 and everything can happen.” Transfer nugget: Emre Can has arrived in Turin to complete his move on a free from Juventus to Liverpool; he has agreed a five-year contract and is undergoing a medical this morning. Meanwhile, more on those 2018-19 EFL fixtures: Australia’s game with Denmark could see a possible clash between two of Huddersfield Town’s standout performers in the Premier League last season, as Mathias Jorgensen and Aaron Mooy go head-to-head, while Jonas Lössl could also feature in goal for the Danes. “If we want to meet our expectations, which are to go through the group stages, then we need to beat Australia,” Jorgensen said. “When you see videos from back home after we won, seeing the crowds at various big screen events out in Copenhagen and around Denmark, seeing how the fever has hit everyone in Denmark and seeing them just enjoying being a Dane.” Big news from the England camp: no sling for Gareth Southgate. Germany are out training in Sochi, with the inquest into their defeat to Mexico still very much ongoing. “We won’t win the next two games by tearing ourselves apart,” Thomas Müller said, asked about reports of team rift. “You can believe me: No one wants be more successful than this squad and the coaching staff.” England news: Dele Alli will sit out training in Zelenogorsk this morning as he continues his recovery from a thigh strain. All the other 22 members of Gareth Southgate’s squad will take part in England’s first full training session since their 2-1 win over Tunisia. Ruben Loftus-Cheek is set to replace Alli on Sunday: A dab of Football League news: the 2018-19 fixtures have just been released, with Frank Lampard’s Derby County opening at Reading on Friday 3 August. Elsewhere, Marcelo Bielsa’s maiden game in English football will be Leeds United’s match at home to Stoke City, on Sunday 5 August. Both those games will be televised. Sunderland, meanwhile, start League One life at home to Charlton. Now, some news to pull at the heartstrings a little: the Denmark squad had a whip round to pay for a private jet so that Jonas Knudsen could fly home and see his baby girl. The Ipswich defender’s wife, Trine, gave birth several weeks earlier than expected, after he had arrived in Russia for the tournament. But, after his team-mates’ helping hand, he spent a day with his new-born daughter before flying back to the Danish base camp in Anapa, on the Black Sea. A goal against Australia later today would surely result in a rock the baby celebration ... Reports in Colombia suggest police will investigate death threats made on social media against the former Aston Villa midfielder Carlos Sánchez, now of Fiorentina, who picked up the first red card in Russia this summer for a deliberate handball three minutes into his country’s Group H opener against Japan. Unknowingly, Kasper Schmeichel eclipsed his father Peter’s record after racking up a record 533 minutes without conceding a goal for Denmark. And he can extend that clean sheet feat by shutting out Australia in Samara today: Some painstaking number-crunching has created this beauty: On the menu a little later, after Australia’s match-up with Denmark, is Peru’s clash with France and Argentina v Croatia. The latter will see Barcelona team-mates Ivan Rakitic and Lionel Messi pit their wits against each other in Nizhny Novgorod, with Jorge Sampaoli’s side, finalists in 2014, under pressure to deliver after stuttering to a draw against Iceland. Speaking of Messi, Rakitic said: “My impression is not just that he’s motivated, but that he’s uber-motivated. When he goes to Argentina, he has a special smile on his face. I don’t think there is a player more proud to wear the jersey than he is. I appreciate him as a human and a player.” Meanwhile, here’s Barney Ronay on Argentina’s No 10: Talking of injuries, England manager Gareth Southgate dislocated his shoulder while out jogging near their training base in Repino, on the Gulf of Finland: I am just a bit gutted because I was on for my record 10k time. I might not be celebrating any goals as athletically in future. The doc has made it clear that punching the air is not an option. Здравствуйте! Let’s kick-off with a serious topic: concussion. Nordin Amrabat, the Watford defender, returned to the Morocco lineup against Portugual on Wednesday, five days after not remembering anything for “five or six hours”. The players’ union, FifPro, are not best pleased, highly critical of what it called “yet another alarming example of a player being put in harm’s way.” The Morocco coach, Hervé Renard, defended his decision to pick the player, saying: “He’s a warrior; he wanted to play. It’s because his spirit is amazing and I was lucky to have a player like this.” As for Amrabat, who also accused the referee Mark Geiger of trying to bag Cristiano Ronaldo’s shirt – “it’s not a circus” – the 31-year-old insisted: “I am my own doctor.” All in all, not great. And with that, it’s over to Ben Fisher once again. Thanks for your company, until next time. Kieran Pender has been chatting to the Australian ambassador in Moscow, Peter Tesch, before the big game in Samara. “In the worse case we plan for the large-scale contingencies,” Tesch says. “If there is some sort of significant incident that affects Australians en masse. It does not even have to be a terrorist scare – it could simply be an infrastructure failure, a breakdown in public transport – anything that is going to inconvenience Australians and put them at risk. The other end of the spectrum is the much more likely: the day to day experience of people who lose a passport, use it as a beer coaster, put it through the washing machine etc, or are hospitalised. These are the more practical consular contingencies that we have been preparing for.” English hangovers, certainly in Leeds, seem to have been pretty severe after the opening win over Tunisia. More than four times the average number of sick days were taken in the Yorkshire city on Tuesday, apparently. How are those Russian hangovers? After their jubilant qualification for the last 16, a wave of optimism is lighting up the nation, writes the Guardian’s central and eastern Europe correspondent Shaun Walker. Guardian reporter Chris Knaus is in Samara, and he has this dispatch on the feel on the streets: “The anticipation is building among Australian fans here in Samara. There’s a feeling of cautious optimism about the team’s chances. The general consensus? The Socceroos are a real shot at causing an upset, but no one – not even the most hopeful of armchair experts – can say where the goals will come from. There’s one thing the Aussies have already won hands down. Their fans significantly outnumber the Danes on Samara’s streets. The city’s pubs were crammed with Socceroos’ gold last night and you could scarcely go half an hour without hearing a drunken rendition of Waltzing Matilda or I Am Australian. This morning, it’s all gold along Samara’s main promenade, and down on the banks of the Volga River. The Danes that have made it here are understandably confident of their prospects. They offer confused looks when you rattle off a list of Australia’s best players – Aaron Mooy, Mat Ryan, or Mat Leckie. Australian fans are hoping the names will register a little more recognition after this afternoon.” Archie Thompson, the former Australia striker who once scored 13 in one game, is on the telly now and he doesn’t believe the Socceroos should mix it up too much after being impressed by their performance in the opening defeat to France. “I don’t think you really need to change too much,” he says. “They were pretty solid throughout.” Like many in Australia, he’s tipping a Socceroos win. “With the confidence from the first game, there a bit of belief. There’s a big belief, not just in the team, but across Australia.” Never, ever underestimate the power of big belief. And of course, Argentina are also in action, against Croatia later today. Here’s (possible Smiths fan) Barney Ronay with a nod to Frankly Mr. Shankly and, armed with some interesting and, perhaps, surprising statistics, a look at Lionel Messi: In the hope that a croissant and a slice of a tres leches cake miraculously lands on my desk, I’ll acknowledge the other Group C match to be played today, between France and Peru. Les Bleus are the clear favourites, and with Olivier Giroud back in the starting XI, supported by Antoine Griezmann and Kylian Mbappé, it’s going to be difficult for the South Americans to avoid a second defeat – and an exit from the tournament. Treats! A package has just arrived at Guardian Towers (Sydney chapter), containing a Danish pastry and a Lamington, a loosely football-related gift from a popular social media platform. I should really tweet about it... Much of Australia’s focus pre-match has been on how they can stifle the creativity of Christian Eriksen, but it’s at the other end of the pitch where they perhaps face their biggest challenge. Because standing in between the sticks is Kasper Schmeichel, the Leicester City keeper who has not been beaten in a monster 533 minutes. “We’ll need to pray hard for Australia to have any sort of chance. Cahill’s forehead needs to pull off another miracle,” James Minglis writes below the line, offering one possible solution. sgGibson asks what we’ve all been thinking: “How is it even possible to dislocate your shoulder while jogging? Was he running upside down?” It’s scientific fact that it’s possible for footballers (and by extension managers) to injure themselves while performing seemingly innocuous tasks. See exhibit A (folding down an ironing board), B (shaving legs), C (jogging again, but in style) and D (mowing the lawn), to list but a few examples of the genre. More here: “Has anyone asked Princess Mary who she is hoping will win - we want to know Mary?” writes Weakaspiss below the line. Somebody has indeed asked, although we’re still in the dark. This is from an Australian betting company, who say they got in touch with an offer of a charity bet if her tip won the match: “Understandably, it seemed picking between her head and her heart was too hard, and we have received word that she has politely declined the offer.” Amazingly, it took until the penultimate first-round group game for a red card to be brandished in Russia, the dubious honour of becoming the first player to be sent off this tournament going to Colombia’s Carlos Sánchez in the Group H game against Japan. Does that make this the cleanest World Cup so far? If red card knowledge is your thing, test yourself with this quiz, which includes posers such as, “How many red cards were there in matches involving Argentina during the 1990 World Cup in Italy?” (And, for that matter, poseurs such as David Beckham.) “Anything is possible of course,” says Mikkel Beck, the former Denmark international who spoke with John Davidson earlier in the week about Australia’s chances. “But they will have to be better offensively to beat Denmark. They will be very good in defence, they have the two central defenders and Maty [Ryan]. But they need to find a way to find Rogic more. Rogic wasn’t really in the [France] game. I think that was a problem for the team because he should be the link between the midfield and the strikers. The fact he wasn’t in the game meant the strikers never really got any balls, so I think that’s the key to their game offensively, to get Rogic more into the game.” Australia’s World Cup hopes hang in the balance later, when Bert van Marwijk’s side meet Denmark in Samara. Lose and the Socceroos can start planning what they’re going to do next month. Win, and it’s a different story. Draw, and, well, it’s not quite so clear cut. The feeling in a nation that so desperately wants its sporting teams to do well is that points can be won off a Danish side that failed to convince in a patchy opening victory over Peru. That, coupled with a decent enough showing in their own opener against France, has Socceroos fans believing a dream run out of the group stage will still be a possibility come full-time against the Danes. Who will be charged with carrying those hopes in Samara later remains unknown. Van Marwijk has kept his cards close to his chest so far, and there are still questions over who will lead the line: will Andrew Nabbout get another run out, or is it time for Tomi Juric to assume the starting striker’s role? May Jamie Maclaren get the nod? And what about Daniel Arzani? Could the youngest player at this tournament squeeze into the side, possibly at the expense of Robbie Kruse, with the need to unsettle the Danes at the back so important? Sadly, I don’t have the answers. But Van Marwijk has and one assumes he will let us know soon enough. Here’s Kieran Pender’s preview of the match to get your teeth into in the meantime: Before yesterday’s victory over Morocco, Ronaldo’s teammate Pepe said Portugal were “privileged” to have to have the Real Madrid man in the squad and that there is “no doubt that the most important thing for our team is that Cristiano Ronaldo is in top shape”. I’ll leave you to judge whether that is the case. Martin Laurence has come up with some ratings to compile a best XI of the opening round. No surprises to see Ronaldo and Costa leading the team from the front, but what about the rest? Take a peek for yourselves: On that final point, Southgate’s unfortunate injury – sustained while going for a jog, of all things – has rendered him incapable of celebrating any goals, apparently. “The doc has made it clear that punching the air is not an option,” he said. “It is better this is me than one of the players,” he added. “They were a bit surprised in the team meeting and were asking: ‘What have you been doing?’ As always, they were probably quite amused. It is good that we have had a quiet day today so I had prepared the meeting before and we are on to preparations for Panama. I am just a bit gutted because I was on for my record 10k time.” And let’s get an early plug in for this, yesterday’s daily podcast, in which Max Rushden, Barry Glendenning and Sam Diss analyse day seven’s events with the help of Barney Ronay, who calls in from Russia to talk about Gareth Southgate’s running injury. As usual, it’s well worth a listen. What better way to get things started today than with an outrageous story from Russia involving Burger King, an incredibly ill-judged and poor-taste social media campaign, a hardly surprising backlash and an inevitable apology. The headline speaks volumes. Incredible stuff. Something of a natural order, if you like, has been restored to the World Cup. How long this state remains is unknown, but after an opening round that contained a number of upsets, it was with a sense of comfort/disappointment (depending on your disposition) that day seven’s round two results went as expected. Not only were the wins for Spain (1-0 over Iran), Uruguay (1-0 over Saudi Arabia) and Portugal (1-0 over Morocco), but the identity of all three goalscorers also came as little surprise. Diego Costa grabbed his third of the tournament to give La Furia Roja their first win, Luis Suárez opened his account on his 100th international appearance to send Uruguay into the last 16 and, perhaps most inevitably of all, Cristiano Ronaldo thundered home a brave header to put Morocco out. Ronaldo’s effort, in the fourth minute at the Luzhniki Stadium, was his fourth of the tournament and ensured the already short odds for him to become the tournament’s top scorer were trimmed even further. The coveted Golden Boot appears well within the Real Madrid striker’s reach. Lionel Messi will be hoping to trouble the scorers for the first time later today when he leads out Argentina against Croatia in Nizhny Novgorod. But before that there is the small matter of two Group C games – and possibly some World Cup fates – to be settled: Denmark v Australia and France v Peru. Much more on those to come in due course.

It's far from over","bodyText":"Was it the “tender age” inmates, the rare sight of all the Senate’s Republicans growing a spine, or the even rarer sight of intervention from every one of the nation’s first ladies? We’ll never know the truth behind Donald Trump’s humiliating reversal of his own brutal policy of separating thousands of immigrant children from their parents at the border. But we do know that Trump will lie about his actions, and will be utterly incompetent about fixing the crisis he created. First, the most glaring lies. This is not a humane policy replacing an inhumane one. Instead of imprisoning children separately, the United States will now imprison them together with their parents indefinitely. That’s for the misdemeanor of crossing the border illegally, even though it is perfectly legal to claim asylum at the border or after crossing the border. There are several reasons why previous administrations – including President Obama’s – found it hard to imprison families, even as they engaged in their own crackdowns on illegal immigration. Yes there were legal constraints on jailing children for more than 20 days, whether alone or with their parents. But there are also practical limits, as well as moral ones: where on earth is the United States going to imprison all these families? So spare us the pretense – and the lazy reporting – about Trump’s newfound moral compass. When Anthony “The Mooch” Scaramucci is testifying about your compassion, you need to find better character witnesses. You also should tell him to stop blaming other White House officials for his own disastrous policies. The policy reversal is itself a lie that gives the lie to another dozen lies. Trump did not need to sign an executive order to end the separation of young children from their mothers and fathers. He could have just picked up the phone to tell his attorney general to stand down, just as Jeff Sessions ordered up the new policy from his own officials earlier this year. How could it be so easy to change a policy that Trump’s own secretary of homeland security, Kirstjen Nielsen, insisted was not in fact a policy? What happened to the legal principles she so bravely defended at the White House podium just two days ago? “Here is the bottom line,” she said, before deciding to eat Mexican food at a DC restaurant the next day. “DHS is no longer ignoring the law.” That law was so Monday, Madam Secretary. So if this wasn’t really about the law, what was this self-instigated crisis about? Fortunately the man behind the disaster is an open book when it comes to the strangely sociopathic behavior that has become his policy. “The dilemma is that if you’re weak, as some people would like you to be, if you’re really, really pathetically weak, the country’s going to be overrun with millions of people,” said the really, really pathetically weak soul sitting in the president’s chair on Wednesday. “And if you’re strong, then you don’t have any heart. That’s a tough dilemma. Perhaps I’d rather be strong but that’s a tough dilemma.” Sorry, Mr President. A tough dilemma is how to keep your sanity when your baby or toddler has just been ripped from you by immigration officers. For most normal adults, this is an astonishingly simple choice: do you prove your toughness by brutalizing children or do you treat them with the essential sympathy that we like to call human nature? Trump’s tough man pose is not a million miles away from the simple choice that George W Bush laid before a terrified nation after the 9/11 attacks: you’re either with us, or with the terrorists. That simple choice opened the door to human rights abuses that represent war crimes in any other country. But there was at least one glaring difference between the politics of these two supposedly tough dilemmas: President Bush was widely seen as protecting Americans from a threat that killed several thousand people. What exactly is Trump protecting Americans from by caging all those children? He can only talk darkly about the MS-13 gang, which in fact targets immigrant children. The threat of MS-13 might be very real in parts of Long Island, but it hardly justifies the abuse of thousands of children. This is not the end of the story, of course. Just like the botched Muslim travel ban, we know that Trump’s worst instincts don’t simply disappear. They metastasize into other forms of immigrant persecution and racial politics. The Trump administration is already taking the unprecedented steps of seeking to deport naturalized US citizens by de-naturalizing them for breaching immigration rules before they became full citizens. It’s hard to imagine how this is related to MS-13 gangs, because of course the supposed threat has nothing to do with what the Trump administration is actually doing. However, this is also not the end of the story for the thousands of children currently separated from their parents. The sad truth is that some of them will never be reunited with their parents. This is coldly called permanent separation. But it is in fact the US government turning children into orphans. For parents already deported, or for children too young to speak, this is the kind of threat that is as terrifying as terrorism itself. Some people have suggested this crisis of Trump’s making is his own personal Katrina: the hurricane that laid bare the incompetence of the Bush administration. It isn’t. That’s because there was Maria: another hurricane that killed three times more Americans than Katrina, because the incompetence was that much worse than anything we saw in New Orleans. No, there are no recent American comparisons to the child cruelty of this man-child president. There’s only the permanent shame of a president and his willing aides who punished children because their parents wanted to give them a better life.

Naz Shah, the MP for Bradford West, said parliamentary voting procedures were archaic and undignified after the whips refused her request to be paired with a Tory MP to cancel out each other’s vote – a practice that allows MPs to be absent from parliament with good reason. She has been in hospital since last Friday with severe nerve pain, an ongoing complication from a hit-and-run collision several years ago. When it became clear the vote on an amendment to the Brexit bill was going to be close, Labour whips asked her to leave hospital and make a four-hour journey to London to take part. They told her she would be allowed to stay in the car rather than haul herself into the chamber, and whips would come to the car park to count her vote. But the Tories insisted she attend not just the vote but the three-hour debate preceeding it. Shah was brought into the House of Commons in a wheelchair, carrying a sick bucket and dosed up on morphine. She said it was a humiliating experience. “I was in my pyjamas. It felt personally very undignified and very invasive. It was embarrassing. I thought I’d just be able to stay in the back of the car, where I’d made a bed for myself, and be counted there, but the Tories wouldn’t have it. By making me go in to vote like that, they stripped me of my dignity. “It wasn’t just me either. I was standing next to Laura Pidcock [the Labour MP for North West Durham], who is eight months pregnant and in agony because the baby is causing her back pain. She said it was like the Tory whips wanted her to prove that she really was in pain by attending. There was another MP [the Liberal Democrat Jo Swinson] who had to come in despite being two days over her due date. The system is just so archaic.” Shah said doctors at Bradford Royal Infirmary had told her she shouldn’t travel but she felt a duty to her constituents. “They kept a bed for me because of the special circumstances,” she said in a phone interview from the back of the car on her way back to hospital. She said the morphine made her queasy and she had been sick numerous times before she went into parliament. “It was really inhumane,” she said. “No other employer would force you to come in to work in that condition. As MPs we are supposed to be setting the tone for the country, setting an example. We make the laws on equality and yet we don’t apply them to our own house.” Shah’s effort ended in vain for her after the government won the vote on the amendment."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jun/21/alan-sugar-senegal-joke-racist-sack-bbc-tweet","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-21T08:28:27Z","webTitle":"If Alan Sugar can’t see why his Senegal ‘joke’ is racist, then sack him | Dawn Butler","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/21/alan-sugar-senegal-joke-racist-sack-bbc-tweet","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/21/alan-sugar-senegal-joke-racist-sack-bbc-tweet","fields":{"headline":"If Alan Sugar can’t see why his Senegal ‘joke’ is racist, then sack him","bodyText":"There’s no question that Alan Sugar’s tweet comparing the players in the Senegal national football team to people selling sunglasses and handbags on beaches is racist and deeply offensive. He tweeted a photo of the team, saying, “I recognise some of these guys from the beach in Marbella. Multi tasking resourceful chaps.” This included a photo of sunglasses and handbags laid out for sale, just to make the comparison crystal clear. Whether it was intended to be a “joke” or not is irrelevant. It’s an unacceptable thing for anyone to say, but is particularly distressing to see from a member of the House of Lords and someone with their own programme on the BBC. The fact that Lord Sugar couldn’t seem to comprehend why it was offensive demonstrates how deep-rooted racism is in our society. I am writing to the House of Lords commissioner for standards to ask for an immediate investigation. Racism has no place in society or in our parliament, and swift action must be taken to demonstrate that. Parliament is supposed to represent our diverse society. How can it do that if its members make comments that belong in another century? I will also be writing to the BBC to ask them to conduct their own investigation. As our state broadcaster, funded by the public, it has a responsibility to represent the diversity of our society and uphold our values of equality and respect. However, the BBC’s response didn’t fill me with confidence. After Sugar apologised for causing any offence, the BBC said that this was sufficient, even though the apology came after he defended his so-called joke, telling those offended to get a sense of humour. Ironically, his tweet went out on the same day the BBC launched its new diversity policy, saying it was a significant step forward in ensuring it represents the ethnic diversity of our society. But I find it hard to see how this can mark a moment of real change if the BBC is already refusing to take action on a racist comment by one of its key figures. I think many people will rightly be appalled that their licence fee is subsidising someone with such bigoted views. When Roseanne Barr posted her racist and Islamophobic tweet about Obama’s former White House adviser, she rightly lost her programme. Sugar’s comments are a clear breach of the BBC’s code of conduct, which says disciplinary action will be taken against anyone who crosses the line. He shouldn’t be exempt because of his high profile. How can we hope to eliminate racism from our society if comments like these from such individuals go unchallenged? If Sugar can’t demonstrate that he truly understands why his tweet was unacceptable, derogatory and demeaning, he should be pulled from the BBC’s programming schedule. • Dawn Butler is Labour’s shadow women and equalities minister"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/jun/21/morning-mail-trump-backs-down-doctors-support-dying-refugee-crunch-game-for-socceroos","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-20T21:09:03Z","webTitle":"Morning mail: Trump backs down on hardline immigration policy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/jun/21/morning-mail-trump-backs-down-doctors-support-dying-refugee-crunch-game-for-socceroos","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/jun/21/morning-mail-trump-backs-down-doctors-support-dying-refugee-crunch-game-for-socceroos","fields":{"headline":"Morning mail: Trump backs down on hardline immigration policy","bodyText":"Good morning, this is Richard Parkin bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Thursday 21 June. Top stories Donald Trump has backed down on his controversial family separation policy, signing an executive order to end the practice. More than 2,300 children have been forcibly removed from their parents at the US-Mexico border over the past six weeks, with babies and young children still being sent to at least three “tender age” shelters overnight in southern Texas. The president faced significant pushback from his own party, with the senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, saying, “All of the members of the Republican conference support a plan that keeps families together,” and many urging the president to hasten the process with an executive order. Trump remained defiant, saying: “We’re keeping families together but we have to keep our borders strong.

They had disparate views of the family separation crisis on the southern border with Mexico but they all agreed on one thing; it wasn’t Trump’s fault. In recent days, the news that more than 2,300 children of asylum seekers who had entered the United States had been separated from the parents sent shockwaves through American politics. The actions of the Trump Administration in setting a “zero tolerance” policy drew bipartisan rebukes as audio and video of crying children became a constant presence on cable news. Some attendees, like Mary Reuter of Sauk Centre, Minnesota, said it was all fake news. Reuter – who was disappointed that she shared a last name with a wire service that she described as “very liberal” but was proud of coming from the home town of Sinclair Lewis – said only Fox News “got it right”. Reuter said only 10% of the children separated from their parents “are really families” and she felt it was acceptable to separate them in that case. “If you are a US citizen, you break the law, you go to jail. You don’t get to be with your kids.” She added: “We got illegals coming with their kids hollering that we are separating them.” In Reuter’s opinion, “most of them are pretty happy, just ship them off with whatever adult wants to take them.” Reuter thought the executive order was “forced onto Trump”. However, she added “when he makes an order I trust him, he did the right thing.” Melissa Young of Dodge Center, Minnesota shared the ire at the media. “I wish they had covered it more fairly.” She said “some of the pictures were from previous [years]. It is bad whenever it happens. It was bad back then and it is now.” She blamed the situation on Congress for not doing its job and specifically pointed at Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer, the Democratic minority leaders in the House and the Senate. Tyler Sterner of Rogers, Minnesota, said “It doesn’t look good, right?” He added: “If you’re criminal and you come across the border which is illegal, your parents committed the crime. You’re a juvenile; your parents did it to you. I don’t think it’s right, eventually they’ll come to a solution.” In his opinion: “ Put them back across the border, that’s what I think, and we shouldn’t be paying for it.” While Sterner thought Trump could “probably do a little bit more” he believed “you’ve got to pick and choose” and noted that Trump “has done more than any other president”. Others took different stances. Jack Nylund of Duluth who showed up at the rally dressed like a Viking and holding a fake shield with the phrase “USA Trump” on it, disapproved of the policy. “I don’t know why they are doing that. There’s gotta be a solution to that you don’t separate kids from parents” said the self-described “honest Finlander” who said he was separated from his parents at five and spent much of his youth in “boarding houses”. However, he supported Trump’s tough stance on immigration. “We can’t afford to support them. That’s the name of the game.” He noted “We can’t afford to take care of our elderly and children and they are flooding the doggone country.” Others simply hadn’t been following it too closely Alex Kordahl, a junior at North Dakota State who was attending the rally while on summer break in his home town, needed prodding to be aware of the story. He said: “I think it’s just totally wrong man. I think kids should not be separated from their parents.” He looked forward to hearing Trump talking about taking steps to end the practice while noting, “I don’t know too much about it.” Trump himself skirted the issue. Although he broached his usual rhetoric about the perils posed by mass immigration, he told the crowd it was a distraction by Democrats to hide the crimes of Hillary Clinton and the FBI. “Right now they are building up immigration, they are building up immigration,” said Trump. “They don’t want to show what’s happening in Congress where this scam has been revealed.” Democrats were skeptical of Trump’s messages. Keith Ellison, a Democratic congressman from Minneapolis who is running for state attorney general thought Trump’s policies did not wear well with many voters in the area. On Tuesday night, Ellison, a candidate for state attorney general, said of Trump’s policies: “People do not like that. People are pro family they believe families belong together. He’s ripping them apart and trying to lie and blame everyone but themselves.” Ellison added that on his campaign stops in the Iron Range, a blue-collar traditionally Democratic mining area that swung heavily towards Trump in 2016, “people in the range are only one or two generations from being immigrants themselves. The Range of all places in Minnesota is a place of immigration so they remember that, so they are fired up and don’t like the policy.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/jun/21/najib-razak-denies-1mdb-scandal-i-know-whats-right-and-wrong-","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-21T04:37:26Z","webTitle":"'I know what's right and wrong': Najib Razak denies responsibility for 1MDB scandal","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/21/najib-razak-denies-1mdb-scandal-i-know-whats-right-and-wrong-","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/21/najib-razak-denies-1mdb-scandal-i-know-whats-right-and-wrong-","fields":{"headline":"'I know what's right and wrong': Najib Razak denies responsibility for 1MDB scandal","bodyText":"The former prime minister of Malaysia Najib Razak has denied any responsibility for the 1MDB scandal and claimed that the hundreds of designer handbags and millions of dollars in cash seized from his house were wedding gifts and campaign funds. In his first interview after he dramatically lost the election in May, Najib protested his innocence and claimed that the board of the troubled 1MDB government fund had kept the multi-billion dollar embezzlement of the money from him. Speaking to Reuters, Najib said: “If I knew there was going to be misappropriation of funds, if that was my knowledge, I would have acted.” 1MDB was a government fund set up by Najib in 2009 but in 2015 it was revealed that over $4bn had been embezzled out of the account and laundered around the world, funding yachts, Picasso paintings, property and films. Some $681m of the fund was deposited into Najib’s personal bank account. The total losses and theft of 1MDB money is now estimated to be $10bn. While he was in power, an investigation Najib cleared of all wrongdoing, but since the newly elected government took office, a renewed prove into 1MDB has been key priority. Najib’s alleged role in the scandal has been at the centre of the investigation. Speaking on Tuesday, new prime minister Mahathir Mohamad said they had an “almost perfect case” against Najib and his allies and expected arrests to be made within months. However, Najib maintained that his conscience was clean. “I’m not party to the yacht, the paintings ... I’ve never seen those paintings whatsoever,” he said. “I was not aware of these purchases. This was done without my knowledge. I would never authorise 1MDB funds to be used for any of these items. I’ve been in government so long, I know what’s right and what’s wrong.” He added that he had no idea the money deposited into his personal bank account came from 1MDB. He also washed his hands of any responsibility for the actions of Jho Low, a Malaysian businessman who was brought on as a consultant for 1MDB and was allegedly responsible for the embezzlement of the money into the US, funding, among other things, the Wolf of Wall Street film, which was produced by Najib’s stepson Riza Ahmad. The Malaysian authorities recently issued a warrant for Low’s arrest in connection with 1MDB. “I didn’t give him instructions, but he volunteered to do certain things, which he thought would help 1MDB,” said Najib. “But whatever he did ultimately is the responsibility of the management and board.” As part of the 1MDB investigation, multiple raids have been carried out on Najib’s property which saw 274 designer Birkin handbags seized as well as $29m in cash. The former prime minister maintained that the handbags were gifts to his wife and weddings presents given to his daughter. The cash, he added, was “genuine donations” from the election. “As president of the party, I had to prepare for the elections, and elections are very expensive affairs,” he said. “Donations are made in cash in election times.” Another case that has reared its head since Najib was toppled from power is the murder of Altantuya Shaaribuya, a Mongolian translator who was the lover of Najib’s close associate Razak Baginda. Claims of a government cover up of her death, with allegations she was Najib’s lover and had known about corrupt government defence deals, have hung over Malaysian politics for over a decade. There are now calls for the new government to re-open the case. However Najib reiterated his denial of any involvement. “The Altantuya case has already been dealt with,” he said. “There is no evidence whatsoever that I ever met her, there are no records, no pictures or witness to say that I even knew her. It was subject to a proper trial and my name didn’t come up during the trial whatsoever.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2018/jun/20/donald-trump-rally-minnesota-family-separations-democrats-attack","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-21T02:27:22Z","webTitle":"Trump on child separations: outcry is a distraction by Democrats","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jun/20/donald-trump-rally-minnesota-family-separations-democrats-attack","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/jun/20/donald-trump-rally-minnesota-family-separations-democrats-attack","fields":{"headline":"Trump on child separations: outcry is a distraction by Democrats","bodyText":"Only hours after signing an executive order to end the practice of separating migrant families at the US-Mexico border, Donald Trump said the public uproar over his administration’s policy was a distraction by Democrats from a report into the FBI’s Hillary Clinton’s email investigation. Speaking to a packed rally in Duluth, Minnesota, on Wednesday night, Trump tied the issue to the inspector general’s report about the FBI’s handling of its Clinton inquiry during the 2016 elections, which he falsely claimed had proved his innocence in the Russia investigation while covering up Clinton’s guilt. “Right now they are building up immigration, they are building up immigration,” Trump said. “They don’t want to show what’s happening in Congress where this scam has been revealed.” Trump faced significant backlash in recent days after audio and video emerged of children separated from their families under the “zero tolerance” policy implemented by his administration. It has led to 2,300 children being separated from their parents. Although Trump’s executive order is prospective, it does nothing to reunite children who have already been separated. The event was held in a congressional district in north-east Minnesota that Trump had won easily in 2016, but where the incumbent Democratic congressman Rick Nolan held on. With Nolan’s retirement, the district has become a top target for Republicans in the 2016 midterms. As Trump asked, “How guilty is she?”, the crowd chanted, “Lock her up”. Trump also dwelled on a familiar array of topics. He expressed his resentment at critics who were dubbed elites. “Why are they elite?” asked Trump. “I have a much better apartment than they do. I’m smarter than they are. I’m richer than they are, I became president and they didn’t and I’m representing the greatest, smartest, most loyal, best people on earth, the deplorables.” He also defended his summit with North Korea, saying that he prevented war and predicted that the country’s dictator, Kim Jong-un, “will turn that country into a great successful country”. Trump also touched on familiar themes on immigration, claiming that, since taking office, towns on Long Island had been “liberated” from the gang MS-13 and that Democrats “put illegal immigrants before American citizens”. He also referenced his infamous announcement speech where he claimed that Mexico was deliberately sending rapists and murderers into the United States. Trump noted of the United States’s southern neighbor: “They are not sending their finest let me tell you and we are sending them the hell back.” Trump was not the only speaker to say the issue of family separation was an attempt to divert attention from his successes and his opponent’s failures. Speaking before he arrived at the venue, his daughter-in-law, Lara Trump, said it was a distraction from Trump’s visit to North Korea. She said the media was focusing on “people coming into our country illegally, breaking our laws and paying the consequences about it”. She went on to lay the blame for Trump’s “zero tolerance” policy implemented by his attorney general, Jeff Sessions, on the Obama administration. “People are hysterical about it. The media is going crazy about it, but this has been going on for years and years and years. It happened for eight years under President Obama. Where was hysteria? Where was uproar? Where were Democrats calling out for him to change it?” Attendees had mixed views of the Trump administration’s family separation policy. Jack Nylund, an ardent Trump supporter, disapproved of the policy. “I don’t know why they are doing that. There’s got to be a solution to that you don’t separate kids from parents,” said Nylund, who added that he was separated from his parents at the age of five and spent much of his youth in “boarding houses”. However, he supported Trump’s tough stance on immigration. “We can’t afford to support them. They’re flooding our own country and we can’t afford to take care of our elderly and children.” Others dismissed the issue. Jim Lundy of Lindstrom, Minnesota, was unconcerned about the reports about children being separated from their parents at the border. “I think it is bullshit,” said Lundy, wearing a T-shirt emblazoned with the slogan “I lived through Obama now you can live through Trump.” He added: “They are following the law. Kids are supposed to be separated from them. They are here illegally. They know it’s going to happen. I don’t understand what the problem is.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2018/jun/20/trump-family-separation-policy-reuniting-ngo-burden","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-21T12:54:31Z","webTitle":"Fate of 2,300 separated children still unclear despite Trump's executive order","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jun/20/trump-family-separation-policy-reuniting-ngo-burden","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/jun/20/trump-family-separation-policy-reuniting-ngo-burden","fields":{"headline":"Fate of 2,300 separated children still unclear despite Trump's executive order","bodyText":"Donald Trump may have signed an executive order to end the separation of families at the southern border, but his administration is not making any special efforts to immediately reunite the 2,300 children who have already been separated from their parents under his “zero tolerance” policy. The lack of action has created an additional burden for groups that provide legal and social services to immigrants, flooding non-governmental organisations (NGOs) with cases. “We would prefer the government to not separate families,” said Megan McKenna, from Kids in Need of Defense (Kind) which offers legal services to unaccompanied children. “But if that has to be the policy then they need to ensure there is a clear protocol that ensures the constant communication between the child and the parent. It’s the only humane thing to do. It’s incredible it’s not happening already.” Connecting families presents an enormous challenge because once they are detained at the border, children and parents enter two separate systems: for parents, the US Department of Homeland Security and criminal prosecution; meanwhile, children are classified as an “unaccompanied alien child” and transferred to the US Department of Health and Human Services. “We are dealing with several agencies all trying to coordinate in a disastrous way,” said Zenén Jaimes Pérez from the Texas Civil Rights Project, which provides legal counsel to immigrant families. Some parents have struggled to find their children, some of whom are being flown to shelters around the country. With no clear process in place, it’s possible some families will never be reunited. “Permanent separation. It happens,” John Sandweg, who ran the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) agency under Obama between 2013 and 2014, told NBC News. Although both parents and children are allocated A-numbers – “alien” identifiers – and case files, no government body aggregates and tracks them as a family unit. A separated child is treated by the system in exactly the same way as a child who had crossed the border without their parents. It’s left to the NGOs to put the pieces of the puzzle together. With each new child Kind deals with, it has to try and figure out their parents’ A-number and search for them on Ice’s online detainee locator system. Some of the organisation’s attorneys have tried to guess alien numbers as they can be sequential if family members were processed at the same time. Without these numbers – and the children rarely have them – they can also search by someone’s name, age and country of origin, but this relies on the details being entered by border patrol accurately. “We can also check where the child was apprehended and try to guess where the parent might be detained,” said McKenna. For parents, there is a hotline for information, but there are long wait times and it can be expensive for family members trying to call from abroad. The Texas Civil Rights Project is taking a different approach. Every day, attorneys go to the courthouse in McAllen, Texas, to speak with adults waiting to be prosecuted for illegal entry. They have up to 10 minutes to take down their personal information, including the names and ages of the children they were travelling with and their country of origin. “A lot of people have fled enormous violence,” said Jaimes Pérez. “We had a mother and an 11-year-old son who fled Guatemala after her husband was brutally murdered. They were then separated by CBP [US Customs and Border Protection].” The group sees between 30 and 40 people each day. “We don’t expect that to abate any time soon given the administration is hellbent on pursuing the zero tolerance policy,” he said. ‘A wolf in sheep’s clothing’ The executive order that purports to end family separation has not been warmly received by NGOs, particularly the part that seeks to modify a settlement agreement that ensured that children could only be detained for 20 days. The order seeks to be able to detain alien families together indefinitely. “It’s a wolf in sheep’s clothing,” said McKenna. “It would potentially end separation by allowing the government to keep children in jail-like conditions for even longer. This will continue to ensure suffering of kids and their families in a different way.” Without an end to the zero tolerance policy of criminal prosecution for every immigrant who crosses the border illegally, parents and children will continue to be separated. “If parents are still being prosecuted as criminals and put in prisons, they will be separated from their children,” said Jaimes Perèz. Family detention centres are already over capacity, despite plans to build more. “What happens in the meantime?” A bittersweet side effect to the widespread outrage has been a surge in donations and volunteers, particularly to one organisation, the Refugee and Immigrant Center for Education and Legal Services (Raices), which has raised nearly $15m in just a few days through a Facebook fundraising campaign. The not-for-profit will use these funds to expand its legal and social services for immigrants. Part of this is the launch of the “Families Together” project that aims, through a coalition of like-minded groups, to centralise data management and help organisations locate and reunite family members. Raices will also use some of the money for its bond fund to get family members released from detention."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jun/21/dear-america-we-can-teach-you-about-cruelty-to-refugees-love-australia","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-21T04:48:06Z","webTitle":"Dear America, we can teach you a few things about cruelty to refugees.

Love, Australia","bodyText":"Every time there is mass gun violence in America, Australians can be counted on to give Americans an earnest lecture on how we do it better. We got rid of guns after Port Arthur in 1996 – why can’t they just do that, and solve their gun problem? But Australia has been more subdued this week – a week when the media showed images of children separated from their parents, imprisoned in cages on the US/Mexican border. Donald Trump’s executive order to stop separations but to imprison families together is something we know how to do. Since September 2001 we have been imprisoning children indefinitely with their families and making conditions so bad in offshore centres that children as young as 10 attempt suicide. For almost 20 years, we’ve elected governments on both sides that have been creative and crafty in devising their so-called solutions (which of course are not really solutions to anyone) to asylum seekers arriving on our shore by boat. So what advice could we give the Americans on how we do “refugee solutions”? Let me count the ways. Dear America, How about you enter into commercial arrangements with impoverished island nations so that they take your refugees. And when you build the camps, how about you make them so grim and dangerous that they are often worse than the conditions people were fleeing from. Why don’t you put the refugees in a place as hot as hell, with all sorts of tropical diseases and only basic medical care. Places where there’s nothing to do and nowhere to go. Places with random outbreaks of violence, that end in murder (RIP Reza Barati). Places where it’s easy to get away with rape. Places where pregnant women can’t access abortions. Places that are almost guaranteed to send their inhabitants mad. And America, the people running the camp should be from the private sector. They should be from some security company that is not accountable in the same way a government employee is. By the way, be prepared to spend big – it costs a lot of money to treat people this badly (a 2016 report produced by Amnesty International, titled Island of Despair: Australia’s Processing of Refugees on Nauru, estimates that the operations on Nauru and Manus cost the Australian government $573,000 per person, per year). And why don’t you tell the refugees, that no matter what they do, no matter how much despair they are in, no matter how much they cut or burn or harm themselves, they will never arrive at their final destination. Why don’t you take away their hope and why don’t you deny their children an education. Why don’t you produce YouTube videos, like we do, saying: YOU WILL NOT MAKE AUSTRALIA HOME. Double down on the cruelty. It’s worked for us. Both major parties run election campaigns around being tough on refugees. It’s a race to the bottom. Your president even expressed shock at our brutality. “You are worse than I am,” he told Australian prime minister Malcolm Turnbull in 2017, when Turnbull explained Australia’s mandatory detention policy. To steal a line from Sylvia Plath: “We do it exceptionally well. We do it so it feels like hell.” But Trump is catching up to us in his rhetoric. When he says he doesn’t want the US to become a refugee holding pen, he almost sounds like an Australian politician. This line was effectively used by former Australian prime minister John Howard. Americans, feel free to borrow it: “we will decide who comes to this country and the circumstances in which they come.” Also America, you made a big mistake showing pictures of the separated children to the media. You have to hide these people! They should have no identity and no recognition. You see, if you show people their faces and their pain, an empathetic response by the public is triggered and that’s the end of your policy. It’s really hard to inflict pain on someone whose face and name you know – so just give the media the same old stock footage and blur out faces. As for the camps, no one is ever allowed to film in there, OK? And you have to threaten anyone who works with these people – say any doctors or aid workers – with jail, with a loss of their livelihood if they speak out against how the kids are treated. Because everyone knows that what’s going on is deeply shameful, but we’ve convinced ourselves that it’s better this way. Yes, America, we have so much to teach you about cruelty and brutality and violence to some of the most vulnerable people on earth. We are a small nation, but on this issue we really punch above our weight! Lots of love, Australia.

It can play hideous tricks on the brain. Here’s an unexpected World Cup statistic. With the opening seven days of Russia 2018 now done, one outfield player has run less over 90 minutes than anyone else in any position in any team. His name? Why, it’s Lionel Messi! Yes, that Messi: many people’s choice as the most gloriously talented player at his tournament; and a man consumed with a sense of voracious personal destiny that he might still drive Argentina on to win this World Cup. But only, it seems, at his own speed, and in a way that reflects both his extraordinary status within this Argentina team, and a sport that is geared more than ever toward the cult of the star. Argentina play their second Group D game against Croatia on Thursday. For now that opening fixture against Iceland stands as a genuine curiosity. Messi’s penalty miss took the headlines. But behind it are a set of numbers that sketch out a performance of bizarre and sedentary monotony. Messi ran 7.61km. Five days on this is still less than any other outfield player to complete 90 minutes. Unsurprisingly Messi has also run less without the ball than any other outfield player, less even than Kasper Schmeichel and Hugo Lloris who are, of course, goalkeepers. Run more, move more: it is an English footballing obsession, a recipe for success that has harvested precisely zero World Cups over the past 50 years. But in that time even the most gifted of World Cup winners has tended to show some degree of urgency. Against Iceland Messi made 17 sprints, half as many as Philippe Coutinho and Mesut Özil in their opening games. The word “sprint” is used advisedly here. The quickest player at the World Cup so far is Cristiano Ronaldo who clocked 34kph against Spain, perhaps while he was running off to celebrate one of his goals. Messi’s top speed is 25kph, slower than David Silva, Andrés Iniesta and even Sergio Busquets. On the flipside the things Messi did he did a lot of. These were mainly shooting and dribbling. Despite playing only one game Messi still has four more World Cup 2018 shots than the next player on the list, Denis Cheryshev. Messi is still top of the dribble charts with 15. And despite not running much, he still has more runs into the attacking third than anyone else. There are mitigating factors. This will surely be a one-off in terms of sheer degree. Argentina had an unusually large number of shots as a team and an unusually high ratio of possession. But Messi still ran than less in a whole game than his teammate Lucas Biglia in 53 minutes, and made seven more sprints than Cristian Pavón mustered in 20 minutes. It adds up to a team geared to an extraordinary degree around their star. Anyone who has watched Argentina over the last decade knows about Messi-dependence. But this felt like reductio ad absurdum, an entire game spent shooting and dribbling, portered around the pitch in his gilded sedan chair, a talent that seemed to have overwhelmed his own team. There has been a shift a little further out at this World Cup. The the climate of tearful piety around Messi is striking, with an entire hand-wringing science devoted to speculation over how to get the most out of his precious gifts. On the other hand, it is very easy to become a little blinded by possibility. This sense of unease was there in comments before the tournament by Jorge Sampaoli, who spoke about Messi in the same way others talk about Jehovah or oxygen or a mother’s love. “We’re at the point where Leo is untouchable,” Sampaoli told World Soccer magazine, insisting there was absolutely nothing about football he could teach his captain. “His vision is much more developed than ours,” Argentina’s manager concluded, going on to gush about a time Messi turned up exhausted for training, which “only empowered everyone else”. Which is fine but is it working? The idea of Messi playing free, the sun around which every other body rotates, made for a curious kind of team in Moscow, a group of otherwise exceptional footballers with their heads down, god-blinkers on, servicing the princeling. No other team play like this. The inevitable comparison – deflector shields to maximum, social media mentions muted – is with Ronaldo, who is the star to an even greater degree with Portugal. But somehow it works, helped by the fact Ronaldo plays as a centre-forward, the task for his plus-10 simply to get the ball to the golden goal-hammer. Whereas Messi in his free role is there in every move, a helicopter parent of a footballer, always intervening, a constant presence at the edge of the picture. There is, of course, a wider point here about star players and about star interference. One of the glories of international football is the enforced human variation. In the past really talented players would often spend years playing with inferior teammates, a natural stage in the climb to the top. The top players just do not do this any more, are instead whisked away to some suitably elite level at a young age. Messi has played with teammates beneath his level really only when he is with Argentina and only to any great degree in the last two years. It shows. In addition football culture at every level has a more excitable view of star players now, extension of a wider world intoxicated by celebrity, dazzled by all those brilliant moments on constant repeat. In reality there is little in football history to suggest a player such as Messi should be able to turn a moderate team into World Cup contenders. The obsession with the power of one might insist otherwise but this is not how it tends to play out. Diego Maradona is the exception, George Best the rule. Football remains, defiantly, a team sport. It is still possible Messi will emerge from his chrysalis and assert those all-time powers. He has the talent to make any dynamic work but it is also hard not to wonder what other gears Argentina could find with a little balance, reimagined as something resembling the old-fashioned, relentlessly successful notion of a team."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2018/jun/20/england-world-cup-2018-gareth-southgate-shoulder","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-20T18:21:19Z","webTitle":"England manager Gareth Southgate dislocates shoulder while running","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jun/20/england-world-cup-2018-gareth-southgate-shoulder","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/jun/20/england-world-cup-2018-gareth-southgate-shoulder","fields":{"headline":"England manager Gareth Southgate dislocates shoulder while running","bodyText":"Gareth Southgate has become the first major casualty of England’s World Cup campaign after dislocating his right shoulder while running near the team’s base on the Gulf of Finland. The England manager suffered the injury while jogging in the beach resort of Repino on Wednesday, a scheduled day off for his squad which most had used to visit family and friends in St Petersburg. Southgate was treated in a nearby hospital, with the assistance of the England team doctor, Rob Chakraverty, and said he would have to temper any fist-pumping celebrations over the remainder of the tournament. “I might not be celebrating any goals as athletically in future,” he said. “The doc has made it clear that punching the air is not an option. We have got such a great support team and they were there very quickly. They were supposed to be relaxing because we let the players have a bit of time off and I am causing them work. We are lucky we have a top-class medical team around us, so it was fine. I had brilliant help from them, and I am just sorry I managed to ruin their day off.” Southgate, his right arm in a sling, was back at the team’s training base in Repino on Wednesday evening in time to hold a scheduled meeting with his squad before dinner, looking towards Sunday’s second Group G fixture, against Panama. “It is better this is me than one of the players,” he added. “They were a bit surprised in the team meeting and were asking: ‘What have you been doing?’ As always, they were probably quite amused. It is good that we have had a quiet day today so I had prepared the meeting before and we are on to preparations for Panama. I am just a bit gutted because I was on for my record 10k time.” The manager joins Dele Alli in the treatment room – Marcus Rashford has now recovered from a knock to his knee suffered back at St George’s Park prior to departure – with the Tottenham midfielder having suffered a minor thigh strain during Monday’s opening victory over Tunisia. That injury is not serious and, while Alli may miss a few days’ training and is likely to be rested in Nizhny Novgorod on Sunday, he should be back in contention for the game against Belgium. Southgate, on the other hand, may have to be more restrained for the remainder of England’s participation in the tournament."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"global-development/2018/jun/22/should-doctors-be-free-to-refuse-patients-an-abortion-on-personal-grounds","type":"article","sectionId":"global-development","sectionName":"Global development","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-22T06:00:21Z","webTitle":"'Conscientious objection': when doctors' beliefs are a barrier to abortion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2018/jun/22/should-doctors-be-free-to-refuse-patients-an-abortion-on-personal-grounds","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2018/jun/22/should-doctors-be-free-to-refuse-patients-an-abortion-on-personal-grounds","fields":{"headline":"'Conscientious objection': when doctors' beliefs are a barrier to abortion","bodyText":"A rise in the number of healthcare providers who refuse to provide abortion services based on their personal beliefs is having a devastating impact on women and girls around the world, a new study has claimed. Over the past two decades, at least 30 countries – including, most recently, Ireland, Chile and Argentina – have taken steps to improve access to abortion through legislative changes. Many medics have sought to exempt themselves from these new laws, however. As a result, doctors, nurses, midwives, pharmacists and even entire hospitals around the world have denied women access to abortion care in countries where the procedure is legal. The report, Unconscionable: When Providers Deny Abortion Care, published by the International Women’s Health Coalition, is based on consultation with 45 experts in 22 countries, from Italy and Ghana to South Africa and Uruguay. It found that more than 70 jurisdictions have provisions allowing medics to refuse care based on their personal beliefs, a phenomenon known as “conscientious objection”. South Africa has the most liberal abortion laws in Africa, but this has not resulted in the consistent availability of abortion care and fewer than 50% of licensed facilities provide services. Unsafe abortions outnumber official procedures by two to one in the country. The Guardian spoke to two practising gynaecologists, based in Johannesburg, about conscientious objection. Dr Tlaleng Mofokeng Runs a women’s private health practice and is chairperson of the sexual and reproductive justice coalition, which campaigns for safe and legal abortion “I’ve been an abortion provider for 10 years now and most of my experience has been in the public sector and in the past four years in the private sector. While South Africa liberalised abortion in 1997, there hasn’t really been a political commitment from the leadership. Now the issue of medics refusing to give women the procedure they are requesting has increased so much that some of us feel the system itself has become an enabler of violence against women. First, it does not discipline health workers who are dishonourable in my view. Second, it doesn’t support providers in the system who are offering abortions. In South Africa, we are starting to see younger medical students coming up who are interested in studying the procedure. They are finding their medical schools, their consultants, the head of departments of obstetrics, are not helping them in the learning process. A lot of clinical training around abortion is left as an optional extra. Abortion is stigmatised by health professionals who won’t speak out and affirm the fact that women have a human right to autonomy, and that their rights should be respected. But it is further stigmatised by the system. There are instances where abortion clinics have been moved to the back of the hospital, where there is no signage to say that an abortion is something offered by core services. Because so few medical doctors and nurses are doing the procedure they find they have a lot of patients to care for on a daily basis, often unsupported by management and with lack of proper medication or stock. Sometimes procedures are delayed, so you might have a patient who comes in at four weeks or six weeks pregnant and, by the time they get an abortion, they are in their second trimester. A lot of abortion providers speak of being burned out or exhausted. People think this means we can’t do the work, or the work is too much. But what it really speaks to is the lack of support from the rest of our colleagues. So the stigma patients face, a lot of us as service providers are facing from those who do not want to offer abortions. In rural areas, if one clinic does not offer an abortion a woman might have to travel for as long as five hours just to get to the next facility, where there is no guarantee the response will be any better. Also, a lot of patients unfortunately have to deal with lifelong complications. Young women often have to have hysterectomies, because in South Africa unsafe procedures outnumber safe procedures by two to one. That is a disgrace if you look at the type of legal framework that we have. I constantly receive messages from women asking where to go to get an abortion. Some clinics shut down overnight and you never find out why. It is very frustrating for us even as civil society members who want to help, and have the technical knowledge, to actually then get in the system and start doing right by some of our patients.” Dr Murishe Ledwaba Gynaecologist and obstetrician based in Johannesburg “I qualified as doctor in 1984 and became a gynaecologist in 1995. I’m self-employed and have my own private practice in a larger clinic, working alongside other practitioners. I provide antenatal care and carry out gynaecological checkups and operations. The private clinic provides the nursing staff, but I have my own receptionist. I prescribe contraception, but I do not prescribe the morning-after pill or carry out abortions because of my religious beliefs. I cannot decide which women should have an abortion just based on what that mother feels about the baby. While the law does provide women with the right to abortion, the rules also allow conscientious objectors based on personal beliefs. So we cannot be forced to provide abortion care. If women approach me about having an abortion I talk them through their reasons. In a situation where the person has an unwanted and unplanned pregnancy, the rationale is not necessarily medical. In that moment abortion may seem like the best option to them but I will discuss with them why they want to terminate. I’ll talk them through their options and alternatives, such as adoption, and I invite them to look at the short-term and long-term consequences. In terms of the procedure, some women end up requiring blood transfusions. Others suffer damage to their uterus or cervix, or end up with an infection. The effects can be emotional as well, with some women suffering acute depression after the procedure. And there is a risk they might not be able to fall pregnant again. Patients have the right to choose but, as health providers, we also have rights. I work in a huge clinic and there are other doctors there who provide abortions. Each is an independent practitioner, so there is no overall policy at the clinic. Many women seeking a termination are not using contraception. If they are not ready, they should be taking precautions. If it was a case that there was a medical problem with the foetus, there are others who will do it. But as a Christian I don’t perform abortion under any circumstances. Legalising abortion has not done anything to stop women having backstreet abortions. You see it openly advertised everywhere. Unlike before, when these people could be penalised, there is no deterrent and services are advertised on the street. When I was training to become a gynaecologist, my senior consultant did not do abortions. So that was a blessing for me, and in our unit we did not do the full training. I attended one session where it was being demonstrated, but I said I will not be using this skill. The problem we have is that in some cases women have multiple abortions. There needs to be more done to provide information about contraception.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2018/jun/23/poor-peoples-campaign-washington-dr-king-mississippi","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-23T10:00:02Z","webTitle":"Fifty years on, the Mississippi town that sparked Dr King's poverty fight","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jun/23/poor-peoples-campaign-washington-dr-king-mississippi","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/jun/23/poor-peoples-campaign-washington-dr-king-mississippi","fields":{"headline":"Fifty years on, the Mississippi town that sparked Dr King's poverty fight","bodyText":"In May 1968, Michael Jossell watched from his front yard as dozens of wagons set out from Marks, Mississippi. They were carrying 82 people, and heading to Washington DC. The mule train, as it became known, took several weeks to reach the capital, where the passengers – each of them black and poor – joined thousands of others in setting up camp on the Washington Mall. This was the Poor People’s Campaign, a Martin Luther King-inspired effort that King envisaged as a way to draw politicians’ attention to the plight of poor people in the US – the conditions they were forced to endure, and the lack of hope that King said he had seen in people’s eyes. This Saturday, just over 50 years after the mules pulled in to Washington DC, thousands of activists will once again assemble in the capital, for the culmination of the “second phase” of the Poor People’s Campaign that began in May as a non-violent protest. Led by the charismatic Rev Dr William Barber, a North Carolinian minister emerging as a national civil rights leader, tens of thousands of people have spent the last six weeks holding demonstrations outside almost 40 statehouses. There have been hundreds of arrests. It’s a sign of increased activism and awareness in the US, but also a sign that, half a century after the first campaign, the country is still beset by inequality. King had been shocked by the poverty he had seen in Marks, located in what was then the poorest county in the poorest state in the country, and decided this should be the starting point for a campaign he hoped would kickstart change in the US. ‘We didn’t know we were poor’ Michael Jossell, now 64, was 14 when people from the Southern Christian Leadership Conference started to travel to Marks to plan the mule train. Activists would gather impoverished black people, the majority of whom worked in the cotton fields that surrounded the town, and hold lectures on social and financial inequality in the US – and what they could do to improve it. “We didn’t know we were poor,” Jossell said as he drove the Guardian around Marks, located in the fertile farming lands, historically farmed by slaves, of the Mississippi Delta, 70 miles south of Memphis, Tennessee. “We didn’t know until the light was shone on us. It took others coming in.” Jossell, who is now a pastor at the Mount Zion Missionary Baptist church in Lambert, four miles south of Marks, remembers working alongside his brothers and sisters – he is one of 10 siblings – in the fields as a child. “Everybody was basically on the same level,” Jossell said. “Nobody could laugh at anybody going to the fields because the whole town was in the fields.” In the late 1960s the lives of people in towns like Marks bore distinct similarities to the lives of black people under slavery. As a child, Jossell’s school year was tailored to working in the white-owned cotton fields. He and his classmates studied on a “split session”, where school ended in March, so the children could spend two months hacking away at weeds growing near the cotton plants. They went back to school in June and July, as the cotton grew, then were sent back out to the fields in July and August. The men, women and children wore a sack over one shoulder and picked the cotton by hand from each plant. When their sacks were full they took them to be weighed before picking more cotton. Jossell would usually make $3 a day. The land around Marks is now surrounded by lush green forest, planted in place of some of the cotton fields. But when Jossell was a boy each side of what is now the I-3 road, which runs north-south through the Mississippi Delta, were cotton fields stretching for miles. The cotton was planted in rows, the fluffy white cotton bolls emerging in late summer. A median yearly income of $41,099 Marks’s population has shrunk over the past few decades; the town’s hospital closed three or four years ago, and its main grocery store shut down a few months back. The downtown area was once bustling, Jossell said, but was now lined with empty stores with paint cracking on wooden buildings. Although the town and the surrounding Quitman county may not be as impoverished as they were, Mississippi is far from prosperous. It remains the poorest state in the country, according to the US Census Bureau, with nearly 21% of people living in poverty – the highest in the nation – while its median yearly income of $41,099 is the lowest in the nation. A 2018 study ranked Mississippi last in the US in terms of quality of education. Despite the best efforts of King and the SCLC in leading the March on Washington in 1963 and then organizing the mule train, it is hard to escape the notion that Mississippi and other places in the south are still struggling to escape their past. “The Civil Rights March [in 1963] was about rights and the Poor People’s Campaign [in 1968] was about having the means to exercise those rights,” said Dr Hilliard Lackey, a professor at Jackson State University. Lackey grew up on a plantation in Marks – his family were allowed to live in former slave accommodation as long as they worked the fields – and wrote the book Marks, Martin and the Mule Train, about the mule-driven journey to DC. “If you have the right to go to the Holiday Inn but you don’t have the money to, are you really any better off?” In 1968, Lackey had just started working at JSU. Between 1966 and 1968, Lackey described to the Guardian in the JSU’s canteen, mechanization of the cotton industry was beginning to leave black workers “totally displaced”. Some people left for cities like Chicago in the north, most of those who stayed faced extreme poverty. “That’s what Dr King saw: these people being displaced who had no money, nothing,” he said. “People were just eking out a living.” King’s trip to Marks wasn’t planned. In 1966 he was taking part in an anti-racism “Walk Against Fear” from Memphis to Jackson, Mississippi, when one of the marchers, Armistead Phipps, had a heart attack and died. Phipps was from Marks, and King travelled to the town to deliver a eulogy for Phipps at Valley Queen Baptist church, where today a sign commemorates the event. It was there that he saw the poverty black people were enduring. “He went to a pre-school classroom and the teacher said to Dr King: ‘Oh, excuse me, I’m going to have to give them their lunch’,” Lackey said. “And she took a cracker, put a slice of apple on the cracker and gave to each one. That’s their lunch. Dr King said he saw hopelessness in the eyes of children.” After his visit, which is said to have brought him to tears, King and the SCLC began to organize the mule train. “He said the mules were identified with the negro,” Lackey said. “He said if we had mules and negroes going into Washington then Congress would suddenly take note and the message would be loud and clear.” When King was assassinated on 4 April 1968, others picked up the baton and carried on the planning. Jossell, as a 14-year-old, was among those who gathered outside the jail where one of the organisers, Willie Bolden, was detained after travelling to Marks to gather support. Jossell remembers a demonstration against his arrest, and police beating teachers and children outside the jail where Bolden was being held. The mule-driven carts left Marks on 13 May, the train making its way to Atlanta before traveling on to DC. Lackey, in his first job, agonized over whether to join the train – so much so that it made him sick. “I wanted so much to be a part of that,” he said. As he agonized over whether to risk his job and go to DC, he got ulcers and was coughing up blood. In the end he decided to remain in Jackson, but has devoted much of his academic career to aiding people in Marks and elsewhere. Lackey said he sees distinct parallels between the 1968 effort and this second phase. “The first one was more about abject poverty, this is sneaky poverty,” Lackey said. “Black people used to be misused. And now we’re ignored.” Speaking about the new People’s Campaign, Lackey said: “It’s almost like we’ve been Rip van Winkle for 50 years and now we’re waking up.” Final demonstration before DC On Monday, Lackey was among the 50 activists and religious leaders who gathered at the Mississippi state capitol in Jackson, for their final demonstration before heading to DC. The event started with a prayer before a variety of activists stood at a podium to call out the conditions in Mississippi. Activists complain that education in the state is chronically underfunded, as is healthcare. Angelique Lee, who works for the Parents’ Campaign, an effort to improve public schools in the state, was among the speakers. “We are still fighting the same issues,” she told the Guardian. “It’s overt racism versus covert racism.” Despite segregation in schools having been officially ended by a supreme court decision in 1954, states in the south largely resisted integration until the Civil Rights Act passed in 1968. Even today, schools in Mississippi are still heavily split between white and black students, but Lee said it tends to be the black schools that suffer from a lack of investment. “Some things are as small as having no toilet paper, having a leaky roof, having no fresh air, no air conditioning,’ she said. After the speeches outside the capitol, the activists marched down Congress Street, towards the governor’s mansion – currently occupied by the Republican Phil Bryant. They crossed Mississippi Street singing Ain’t Gonna Let Nobody Turn Me ’Round”, a song popularized during the civil rights movement. Outside the mansion, the Mississippi state flag was unfurled. The flag features innocuous thick blue, white and red stripes running horizontally. But in the top left corner it bears the Confederate symbol. Mississippi, which has the highest percentage black population of any state, is the only state in the US to still bear it. To shouts of: “No hate in our state,” the flag was unfurled and set on fire. A Confederate flag was set alight too. “It’s burning white supremacy, burning hate,” said Danyelle Holmes, who was born in Greenwood, Mississippi and is now a national organizer with the Poor People’s Campaign. The route out, Holmes said, is through the ballot box. She sees this as a “multi-year campaign”, to organize and educate people in Mississippi and elsewhere. “We need to get people in these marginalized communities to vote,” Holmes said – to vote in politicians more willing to represent their interests. “My ultimate goal is to see Mississippi rise from being the bottom of everything that’s good in the rankings and from being the top of everything that’s bad,” Holmes said. “It’s called persistence; and when you continue to be persistent, and persevere in a fight, change doesn’t come overnight but eventually change will come.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2018/jun/21/trump-immigration-stephen-miller-doxxing-harassment","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-21T10:00:08Z","webTitle":"Is it justifiable to harass those who enforce Trump's immigration policy?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jun/21/trump-immigration-stephen-miller-doxxing-harassment","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/jun/21/trump-immigration-stephen-miller-doxxing-harassment","fields":{"headline":"Is it justifiable to harass those who enforce Trump's immigration policy?","bodyText":"Until a few months ago, Stephen Miller was just an anonymous bureaucrat in the Trump administration. However, thanks to his role as a key architect of the zero tolerance border policy, everyone now knows the political adviser’s name. What’s more, a lot of people have his personal phone number. On Wednesday, Splinter, a news site owned by Univision, published Miller’s cell phone number, stating: “The Trump administration’s policy of separating immigrant children from their families has been credited primarily to the strenuous efforts of White House adviser Stephen Miller. Perhaps you would like to call him about it.” Miller wasn’t the only person involved in Trump’s family separation policy to have his personal information publicized. Earlier this week Sam Lavigne, an artist and adjunct professor at NYU, created a database containing the LinkedIn information of over 1,500 Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) employees. Publicizing people’s personal information without their consent, typically with the aim of inconveniencing or intimidating them, is known as “doxxing”. It’s not a new practice but while it used to be largely confined to squabbles between hackers, it’s now very much in the mainstream and is becoming an increasingly common tactic used by both the left and the right. After the neo-Nazi rally in Charlottesville last year, for example, where 32-year-old Heather Heyer was killed while counter-protesting, a Twitter account called @YesYoureRacist kicked off a campaign to identify the “Nazis marching”. One of the first demonstrators to be identified was Cole White, who worked at a fast food restaurant in California. His employer, Top Dog, was bombarded by inquiries about White, who soon resigned from his job over the incident. Another marcher identified by Heather Heyer was Peter Tefft. After his outing, his father disowned him in a viral letter. “I, along with all of his siblings and his entire family, wish to loudly repudiate my son’s vile, hateful and racist rhetoric and actions,” Pearce Tefft wrote in a letter to the Forum newspaper. “We do not know specifically where he learned these beliefs. He did not learn them at home.” Leftwing proponents of doxxing argue that publicly naming and shaming neo-Nazis or people who are drumming up hatred, sends a message that that sort of behavior is socially unacceptable. During a time when the president is emboldening bigots with inflammatory rhetoric and inhumane laws, doxxing is a way of ensuring that people know that there are still consequences for unacceptable behavior. And there is certainly evidence that you can shame people into doing the right thing: the Trump administration has backtracked their family separation policy after weeks of intense criticism. We can’t know how much more personal attacks, such as doxxing, and protesters targeting the US homeland security secretary, Kirstjen Nielsen, while she was eating at a Mexican restaurant, played a role in that decision. Even if doxxing may dissuade some neo-Nazis from spewing hatred, it remains a highly dubious practice. When used by the left it’s also easy for the right to play the victim. Indeed, the release of Miller’s phone number and Sam Lavigne’s database of Ice employees has angered many on the right, who view it as harassment. Online platforms like Medium, Github and Twitter also view it as harassment, and have censored posts which link to the Ice employees information and Miller’s phone number. This, in turn, has angered many on the left, who point to double standards. Indeed, as the Splinter article itself mentions, Trump has a history of publishing the personal information of people he doesn’t like including the phone numbers of the Univision anchor Jorge Ramos and the Republican primary opponent Lindsey Graham. Doxxers also often get things wrong. In 2013 Reddit wrongly identified the Brown University student Sunil Tripathi of being the Boston Marathon bomber and his family was subject to a barrage of hate. When it was clear Tripathi had no role in the bombing, Reddit released a statement apologizing for its role in the misinformation. “Though started with noble intentions, some of the activity on Reddit fuelled online witch hunts and dangerous speculation which spiralled into very negative consequences for innocent parties,” the post stated. Tripathi was later found dead; the 22-year-old had been suffering from depression and killed himself. Triparthi is far from being the only victim of misinformation. After the Charlottesville protest Kyle Quinn, who runs a lab at the University of Arkansas dedicated to wound-healing research, was wrongly identified by internet sleuths as a participant in the rightwing rally. He was inundated with angry comments and his home address was posted on social networks."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/jun/20/police-england-fans-russia-nazi-salute-world-cup","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-20T16:54:20Z","webTitle":"Police investigate video showing England fans making Nazi salutes","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jun/20/police-england-fans-russia-nazi-salute-world-cup","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/jun/20/police-england-fans-russia-nazi-salute-world-cup","fields":{"headline":"Police investigate video showing England fans making Nazi salutes","bodyText":"British police are working with the Football Association to investigate a video that has surfaced online apparently showing England fans at the World Cup in Russia performing Nazi salutes. The video shows two fans performing a Nazi salute and singing a fascist chant while in a bar. The establishment closely resembles one in Volgograd, where England played Tunisia on Monday. England fans had previously been warned not to hang St George’s flags on monuments in the city – formerly known as Stalingrad – and to be respectful of the fact that it is the site of one of the most brutal battles of the second world war. Deputy chief constable Mark Roberts, the head of British football policing, presides over a team of spotters who are charged with identifying problematic and criminal behaviour by travelling fans. The spotters are aware of the bar where the video is thought to have been filmed and are investigating. One of the fans in the video was seen on the streets of Volgograd before the game looking inebriated. An FA spokesperson said: “We strongly condemn the actions of the people in this video. We are working with the relevant authorities, including the UK police investigations team, who are making inquiries to identify the individuals involved and take appropriate action. The disgraceful conduct of the individuals in this video does not represent the values of the majority of English football fans supporting the team in Russia.” The bar in the video appeared similar to one in Volgograd called Gallery Pub, which had hosted England fans on the evening of the match according to photographs posted on social media. The placement of furniture, televisions, menu items, and scarves and flags around the bar, including a local FC Rotor scarf over a plasma screen, matched the video with the British fans singing. “And now the fiery British are with us! The entire pub is shaking from their singing!” an account tied to the pub posted on Instagram, alongside a photograph of British and Russian fans. A person who answered the phone at the pub hung up twice on a reporter from the Guardian when asked about whether the incident had taken place there. “This type of behaviour shows absolute ignorance of history, is insensitive and can be prosecuted under Russian law,” said Piara Powar, head of Fare, which monitors far-right and discriminatory behaviour in football. The overwhelming atmosphere in Volgograd was one of good-natured mingling, with most England fans praising the friendliness of their hosts and reporting that Russians had gone out of their way to show them around the city, and provide help and advice. Equally, there was a sense that the travelling support was being careful not to behave antagonistically. On the morning of the match, Greg Clarke, the chairman of the FA, and the deputy British ambassador to Russia joined fans in a wreath-laying ceremony at Volgograd’s main war memorial. In the early hours of Tuesday morning in an English pub in central Volgograd, a Guardian reporter heard three young Russian men sing a chant involving the words “Hitlerjugend SS”, apparently a common chant among far-right football supporters in Russia and Ukraine. Elsewhere in the pub, England and Tunisia fans were drinking together with locals amid a party atmosphere."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jun/20/labour-break-endless-brexit-deadlock","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-20T17:24:07Z","webTitle":"Labour must do its bit to break this endless Brexit deadlock | Gaby Hinsliff","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/20/labour-break-endless-brexit-deadlock","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/20/labour-break-endless-brexit-deadlock","fields":{"headline":"Labour must do its bit to break this endless Brexit deadlock","bodyText":"It has always been about control. Sweep aside all the baffling language, the arcane procedure, the boring technicalities of Brexit’s long and painful grind through parliament; it all comes down to the one thing Vote Leave understood with absolute clarity: that control is what matters. Brexit was originally about who has control over borders, money and decision-making, but it’s increasingly about who controls the controllers, and that’s what Wednesday’s vote was really about. Are the people in charge, and politicians just their servants, or are those servants entitled to say something when the people seem hellbent on shooting themselves in the foot? Is the prime minister in charge of her own negotiating strategy, or is she the prisoner of a warring party and a tiny majority? And who controls what happens if she fails and can’t get a Brexit deal, or gets one parliament won’t accept? Asking that question isn’t about subverting the “will of the people”, since in the event of a cataclysmic negotiating failure that will would be unclear; if leavers were presented with a Brexit that doesn’t remotely resemble what they were promised, it’s unlikely they would unite as one in response. Some would still want to leave, regardless, while others might want to go back to the negotiating table, or even retreat. Without a clear mandate, it would be for MPs to do what we elected them to do in the first place, namely use their best judgment in the national interest. Wednesday’s showdown in the Commons was really about who programmes the Maybot, in the event of serious malfunction; whether parliament would take charge, or whether yet again we’d all be at the mercy of the internal politics of the Conservative party. And after a week-long game of chicken, it was the Tory rebels who blinked first. Dominic Grieve withdrew his amendment, that would have given MPs the power to block a “no deal” Brexit, accepting May’s assurances that parliament would have a meaningful vote on it despite widespread scepticism on the Labour benches; although six of his fellow rebels held out, that wasn’t enough. Thus has last week’s hasty fudge, which put the row off for a week, hardened into a fudge that could last for months. As he backed down, Grieve issued a characteristically polite rebuke over the current climate of hysteria over Brexit. The death threats, vilification and bullying simply made both sides dig in, he observed. People are afraid to compromise for fear of everyone crowing that they’ve lost a battle, when it shouldn’t be about losing and winning; it should be about doing the right thing. He’s right, of course. And yet it expresses remainers’ problem in a nutshell; they are so endlessly reasonable, up against people who are beyond reasoning with. For hardline Brexiters (including some Lexiters), it really is about losing and winning, so much so that they’d rather crash out of the EU without a deal, regardless of what that unleashes, than back down. Remainers, however, tend by temperament, as well as ideology, to moderation. They’re uncomfortable going right to the wire, inclined to seek consensus, respectful of the feelings of people who disagree. The Tory rebels wanted to believe May last week, when she told them that she was listening, only for No 10 to row back, and they still want to believe her. So what now? The failure of the Grieve amendment doesn’t in practice put “no deal” back on the table, because the cabinet has peered over that particular abyss and shuddered. But it does turn a spotlight back on Labour. There is almost certainly a parliamentary majority for a soft Brexit, and a mandate in the country for a Brexit that doesn’t hurt. But it’s clear that will not be achieved by leaving it to a few agonised Tory rebels, and still less by Corbyn loyalists furiously slagging off anyone on the Labour side trying to bring about a soft Brexit, whether it’s centrist MPs or the People’s Vote movement (currently under suspiciously concerted attack from Corbyn outriders). Rather than carping at what they’re getting wrong – and there is plenty they’re getting wrong – Corbynites should bring their own undoubted campaigning skills to the table, recognising that this is the one cause that should trump all other grievances and ideological differences because of the risk a bad Brexit poses to Labour’s own programme for government. It’s time for the broader Labour movement to do what it did in many places on the ground during the last election, but could not do during the referendum, and unite against a common enemy. You could even call it taking back control. • Gaby Hinsliff is a Guardian columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jun/20/the-guardian-view-on-the-gosport-hospital-deaths-the-families-vindicated-at-last","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-20T17:20:31Z","webTitle":"The Guardian view on the Gosport hospital deaths: the families vindicated at last | Editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/20/the-guardian-view-on-the-gosport-hospital-deaths-the-families-vindicated-at-last","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/20/the-guardian-view-on-the-gosport-hospital-deaths-the-families-vindicated-at-last","fields":{"headline":"The Guardian view on the Gosport hospital deaths: the families vindicated at last","bodyText":"At long last, relatives of hundreds who died in the Gosport War Memorial hospital in the 1990s have had some answers, thanks to an inquiry chaired by the Right Rev James Jones. The former bishop of Liverpool, who also chaired the Hillsborough panel, was initially in touch with eight families, and ended up in contact with 100. His report now concludes, shockingly, that more than 450 lives were shortened unnecessarily after they were given inappropriate doses of opioids. The drugs were administered using a syringe driver, normally reserved for pain relief for those at the very end of life. These patients were frail, elderly and sick – but had every hope of recovery. That possible future was taken from them. One of the most distressing elements of the case is that concerns were raised by nurses as long ago as 1991, but the hospital authorities chose not to act. When relatives began to make complaints, they were often treated with disdain, brushed off as irritants. The Gosport families have shown extraordinary bravery, despite years of obfuscation and inaction, despite the sense that the establishment had closed ranks to protect their own people and institutions – a complex, interleaved collection of bodies including the hospital itself, the Hampshire constabulary, the Crown Prosecution Service, the General Medical Council and the General Nursing Council. The name of one doctor in particular is destined to be associated with Gosport: Dr Jane Barton, a GP, who oversaw the prescription of the fatal drugs. A GMC investigation, which took place only in 2009, found her guilty of serious professional misconduct but did not strike her off. She is now retired. As the Gosport report’s findings are absorbed, and as understandable anger is aired, it would be tempting to focus a desire for justice solely on her. While it is clear that individuals must face the consequences of their actions, it is also the case that Dr Barton was relatively junior. Senior colleagues were aware of her actions. Fresh police investigations seem likely and the case of Gosport may, in due course, turn out to justify charges of corporate manslaughter. One purpose of an inquiry such as this is to prevent the repetition of past mistakes. In the period under scrutiny – 1987 to 2001 – patient safety was much less of an urgent priority. There was still a culture of deference towards supposedly omniscient consultants. This has transformed, not least in the wake of the Mid Staffordshire scandal. Hospitals are now regularly inspected, there are ways for whistleblowers to raise concerns, and patients are better able to make complaints. The system is surely imperfect, but vastly improved. The greatest threat to patient safety now is understaffing. NHS Improvement, which oversees hospital trusts, recently reported that 93,000 posts are unfilled in English hospitals – including nearly 36,000 nursing positions and nearly 10,000 for doctors. It is this lack of staff, partly a result of too few university places and partly a result of clinicians quitting jobs that leave them disillusioned, that must be addressed. The task of keeping patients safe and clinicians accountable is constantly evolving. An enduring lesson from Gosport is that the will of bereaved families to understand what happened to their loved ones is stronger than the capacity of any bureaucracy to obscure the truth. The Gosport families bore a lonely burden, as the Right Rev James Jones has made plain. They persisted despite every attempt to silence them, because they instinctively knew justice was on their side. And now, at last, they are vindicated."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/jun/20/two-tottenham-tower-blocks-at-risk-of-catastrophic-collapse","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-20T18:32:06Z","webTitle":"Two Tottenham housing blocks at risk of catastrophic collapse","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jun/20/two-tottenham-tower-blocks-at-risk-of-catastrophic-collapse","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/jun/20/two-tottenham-tower-blocks-at-risk-of-catastrophic-collapse","fields":{"headline":"Two Tottenham housing blocks at risk of catastrophic collapse","bodyText":"More than 200 homes on the Broadwater Farm estate in north London are at risk of catastrophic collapse and all the families are to be urgently moved out following tests carried out in the wake of the Grenfell Tower disaster. Two residential blocks, which were completed in the early 1970s are among 11 buildings on the Tottenham estate that failed structural tests, are the most seriously affected and are likely to be demolished. The tests uncovered serious structural failings, which make the homes vulnerable to collapse in the event a gas pipe or gas canister explodes or a vehicle strikes the base of the buildings. Tangmere House, a six-storey block, and Northholt, an 18-storey block, are those worst affected. The estate was the scene of riots in 1985 and its blocks were built using the same large-panel system used on Ronan Point, where a gas explosion in 1968 caused progressive collapse, killing four people. The type of tests the buildings failed were initiated following that disaster but the problems at Broadwater Farm were only uncovered in the last 12 months. “Neither Tangmere nor Northolt can remain occupied long-term as they are in their current structural state,” the London Borough of Haringey said in a report into the problems. “The presence of piped gas in Tangmere continues to pose a health and safety risk to residents. Tangmere failed structural tests, which means there is a risk of progressive collapse from an explosion caused by piped gas or from an explosion from a lower impact event such as a vehicle strike or bottled gas explosion.” The gas company Cadent has said it must disconnect the gas main in October which means the rehousing must be started now. Some residents reacted with anger to the news as they faced the prospect of being thrown out of homes they have lived in for decades. “It’s disgusting and it is very stressful,” said one woman who has lived in the same flat in Tangmere for 38 years. “Ain’t it funny this has just come out after Grenfell?” She had just come from the housing office, and said: “They said they will find us a place to stay and you will have to take it. That’s wrong.” Nicky Erar, 46, a mother of two, said: “These blocks must have been dangerous for many years. It is quite scary that it is not safe. We worry about it at night.” A mother in the same block said: “We don’t know where they are going to rehouse us. But at least they are moving us. Who wants what happened in Grenfell to happen to their loved ones? ” Other residents reacted sceptically to the council’s claim that new council houses will be built voicing fears the site might be sold off to private developers, although there is no evidence that is the case. The council said: “There will be a consultation but the council’s preferred option is to demolish the blocks and replace them with high quality, new council homes built on the estate.” It said it wants to start to re-house residents of Tangmere “now, so that there is sufficient time to rehouse residents before the end-of-October deadline”. The council has estimated that it will cost around £28m to strengthen the two buildings so it prefers to demolish them. The council’s housing arm, Homes for Haringey, is undertaking home visits to every property in both blocks to check for the presence of both bottled gas and oxygen cylinders. Concierges are stationed on the doors to flats 24 hours a day to prevent residents bringing in such items. In a letter to residents the landlord said: “We understand that moving will cause you disruption; which is why we are committed to working closely with you to find a home permanently or temporarily that suits your needs.” Not everyone was upset to be leaving. Barry, 17, who has lived with his family in the estate for seven years, said: “I am happy to leave if they give us a new house in a better area. This is where the 2011 riots started. It is in a bad state. No one cares about this place.” Emina Ibrahim, Haringey’s cabinet member responsible for housing, said: “We understand that residents on Broadwater Farm – particularly those in Tangmere and Northolt blocks – will have questions and concerns. We are committed to providing a safe, decent and affordable home for everyone and I want to assure all affected residents that we will carefully consider all of the issues, and that any decision we take will be with primary consideration for the safety, aspirations and rights of our tenants. “A decision on the long-term future of these blocks will only be taken following proper consultation with residents. Our residents are our absolute priority and I would encourage anyone with questions to contact the dedicated Homes for Haringey team that has been set up on the estate.” Nine other blocks on the estate with piped gas failed tests at a higher threshold in December, so gas cookers have been replaced with electric cookers in all those 725 flats and gas interrupter valves have been installed which will switch off the gas if a leak is detected."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/live/2018/jun/21/argentina-v-croatia-world-cup-2018-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-21T20:15:12Z","webTitle":"World Cup 2018: Argentina 0-3 Croatia – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2018/jun/21/argentina-v-croatia-world-cup-2018-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/live/2018/jun/21/argentina-v-croatia-world-cup-2018-live","fields":{"headline":"World Cup 2018: Argentina 0-3 Croatia – as it happened","bodyText":"And that’s your lot. Croatia have made it to the knockout phase with a game to spare, and have sent out a signal that they’re a team to take very seriously indeed. Argentina by contrast are in all sorts of trouble. Their game against Nigeria promises to be huge. Lionel Messi’s last chance to join the World Cup pantheon is looking a long shot right now. Congratulations to Croatia, commiserations to Argentina. Night night! Argentina Are Not Alone dept. And here’s our man Paul MacInnes, rating the first week’s winners and losers. A good one for Denis Cheryshev and Mr CR7, not so great for Mo Salah and Neymar. Here’s the hot take on tonight’s action. Stuart James’s match report from Nizhny Novgorod will follow soon. Expect the comments section to tick over nicely this evening. Croatia are ecstatic. They go to their fans in celebration. They deserve the right to cavort. That’s the team performance of the World Cup so far. With Modric and Rakitic in such good form, and assisted by the likes of Perisic, Mandzukic, Kramaric and Rebic, they could go very deep in this competition. Argentina by comparison ... oh dear. They were dreadful from front to back. Caballero suffered a nightmare of Karius proportions, while Messi was a total non-event. They now need to beat Nigeria in their last game to have any chance of progressing to the next round, and even then their fate won’t be in their own hands. Their fans are accordingly miserable. Croatia are deservedly through to the last 16 of the World Cup! They were as magnificent tonight as Argentina were abject. Messi stomps off with a face on; his dream of winning this World Cup is now hanging by a thread. 90 min +3: Corluka comes on for Mandzukic, and is almost immediately booked for a late tackle. 90 min +2: A look around the stadium, and the blood has drained from a lot of the Argentinian faces. The players look utterly stunned. Croatia deal with the set piece, and romp up the other end. Rakitic blazes down the middle. His shot is parried brilliantly by Caballero, but the ball breaks to Kovacic on the left. Kovacic simply rolls the ball back to Rakitic, who slams the ball into the bottom left. This is now a humiliation for the two-time winners and 2014 finalists. 90 min: Messi makes a little bit of space to the right of the Croatia box, and slips the ball inside for Meza, who drops a shoulder, then again, and again, as he embarks on a George Best-style dribble across the face of the area. His eventual shot is blocked for a corner. From which ... 89 min: Modric has another look from distance. Not this time. “If you watched this game knowing nothing about the players and were told one of the world’s best players was on the pitch, you’d never say it was Messi,” writes Brad Wilson. “You’d say it was Luka Modric.” 87 min: Acuna is booked for treading on Vrsaljko’s toes. It’s fair to say this match has had something of an edge. It’s been brilliant to watch, unless you support Argentina of course. 86 min: Rakitic is inches away from taking perfect revenge on Otamendi and Argentina. He whips the resulting free kick, 25 yards out, over the wall and towards the top left. It’s a stunner, but it slams off the crossbar and away. Caballero was stranded. 85 min: Wahey! It all kicks off! Rakitic is bundled over by Mascherano. It’s a foul, no question. Otamendi comes in and kicks the ball at the prone midfielder’s head. That’s a dismal act. He’s booked, and is fortunate to stay on the pitch. For a second it looks as though the match is about to degenerate into a bench-emptying brawl, but it cools down very quickly. 84 min: Higuain has a crack from a position just to the left of the D. Subasic gathers easily. 83 min: Meza hooks the ball into the mixer. It’s headed clear with ease. Argentina have been little short of appalling. Croatia have been extremely impressive, mind you. Another run to the semis? Even further than 1998? With the midfield talent they boast, anything is possible. 82 min: Perisic is replaced by Kovacic, whose first act is to concede a free kick out on the right. This is as sensational as the first goal was farcical! Modric picks up possession 25 yards out. He drops a shoulder to confuse Otamendi, shifts the ball a little to the right, and curls an unstoppable shot into the top right! Upfield, Messi drops his head slowly and sadly. 80 min: Rakitic and Kramaric combine nicely down the left. Rakitic eventually has a dig from the edge of the box. Tagliafico does well to block. Then there’s another phase of attack. And then ... 78 min: Pavon busts down the left and nearly breaks clear, but Lovren tackles him well. Corner. Pavon takes it himself, but it’s cleared at the near post by Kramaric. “I feel for Messi. The GOAT tag weighs heavily on his shoulders. I also feel for Caballero. Unless his teammates can put the ball in the net soon, he’ll be the goat.” Peter Oh, ladies and gentlemen. He’s here all week. Try the borscht. 76 min: Rakitic goes down in the centre circle, winded. The referee stops the play with Argentina on the attack. Argentina are rightly annoyed, and surround the ref, but it’s done now. 74 min: Messi has a moan at the referee, waving his arms about in frustration over very little. He’s on a rolling boil right now. 73 min: Mandzukic brushes past Mascherano down the right and romps goalwards. He crosses into the centre. Otamendi and Mercado confuse each other, and the ball deflects to Kramaric, who is closed down by Cabellero to the left of goal. He’s got options in the middle, but opts to beat Cabellero himself. And doesn’t. A waste. 71 min: Dybala cuts in from the right and looks to curl one into the top left. It’s a wild effort, but at least it’s something. 70 min: Modric stumbles through a few challenges in the middle, keeps his balance in astonishing fashion, and flicks Kramaric free down the left. That was sensational play. Kramaric reaches the byline and comes very close to finding Mandzukic in the centre with a pullback. Not quite. Modric is such a wonderful player to watch. A glorious mix of steely determination and pretty skill. 68 min: The last roll of the dice for Argentina: Dybala comes on in place of Perez. 67 min: Vrsaljko is booked for a late slide on Acuna. 66 min: Croatia nearly extend their lead. Rakitic scoops a pass wide right for Vrsaljko, who slips a ball inside for Mandzukic, on the corner of the six-yard area. It’s a lovely slick move. Caballero isn’t an imposing figure here, and there’s space at the near post. Mandzukic tries to flick home, but only flaps the ball into the side netting. 64 min: From the set piece, Otamendi sends a header over the bar. Argentina have stepped it up since going behind. 63 min: Higuain is sent bombing towards the byline on the left by Perez. He pulls it back for Meza, who surely must score from six yards! He sidefoots towards the bottom left. Subasic palms the ball out, though he tried his best to palm it into the net. Rakitic slides in to poke the ball out for a corner. 61 min: Messi picks up the pace with a speed dribble, his first serious contribution of the evening. He nearly sets Higuain free down the right, but the move peters out. Much better, though, from both Messi and Argentina. “Give Zafar Sobhan a cigar,” writes Sam Hankins. “He called it exactly!” Yep. You’ve gotta love our readership. 59 min: Mandzukic is booked for a late lunge on Meza. In the stand, Diego Maradona chomps on his nails. 57 min: The entire stadium seems shocked at the nature of that howler. Shades of the atmosphere at the Champions League final after Loris Karius’s error. They replace Salvio with Pavon. Croatia meanwhile swap the injured goalscorer Rebic with Kramaric. 55 min: Argentina respond by taking off Aguero and sending Higuain on. Perisic goes at Argentina down the right, winning a corner, but the set piece comes to nothing. What an absurd error by Willy Caballero! Dealing with a simple backpass, he tries to chip a pass wide right to Mercado. But he doesn’t get enough on it, simply teeing it up in mid-air for Rebic, who meets it first time with a screaming volley into the top right! Oh Willy! 53 min: Messi drifts in from the right and feeds Tagliafico, who slips a pass down the inside left for Aguero. A shot from a tight angle, but it’s easily gathered by Subasic. Then Croatia go straight up the other end and ... 51 min: Modric sweeps a pass out left for Rebic, who tears down the wing in great style, sashaying past a couple of challenges. Then he’s taken out by Mercado, who sticks a leg across his knees. Hilariously old-school. He’s booked, and doesn’t bother complaining. 50 min: Vrsaljko and Acuna squabble on the touchline over a throw. Perisic romps down the right but his cross is easily dealt with. This is scrappy right now. 49 min: Hesitation from Lovren, followed by confusion between Brozovic and Vida. Croatia do not convince at the back. Aguero nearly takes advantage, but the ball clanks out of play. Another phase, and Acuna has a whack from distance, but Lovren blocks well this time. “Messi to me is blameless as he is forced by vice and not virtue of this humdrum Argentine XI to not just be himself, he has to be Iniesta as well,” opines Hubert O’Hearn. “His career cannot be judged on a World Cup. Football is a team sport. One that frames its greatest players, but a frame made of shirt cardboard is not gilt gold.” 47 min: Both teams take turns to have a little feel of the ball, re-familiarising themselves with it. A slow start to the second half, in other words. Here’s Zafar Sobhan: “This game will be decided by a grotesque defensive error. Only thing that remains to be seen is by whom. Not the boldest of predictions I know, sorry.” And we’re off again! No half-time changes by either team. Argentina get the party restarted. They’ll be hoping to bring it up a notch or two. Messi only touched the ball 20 times in that first half; Aguero just seven. “It seems telling that Croatia’s key player, Modric, is a passing play maker, whereas Argentina’s key player, Messi, is more of a dribbler,” begins David Wall. “So when Modric plays well it means Croatia play well. But when Messi plays well it means that Messi plays well. That may in itself decide a game, but it doesn’t really make the team as a whole convince. Perhaps the manager should just tell him to get over the idea of trying to win it himself, and instead base their play on the abilities of all eleven, with Messi as an exceptional component of that.” Half-time reading: The action from earlier, in case you’re just in from work, or whatever it is they say on the telly ... It’s goalless, but very intriguing. Both teams should have scored; both teams could easily have had a man sent off. Messi has done nothing. The second half promises to be quite the event. 45 min +2: Modric sends Rebic clear down the left with a glorious diagonal pass. But Rebic lets the ball get stuck under his feet. He’s forced to check back, then attempt a curler into the top right, which he gets all wrong. 45 min: There will be two added minutes. This half has flown by. 44 min: Tackles continue to fly in. Meza stands on Vrsaljko’s ankle. That’s a really bad one as well. Again, VAR checks it and decides there’s no need to escalate things. 42 min: Brozovic, out on the right, crosses long for Rebic, who can’t quite get the ball under control immediately. He tangles again with Salvio, who stumbles. Suddenly Rebic has space on the left flank, but the referee blows for a generous free kick. Argentina got away with that one. 40 min: Rebic is booked for planting his studs on Salvio’s shin. It was a nasty one, it should have been a red card. Though it’s been checked by the VAR, and it’s not considered a clear and obvious error. 38 min: Tagliafico makes good down the left, but sends a harmless looping cross into the arms of Subasic. To be fair, he hardly had a man to aim for in the Croatian box. Argentina strangely non-committal. 36 min: Mercado is down getting some treatment, after being winded in an aerial 50-50 duel with Rebic. He took a knee in the chest, though it looked accidental, both players going for the ball in the no-nonsense style. 34 min: Salvio nips past Strinic and gets an arm in the mush for his trouble. The Croatian defender is slightly lucky to get away without a booking, but this referee is good-humoured and lenient. And to be fair, we’ve hardly noticed him. Speaking of which ... “There’s nothing wrong with Messi’s involvement in this game that the immediate Argentinian recruitment of the other 10 Barcelona first team wouldn’t fix,” writes Charles Antaki, who may or may not be trying to start an argument just for the sheer hell of it. 32 min: Vida sees his clearance charged down by Messi, but the ball makes it back to Subasic. Croatia go up the other end and nearly score: Vrsaljko curls a glorious cross into the box from the right. On the left-hand corner of the six-yard box, Mandzukic is free! But he stoops and sends his point-blank header wide left! What a miss! That’s one apiece now. How/why is this still 0-0?! 30 min: So having said that, there goes that shape! Lovren hesitates and falls over, allowing Salvio to nick the ball off him. He’s free in the box, but facing a tight angle on the left. He pulls back for Perez, who faces an empty net, Subasic having gone walkabout. He must score, but sends his first-time slapshot wide left of goal! 29 min: Argentina are beginning to push Croatia back, their first period of genuine dominance in the match. No way through yet, though, as the men in black keep their shape. 27 min: Meza whips the corner straight into the side netting. What a waste. What a run by Aguero, mind: the most dangerous Argentina have looked so far. 26 min: Aguero runs at Croatia down the left. His power dribble sends Vida into a backtracking panic. He reaches the byline and chips inside, but Strinic steps in to head behind for a corner. 24 min: Rebic spins on a sixpence to make himself some space on the right, then feeds the overlapping Vrsaljko. The full back clumps the ball too far ahead of himself, and the danger’s over, but for a split second there Argentina looked very exposed. 22 min: Space for Acuna out on the left. He crosses, overhits it, and the ball twangs the top of the Croatian crossbar! A mishit outswinger, it was never threatening to actually creep into the net. 20 min: More Argentinian nerves on display, as Tagliafico nearly gives up possession on the edge of his own area. The referee generously blows for a free kick, there having been contact with Mandzukic. It’s just as well for Argentina, because Modric was onto the loose ball, and would have been one on one with Caballero. 19 min: This is hotting up quite nicely. Perez is shoved over by Brozovic, but doesn’t get the free kick; Mascherano bowls Modric to the floor and he’s penalised. Argentina surround the referee in the indignant style. The ref performs the international mime for dive, and grins. 18 min: Another period of sterile Argentinian possession ends when Otamendi needlessly passes the ball out of play in the middle in a show of nerves. 16 min: Rakitic and Perez slide in for a 50-50 in the midfield. Rakitic comes off worse. It’s a foul, but not a terrible challenge. After frowning quite a lot, Rakitic eventually gets up. Happily, both players are good to continue. 15 min: Argentina pass it around quite a lot in the middle, but don’t really go anywhere. Croatia are still buzzing around at speed, closing down all the space. 13 min: Meza races down the right and pulls the ball back for Salvio, whose shot from the penalty spot is deflected over the bar by Lovren. The resulting corner is wasted. But this is lovely and open, and surely won’t end goalless. 12 min: But Argentina aren’t too shabby going forward either. Perez chips a cute pass down the inside-left channel, and Messi nearly meets the ball dropping over his shoulder, Jamie Vardy style. But not quite. 10 min: Modric really looks in the mood tonight. He’s beginning to dictate the play. He tees the ball up for Rakitic on the edge of the Argentina area. Rakitic loops diagonally for Vrsaljko, who has sprung the trap on the right! But his sidefooted volley, meant as a pass for Manzukic in the middle, is weak and intercepted. A pretty move, though, and Croatia are looking very tidy indeed up front. 9 min: Tagliafico is slightly fortunate not to go in the book after standing on the foot of Mandzukic in the centre circle. Just a ticking off from the referee. 8 min: A throw to Argentina deep in Croatian territory down the right. But they’re pressed all the way back to the halfway line. This is a busy, brisk, open game, and Croatia look very sharp. 6 min: Modric’s corner is dealt with easily enough by Argentina. But the ball’s quickly coming back at Argentina, and another long pass is launched down the left in the hope of releasing Perisic again. The winger’s in a ludicrous amount of space once more, but this time he’s gone too early and the flag goes up for offside. 5 min: Argentina go to sleep at the back, and Perisic is allowed to race into acres down the inside-left channel. He enters the box and looks for the bottom right. His shot is on target, but Caballero fingertips spectacularly out for a corner. That’s a fine save, and nearly a dream start for Croatia! 4 min: Both sets of fans are giving it plenty. They know there’s a lot on this match. Not least because the runner up in this group is likely to play France in the next round. 2 min: There’s a cracking atmosphere in the stadium. And nearly an early chance for Argentina, as Otamendi rakes a pass down the right in the hope of releasing Salvio. He’s not far from making it, but the ball flies out for a goal kick with Croatia very light at the back. And we’re off! Croatia get the party started. “As an Icelander I’ve seen a lot of teams play Iceland in the last few years,” begins Kári Tulinius. “I thought Argentina played very well, better than Croatia did last time, certainly. The Icelandic team is very difficult to play against and had Messi converted that penalty they would’ve won. I’m expecting Argentina to win tonight.” The teams are out! Argentina are in their famous blue-and-white-striped shirts, while Croatia sport their second-choice black check. As the anthems play, Messi rubs his forehead while wearing an extremely pained expression, almost as though the pressure of carrying half the world’s hopes and dreams is wearing him down. We’ll be off in a minute! “If you’re going to post a Croatia-themed Seinfeld clip it’s only sporting to provide one for their South American rivals as well (and impugn an entire continent in the process),” adds Jerry Parks. These two countries have only met once at the World Cup. That was back in 1998, the year Croatia were 43 minutes away from the final. It wasn’t much of a match, because both teams had already qualified from Group H: Ariel Ortega set up Mauricio Pineda for the only goal. Outside of the finals, it’s one win each and a draw. Good luck calling this, then. The national anthems: The Himno Nacional Argentino is a stately affair, which threatens once or twice to turn into the theme tune to Van der Valk, but doesn’t. ♭♮♯ May the laurels be eternal / that we were able to achieve / Let us live crowned in glory / O let us swear to die with glory ♭♮♯ The Croatian number, Lijepa naša domovino, is even grander, proceeding at such ceremonial pace that it threatens to grind to a halt once or twice, but never does. ♭♮♯ Our beautiful homeland / O so fearless and gracious / Our fathers’ ancient glory / May you be happy forever ♭♮♯ While we’re on the subject of Menotti ... here’s a short story about the man, courtesy of everyone’s favourite football periodical, The Blizzard. Pre-match playtime. Before this World Cup started, we asked Juan Sebastián Verón to pick an all-time World Cup XI to represent Argentina. Here’s what he came up with. And now you can do the same, channelling your inner César Luis Menotti to your heart’s content! Oh yes! Croatia make one change to the starting XI sent out against Nigeria. In comes Marcelo Brozovic of Internazionale; out goes Andrej Kramaric of Hoffenheim. Argentina make three changes to their team, though, after the disappointing draw with Iceland. Sporting Lisbon’s Marcos Acuna, River Plate’s Enzo Perez and Sevilla’s Gabriel Mercado replace PSG’s Angel Di Maria, Milan’s Lucas Biglia and Manchester United’s Marcos Rojo. Argentina: Caballero, Mercado, Otamendi, Tagliafico, Salvio, Mascherano, Perez, Acuna, Messi, Aguero, Meza. Subs: Guzman, Ansaldi, Biglia, Fazio, Banega, Higuain, Di Maria, Rojo, Lo Celso, Dybala, Pavon, Armani. Croatia: Subasic, Vrsaljko, Lovren, Vida, Strinic, Rakitic, Brozovic, Rebic, Modric, Perisic, Mandzukic. Subs: Livakovic, Corluka, Kovacic, Kramaric, Jedvaj, Bradaric, Caleta-Car, Badelj, Pjaca, Pivaric, Nikola Kalinic, Lovre Kalinic. Referee: Ravshan Irmatov (Uzbekistan). Argentina went into this tournament as one of the favourites to win the whole shebang. Hey, if you’ve got Lionel Messi in your side, it’s not the wildest notion. But if, for a while, it became easy to forget how they scraped through qualifying, their turgid performance against Iceland served as a sharp reminder that this isn’t the greatest vintage of the Albiceleste. Suddenly you wonder: the two-time winners and five-time finalists couldn’t crash out in the groups, could they? There’d be a fair chance of that happening if they don’t do the business against Croatia tonight. The Croats eased past the much-heralded Nigerians in their opening game, and any team with Luka Modrić pulling the strings is going to pose problems. Especially if you’ve got a rickety defence. So, this is potentially highly interesting, the first case of big-team jeopardy at the 2018 World Cup. Both of these teams look their happiest when going forward. Accordingly, you’d think both will go in search of the win: Croatia because they’ll qualify for the next round with one, Argentina because they kind of need it. Should be a cracker, then. It’s on! Kick off: 7pm BST, 9pm at the Nizhny Novgorod Stadium."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"culture/ng-interactive/2018/jun/24/simone-lia-on-life-on-the-road","type":"interactive","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-24T07:00:22Z","webTitle":"Simone Lia on life on the road","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/ng-interactive/2018/jun/24/simone-lia-on-life-on-the-road","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/ng-interactive/2018/jun/24/simone-lia-on-life-on-the-road","fields":{"headline":"Simone Lia on life on the road","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"culture/2018/jun/21/samantha-bee-trump-executive-order-not-a-solution-not-new-and-not-legal","type":"article","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-21T14:09:35Z","webTitle":"Sam Bee calls Trump's executive order 'not a solution, not new, and not legal'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2018/jun/21/samantha-bee-trump-executive-order-not-a-solution-not-new-and-not-legal","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/2018/jun/21/samantha-bee-trump-executive-order-not-a-solution-not-new-and-not-legal","fields":{"headline":"Sam Bee calls Trump's executive order 'not a solution, not new, and not legal'","bodyText":"Late-night hosts on Wednesday addressed the backlash to Donald Trump’s policy of separating children from their parents at the border, which led to the president signing an executive order saying families will instead be detained together. Samantha Bee “If, like most people, you’ve been feeling a little uncomfortable with our new pre-K presence, good news, the president fixed it with the next worse thing,” began Samantha Bee, who showed footage of Trump signing the executive order while falsely claiming family separations have been taking place for 60 years. “Actually buddy, it’s been a month, but I agree that it feels like 60 years,” the host said. “Anyway, no more baby internment camps. Just regular internment camps. That’s what we call a win in 2018.” “I am happy that at least these kids are theoretically going to stay with their parents, but Mommy and Me jails are not a solution, they’re not new and they’re not legal,” Bee explained, referencing the 1997 Flores consent decree which states governments must keep migrant children in the “least restrictive conditions” possible. “The leading bills in the Senate and the House also consider indefinite family detention to be a solution, and some Democrats have gone on record saying they’re willing to vote for it,” Bee noted. “Any solution to this problem has to start from the premise that children should not go to jail. I know, I know, I’m such a radical leftist.” The host then summarized the myriad and contradictory justifications the administration put forth to defend their policy, ranging from the false claim it was passed by the Democrats to the notion “it is biblical to enforce the law”. “Oh, it’s so clear now!” Bee joked. “Democrats made the law, which was in the Bible, which is fair because these children are tricking the government into separating them from their parents, and also they are simultaneously separated and not separated, just like Donald and Melania.” Stephen Colbert CBS’ Stephen Colbert also discussed Trump’s about-face, beginning: “Our long national nightmare is ... different. “After weeks of tearing families apart at the border and then falsely insisting that only Congress could solve the problem, this afternoon the president looked deep into his heart and realized it was not there,” the host continued. “However you slice it, Donald Trump has changed his mind and decided to keep families together,” Colbert added, showing footage of Trump saying “we’re gonna have a lot of happy people” due to his executive order. “Happy people?” the host replied. “Wait, are you signing your resignation? “Trump made it a big signing ceremony to make it look like he did something good instead of admitting he was just ending the very thing he started,” Colbert added. “This executive order is not what he wants you to think it is. Sure, he’s reuniting families … in prison. He’s detaining parents and children together.” Colbert then mimicked the president: “Look, if I have to go to prison with my kids, so do you.” Trevor Noah Comedy Central’s Trevor Noah weighed in as well. “The Trump administration policy of separating families at the border,” he said. “It has rightfully outraged pretty much every decent human being and Ted Cruz.” Referring to the executive order, Noah said: “On it’s face, it seems like president Trump has decided to back down which, to be honest, isn’t totally surprising. Every day, the family separation stories have gotten worse and worse.” It began, the host explained, with reports about children and parents being separated at the border, then images of the cages in which they’re kept, followed by coverage of the “tender age” shelters in which babies were being kept. “Yesterday people found out that the federal government was snatching children as young as eight months from their parents,” the host noted. He then mentioned secretary of homeland security and “Cinderella’s step-sister”, Kirstjen Nielsen, who became the face of the policy and was shouted out of a Mexican restaurant by those protesting family separation. “This is the one time someone actually wanted a mariachi band to come to their table,” Noah said, adding that “it’s not a good look to torment Latino kids and then go and get your taco Tuesday on”. “Right now, no one really knows how Trump’s executive order will actually work,” he said. “It has loopholes that could allow separations to continue, it says nothing about the kids who have already been taken, and the whole thing might not even be legal.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"society/2018/jun/29/life-as-an-nhs-nurse-in-the-1990s","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-29T07:00:33Z","webTitle":"Life as an NHS nurse in the 1990s: ‘Patient expectation has risen’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jun/29/life-as-an-nhs-nurse-in-the-1990s","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/jun/29/life-as-an-nhs-nurse-in-the-1990s","fields":{"headline":"Life as an NHS nurse in the 1990s: ‘Patient expectation has risen’","bodyText":"I was studying philosophy in university when I decided to completely change tack with my career. It was this impulsive, intuitive feeling – where am I going with this? I’d had nurses in my family, and that career path resonated with me: working with people, doing something dynamic and challenging that’s not stuck in an office, a career which has a future where you can really make a difference. That last point was the key for me. I carry one very early, personal experience in nursing with me every day. My mother was diagnosed with metastatic [incurable] cancer when I was 22, and she was being treated in the hospital where I’d just started work as an oncology nurse. She refused chemotherapy, and I’d see her in my lunch breaks and after my shifts, so going back to work after she died was very tough. That time taught me that it’s so important to listen to a patient, to be in that moment, and that simple gestures of care can be so important. For nursing to work properly, by which I mean compassionately, you have to have time. People don’t fit into boxes. Because of waiting targets and turnover volumes today, we have to consistently justify time spent on individuals. The hardest thing for me is when operations are cancelled or procedures can’t go ahead, and you have to tell that to a person waiting to hear if their cancer has spread. Not being in control of that is very hard. No amount of training can make up for it. The demographic being treated by the NHS has changed so much since it began. We have an ageing population now, and so many chronic and long-term illnesses. The templates we have for clinic care are also very archaic: some people need less than five minutes, some people need more. Patient expectation has also risen, which is not a bad thing, but this means care takes longer. Will Brexit affect nursing? I think so. We have a huge vacancy of nurses in England and I work with several nurses from other parts of Europe and further afield. The nursing shortfall is also due to years of short-term planning, so any further shortage will have a ripple effect and repercussions on patient safety. The best part of my job is the interaction with people. I’m in a position to make a difference to people’s lives every day – that’s very rewarding. My advice to anyone wanting to start out now, though, would be to take your time. There’s a tendency to want to fly to the top of the career ladder straight away, but nothing will replace the expertise I got from the 10 years I spent on wards at the start of my career. We also need to make nursing a more attractive prospect career-wise, and building in much clearer paths for professional development, which nursing doesn’t have in the same way as other medical careers. Recognition is so important too. If staff feel valued, that translates to better patient care, and everyone prospers. • Life as an NHS nurse in the 1940s: ‘You have to forget about yourself’"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"stage/2018/jun/22/celestial-motion-virtual-dance-stars-vr-360-film-alexander-whitley-dance-company","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-22T07:00:21Z","webTitle":"Celestial Motion: a virtual dance with the stars","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/jun/22/celestial-motion-virtual-dance-stars-vr-360-film-alexander-whitley-dance-company","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2018/jun/22/celestial-motion-virtual-dance-stars-vr-360-film-alexander-whitley-dance-company","fields":{"headline":"Celestial Motion: a virtual dance with the stars","bodyText":"Celestial Motion uses a combination of contemporary dance and motion-capture technology to explore the human relationship with the Sun. The VR piece was made by the Guardian’s in-house VR studio with Alexander Whitley Dance Company, and in association with Sadler’s Wells. Choreographed by Whitley, Celestial Motion was adapted from his original stage performance 8 Minutes, which premiered in June 2017 and has been on tour this year. Whitley collaborated with physicists from STFC RAL Space, taking inspiration for his original piece from solar science research images and data. In the 360-degree film, (best viewed with a Google cardboard headset on the YouTube app) users are transported to a cosmic landscape where they see the dancers, both in their human form and as ethereal digital figures performing the same choreography. “Exploring the new creative possibilities opened up by digital technology is a defining principle of my company” Whitley said. “I’m as excited by what dance has to bring to this new platform as I am by the opportunity it presents for creating and experiencing new forms of dance performance.” The groundbreaking VR experience was created in two halves. The costumed dancers were filmed in YouTube Space’s 360 green-screen studio in London while the virtual world was created by recording the dancers wearing motion capture suits at Queen Mary University of London, where Whitley is an artist fellow. The Guardian’s VR team worked with creative technologist and lead developer Luca Biada, of production studio FENYCE, to bring the project to life. Video graphics for the piece were designed by Bafta award-winning artist Tal Rosner, and the accompanying music was composed by electroacoustic musician Daniel Wohl. Stunning images of the sun from the Solar Dynamics Observatory were also incorporated to create the dramatic climax of the piece. A fully interactive version where you can switch between the two worlds is available on the Guardian VR app via the Daydream platform. You can watch the film as a YouTube 360 video with Google Cardboard for a more immersive experience.

Then I saw an advertisement saying that they were desperate in London to have qualified persons to help out, so I came here in 1958, when I was 20, and trained for three years at Mount Vernon hospital in Northwood. As a trainee in St Lucia, there were a lot of restrictions. You had to jump out the window to see your boyfriend, that sort of stuff. Things were strict over here, too: we weren’t allowed to go to parties, so we had to leave one window open and jump out. I have no idea what would have happened if we got caught – we were too well organised for that. On the ward, there was no time for tittle-tattle. Our patients were very well looked after, with bedside nursing, and we carried out our duties efficiently. There were no disposable utensils, we had to wash bedpans in the sluice. We couldn’t wear uniforms outdoors because it might cause infection. Visitors were not allowed to bring food to their relatives in hospital. There was no shortage of nurses and patients never had to wait on trolleys to occupy a bed. I did six years in accident and emergency at St James’ hospital in Balham, south London, working in the resuscitation section. That was the hardest I’ve ever worked but I loved it. You were buzzed as soon as an ambulance came through and you’d have to leave your dinner and run. The thing that bothered me the most was when children came in half-dead or dying. Most times I was able to switch off when I left work, but sometimes, when there were bad cases, it was very difficult. In 1988 there was a big train crash in Clapham Junction. We had nearly finished our shifts when the emergency bell rang. There were quite a lot of injuries and they all came in together. That was the worst situation I ever had. But we coped. I retired 18 years ago but I’m still active. I’m part of the Diamond Club, which is a group for older people in Lewisham promoting health and wellbeing. And I sit on the Lewisham Pensioners Forum, which campaigned very hard to save the local hospital. The NHS is in a bad state. Last November, I was admitted as a patient at King’s College hospital for two weeks. There were no beds for me at the start so I spent two days on a trolley in casualty. In my day, we did the nursing and we did all the treatment; now they’ve got auxiliaries who are trained to take blood pressure, temperature and so on. The whole field of bedside nursing is gone. Sisters sit in front of computers and do the office work. That bond between the nurse and the patient has disappeared. That said, I would be very pleased if more young people wanted to become nurses. We never had a shortage of nurses in my day. Young people wanted to do it and they did it very well, but today they’d rather go push a pen in an office than go clean a bedpan or look after someone. I’m afraid that nursing has lost its value. • Life as an NHS nurse in the 1970s: ‘There was a prejudice that nurses shouldn’t be educated’"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2018/jul/01/tyrant-shakespeare-on-power-by-stephen-greenblatt-book-review-robert-mccrum","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-07-01T06:00:38Z","webTitle":"Tyrant: Shakespeare on Power by Stephen Greenblatt review – sinister and enthralling","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jul/01/tyrant-shakespeare-on-power-by-stephen-greenblatt-book-review-robert-mccrum","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/jul/01/tyrant-shakespeare-on-power-by-stephen-greenblatt-book-review-robert-mccrum","fields":{"headline":"Tyrant: Shakespeare on Power by Stephen Greenblatt review – sinister and enthralling","bodyText":"In a twist that Shakespeare himself might have relished, he is as much America’s national poet as Britain’s. Here, he is an icon; there, in a crisis, his poetry and plays can become a touchstone. Indeed, in the “general woe” (Shakespeare’s words) that attended the 2016 US election, it was to Shakespeare that many Americans turned in their distress. When, in the midst of the most vicious presidential campaign in memory, Professor Stephen Greenblatt, bestselling author of Will in the World, published an op-ed piece in the New York Times headlined “Shakespeare Explains the 2016 Election”, it went viral. Greenblatt was at once topical, impassioned and provocative. “In the early 1590s,” he began, “Shakespeare sat down to write a play that addressed a problem: How could a great society wind up being governed by a sociopath?” After a pointed analysis of Richard III, he closed with this appeal: “Shakespeare’s words have an uncanny ability to reach out beyond their original time and place and to speak directly to us. We have long looked to him, in times of perplexity and risk, for the most fundamental human truths. So it is now. Do not think it cannot happen, and do not stay silent or waste your vote.” Overnight, Greenblatt’s article becameshared more than 500,000 times. As the US election spiralled beyond expectation, “Shakespearean” became a consoling shorthand for bewildered American democrats. It was a buzzword that soon acquired the status of a minor linguistic meme, rooted in an old tradition of New World veneration for Shakespeare’s life and work. Having sounded the alarm, and after two long years of disruption and dismay, which reached a grim nadir with the forced separation of immigrant families, Greenblatt now addresses the overwhelming question with which we are still grappling: how is it possible for a whole country to fall into the hands of a truly disastrous leader, a sociopath and a demagogue? Tyrant is Greenblatt’s answer, a highly entertaining rhetorical exercise tinged with sinister intimations of dread. A lifelong Shakespeare scholar, he has turned to the collected works to construct a grammar of tyranny based on Shakespeare’s plays, and some of their most notable monsters, from Richard III to Macbeth, by way of Coriolanus, Julius Caesar and King Lear, reflecting on their narcissism, incompetence, cruelty, paranoia, folly and corruption. Greenblatt’s method, after Polonius, is sly. He will “by indirections find directions out”, a nod to Shakespeare who perfected a strategic obliquity in his narratives of power. For instance, you will look in vain for an outright indictment of Donald J Trump. Nonetheless, the villainy of the 45th president is implicit in every line of this elegant and measured exploration. Greenblatt’s anatomy of power moves from the dishonesties of party politics to the cynical exploitations of populism to the mind of the tyrant – a wonderful analysis of Jack Cade’s revolt in Shakespeare’s Henry VI, the play famous for “first thing we do, let’s kill all the lawyers”. In general, Shakespeare’s villains are more sinister than the clownish, lazy and narcissistic Trump, though no less evil. Still, Greenblatt is very perceptive about the “enablers” who sustain a weak and incompetent leader in office. As a Harvard professor and a prominent member of America’s liberal elite, Greenblatt is probably too appalled by Trump’s insurrection to see the funny side, as depicted, for example, in Michael Wolff’s Fire and Fury. He does concede “a touch of comedy in the tyrant’s rise to power”, but doesn’t develop this promising line of thought. He closes, wearily, with the admission that, since he first protested in the New York Times, “it feels like a century has passed”. With so many American democrats, all he can do is wait for the wheel of history to bring some respite, as it must. Until this nightmare ends, we should be grateful for the reminder that one consoling antidote to Trumpism might be regular visits to Shakespeare plays, which teach, as Edgar puts it in King Lear, that: “The worst is not, so long as we can say, ‘This is the worst.’” • Tyrant: Shakespeare on Power by Stephen Greenblatt is published by Bodley Head (£16.99).

McDonald resigned from the Scottish National party in March over his inappropriate behaviour but refused to stand down from parliament, despite senior colleagues, including Nicola Sturgeon, expressing their dismay at his decision. The Commissioner for Ethical Standards in Public Life concluded that McDonald’s behaviour amounted to sexual harassment, and Holyrood’s standards committee has now recommended that the member for Aberdeen Donside should be suspended from the Scottish parliament without pay for a month. MSPs will vote on the proposed sanctions next week, before recess. In the complaint to the ethical standards commissioner, McDonald’s former SNP colleague James Dornan claimed the MSP had used his position to harass a female member of his staff. In examining information relating to this complaint, the commissioner was made aware of McDonald’s conduct towards another staff member and decided this was also relevant. The commissioner concluded that McDonald had “failed to treat one witness with respect, and that his conduct towards her involved sexual harassment and that he also failed to treat a second witness with respect in relation to a financial matter”. This second matter is reported to be a £470 loan from a staff member that he took three weeks to repay. The commissioner’s conclusions will be published in full later on Thursday, but it has been reported that it finds McDonald guilty of harassment based on the case that sparked his resignation as a minister, involving an inappropriate text message, but clears him of the allegations made by Dornan. McDonald said he would accept the outcome of the MSPs’ vote next week, but added that he would “continue to represent the interests of my constituents diligently”. Clare Haughey, the convener of the standards committee, said she wanted to send a “clear signal about the seriousness of Mark McDonald’s conduct”, but also criticised Dornan for disclosing details about his complaint to the media, saying: “Confidentiality requirements have been flouted more than once.” An internal SNP investigation which reported in March found that McDonald was responsible for persistent and inappropriate behaviour towards women, unwanted attention causing distress and exploiting his position of power. The Scottish Labour MSP Rhoda Grant said McDonald was “totally unfit” to remain an MSP, and that the proposed sanctions did not go far enough. “As this report has shown, Mark McDonald’s behaviour has been well below that expected of anyone, let alone an MSP. Mark McDonald has let down his constituents and it is clear to everyone except him that he is totally unfit to represent the people of Donside. It is right that he faces a sanction for his behaviour, but the reality is the proposed action does not go far enough. Anyone with an ounce of decency in his position would do the right thing and immediately resign as an MSP.” At the beginning of March, the findings of a comprehensive survey of Holyrood staff revealed that one in three women had experienced harassment or sexist behaviour there. Of those who reported sexual harassment, 45% identified an MSP as the perpetrator. A subsequent report for the parliament’s standards committee recommended all MSPs undergo training on harassment awareness."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"games/2018/jun/22/jurassic-world-evolution-business-management-game-pc-ps4-xbox-one-frontier-developments","type":"article","sectionId":"games","sectionName":"Games","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-22T10:30:41Z","webTitle":"Jurassic World Evolution review – fun once the chaos begins","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2018/jun/22/jurassic-world-evolution-business-management-game-pc-ps4-xbox-one-frontier-developments","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/games/2018/jun/22/jurassic-world-evolution-business-management-game-pc-ps4-xbox-one-frontier-developments","fields":{"headline":"Jurassic World Evolution review – fun once the chaos begins","bodyText":"The latest game spun out from the world of Michael Crichton’s books and Steven Spielberg’s films asks a straightforward question: how would you run a dinosaur theme park? Jurassic World Evolution is a business management game that has you building and maintaining attractions full of terrible lizards, turning them into thriving enterprises. Part zoo, part window into the past and part simmering disaster, the park itself plays a charismatic lead. This is nominally an expansion to the recently released movie Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom, but it feels much more like a homage to the entire series, thanks to evocative audio, a playful cameo from Jeff Goldblum as the voice of a sardonic player guide and sterling work realising and animating the dinosaurs. You start by establishing the ecosystem of a given park, building dinosaur enclosures that best serve their inhabitants while also satisfying warm-blooded visitors. Guests don’t just need good views of the prehistoric exhibits, they will also expect restaurants, gift shops, hotels, monorails and more. Incubation blocks, research labs and helipads are needed to breed and export new dinos. And everything needs to be linked together with networks of paths, and kept functional with power lines and regular maintenance. Most importantly, you will need bunkers for the guests to hide in when things start to go wrong. Like the films, Evolution is at its best when disaster strikes. The chaotic side of this business simulation is about restoring order after all hell breaks loose. And that happens often, thanks to tropical storms, a frustrated diplodocus headbutting a fence panel or inadequate security. One escaped herbivore can cause panic, make a hole in another enclosure and trigger a cascading disaster of loose carnivores, damaged facilities and traumatised visitors rushing to leave negative reviews. In those moments, Evolution becomes a disaster simulator and that, at times, is fantastically fun and energetic. It offers what the management-game genre can be at its best: a dynamic to-do list of competing priorities that begs you to bring order to a model world of your creation. In its fallow phases, however, Evolution can be too sedate and repetitive. Extracting DNA from fossils to breed new dinosaurs is captivating at first, but a few dozen times later, prodding at the menu screens to achieve the same end feels too much like real-world admin. Jurassic World Evolution is both accessible and relatively complex, though seasoned management-game players might find it a little shallow. It does an elegant job of training players – it takes only a couple of hours before you feel like a veteran park management specialist. A scientist, a marketing-minded entertainment consultant and a security specialist with a habit of musing over weaponised dinosaurs will each try to influence the ways in which you shape your park, offering their own self-serving objectives. Satisfying one of these virtual folk will bring perks at the expense of your relationships with the others but, over time, it becomes clear their impact is insignificant. In spite of a smattering of minor missteps, Evolution is engrossing and clearly created with a deep affection for the source material. Any fan of the films (or the books) who has ever imagined opening a disaster-prone theme park will have a good time with it, despite the repetition. Jurassic World Evolution is out now, £44.99."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"books/2018/jun/21/theresa-mays-brexit-dividend-is-imaginary-there-is-no-brackpot","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-21T05:30:01Z","webTitle":"May's Brexit ‘dividend’ is imaginary – there is no Brackpot","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jun/21/theresa-mays-brexit-dividend-is-imaginary-there-is-no-brackpot","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/jun/21/theresa-mays-brexit-dividend-is-imaginary-there-is-no-brackpot","fields":{"headline":"May's Brexit ‘dividend’ is imaginary – there is no Brackpot","bodyText":"This week Theresa May announced that she’ll spend more on the NHS because of the “Brexit dividend” (Brividend). Like a “jobs-first Brexit” or a unicorn, it’s a thing that’s entirely imaginary, since the likely loss of tax revenue due to slower growth after Brexit will more than offset the slightly more than 1% of the government budget we currently pay to the EU. Still, let us at least applaud May’s sobriety in not announcing a Brexit bonanza (Bronanza) or a Brexit jackpot (Brackpot). The term “dividend”, here, borrows the rhetorical authority of finance to imply the very mathematical precision the idea totally lacks. From the Latin for “that which is to be divided”, “dividend” was originally a number you were dividing (by the divisor), and then applied to situations in which money was shared among a group of people – latterly, most often, shareholders in public companies. Perhaps most apposite in the present political context is the sense of “dividend” that means the proceeds from gambling on the football pools.

While Hollywood depictions of dinosaurs often show the creatures open-mouthed with tongues waving, researchers have discovered that many of them were probably tongue-tied, their tongues firmly anchored to the floors of their mouths and unable to waggle around. Writing in the journal Plos One, palaeontologist Julia Clarke of the University of Texas at Austin and scientists from the Chinese Academy of Sciences describe how they explored the tongue-wagging abilities of dinosaurs by looking at fossils of a set of bony structures known as the hyoid that anchors the tongue in the mouth. They also looked at fossils from extinct flying reptiles known as pterosaurs, and used both x-ray CT scanning and dissection techniques to look at the tongue anatomies of alligators and living birds – including the common pheasant, emu and redhead duck. Birds have thin, mobile tongues and Y-shaped hyoids: two long, bony projections point towards the back of the mouth, and a central bony section sits in the front of the mouth with the tongue wrapped around it. Muscles attach to these bony projections, allowing birds to move their tongues and stick them out. “We take birds for granted, but they have crazy tongues,” said Clarke. “The way that tongue is able to protrude so far is that these little skinny bones are super, super long – they are so long that in a hummingbird they wrap over the surface of the skull into the nose holes. “We know that bird tongues are highly mobile, [but we were interested in] what is unique to them, when does that arise in Dinosauria.” The team found that dinosaurs evolutionarily close to birds, such as microraptors, had hyoids similar to – albeit shorter than – those of modern birds. Elongated complex hyoids were also found in pterosaurs. However, the majority of dinosaurs were found to have a simple, short hyoid rather like modern alligators, whose large, fleshy tongues are fixed to the floor of their mouths, with broad, short pieces of cartilage at the back rather than the longer bony support seen in birds. This, say the researchers, suggests dinosaurs could not have waggled their tongues, let alone stuck them out. The exception, notes Clarke, was a group of plant-eating dinosaurs known as ornithischians, which includes beasts such as triceratops, who were found to have an unusual, complex hyoid. While the team say it is not clear why some dinosaurs and birds evolved more mobile tongues, they suggest it comes down to feeding habits. Crocodiles and alligators – like many meat-eating dinosaurs – do little chewing, instead opting for a “tear and gulp” approach to table manners that does not require a mobile tongue. Herbivorous dinosaurs like triceratops needed to chew, while birds have a variety of feeding habits borne of their lifestyle. “Once you have things that are eating seeds like birds, that are eating smaller prey items, then there seems to be elaboration of the tongue,” said Clarke. “Once there are wings instead of mobile forelimbs then I think there is more pressure on the tongue to participate in positioning food or food processing … moving food in the mouth.” Stephen Brusatte, a palaeontologist at the University of Edinburgh who was not involved in the study, welcomed the research. “It turns out that most dinosaurs have the very simple hyoid bones of modern crocodiles, which anchor a tongue that is pretty much glued to the floor of the mouth,” he said. “A cousin of T rex called Yutyrannus has this type of hyoid bone, as do almost all other dinosaurs, so it’s reasonable to infer that T rex did as well.” “Those images in Jurassic Park of the T rex sticking its tongue out like a lizard as it prepares to devour its prey are probably wrong.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/jun/07/france-macron-fake-news-law-criticised-parliament","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-08T09:37:06Z","webTitle":"French MPs criticise 'hasty and ineffective' fake news law","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/07/france-macron-fake-news-law-criticised-parliament","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/07/france-macron-fake-news-law-criticised-parliament","fields":{"headline":"French MPs criticise 'hasty and ineffective' fake news law","bodyText":"The French government was accused by right and leftwing opponents of trying to create a form of “thought police” and institute censorship, as parliament began debating Emmanuel Macron’s proposed law to ban fake news on the internet during election campaigns. The draft law — designed to stop what the government calls “manipulation of information” in the runup to elections — would allow political parties to complain about widely spread assertions deemed to be false or “implausible” and a French judge could immediately move to stop their publication. The centrist President Macron, who beat the far-right candidate, Marine Le Pen, in 2017, has personally backed the reform after he complained his presidential campaign was targeted by online fake news rumours, including that he was gay and that he had a secret bank account in the Bahamas. He has said a law was needed against the spread of fake news “in order to protect democracy”. The government wants the law to come into force before next spring’s European parliament elections. It is likely to pass because Macron has a parliamentary majority. But in heated exchanges in parliament on Thursday, members of the rightwing Les Républicains party accused Macron of trying to create a “thought police” that threatened freedom of expression. The leftwing France Insoumise party warned of a new kind of censorship and cautioned against a hasty, unnecessary and ineffective law against an ill-defined concept of fake news. The culture secretary, Françoise Nyssen, told parliament the spread of fake information online was “polluting” the public domain and amounted to a “slow poison that destroys our credibility”. After one journalists’ union had warned the law could be used to hamper reporters’ work, Nyssen said that professional media would not be targeted. Bruno Studer, a politician from Macron’s La République En Marche party, who drafted the bill, said the law would focus on “manipulation of information” and deliberately not use the English term “fake news”. He said the government wanted to distance itself from any ideological appropriation of the term “fake news” as used by the US president Donald Trump as means to attack journalists and the media. The law aims to identify and stop deliberately false information that is “massively” spread online in the three-month period before an election. Most criticism has been focused on the section of the law that allows political parties or candidates to complain about an item of allegedly false or implausible information online and a judge will, within 48 hours, rule on it and can block the publication. The judge must decide whether the allegedly false information could determine the course of an election, and whether it has been massively and artificially spread online. Social networks would also have to clearly state who was sponsoring content. The law would also give the French media regulator new powers to remove broadcasters’ rights to air content in France if it is deemed to be deliberately fake or implausible. Foreign broadcasters could be taken off air if they were deemed to be attempting to destabilise France, a measure taken to be aimed at Russian state-backed outlets. The newspaper Le Monde warned of the importance of ensuring the law could not one day be used by an authoritarian government for censorship. The paper argued that the real problem was that people readily believed fake news — a sign of “a major crisis in our democracies, people’s growing mistrust towards their institutions”. Constance Le Grip of Les Républicains told parliament the law was “useless, redundant, inadequate, dangerous, an attack on freedom of expression, badly written and only raises concerns instead of bringing solutions”. During the election campaign in spring 2017, Macron filed a legal complaint after Le Pen, the Front National leader, referred to stories about him placing funds in an offshore account in the Bahamas. At the time, Macron’s political movement, En Marche, called Le Pen’s statements a “textbook case” of fake news. Macron has also had harsh words for Moscow, accusing Russia of following a “hybrid strategy combining military intimidation and an information war”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2018/jun/07/tsb-chief-mps-paul-pester-it-crisis","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-07T19:05:30Z","webTitle":"TSB chief under pressure to quit after rebuke from MPs","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jun/07/tsb-chief-mps-paul-pester-it-crisis","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/jun/07/tsb-chief-mps-paul-pester-it-crisis","fields":{"headline":"TSB chief under pressure to quit after rebuke from MPs","bodyText":"The TSB chief executive is under mounting pressure to quit after MPs said the bank’s board should give “serious consideration as to whether his position was sustainable”. The Treasury select committee said Paul Pester had “not been straight with” MPs and customers about TSB’s recent IT meltdown, and that the bank’s public communications had often been “complacent and misleading”. The MPs said they had lost confidence in his ability to provide a full assessment of the problems and deal with them in the best interests of customers. However, hours later, the bank rebuffed the apparent call for Pester to step down, saying that he continued to have the full support of the board. The letter from Nicky Morgan, chair of the select committee, to Richard Meddings, chairman of TSB, came 24 hours after Pester had a bruising encounter with MPs, some of whom suggested he should consider quitting. Shortly before Pester’s appearance before the committee, the Financial Conduct Authority launched a stinging attack on him over the bank’s failure to be open and transparent with customers when a botched IT upgrade locked up to 1.9 million people out of their accounts. The FCA accused him of “portraying an optimistic view” of services after the botched upgrade in late April. More than six weeks later some TSB customers are still facing disruption to services, and at the committee hearing on Wednesday it emerged that 1,300 customers had had money stolen from their accounts – in some cases their life savings – by fraudsters exploiting the meltdown. The letter to Meddings stated: “The committee considers that the TSB board should give serious consideration as to whether Dr Pester’s position as chief executive of TSB is sustainable. “The committee has lost confidence in his ability to provide a full and frank assessment of the problems at TSB, and to deal with them in the best interests of its customers. “It is concerned that, if he continues in his position, this could damage trust not only in TSB, but in the retail banking sector as a whole. I ask that the board consider the committee’s view as a matter of urgency.” Commenting on the correspondence, Morgan said that from the time the IT problems at TSB had begun the bank’s public communications had “often been complacent and misleading”. She added: “This tone has been set from the top – by Paul Pester – and whether intentionally or not he has not been straight with the committee and TSB customers. Dr Pester’s statements that ‘everything is running smoothly for the vast majority of our … customers’ and that ‘there will be no barriers’ to customers switching accounts, and his denial that there were problems on TSB’s fraud reporting line, are all examples of this. “The Treasury committee, therefore, has lost confidence in Dr Pester’s position as chief executive of TSB, and considers that the TSB board should give serious consideration as to whether his position is sustainable.” During often heated exchanges with MPs on the select committee during Wednesday afternoon, Pester and two other executives, Meddings, and Miquel Montes, chief operations officer of the Spanish parent company, Sabadell, were asked, “why are you still in your job?” and “can we be certain that some heads are going to roll?” The Labour MP John Mann asked Pester: “Will you fall on your sword before you’re pushed?” The chief executive responded: “I believe I’m the right person to fix this problem for our customers.” Morgan has also written to Andrew Bailey, the FCA chief executive, and Sam Woods, chief executive of the Prudential Regulation Authority. Up to 1.9 million of TSB’s 5.2 million customers began experiencing problems with online and mobile banking services on 23 April after accounts were migrated from an IT system inherited from the previous owner, Lloyds Banking Group, to Sabadell’s technology operation. In a reply to Morgan, Meddings said the bank had “made good progress in resolving the recent IT issues, and TSB is now functioning at, or close to, normal for the majority of TSB customers”. He said: “We recognise that we still have areas where we need to improve performance for our customers, and we do not underestimate these remaining issues. The important point is that this progress has been achieved under the leadership of Paul Pester, who continues to have the full support of the TSB board.” Meddings said the board believed that communications since the upgrade had been made in good faith and based on the information available at the time."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jun/07/the-guardian-view-on-the-brexit-backstop-row-much-ado-about-nothing","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-07T17:36:20Z","webTitle":"The Guardian view on the Brexit backstop row: much ado about nothing | Editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/07/the-guardian-view-on-the-brexit-backstop-row-much-ado-about-nothing","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/07/the-guardian-view-on-the-brexit-backstop-row-much-ado-about-nothing","fields":{"headline":"The Guardian view on the Brexit backstop row: much ado about nothing","bodyText":"So you thought that the Brexit negotiations had become bogged down and intractable? Fear not. All is suddenly and brilliantly clear. Theresa May’s strategy isn’t to manoeuvre the European Union into a favourable Brexit deal by making threats or by clever argument. It’s to reduce Brussels into submission by making the EU negotiators collapse laughing. That is the only possible conclusion from the latest bout of internal Tory party nonsense over the terms of Britain’s EU exit. Bear with us as we try to explain. The Brexit secretary David Davis came very close to resigning on Thursday over a date. The date in question was the one at which a backstop provision that has not been agreed, which is attached to a transitional customs deal that has not yet been negotiated, which is part of a post-Brexit economic relationship that has yet to be settled, may come to an end. Or, as it turned out on closer reading of the text, may not come to an end at all, since this depends not just on whether the UK’s “expectation” that all this would happen by December 2021 (the date in question) is the same thing as a commitment to the fact that it would do so, but also on the small matter of whether the EU will agree anyway. All clear? Good. Thursday’s tense negotiations between the prime minister and her Brexit secretary were ridiculous. But they were also a microcosm of something much larger – the government’s focus on keeping the Tory party together rather than making a Brexit deal that protects jobs and the economy. In the end, the struggle in the Tory party is not so much hilarious as tragic and dangerous. With only weeks now remaining in which to make a comprehensive deal, the government came close to destroying itself on Thursday morning over an essentially trivial internal argument about a date. Talk about not being able to see the wood for the trees. Mrs May and Mr Davis had two meetings about whether and how to put a time limit on the backstop customs arrangement that would – or could – keep the Irish border soft and open. There were rumours that Mr Davis was preparing to walk out. Then it was said that Mrs May had folded in the face of his threats. Then it was briefed that Mr Davis was actually the loser. When the text of the “technical note” on the temporary customs arrangement was published at lunchtime on Thursday, it soon became clear that the settlement between the two sides was really a fudge. “The UK expects the future arrangement [which would replace the temporary one] to be in place by the end of December 2021 at the latest” read the key sentence. In other words, it may or may not be and it all comes down to what the EU thinks. Underlying all this is something serious. Mrs May wants to tilt the Brexit negotiations towards a softer or more extended settlement, in the hope that during that time a technological border solution can be found (and installed) to ensure that the Irish border does not slam shut when Brexit comes. She is therefore prepared to blur the eventual terms in order to simply get Brexit – almost any Brexit – over the line in March 2019. Mr Davis’s aims are less clear, as his aims often are. He appears to want to tell the fellow anti-Europeans that any concessions this master negotiator has made along the way will no longer be in place by the time of the 2022 general election. Now comes the reality check. The agreement that matters is the one with the EU27, not the one between the two wings of the Tory party. The May-Davis fudge may not survive the next meeting with Michel Barnier, because the EU (and Ireland in particular) will not agree to something that, in the Davis version, could collapse as the clock strikes midnight at the end of 2021. The Irish government was very clear that it is not possible for a backstop to be temporary. The agreement, in the words of both Leo Varadkar and Mr Barnier, had to be an “all-weather agreement”. An EU diplomat was quoted on Thursday as saying all this is a joke. So, in a sense, it is. In the end, though, it is the opposite. Britain is a serious country. Its national interests are being tossed around between the rival wings of the Tory party, not being defended and advanced by ministers who grasp what is at stake. The right reaction is not to laugh, but to cry."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/jun/30/how-to-create-a-container-water-garden","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-30T10:00:09Z","webTitle":"How to create a container water garden | Alys Fowler","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jun/30/how-to-create-a-container-water-garden","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jun/30/how-to-create-a-container-water-garden","fields":{"headline":"How to create a container water garden","bodyText":"Japanese temple gardens are world-renowned for good reason, but although all that perfectly raked gravel and artful pruning can be incredibly moving, I’m not sure it transfers well to a different setting. Or, to put it another way, I had no desire to come home and recreate any of it. The street gardens of Japan, however, are another thing; I want every one of them. At any opportunity, by the front door, in a sliver of a front garden, outside a restaurant or corner shop, there’s a gathering of pots, holding everything from herbs to miniature azalea, bonsai and houseplants out for the summer. My favourites are the container water gardens, often no bigger than a bucket. Container ponds offer just what a large pond might – a slice of the sky and a mirrored surface to change the beat between plants – and yet can be squeezed into the smallest of spaces. I came home inspired. My mother donated a large iron cauldron-like thing, which, because it sits on top of the soil rather than sinks into it, reflects a floating sky among the foliage and introduces a very different sense of space. Now I’m on the hunt for more, because one of my favourite gardens in Japan consisted of many container ponds grouped together to create something both playful and serene. Each contained just a single plant, an Equisetum scirpoides. This is a relative of mare’s tail that requires boggy conditions and no more than an inch of water over the top of it. It grows to 20cm high, and is perfectly happy in a sunny or shady spot. A number contained miniature water lilies, and one, made of stone, had nothing in the water but the edges were covered in moss and the miniature spleenwort Asplenium trichomanes. As so often in Japanese gardens, it was hard to tell if this was nature’s hand at work or the gardener’s, but it was quite delightful. There are a number of water lilies suitable for container ponds: Nymphaea ‘Pygmaea Alba’ is a lovely pure white form; ‘Perry’s Baby Red’ is bright reddish pink; and ‘Helva’ is a double yellow form. All grow no more than 30cm wide and love the sun. Another choice for a sunny spot could be the beautiful kaffir lily, Hesperantha coccinea (formerly Schizostylis coccinea), which thrives in wet mud, be it a stream edge, bog garden or pot. If you only have a shady spot, the British native cotton grass, Eriophorum angustifolium has white cotton-wool seed heads over a grass‑like foliage."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/aug/18/a-letter-to-my-midlife-lover","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-08-18T05:45:41Z","webTitle":"A letter to… my mid-life lover","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/aug/18/a-letter-to-my-midlife-lover","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/aug/18/a-letter-to-my-midlife-lover","fields":{"headline":"A letter to… my mid-life lover","bodyText":"Last December, nearly a year after my husband’s death, I realised I had turned a corner: a friend mentioned this paper’s online dating service, Guardian Soulmates, and I thought, “I could do that.” Barely three weeks later, I was meeting you and your puppy on my favourite beach. I knew right away that we’d hit it off: we talked nonstop and I felt totally at ease. You had also been widowed within the past year, and although your marriage was blissfully happy, whereas mine was more complicated, we talked openly about the searing pain of bereavement. We laughed and smiled a lot, too. As your mad puppy jumped around, causing me to repeatedly move to the other side of you, I found that I kept touching your arm. We went to a nearby pub and continued to talk without pause. It was obvious that we shared a great deal in terms of values, beliefs and sense of humour. I told you I was having a lovely time, and you smiled the smile that I have since come to love and told me that you were, too. After four hours, which barely felt like one, I had to go. We walked to my car and you kissed me. I was astonished, enthralled, charmed. It was clear that this was not going to end here. We spoke that evening and agreed to meet again a week later. We spoke several times every day in the interim. I astounded myself by suggesting we spend a weekend near that same beach a few weeks later. On our second meeting, there were instant fireworks: an explosive combination of emotional connection, physical attraction and a huge liking for each other. We continued to spend as much time together as we could and, 17 days after meeting, we rather crazily booked a holiday abroad. Three months on, I am happier than I thought possible – I did not expect, in my late 50s, to feel like this. You have turned my life around. We make each other laugh all the time and your capacity for physical affection is unending. You tell me I am gorgeous and are unfailingly kind. You talk about what you see as my talents and encourage me to develop them (even at this late stage). There have been many magical moments: dancing round my kitchen in each other’s arms; walking, crying and laughing on that beach where we first met; sitting in a cafe and grinning broadly at each other at the sheer, wonderful craziness of it all. This feels like something that could last for ever. Whatever happens, you have shown me that, even after the very worst has occurred, unbelievable happiness can make a new appearance. For that, my love, I truly thank you. • We will pay £25 for every letter we publish. Email family@theguardian.com, including your address and phone number.

But Thorpe’s memoir is not part of any herd. Nor does it belong in the fast-and-loose category of potboilers about swapping English life for continental idylls, such as Carol Drinkwater’s The Olive Farm or Peter Mayle’s A Year in Provence. It is erudite, firmly embedded in its own soil and yet evasive. It never answers the questions the Du Maurier quotation raises. Twenty-five years ago, Thorpe and his family moved to the lower slopes of the Cévennes mountains, what he describes as “the last thrust of the Massif Central before the southern plain and the sea”. It was not long after the publishing of Ulverton – now a Vintage classic – a novel about the life of an invented English village. Thorpe’s village house in the Cévennes has a “modest, unattached garden behind, sloping up in a series of terraces” and a marvellous view, “you can see the far-off Alps on a clear day, small and sharp as a shrew’s lower teeth”. The arrestingly precise image is typical of Thorpe’s vision as a poet as well as a novelist. Briefly, he explains his reasons for decamping to France – he was born in Paris and, with a novelist’s uncertain income, it seemed a good move. I’d have liked to know more – about doubts (if any), highs, lows and how he has assimilated. He has a nuanced sense of France and one imagines that he comes as close to proving Du Maurier’s character wrong as it is possible for an Englishman to do. But this must remain guesswork, for Thorpe writes about what he sees more than about how he feels. The book is based on Freelance columns for the Times Literary Supplement upon which he has expanded. This accounts for the discrete chapters and sense that, for all its articulate intricacy, the book does not quite hang together. Yet, form aside, there is much to enjoy. Thorpe writes like an archaeologist – the prose stratified. He remains a pencilled figure in his adopted landscape, mindful, perhaps, that the landscape predates and will survive him. He writes especially well about his house’s ancient, human quirkiness. The locals are quirky too – his penetrating accounts recall Ronald Blythe’s Akenfield. The chapter about Guillaume, a Parisian rebel from ’68 who stayed on in the Cévennes and became a compulsive purchaser of junk, is intriguing and troubling. I loved the account, too, of the animal locals, the martens who make his roof their temporary residence. I relished meeting artistic Lisa, the baker’s wife, and her husband, Alain, who goes awol, causing widespread alarm before winding up in Nîmes, defiantly sloshed. A diverting chapter on Robert Louis Stevenson (Travels With a Donkey in the Cévennes) describes a company offering “docile” donkeys, standing in for Stevenson’s Modestine. Thorpe is sensitive to village tensions, in despair about Brexit, aware history is anything but dead. In the most enjoyable chapter, he allows himself a shout-on part. He describes living in a flat in Nîmes (the children went to school in the city) above a penitentially noisy cafe. A nightmare for him, an entertaining cartoon for us. It made me reflect on how often the book dwells on nuisance – in the medieval sense. No matter how affectionate, appreciative and perceptive, this memoir serves as a corrective to unchecked dreams of living in France. • Notes from the Cévennes by Adam Thorpe is published by Bloomsbury Continuum (£16.99).

May’s premiership has seen the resignations of four cabinet ministers, but to lose her Brexit secretary might have been the fatal blow. Yet Davis was mollified in the end with a concession to insert an end date in the final text of the proposal, one that may ultimately carry little weight. The row could hardly have been said to have come out of nowhere. The spectre of the Irish backstop agreement had been hovering for six months, a blueprint Britain signed up to in the deal reached with the 27 EU members states in December. The backstop – which was crucial to the deal to allow Brexit negotiations to move on in December – would keep the whole of the UK inside key aspects of the customs union until a permanent arrangement can be put in place to avoid border checks between Northern Ireland and the Republic. No 10 has said consistently it is a fall-back option, and a temporary one, and it hopes to agree a different customs solution with Brussels. Attempts to reach that solution has exacerbated the tensions between remain and leave cabinet ministers; the two sides seemingly irreconcilably opposed. When the Department for Exiting the EU first saw May’s detailed plan for the backstop, set to be presented to negotiators in Brussels, it contained no legally enforceable end date. Sources close to Davis said that was something the Brexit secretary could never accept. Rumours had swirled that Davis was poised to quit for almost 12 hours by the time the Brexit secretary met the prime minister on Thursday morning for a tense hour-long meeting in her House of Commons office behind the Speaker’s chair. Afterwards, his aides looked stony-faced as they passed waiting journalists and escorted their boss back to 9 Downing Street. Government sources briefed journalists that the meeting had been “conclusive” but within minutes it became clear that it had not. No deal had been reached and Davis’s future was still in doubt. Though the customs backstop was the touchpaper, many other frustrations were kindling. Davis is frustrated with the slow pace of Brexit, the delay of his white paper on the government’s detailed plans until after the crucial Brussels summit later this month, and the government’s failure to agree a customs arrangement. In their meeting, where the pair were the only two in the room, Davis voiced his frustrations more widely than the backstop, insisting there should be a commitment to speed up the publication of the white paper. Less than an hour after the pair had met in Parliament, Davis was back in Number 10 for a second meeting with the prime minister. It was there, sources said, that the deal to insert the date was finally struck. Allies played down the idea he had ever been prepared to walk out. “He has said he was going to meet [chief EU negotiator] Michel Barnier next week, does that sound like a man about to resign?” one source said. Another said that threats were “not in his nature”. But after a chaotic 24 hours, the fact remains that there is still no legally enforceable end date in the text. May has kept her Brexit secretary in the fold and conceded almost nothing, although Davis’s allies will say the inclusion of the date now makes it politically impossible for the backstop to become the status quo. Crucial to the new text is the word “expects” – “The UK expects the future arrangement to be in place by the end of December 2021 at the latest.” That phrase is no firm commitment. Downing Street has always argued it needs to be able to credibly sell the proposal to Brussels – and an insurance option against a cliff edge, which in itself has a cliff-edge, would not fly. Senior civil servants have already told ministers that the highly complex new customs systems are unlikely to be ready for another five years. If and when the row comes in 2021, a year when an election will be looming, neither May nor Davis may be around to deal with the consequences. What may be more damaging in the short-term is yet another public split ahead of a crucial June summit in Brussels. “The prime minister clearly has no authority and this entire affair just smacks of incompetence,” fumed one Tory source. “We can’t even agree our own position in dignity and private.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2018/jun/07/immigration-reform-house-republicans-fail-to-reach-deal","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-07T17:07:54Z","webTitle":"House Republicans fail to reach deal on immigration reform","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jun/07/immigration-reform-house-republicans-fail-to-reach-deal","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/jun/07/immigration-reform-house-republicans-fail-to-reach-deal","fields":{"headline":"House Republicans fail to reach deal on immigration reform","bodyText":"Congressional Republicans left a Capitol Hill meeting on Thursday no closer to a deal on immigration reform. In a meeting held in an effort to forge common ground between moderates concerned about protecting the 700,000 undocumented immigrants popularly known as Dreamers and hardliners eager to uphold Donald Trump’s anti-immigration pledges, no compromise was reached. However, lawmakers left the meeting feeling more optimistic about efforts for legislation before the midterm elections. The meeting was sparked by an effort by a growing group of Republicans to force a vote, via a mechanism known as a discharge petition. This would allow a bill to be brought directly to the floor if 218 members of Congress sign it. So far, a discharge petition on immigration has attracted 215 signatures, including 23 Republicans and all but one congressional Democrat. If successful, the petition would initiate a series of votes on immigration proposals including one that would provide a pathway to citizenship for Dreamers. This has aroused fierce opposition from conservatives, who see such a vote as not only a betrayal of Trump’s agenda but electoral suicide in the midterms. RJ Hauman, the government relations director for Federation for American Immigration Reform, a Washington thinktank that advocates stricter control over legal and illegal immigration, said the discharge petition was a futile effort that imperiled the Republican party’s chances of keeping its majority control over Congress in November. “You have a pro-amnesty minority of the majority essentially making the rest of the GOP walk the plank on an issue that is almost certainly not going anywhere,” Hauman said. He noted that Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, had said he would bring up immigration legislation only if the president will sign it – and Trump has repeatedly said that he will veto any bill that does not fund a wall along the US-Mexico border – an election pledge that is a non-starter for many Democrats. He said the discharge petition could squander Republicans’ leverage in future negotiations, especially if the supreme court upholds Trump’s decision to terminate the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (Daca) program, which defers deportation for eligible undocumented youth in the US, known as Dreamers. “We fully believe that the supreme court will rule in favor of the administration next year, and then the Daca program will start to be officially wound down,” he said. “That’s when the Democrats will come to the table and they will certainly be willing to make some concessions then.” Speaking to reporters after the meeting, the House speaker, Paul Ryan, said the goal was “to get things done and avoid a discharge petition”. He warned a discharge petition would not result in any law signed by Trump, but he described “very productive conservations” occurring among House Republicans. Congressman Carlos Curbelo, a Florida Republican who has been one of the leaders of the discharge petition effort, said on Twitter after the meeting, “I don’t think it could have gone any better. Some questions but a lot of consensus. Our country deserves meaningful action on #immigration now. For too long politicians have used this issue for personal political gain. Enough.” The intra-party schism over immigration between moderates and hardline immigration hawks has been building for years, said Al Cardenas, a former president of the American Conservative Union, who recalled an effort by George W Bush to pass reform that would have provided legal status and a pathway to citizenship for the estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants living in the country unlawfully. Obstruction from hardline conservatives has rendered the issue politically perilous, Cardenas said, in that the debate has narrowed to focus on only a small population of sympathetic young immigrants. And even then Congress cannot find common ground. “The lift seems minimal and the personal consequences so severe that I can’t for the life of me figure out why congressmen and women can shrug their shoulders and think that this is an issue that can wait,” he said. Cardenas noted some irony in the leadership’s opposition to passing legislation that Trump won’t sign. “The House passed over 50 healthcare bills knowing that President Obama would veto them but that didn’t stop them from trying,” he said. And, Cardenas added, lawmakers should know better than to predict how Trump will respond. “The president has spoken out of both sides of his mouth on the issue,” he said. “It’s possible he could surprise us.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2018/jun/10/devon-log-bank-fuel-poverty-roresters-food-banks","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-10T11:44:54Z","webTitle":"Devon 'log bank' set up to help those struggling with fuel poverty","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jun/10/devon-log-bank-fuel-poverty-roresters-food-banks","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/jun/10/devon-log-bank-fuel-poverty-roresters-food-banks","fields":{"headline":"Devon 'log bank' set up to help those struggling with fuel poverty","bodyText":"A band of volunteer foresters working from a base tucked away in a steep West Country valley is pioneering a “log bank” scheme designed to help struggling families and individuals out of fuel poverty. Inspired by the food bank system that has become a feature of austerity Britain, the idea is that people in Devon who are unable to afford to heat their homes will be supplied with free logs for open fires and burners. For the last eight years members of the Axewoods Co-operative – the name is a play on the River Axe as well as the cutting tool – have managed woodland in east Devon without pay in exchange for the firewood produced as they work. The scheme has been so successful that they found they were getting more wood than they were able to use themselves and decided to launch the log bank. East Devon district council has provided the group with a plot of land at its Knapp Copse nature reserve to season the wood and store equipment. Axewoods is now forging links with food banks, charities and advice centres to find people who would benefit from a supply of logs. Its chairman, Alan Dyer, said members hoped their scheme, which they believe to be the first of its kind, could help hundreds of people heat and power their homes. “It’s not aimed at people who might turn up in their Range Rover, load up and say: ‘Thanks very much for the free logs,’” Dyer said. “Fuel poverty is a real problem in rural areas. In the south-west where wages are low and costs are high ordinary people are struggling to keep themselves warm. If they have access to a log burner or open fire, the wood we provide could make all the difference.” Fuel poverty is defined as a household living on a low income in a home that cannot be kept warm at reasonable cost without bringing residual income below the poverty threshold. According to the latest government figures 11% of households in urban areas of England are fuel poor. In rural villages, hamlets and isolated dwellings the figure rises to 14%. In 2015 – the most recent year for which figures are available - the average fuel poverty gap for fuel poor households in rural villages, hamlets and isolated dwellings was £726. Research by National Energy Action and the Campaign to Protect Rural England shows that rural areas are five years behind urban areas in terms of energy efficiency of homes and that people were paying almost 55% more to fuel their home as a result. Axewoods is very much a product of austerity Britain. Ten years ago it became clear that many landowners, both private and public sector, were not prepared to spend money on managing woodland because bringing in commercial contractors was so expensive. In east Devon people with an interest in sylvan areas and forestry work formed the cooperative and offered to manage woodlands in exchange for logs for their own use. “The landowners have their woods managed and we get exercise and free wood,” said Dyer. “We have retired people, youngsters, unemployed, business people, coastguards come along. It’s an eclectic mix, which is half the fun.” A new member flagged up that he had come across people burning rubbish in stoves – and often damaging them – because they could not afford good quality wood. The cooperative decided to try to find a way of getting its surfeit of logs to such people. The environment secretary Michael Gove’s calls for curbs on wood burners and coal fires to reduce emissions are dismissed by Dyer as a “stupid soundbite”. He agreed people burning logs could be a problem in London, but not in the places such as Devon. Nathan Robinson, a local authority nature reserves ranger who works with the cooperative, said: “In many rural areas of the district, wood fuel provides one of only a few viable options for how to heat your home. A project such as this which aims to supply firewood from sustainably managed sources to those in need is surely a good thing. It’s a win-win as I see it. Warm homes, well managed woods.” Claire Wright, the Devon county councillor for Otter Valley, called the log bank a fantastic project. She said: “Some people genuinely do have to make a choice between eating and heating their house. I know not everyone has a log burner or open fire but for those who do then this service could be a bit of a lifeline.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"theobserver/commentisfree/2018/jun/10/may-i-have-a-word-about-words-make-us-squirm","type":"article","sectionId":"theobserver","sectionName":"From the Observer","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-10T05:00:46Z","webTitle":"May I have a word about… words that make us squirm? | Jonathan Bouquet","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/commentisfree/2018/jun/10/may-i-have-a-word-about-words-make-us-squirm","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/theobserver/commentisfree/2018/jun/10/may-i-have-a-word-about-words-make-us-squirm","fields":{"headline":"May I have a word about… words that make us squirm","bodyText":"It’s odd what makes people squeamish. A recent report from the Royal Society’s Philosophical Transactions B journal listed various things that turned stomachs. These include poor hygiene, rats, cockroaches, sores and signs of infection and rotten food. All perfectly understandable, although why a manky tomato should actually occasion disgust is slightly beyond me. For some other people, words can cause just as violent a reaction. I remember a subeditor on another paper who would blench at the mere mention of the word “trousers”. It seemed to induce in him an almost physical pain and he would implore his colleagues never, ever to use that word again. Bad mistake – every time he stepped out of line, such as coming into the office and trying to work with a broken arm, the dreaded “T” word would be uttered and his sang-froid shattered. Another workmate came over all unnecessary if the word “belly” was said in her hearing. Mind you, she was also revolted by “moist” and “wet wipes”, so perhaps she didn’t have the strongest of backbones. Another colleague comes over all nauseous at the word “supper”. Mmm. For others, the revulsion is not physical but intellectual. My wife, normally a most equable woman, cannot abide the misuse of the word feisty, especially in conjunction with “heroine”. (I’ll gloss over feisty alligator in Florida that butted a trapper in an escape attempt, and footballer Paul Pogba’s feisty interview.)

During the EU referendum, I seem to remember getting a full two columns out of Bpop Live, the concert to promote Brexit, featuring the sounds of Nigel Farage and Phats and Small – and that event never even happened. Another mixture of speakers and musical acts, some of whom had not lost court battles to trade under their own name, Bpop Live was pulled after failing to fill much past row B of the Genting Arena in Birmingham. The trouble with these political concerts is you need to make the offering really enticing, or you are left with a bit of a horror show. It’s not Bestival; it’s Worstival. No such fate awaits Labour Live, which will be going ahead at White Hart Lane recreation ground on 16 June even if Len McCluskey has to rush in a one-member, one-free-ticket ruling. Have you got tickets, which were priced at £35? What do you mean: “It’s literally the first Saturday of the World Cup and – shoot me if you like – I’d rather watch France and then the Argies than John McDonnell”? That’s crazy talk. Admittedly, the event is perceived as having run into a few problems, not least the lineup. There was rather a lot of hype around Labour Live when it was announced, suggesting it would be the biggest and most slickly stage-managed political rally since any of the ones it’s tasteful to mention. Following Jeremy Corbyn’s very well-received appearance at Glastonbury last summer, it was expected that Labour could bring together some of the biggest entertainment properties in the Corbynverse – a sort of Infinity Rally featuring Stormzy and Lily Allen and whatnot. That was then. For whatever reason, Labour Live’s headliners are now the Magic Numbers (ask yer dad). Incredible, really, to think of the sheer volume of agents who have told their Corbyn-supporting clients that they are simply NOT doing this. I wonder what lies they have told? “No one but no one wants you to appear at this more than me, but the record company just won’t have it. It’s heartbreaking, but my hands are tied.” Still, Jermain Jackman will be there, and Hookworms, and Reverend and the Makers (again, your dad can help), and the gig will obviously feat. Jeremy Corbyn. So the situation could be a lot worse. The problem with anti-EU concert Bpop Live was all the booked artistes pulling out when they discovered it was an anti-EU concert. This will not be the case with Labour Live. Pretty sure that when my colleague Owen Jones says he is going to be somewhere, he honours his commitment – unlike East 17 or the two remaining members of 5ive, who binned off Bpop Live when it started to look like a shitter. Even so, there are whispers that Labour could be in for a big financial hit on the event, never mind the PR awks of a sparsely filled venue. To this end, none other than Unite boss McCluskey has had to step in to get the show back on track, which – creatively – feels akin to the moment Bob Geldof got promoter Bill Graham on board for the US side of Live Aid. Indeed, it’s a shame Labour Live can’t avail itself of someone with even a hundredth of the talent and soul of the legendary and extraordinary Graham, who always spoke with wistful power of the cultural moment of 70s rock, where the possibility of immense change felt real and within the grasp of a generation. Then again, instinct suggests there are – how to put this? – other aspects of contempo Labour discourse that would have put Graham right off association with them. Anyway, they have got Len instead, which in one sense isn’t weird – he already has form as a mood-music promoter. As for his strategy on this occasion, Unite announced a couple of weeks ago that it is giving away 1,000 tickets and would even organise free transport to the event. Since then, Labour HQ has made further offers of free tickets to constituency Labour parties, along with promises to lay on transport. And this week, the Labour party announced: “We’re offering a limited number of £10 tickets to under-27s. But you’ve got to be quick!” Of course you have. Like the saying goes: the early bird catches the people who bought early bird tickets. “Is there a process to try and reclaim costs?” one irked Labour supporter wondered on Twitter. “I’ve spent £70 on two tickets.” There isn’t, alas. As a Labour spokeswoman told the Observer last Sunday: “Labour Live is one of the ways we’re continuing to open up politics to a wider audience and spread Labour’s message about how we can build a society that works for the many, not the few.” It certainly works for the many who are being given free tickets – but arguably less so for the few who paid actual money for them. I hope the latter group of suckers learns their lesson: participating in capitalism always gets you screwed over, while waiting for a free handout builds a concert we can all be proud of. I also hope the person in charge of this eccentric ticketing process will be chief secretary to the Treasury within four years. So there you have it. We have not yet got to the stage of needing to put on a concert to save the concert, but there is a clear sense that the Labour press office would now literally rather talk about the realities of their Brexit position than Labour Live. However, anti-Corbyn elements should not be tempted to fall into any traps with this one. Those seeking to extrapolate Corbyn’s electoral prospects should avoid reading anything whatsoever from Labour Live’s ticket sales data. After all, as mentioned, Brexit couldn’t sell out a Birmingham arena during the referendum campaign itself, but – yes, here it comes – just look what it’s selling out now! Woody Allen seeks new job: the face of #MeToo Exciting news this week for the #MeToo movement, which has caught the eye of the man who for so long was the holy grail of aspirational Hollywood actors. For decades, working with Woody Allen was always the greatest honour for any movie star, until – basically overnight – it wasn’t. Indeed, the director’s insistence on making an estimated 12 films a year meant that a couple of movies were still in post-production when the deluge of voices suddenly saying they would never work with him again broke. This left the stars of those movies in the odd position of being contractually obliged to promote the very same forthcoming films for which they were already apologising for appearing in. Whatever. The director himself has other fish to fry. “I should be the poster boy for the #MeToo movement,” explained Allen this week. “Because I have worked in movies for 50 years. I’ve worked with hundreds of actresses and not a single one — big ones, famous ones, ones starting out — have ever suggested any kind of impropriety at all. I’ve always had a wonderful record with them.” Well. I don’t think any women’s movement can really be regarded as having made it until a man wants to be its figurehead – and if the ladies of #MeToo are serious about taking this to the next level, they should do more than just place these peerless credentials on file."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"environment/2018/jun/07/pesticide-use-in-the-uks-intensive-agriculture","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-07T17:12:01Z","webTitle":"Pesticide use in the UK’s intensive agriculture | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jun/07/pesticide-use-in-the-uks-intensive-agriculture","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/jun/07/pesticide-use-in-the-uks-intensive-agriculture","fields":{"headline":"Pesticide use in the UK’s intensive agriculture","bodyText":"Guy Smith of the National Farmers’ Union says (Letters, 4 June) that there has been “no intensification of agriculture in the UK for 25 years”, and that government figures show pesticide use has been “significantly reduced”. No they don’t. Government figures show the number of active substances – the actual chemicals applied to three major UK crops (wheat, onions and potatoes) – have increased between six and 18 times (that is, between 600% and 1,800%) from the 1970s to 2014. And as recent Guardian investigations have found, there has been a significant growth in large-scale pig and poultry production, and recently you revealed the arrival, albeit just a few at the moment, of US-style beef lots in the UK (Report, 30 May). UK dairy herds have been getting ever larger over recent years, with the growth of dairy systems where the cows are kept indoors all their life, with feed brought to them, and no grazing on grass. These are all undesirable trends for English farmers, squeezed by rising costs and falling prices, and as we face government policy that rightly wants us to compete on the world market on the basis of high animal welfare, high environmental standards and high quality. Peter Melchett Policy director, Soil Association • Guy Smith of the National Farmers’ Union tells only half the story when he says pesticide use in the UK has been significantly reduced. What he is referring to is the weight of pesticides, and on that point alone he is correct. In 1990 the weight of active substances applied was 34,500 tonnes compared to 17,1800 tones in 2015. But weight is not the significant factor. Toxicity is. Many of the pesticides on the market now are more toxic than they used to be and so farmers apply less weight of pesticides to do the same job. What Guy Smith fails to mention is that the total area of UK farmland treated with pesticides has increased sharply, almost doubling between 1990 and 2015. Crops are now commonly treated with 20 different pesticides in a season. There is little doubt that such increase has had a significant effect on the loss of biodiversity in our farmed landscape. A radical overhaul of our farming system, rather than comforting platitudes from the NFU, is required to reverse this trend.

But never for sports, not at least since Washington’s NFL team won three Super Bowls between 1983 and 1992. DC is a government town, and sports never seemed to fit the image. That changed every night of hockey’s Stanley Cup finals, as fans came, wearing red hats, red shirts and carrying signs that said “Rock The Red”. At first the crowds started small, but within a few hours, a crimson river snaked around the Capital One Arena, lapping at the steps of the National Portrait Gallery. All because the red-clad Washington Capitals were on the big screen, and on the verge of the city’s first professional sports championship in 26 years. Game 5 on Thursday night ended in elation for them as the Capitals won the Stanley Cup with a 4-3 come-from-behind win in Las Vegas. Back in Washington, Capitals fans celebrated into the night. Despite the city’s championship drought, Washington sports fans are often not described as “long-suffering” or “resilient” or “downtrodden” as they are in other cities. Mostly because the national perception of DC has been that it isn’t a sports town at all – too consumed with politics and other important business to care about anything else. It’s a sense so ingrained in the area’s identity that seven years ago the Washington Post raised the question: “Why is Washington DC a mediocre sports town?” “I would say we are a good sports town – we just don’t have the attitude and aggression that New York and Philadelphia fans have,” Christopher Sargent, who has lived his 40 years in the Virginia suburbs and is a passionate fan of all of DC’s teams. Something is changing, though and, it’s not just the Capitals’ Stanley Cup run. Suddenly the sports city that never was a sports city is popping up in headlines worldwide. Next month, the Washington Nationals will host baseball’s All-Star Game at their stadium, which is only three blocks from Audi Field, the new ground for Major League Soccer’s DC United, who appear close to acquiring Wayne Rooney. There appears to be an excellent chance England’s leading scorer could be with the United team for the stadium’s mid-July opening. And while all of this might seem coincidental, it is not. What is happening now is part of a slow build over the past 15 years, designed to make Washington what it has become: a sports city. “Mayor Bowser likes to say: ‘This isn’t your grandfather’s Washington DC,’” Mayor Muriel Bowser’s chief of staff, John Falcicchio, told the Guardian this week. The new interest in sports is a big part of that, he added. Two decades ago, DC had only an NFL team inside their borders. Its hockey and basketball teams played in an arena located along the Beltway in Landover, Maryland. There was no baseball team, following two failed attempts – the last of which ended in 1971. But then the Capital One Arena opened in 1997, bringing the Capitals and the NBA’s Wizards into the city, and then baseball moved the Montreal Expos to town in 2005, prompting the building of Nationals Park. Now only the NFL team is left out, having moved in 1997 to the same area where the basketball and hockey teams had played. “What we are looking to do is diversify our economy,” Falcicchio said, speaking about a general policy over four regimes of DC mayors to lure sports teams and big sports events to town. “What we are looking to do is find ways to capture more tourists, and sports is a key driver – we kind of have something for everyone. It has given a vibrancy to our city.” Sargent said: “That’s part of the experience of a fan here now, going into the city to see DC sports teams representing DC.” None of this has come cheap. Washington has spent more than $700m of public money on pro sports facilities, this century and is looking to throw more at taking the RFK Stadium site (the NFL team’s old home stadium), not far from the Capitol building, as a possible location for new football stadium. A cost the mayor’s office feels is worth it, because the new stadiums have allowed developers to invest in huge new buildings filled with offices, hotels, apartments and restaurants. All of these developments, they insist, bring jobs. An example is the new Wizards practice facility and arena for the WNBA’s Mystics, that is being built on an abandoned portion of the St Elizabeth’s mental health hospital in Ward 8, one of the city’s poorest neighborhoods. “We’re excited about the jobs that will create,’’ Falcicchio said. It’s a steep price to be considered big-league, and one not without risks. Many sports economists have warned that building sports stadiums and chasing big events (which DC has in recent Olympics and World Cup bids) might create a buzz but doesn’t always translate into value. “Professional sports teams create very few full-time-equivalent jobs for local residents,” Victor Matheson, a Holy Cross sports economics professor said. “An NFL team employs local game day workers, but that works out to fewer than 100 full-time jobs, and these are minimum wage jobs. Only a few jobs go to locals: sales, marketing, lower-level administration. A typical Macy’s department story will hire more local workers than an NFL team. Plus, given the fact that DC is a large, super-rich metro area, the area is super desirable [for sports teams] – even without subsidies.” American cities have been building themselves around professional sports for decades now. DC, in many ways, is following a well-used blueprint. Some have had success, too. Matheson pointed to Indianapolis, which used the Colts’ move from Baltimore in 1984 to cast the city as a top destination for events like the Super Bowl and college basketball, eventually convincing the NCAA to move its headquarters there. Another, he said, is Los Angeles, which has used existing facilities and private financing to take on the 2028 Olympics and absorb 10 professional sports teams in Los Angeles and Orange counties. Washington, he added, is not a city that needs to embrace sports to be relevant. “If you need an MLS team to find DC on a map, you really need a new map,” he wrote. But if DC can find a place for an NFL stadium, the city will have five major pro sports teams inside its borders. An amazing number for a city that is just 68 sq miles and has vast swaths of federal parks and monuments. The major impediment might be a 2013 district council resolution that demands the NFL team change their team name from “Redskins” – which the council called “insulting and debasing”. The team owner, Daniel Snyder, has refused to consider a name change. When asked about the name issue, Falcicchio said: “The council has weighed in on the name and we are focusing on what the [RFK] site can be.” He also said: “The last time the NFL team won they were in Washington.” Not the suburbs. A clear message that the sports town that was never a sports town is trying hard to really be a sports town."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/live/2018/jun/09/french-open-2018-sloane-stephens-simona-halep-live-score","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-09T15:35:12Z","webTitle":"Simona Halep beats Sloane Stephens to win French Open title – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2018/jun/09/french-open-2018-sloane-stephens-simona-halep-live-score","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/live/2018/jun/09/french-open-2018-sloane-stephens-simona-halep-live-score","fields":{"headline":"Simona Halep beats Sloane Stephens to win French Open title – as it happened","bodyText":"Here’s Kevin Mitchell’s report from Roland Garros on Simona Halep’s long-awaited first grand slam victory.

The world No1 has won a grand slam final for the first time in four tries and busted the narrative that she’s a player who comes up short in the big moments. Third set: Halep 3-6, 6-4, 6-1 Stephens: Stephens is not giving up without a fight. She’s hanging in the rallies and has gotten it to 30-all. But Halep puts away an overhand smash to set up championship point ... and she converts! Halep becomes the first Romanian to win a grand slam in 40 years since her mentor Virginia Ruzici won Roland Garros in 1978. Third set: Halep 3-6, 6-4, 5-1 Stephens* (*denotes server): Stephens mixes in a couple of errors to fall behind love-30 and Halep is two points from her first grand slam championship. The American wins three quick points, but Halep gets the best of her in alother long rally for deuce. A few more errors by the Romanian and Stephens is finally on the board in the third. Now Halep will serve for the title. Third set: *Halep 3-6, 6-4, 5-0 Stephens (*denotes server): It’s an elementary hold for Halep and now Stephens will serve to stay in the tournament after the changeover. Third set: Halep 3-6, 6-4, 4-0 Stephens* (*denotes server): A critical moment for Stephens at 30-all as she can’t afford to fall behind a double break. Halep gifts her a point on a clumsy return, but forces deuce with a vicious backhand winner at the end of a lengthy rally. Now Halep has a break-point chance when Stephens can’t return a volley and she’s converted when the American misses again at the net! Third set: *Halep 3-6, 6-4, 3-0 Stephens (*denotes server): Halep moves ahead 30-love and she’s won 14 of the last 20 points. Stephens hits back for a few points, but the indefatigable Halep is able to outlast the increasingly tired-looking American in another extended rally to earn the hold and consolidate the break. Third set: Halep 3-6, 6-4, 2-0 Stephens* (*denotes server): Stephens falls behind 15-30 and is in danger of falling behind an early break. She levels at 30-all with a powerful forehand winner, but misses on a backhand down the line and Halep has a break-point chance early in the decider. And she converts! Third set: *Halep 3-6, 6-4, 1-0 Stephens (*denotes server): An early look at a break for Stephens, who goes ahead love-30 on Halep’s serve after the Romanian errs in a couple of rallies. Halep levels with a gorgeously struck backhand winner down the line, then Stephens makes another unforced error and blinks at the end of an extended rally. A nice hold for Halep from love-30 down. Second set: Halep 3-6, 6-4 Stephens* (*denotes server): From 30-all, Stephens makes an error on a backhand and Halep has a look as a break point that could force a third set. And the world No1 converts when Stephens sprays another backhand wide! We’re heading to a decider at Roland Garros. Second set: *Halep 3-6, 5-4 Stephens (*denotes server): Halep holds in a tight game that features a series of marathon rallies and Stephens will now serve to stay in the second set. Second set: Halep 3-6, 4-4 Stephens* (*denotes server): Stephens runs out to 40-love, including her first ace of the afternoon, and has won seven straight points. She mixes in a few more unforced errors, but comes out in top on a baseline rally to earn the hold and they’re at 4-all in the second. Second set: *Halep 3-6, 4-3 Stephens (*denotes server): And just when it seems like the second set has slipped away from Stephens, she capitalizes on a series of forehand unforced errors by Halep for triple break point and winds up breaking at love when Halep goes wide on an inside-in return. All even in the second. Second set: Halep 3-6, 4-2 Stephens* (*denotes server): From 30-all, Stephens nets a backhand then a forehand and Halep breaks again. She’s won four straight games and is on the verge of forcing a third and deciding set. A dramatic swing in form. Second set: *Halep 3-6, 3-2 Stephens (*denotes server): Halep’s level has climbed while Stephens’ has dipped. She holds at love and has won eight straight points. Second set: Halep 3-6, 2-2 Stephens* (*denotes server): Halep hangs in a long rally and hits a winner, then Stephens double-faults and it’s love-30. Big chance for Halep here. Now another winner for Halep and she will have three looks at a break point to even the match. She will need only one and Stephens forehand sprays a return wide. Second set: Halep* 3-6, 1-2 Stephens (*denotes server): A great game by Halep, who comes up trump with a thrashing forehand to finish the job. Still a long way to go yet. And with that, here’s Bryan to take you through the rest of this final at Roland Garros. Second set: Halep 3-6, 0-2 Stephens* (*denotes server): Halep leaves the court wide open, allowing Stephens to gobble up the space and storm in at 30-15. And then she earns another winner, about 8ft from the baseline. When it’s your day, it’s your day. Stephens is seemingly winning all of the big points out on Chatrier. Second set: Halep* 3-6, 0-1 Stephens (*denotes server): Stephens comes out on top of a preposterous rally, which she clinches with a sweet, angled forehand, showcasing a glorious mix of agility and poise. Halep is outdoing Stephens in terms of forced errors, 17-6, and that’s conducive at an occasion like this. Stephens tries a drop shot at 15-0, but it plops into the net - a rare misstep from the American. Her defence has been great throughout the match and she stays in the point at 30-15 before sending another shot into the net. Then Halep plays a drop shot of her own! And it works beautifully as Stephens can’t quite get to it. Stephens shows her defence again though and a big serve takes the US Open champ to set point. Sloane then batters away at her opponent whose final shot of the set is VERY wide. First set: *Simona Halep 3-5 Sloane Stephens (*denotes server) A fairly comfortable hold for Halep but Stephens will not serve for the set and there’s not much evidence she won’t close out easily [prepares for Halep to break]... First set: Simona Halep 2-5 Sloane Stephens* (*denotes server) Halep has a glimpse of daylight at 0-15 when Stephens is out of position but she can’t quit land her forehand where she needs to. Sloane then commits an error of her own sending a forehand wide to make it 15-30. It’s a rocky game for both players - Halep has a chance to bring up her first break point of the match at 30-30 but a sloppy shot ends that hope and Stephens survives. First set: *Simona Halep 2-4 Sloane Stephens (*denotes server) As much as Halep has looked a little tight in this match, Stephens has been superb. If Halep is committing errors, it’s because her opponent has put her under so much pressure she needs to switched on for every point in order to beat her. A welcome hold for Halep after Stephens nets at 40-30. First set: Simona Halep 1-4 *Sloane Stephens (*denotes server) How does Simona recover from that break? Well, she’s battling hard. She looks completely lost at 15-30 but somehow gets back into the point before an errant shot ends her hopes. She goes on to lose the game. Halep is giving it everything but Stephens is simply too good at the moment – and the unforced errors are starting to creep in. First set: *Simona Halep 1-3 Sloane Stephens (*denotes server) In the crowd is Jozy Altidore, who has a bit of time off this summer to follow his girlfriend Sloane Stephens now that the US had that little bit of misfortune around the World Cup. In fact, the TV feed cuts to Sloane warming up with a football before the match. Her close control is as good, if not a little better, than Jozy’s. Anyway, tennis: Halep has Stephens crashing around the baseline at 15-30 before an overhead at the net takes us to 30-30. But a crushing forehand is too good for Halep and we have our first break point. Stephens guides Halep around the court and she can’t get enough of a forehand and nets it. First set: Simona Halep 1-2 *Sloane Stephens (*denotes server) Halep has taken Navartilova’s advice and is being very aggressive compared to her performance last year. She gets a little more success than in Stephens’s first service game and takes her to 40-30 but can’t force a break point. First set: *Simona Halep 1-1 Sloane Stephens (*denotes server) Let’s see how Simona responds after the dominant game from Stephens. It’s not quite as smooth as the American’s effort and she looks more nervous than her opponent, although she famously has issues with that area of her game. It goes to deuce after great defence from Stephens at 40-30 but Halep battle through at advantage. The Romanian is having trouble breaking down her opponent though, even when she’s on top in rallies. Early days though... First set: Simona Halep 0-1 *Sloane Stephens (*denotes server) If Sloane has any nerves in her second grand slam final she is showing exactly zero signs of them. She leaps out to a 40-0 lead on her own serve. There’s a brief hiccup when she sends a forehand long but a lovely winner down the line secures the game. This French Open has seen a little disruption from rain but that shouldn’t be a problem today. There a 20% chance of rain during the match so I’d say there’s an ... 80% chance we should have uninterrupted action. The players are out on court now and warming up. Just a reminder than Halep is going for her first grand slam title and Sloane Stephens her second in the last nine months (and, to be fair, her second in 20 years). Morning. Martina Navratilova - who knows a thing or two about winning majors - thinks Simona Halep will need to be a little more aggressive than last year if she’s to capture her first grand slam: “For me, the mistake Halep made in last year’s French Open final against Jelena Ostapenko was that she played too defensively, that she played not to lose. But champions learn from their mistakes so I don’t think she’s going to make the same mistake twice in the same situation, which is why I expect her to play aggressively against Stephens,” she wrote on the WTA site. Bryan will be here shortly, in the meantime here’s how the two finalists got here: It is testimony to the depth of their friendship that Sloane Stephens’s perfectly shaped backhand down the line to put Madison Keys out her misery and out of their French Open semi-final on Thursday was struck almost apologetically. When it landed like a merciful knife into the deuce corner to end their one‑sided match in just an hour and 17 minutes, the winner raised her arms in celebration, smiled broadly then looked immediately up the court on a packed Philippe-Chatrier to commiserate with her fellow American. She played an almost perfect defensive game, soaking up seven aces and keeping her mistakes to a minimum, to win 6-4, 6-4 and book a place in the final on Saturday against the world No 1, Simona Halep, who earlier took an hour and a half to break down the resistance of Garbiñe Muguruza, 6-1, 6-4.

Louis-Auguste Cézanne was a self-made man who rose from humble origins to a position of wealth and power in Aix-en-Provence. His son’s portrait shows him as a stern, raw character who mystifies and perhaps frightens the young artist.

Her upset victory was cheered as a resounding win for the activist left – and a repudiation of centrist politics. But Eastman says that’s not how Democrats in Omaha viewed the race. “People were just excited to have someone stand up for their values,” Eastman said. “While those values are tagged as progressive, I think people here see it as common sense.” In the aftermath of the 2016 election, the rivalry between supporters of Hillary Clinton and those of Bernie Sanders consumed the debate over the future of a party still shell-shocked by defeat. The ideological tug-of-war was a defining feature of the contest to lead the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and it animated a number of political races last year. But as the 2018 midterm primaries play out across the country, the “civil war” that once threatened to undermine Democrats’ path to power appears to be little more than a skirmish in the all-consuming battle they are waging against Trump. That fight has produced a historic number of Democratic female candidates and set the stage for what analysts believe could be a “wave” election for the party in November. “Democrats remember how miserable they felt on election night and how they have felt every day since then,” said Larry Sabato, the director of the University of Virginia Center for Politics. “That feeling – ‘the Trump effect’ – is helping to cap the volcano. Were it not for Trump, however, I think the volcano of Democratic fractiousness would erupt all over the nation.” He added: “I do think Democrats are relearning that old lesson that a bird cannot fly on one wing, and neither can a party.” Primary contests so far this year have produced a string of victories for both wings of the Democratic party. Progressives notched successes in Pennsylvania, Nebraska and Idaho while more establishment-friendly candidates celebrated wins in Illinois, Texas and California.. Yet many races do not fit neatly into the centrist-v-progressive construct. In the Georgia Democratic primary for the governorship, Stacey Abrams, a progressive former state house leader, won the race with support from both Clinton and Sanders. On the same night, Amy McGrath, a former marine fighter pilot and first-time candidate, defeated Jim Gray, the mayor of Lexington, who the party had believed would be a stronger candidate in Kentucky. “There may be something much simpler and more powerful than ideology at work here,” David Wasserman, a political analyst at the non-partisan Cook Political Report, wrote recently: “Democratic primary voters’ intense desire to nominate women in 2018.” To be sure, there are certain issues and races that have plunged the party back into the bitterness of 2016 . The DNC’s “unity reform commission”, which was established to heal the divide between supporters of Clinton and Sanders, is still wrangling over the role of superdelegates in the party’s primary system. And in New York, tensions flared when the DNC chair, Tom Perez, intervened in the gubernatorial race to endorse Governor Andrew Cuomo against the insurgent candidate – the actor and progressive favorite Cynthia Nixon. During a live interview with the Washington Post this week, Sanders said Perez’s endorsement of Cuomo was “absolutely” a mistake and “not what the DNC chair should be doing”. Democratic party officials have intervened in certain congressional races to help the candidate they believe has the best chance of winning the general election succeed in a crowded primary contest. The strategy, which drew progressive backlash in Texas, paid off this week in California, where a glut of candidates threatened to split the share of Democratic voters and produce all-Republican ballots in November under the state’s “jungle primary” system. In order to win back the House, the Democratic party must be willing to intervene in primary races as it did in California, says Elaine Kamarck, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institutution and member of the DNC. “The path to a Democratic majority does not run through deep blue districts. The path runs through purple and slightly red districts,” Kamarck said, adding: “The irony here is that the party must win in places where the progressive message doesn’t work as well in order to get close to a place where you can have a progressive agenda.” The tug of the party’s progressive wing didn’t begin with Sanders’s entrance into the 2016 presidential race.But Stephanie Taylor, the co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, credits him with helping to bring the left’s economic populist agenda into the mainstream. Ideas like a European-style healthcare system, once dismissed as magical thinking, now has the support of more than half of House Democratic lawmakers and one-third of the Senate caucus. “That the question around healthcare is no longer ‘Should we fix the Affordable Care Act?’ but ‘What is the best way to get to universal healthcare?’ is a radical departure from where we were,” Taylor said. According to an analysis by Brookings, 42% of non-incumbent Democratic candidates label themselves progressives, compared with just 14% in 2014 and 13% in 2016. Among them is Eastman. She faces an uphill battle to oust the Republican incumbent, Don Bacon, in the conservative-leaning district. “I’m running because I feel a sense of desperation in the country and I think a lot of people feel similarly,” Eastman said. “And,” she added, “we learned from 2016 that people are willing to take a bet on political outsiders.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jun/07/the-guardian-view-on-northern-ireland-and-abortion-the-mounting-demand-for-change","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-07T17:35:47Z","webTitle":"The Guardian view on Northern Ireland and abortion: the mounting demand for change | Editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/07/the-guardian-view-on-northern-ireland-and-abortion-the-mounting-demand-for-change","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/07/the-guardian-view-on-northern-ireland-and-abortion-the-mounting-demand-for-change","fields":{"headline":"The Guardian view on Northern Ireland and abortion: the mounting demand for change","bodyText":"The moral case for the reform of Northern Ireland’s harsh abortion laws, which forbid terminations even in the case of rape or fatal foetal abnormalities, has long been clear. But the sweeping victory for reform in the Irish abortion referendum last month made it starker than ever. The logical case is obvious: the restrictions do not prevent but displace abortions, with women travelling across the Irish Sea to end their pregnancies. The political case is equally evident: poll after poll has shown that voters in Northern Ireland believe the law must change. Now the supreme court has laid out the legal case. By a narrow majority, the judges of the UK’s highest court ruled that it had no jurisdiction to consider the legal challenge brought by the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission because there was no actual or potential victim involved. (A Belfast woman now plans to challenge the law in her home city’s high court.) They could have stopped there. Instead, the majority went on to state that the current law is incompatible with the right to respect private and family life, guaranteed by the European convention on human rights, in prohibiting abortion in cases of rape, incest and fatal foetal abnormality. Two of the seven concluded that it was also incompatible with the right not to be subjected to inhuman or degrading treatment. Technically speaking, this is not a declaration of incompatibility. But its effect is to make such a declaration unnecessary. The judgment should concentrate the minds of both Theresa May and Arlene Foster. To simply repeat that abortion is a devolved issue is inadequate when it is the UK government that is responsible for compliance on rights. The DUP leader, whose party vehemently opposes abortion reform, accuses others of seeking to circumvent the role of the Northern Ireland assembly. This is utterly disingenuous when the collapse of power-sharing means that the assembly has not sat for almost a year and a half. Central government should be cautious of overriding devolved ones. Such actions can foster local anger and have perilous consequences. But Mrs May has other matters in mind too. She acknowledged in a private meeting of Conservative MPs that she is concerned about the issue’s potential to unsettle crucial Brexit votes. She argued that it may also hamper efforts to restore power-sharing. Most surmise she is more concerned by the precariousness of her own government, propped up by the DUP. But Mrs Foster also has much to lose should their pact collapse, unless she is happy to risk a Jeremy Corbyn government. Mrs May should call her bluff. The restoration of power-sharing is long overdue: Northern Ireland’s politicians should get on with it, and then change the abortion law. For the case for change is uncontestable and the mood in Westminster is toughening. Penny Mordaunt, minister for women and equalities, tweeted of this week’s debate on the law: “Message from NI Secretary of State: NI should take that responsibility. Message from the House of Commons: if you don’t, we will.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"artanddesign/2018/jun/08/malcolm-morley-obituary","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-08T16:53:45Z","webTitle":"Malcolm Morley obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/jun/08/malcolm-morley-obituary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2018/jun/08/malcolm-morley-obituary","fields":{"headline":"Malcolm Morley obituary","bodyText":"Salvador Dalí claimed that Malcolm Morley, the inaugural winner of the Turner prize, was the best painter of his generation, no small accolade given that the artist counted Roy Lichtenstein and Andy Warhol as contemporaries. Morley, who has died aged 86, pioneered two distinct movements in painting. In the 1960s he spearheaded photorealism. Morley’s subjects ranged from picnic to pastoral scenes, but his images of ocean liners, caught in superb detail, are the best known. For his part, the artist preferred the term “superrealist”, and it is true that these paintings are more than mere copies of photographs: the texture and shadows within the work have an uncanny quality, one that perhaps explains the admiration of the surrealist Dalí. By the 1970s, however, Morley had tired of the style. “As soon as a movement is named you know it’s over,” he said. His painting became messier, the brush strokes more obvious, though transport remained an obsession. With Train Wreck (1975), which depicts a derailment surrounded by painted newspaper reports and phrases in Japanese, Chinese and Russian, Morley came to be seen as an early proponent of neo-expressionism, the dominant style of painting in the 1980s, and for which he was included in the influential 1981 group show A New Spirit in Painting, at the Royal Academy in London. The artist appreciated the second tribute even less than the first. “If I had known that I was going to invent horrors like Julian Schnabel and David Salle … I would have cut off my hands,” he once said. In 1984 the artist’s first survey show came to the Whitechapel Gallery in London. It was for this that Morley was nominated for the Turner prize, alongside Gilbert and George, Richard Long, Howard Hodgkin and Richard Deacon. When he received the call telling him he had won, the artist recalled that he was at home on the Bowery, in downtown Manhattan, New York, gazing out of the window at a homeless person defecating in the street. “It felt unreal. Here I was watching this act; the next minute I’m told I’ve won.” Not everyone was impressed however: Waldemar Januszczak, writing in the Guardian, said that while Morley’s Whitechapel show was “fine” the artist could hardly be thought of as British. In fact, Morley took American citizenship in 1991. Malcolm was born in north London to Dorothy Morley, who never revealed the name of his father. When her son was six, Dorothy married a former Welsh miner, an imposing figure known only as Evans who terrified the boy. That year, his mother sent him to a boarding school in Devon, only telling him that he was going, to his horror, when they arrived at the train station. Nonetheless, when home for the holidays, Malcolm seemed to enjoy his wartime childhood, being fascinated by the blitz. “We would go on top of roofs and watch Messerschmitts and Spitfires have dogfights, and bet marbles on who was going to shoot who down.” Malcolm took to model-making, recreating the planes he saw in the skies over London, as well as other military kit. In 1944 he spent weeks making a balsawood miniature of the battleship HMS Nelson. The night he finished it, a doodlebug rocket hit the family home, destroying the front of the house. None of the family was hurt (apart from the dog, Sally) but the model was gone. Morley referenced the memory repeatedly. The 2013 painting B25 Liberator Over Independence, for example, depicts two planes swooping ominously over a warship. An unruly pupil, Morley was often in trouble at school. After receiving the cane, he absconded aged 14, and persuaded the crew of the Salvonia, a tugboat bound for Newfoundland, to take him as ship’s boy. On his return, he took to petty crime in London and ended up at Hewell Grange borstal in Birmingham. There he learned weaving and bricklaying but neither helped him to get on the straight and narrow. Instead he burgled houses and, having turned 18, was sent to jail, first in Portsmouth for six months, and then in Wormwood Scrubs, London, for three years. While incarcerated, Morley came across a copy of Lust for Life, Irving Stone’s 1934 novel featuring the painter Vincent van Gogh. Feeling empathy with Van Gogh’s fraught life, Morley became convinced he too could be an artist. He enrolled in a correspondence course from his cell and, on release in 1951, first painted watercolours of pubs and attempted to sell them to their landlords. Later he went to St Ives and waited at tables because “that’s where I heard the artists were”. A canny parole officer recognised Morley’s talent and got him into Camberwell College of Arts. After a year, in 1953, he transferred to the Royal College of Art – his fees sponsored by Julian Salmon, one of the owners of Lyons tea houses – studying alongside Peter Blake and Frank Auerbach. Following graduation, in 1958, Morley met a young American woman on a bus and followed her to New York. Their short-lived marriage was the first of five for Morley. In Manhattan, he took another job as a waiter. One night a distinguished-looking customer sporting a monocle noticed his accent and asked him what had brought him to the US. On hearing he painted, the man stood up, hugged him, and introduced himself as Barnett Newman. “I almost dropped the fucking tray,” Morley recalled. Through Newman, he fell into the downtown scene, meeting Warhol, Jackson Pollock and Willem de Kooning at the Cedar Street Tavern in Greenwich Village. He became a firm friend of Lichtenstein. His first solo exhibition, in 1964, was at the Kornblee gallery, where he showed a series of abstract works. By his second exhibition at the gallery, in 1967, he was using photorealism, having become fascinated by the ocean liners at Pier 57 in New York. He had been included in the Guggenheim’s pivotal survey The Photographic Image a year earlier and by 1972 he was established enough to take part in Documenta 5 in Kassel, Germany. Yet recognition failed to quell Morley’s rebellious spirit. He was consuming copious amounts of LSD and cocaine and would turn up to a teaching position at Stony Brook University dressed in an assortment of threadbare women’s clothes. In 1974, the artist named by the critic Robert Hughes as “the last wild man of modern art” attacked his own painting with a water pistol when it came to auction (the water pistol was later attached to the canvas, a depiction of Buckingham Palace). Morley showed internationally for the rest of his career, including major retrospectives at the Pompidou Centre in Paris (1993), the Hayward Gallery in London (2001) and the Ashmolean in Oxford (2013). New works were also included in a retrospective in Germany last month. “I don’t believe that artists should run for the office of artist,” he said of his trajectory. “They should be elected.” Morley is survived by his fifth wife, Lida (nee Kruisheer), whom he married in 1989. • Malcolm Morley, artist, born 7 June 1931; died 1 June 2018 • This article was amended on 9 June 2018.

It is not in eastern Europe, not even in central Europe, but the capital of a Baltic state in northern Europe. Founded in 1323 by grand duke Gediminas, who attracted Jewish and German tradesmen and merchants with generous tax exemptions, for centuries it became a destination for those fleeing religious persecution (there was even a Scottish Calvinist community in Vilnius) or tough trade guild regulations. The city’s coat of arms features Saint Christopher, the patron saint of travellers. The same liberal attitude continued through the centuries, and today the city still has its Catholic, Protestant, Jewish and Ruthenian Orthodox quarters. For two centuries from 1569, it was the co-capital of what was then Europe’s biggest empire – the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. Later, Vilnius withstood Russian tsarist and Soviet occupation, and in 1991 gained its freedom and independence. Užupis Republic On 1 April 1997, the Užupis district (the name means “over the river”) declared itself a separate republic, forming a bohemian commune with a president, foreign ministry and even a constitution. During Soviet times, Užupis Street was called the Lane of Death for its crime rate, but it’s safe now, and boasts galleries, boutiques and restaurants. On Thursdays, nearby Tymo Turgus food market is the destination for organic produce: stalls sell homemade cheeses and juniper smoked meats, honey (including linden, clover and forest flowers), pickles, jams and preserves (sea buckthorn and rosehip are local specialities), herbal teas, berries and vegetables. There’s also plenty of streetfood – artisanal burgers and bagels, meat on skewers and pastries – to enjoy to the sound of local DJs. Stop in at Špunka (Užupio g 9), a cosy pub with a wide selection of local beers. • 10am-3.30pm, tymoturgelis.lt National Gallery Vilnians love the Nacionalinė Dailės Galerija, simply called NDG, across the River Neris from the centre. What was the Museum of Revolution has been revamped into a contemporary art gallery. The permanent exhibitions are contemporary and of 20th-century Lithuanian art (though you won’t see our symbolists – the best of them are currently are on loan to Paris’s Musée d’Orsay for its Wild Souls: Symbolism in the Baltic States show). The bookstore is fantastic, and the restaurant has a river view and a European menu that changes weekly. • Konstitucijos prospektas 22, ndg.lt Stikliai Hotel The Stikliai (Glassblowers) hotel was the first five-star hotel in Vilnius to open after independence in 1990. Yet it is relatively affordable, with rooms from €144. It’s in the former Jewish quarter, with easy access to all the main sights. There is a pool in the basement, a closed atrium with greenery and a comfortable conservatory which is a locals’ favourite place for a nightcap. Pastry shop “Ponių laimė” (Ladies’ Joy) across the street belongs to the same owners and all the fruits served in the hotel come from their eco-farm in Dubingiai, 50km north of the city. More affordable is the Amberton Hotel, which overlooks Cathedral Square and has doubles from €98 B&amp;B. • stikliaihotel.lt Restaurants Most good restaurants in the city are determined to use only locally sourced organic produce, taking inspiration from the seasons and adding a contemporary twist to traditional Lithuanian recipes. Publication of the annual list of Lithuania’s 30 best restaurants is hotly anticipated. Most restaurants in the top 30 are reasonable, with mains from €20. Try the local fish – pike, sturgeon and smoked eel – at places like Dine; and mushrooms at restaurants such as Gaspar’s or Somm (try anything with boletus). Beetroot is in vogue – from crisps to tartares to ice-creams – and is popular on the menu at Dziaugsmas. Gate of Dawn The chapel in the Gate of Dawn in the former city wall hosts our famous Madonna, in radiant gold and silver. Painted by an unknown artist, it was placed over the gates in the 16th century to protect the city from enemies and is said to have miraculous powers. There are copies in Saint Peter’s in Rome, in Paris, Venice and South America. Fortunately, a Soviet plan to demolish the gates in the 1950s to make way for the avenue leading to the station was abandoned. Locals go there to pray, and they continue the tradition of bringing ex votos – silver and gilt hearts, arms and legs, representing body parts that were healed. The walls of the shrine are covered with thousands of them. • Aušros Vartų 14, ausrosvartai.lt St John’s Church For an overview of the extensive Unesco-listed old town, take the lift (open May-October) up the belltower of St John’s Church and climb the last few steps to the open balcony. There, 60 metres up, you’ll notice German gothic, Italian baroque and French classicist architecture, plus Russian Orthodox domes and the labyrinth of the Jewish quarter, all surrounded by green hills. Several scenes of the BBC’s 2016 adaption of War &amp; Peace were shot within this view. • University Street, muziejus.vu.lt Church of St Peter &amp; Paul Aristocratic 18th-century Lithuanian travellers were rather unimpressed with London’s St Paul’s Cathedral and noted in their diaries that its interior did not come close to St Peter and Paul’s church in Vilnius. Begun in 1668 it embodies the baroque principle – a balance between control and chaos. There are thousands of sculptures by Giovanni Pietro Perti and his team from Ticino, Switzerland, all in white stucco. Look for the statue of Saint Mary Magdalene in a fashionable dress – it’s said to be a portrait of Perti’s beloved Lithuanian wife, Magdalena. • Antakalnio 1, vilniauspetropovilo.lt Museum of Occupations and Freedom Fights At this sobering must-see, visitors can go into the cells, where, between 1958 and 1987, thousands of Lithuanians were detained, interrogated, tortured and executed. Once a courthouse, it became the Gestapo’s Vilnius HQ after the Nazi invasion, and would have played a role in the murder of much of the country’s Jewish population, before the KGB moved in after the USSR retook the Baltic states during 1944. After that, many who entered this building emerged only to be deported to the gulags of Siberia. You will come out enlightened about the reality of the Soviet socialist system. It is one of the best-rated museums by foreign visitors and essential to understanding the recent history of Lithuania. • Aukų 2A, genocid.lt/muziejus Vilnius City Opera Vilnius is known for its classical musicians and singers – Jascha Heifetz was born and discovered as a prodigy here. The famous mezzosoprano Violeta Urmana is more often on the stage of Milan’s La Scala than at home, but do check the programmes. Directed by a Dalia Ibelhauptaite (wife of British actor and director Dexter Fletcher), the productions are young, ambitious and spectacular , from a half-British team, working with the best of Lithuanian vocal talents, usually heard in Glyndebourne, Covent Garden or Salzburg. Best of all, tickets start from €20. • Congress Palace, Vilniaus 6, on Facebook Botanical garden Vilnius University is home to a venerable botanical garden, founded in 1781 by French professor Jean-Emmanuel Gilibert and later expanded by James Cook’s companion, the botanist Georg Forster. Since 1974 it has been at Kairėnai, on the outskirts of Vilnius, in the woods of a former country manor. May sees an amazing variety of lilacs in bloom, the rhododendron collection is impressive in June, and there are also Japanese gardens. There’s also horse riding – €10-€15 for an hour’s ride, carriage rides from €30 and a barbecue area with picnic tables. • Entry €1.5o, botanikos-sodas.vu.lt Getting there Norwegian and airBaltic fly to Vilnius from Gatwick, Wizz Air flies from Belfast, Doncaster/Sheffield and Luton, and Ryanair from six UK airports. Best time to go 2018 is the centenary of the restored state of Lithuania, which will be celebrated at the Centenary Song Festival (30 June-6 July), with a focus on traditional music, crafts and folklore, culminating in a choir of 20,000 singers and 6,000 dancers performing at Vingis Park. The Christopher Summer Festival (12 July-28 August) features classical, jazz and pop.

The current Mail on Sunday boss will replace Paul Dacre, 69, who is stepping down in November. Lord Rothermere, who controls the two papers, said: “Geordie has been an outstanding editor of the Mail on Sunday, and I am delighted that he will continue the high-quality journalism that Paul has made a hallmark of the Daily Mail for more than 25 years.” A source with knowledge of the discussions told the Guardian that Greig’s appointment was part of a process of “detoxifying the Daily Mail” after Dacre’s editorship. Any change to the Daily Mail’s editorial line on Brexit could have substantial implications for the government. Under Dacre’s leadership, the paper has launched ferocious front-page attacks on public figures who it deems to have challenged the decision to leave the EU. One labelled high court judges “enemies of the people”, another urged Theresa May to “crush the saboteurs” with an early election, and a recent attack on the House of Lords described them as “dinosaurs in ermine”. The paper is regularly the focus of morning news meetings in Downing Street, while Dacre was an early and consistent backer of May’s policies. Greig, 57, however, has repeatedly clashed with Dacre during his stint at the Mail on Sunday. Staff at both papers expressed surprise at the idea the two editors would be able to work together during the transition period, saying there was no love lost between them. The sister news outlets frequently battled during the Brexit campaign, and Greig’s Mail on Sunday has often gone out of its way to rubbish the daily paper’s scoops. Under the new arrangement, according to a company insider, it is expected the two papers will work much closer together, which could result in cost savings and opens the door to potential job cuts. Greig has been in his current position since 2012, having previously edited the London Evening Standard and Tatler magazine. Ted Verity, the deputy editor of the Daily Mail, will take control of the Sunday edition. Greig will have three challenges as Daily Mail editor: keeping the newspaper influential among politicians; ensuring it continues to make money in the face of declining circulation; and stepping out of the shadow of a man who has held the job for a quarter of a century. Dacre’s commitment to the job will be hard to match, according to Adrian Addison, the author of the book Mail Men, an unauthorised history of the newspaper. “He’s a tyrant. He’s a bully. He’s hands-on,” Addison said. “When he first became editor, he would get so wound up near edition time he used to behave like a gorilla and scratch himself so hard that his back would bleed. The blood would come through his shirt. That’s the wound-up tension.” Addison insists that Dacre – one of the most divisive individuals in the newspaper industry – has an impressive understanding of his audience. “He has a natural affinity with the lower middle-class reader. He doesn’t communicate with many members of the public – everything is purely gut instinct and surrounding himself with people who he listens to.” The financial analyst Ian Whittaker, who covers the fortunes of the papers’ parent company DMGT for Liberum Capital, warned against too much change. “From their standpoint, they probably want to keep the formula of a winning product, so I wouldn’t expect that much change in terms of direction of the Mail.” Whittaker speculated that giving the job to Greig could constitute a risk to the Daily Mail’s income unless the editor was willing to compromise on his political views. “You don’t want what happened to the Express 20 years ago,” said Whittaker, referring to when the Mail and the Express were locked in a battle for readers. “The Express decided to support Tony Blair, it annoyed its readership, and its circulation took a hit.” Greig, however, has form for bold gestures. When the old Etonian took over the Evening Standard in 2009, he issued a series of advertisements saying “sorry” to Londoners for the previous editor’s coverage. Behind the scenes, there is much discussion of the role played by the Rothermere family, who have a controlling interest in DMGT, especially the current owner’s wife, Lady Rothermere. It has been suggested the Daily Mail’s relentless pro-Brexit stance has become increasingly problematic among their social circle in Wiltshire, where they built a modern country house and mix with the likes of the fashion designer Jasper Conran. “[Greig] was parachuted in by Rothermere because he’s very good friends with Lady Rothermere – he’s a courtier,” claimed Addison. Greig will inherit a highly profitable print outfit which, together with its Sunday counterpart, delivered income of £219m during the first six months of 2018, despite the Daily Mail’s circulation almost halving over the last 15 years, to sit at 1.3m copies a day. By comparison, MailOnline, which claims to be the biggest English-language news website in the world with tens of millions of readers, brought in just £61m during the same period, albeit with a smaller cost base. Despite enormous success in the US under the editor Martin Clarke, the site recently reported a fall in traffic, which it blamed in part on changes to Facebook’s algorithm. Daily Mail insiders played down the possibility that the print edition, which until now has fiercely guarded its identity, could merge with the celebrity-obsessed MailOnline website in the near future, although there is the possibility that they could work together more closely. “I wouldn’t work on the assumption there are necessarily massive changes planned,” said one source. “But at the same time that doesn’t mean they won’t happen, because once new people are appointed they may decide there are things they want to do.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"money/2018/jun/09/tsb-best-deal-bank-current-accounts","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-09T06:00:16Z","webTitle":"TSB troubles?

He is still indulging his fondness for murder and cannibalism, but not living life on the run because he generally manages to pin his crimes on other people. Or he just eats them. It all takes place in a weird hyper-homicidal world in which the characters from Thomas Harris’s series of Hannibal books – killers, cops, tabloid hacks and freaks – exist at the same time. The show’s secondary character is Will Graham (Hugh Dancy) from Red Dragon, who can visualise murders after they have happened simply by looking at the scene. He serves as sparring partner, sidekick, patient and general ball of wool to the Hannibal cat. Harris nerds love the series, as it foregrounds characters from the books who are so obscure that they were only briefly mentioned in passing, such as serial killer Garret “The Minnesota Shrike” Hobbs, who mounts his victims on deer antlers. Which seems unkind to both the people and the deer. (Sadly, the Clarice Starling and Buffalo Bill characters couldn’t make it to the party due to a usage rights issue.) However, addicts will tell you that what really sets Hannibal apart is the killing, of which there is plenty. The manner of deaths in the series is, appropriately, completely bonkers – whoever came up with them clearly watched the Saw films and thought: “This just isn’t grisly enough.” As well as antler mountings, we see human bodies used as mushroom-patch fertiliser; backs flayed of flesh and turned into ghastly angel wings; a totem pole made of human body parts; and a corn silo full of naked men, all glued together. At one point, a cello is used as a murder weapon. Once we arrive at the halfway point of the second series, though – by which time, the spinning of narrative plates has reached a frenzy – things get silly. Sadly, it is partly Eddie Izzard’s fault. He plays Abel Gideon, a surgeon and an is-he-or-isn’t-he? serial killer. Izzard is the weak link: he’s simply too adorable to pull off a psycho. He runs marathons and tells jokes in French! He looks great in heels! It’s fun for a while, but his relentless Hopkins shtick (Anthony, not Katie) culminates at the point at which grand guignol spills over into outright farce, when he allows Lecter to – how to put this? – cut off his limbs and serve them to him over dinner. At one point, he eats his own leg. Oh, Eddie! It is an absurd development, even by Hannibal’s standards; one that almost compels a viewer to throw their glass of Chianti at the TV. Of course, it’s a nod to the climax of Hannibal the film, in which Ray Liotta’s slimy agent Paul Krendler eats some of his own brain. But then the film Hannibal – and Hannibal Rising for that matter – were always a bit on the duff side anyway. In summary, human-limb totem poles and death by mushroom: fine. Eddie Izzard eating his own leg: TOO SILLY."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"us-news/2018/jun/07/kate-spades-husband-acknowledges-her-fight-with-depression","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-07T17:50:28Z","webTitle":"Kate Spade's husband talks of her struggle with depression","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jun/07/kate-spades-husband-acknowledges-her-fight-with-depression","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/jun/07/kate-spades-husband-acknowledges-her-fight-with-depression","fields":{"headline":"Kate Spade's husband talks of her struggle with depression","bodyText":"The husband of Kate Spade, the American designer who died on Tuesday, has released a statement that addressed his late wife’s struggle with depression. Andy Spade said that he and his daughter Bea were “devastated by her loss, and can’t even begin to fathom life without her”.The handbag and fashion designer, 55, was found dead in her New York apartment by housekeeping staff in what officials called an apparent suicide. “Kate suffered from depression and anxiety for many years,” the statement said. “She was actively seeking help and working closely with her doctors to treat her disease, one that takes far too many lives. “We were in touch with her the night before and she sounded happy. There was no indication and no warning that she would do this. It was a complete shock. And it clearly wasn’t her. There were personal demons she was battling.” Spade met her future husband and business partner Andy at a department store where she was working in 1983. They moved to New York in the mid-1980s and she launched Kate Spade Handbags in 1993. The purchase of one of the handbags soon became a coming of age ritual for a generation of American women. In the statement, Andy explained that although they had been living separately for the past 10 months, they spoke or saw each other every day and co-parented their daughter together. “Our daughter was our priority,” he said. “We were not legally separated, and never even discussed divorce. We were best friends trying to work through our problems in the best way we knew how. “We were together for 35 years. We loved each other very much and simply needed a break.” “This is the truth,” he added. “Anything else that is out there right now is false.” He stressed that she had not been abusing any substances or alcohol, nor had there been any business problems. “I have yet to see any note left behind and am appalled that a private message to my daughter has been so heartlessly shared with the media,” he said. “My main concern is Bea and protecting her privacy as she deals with the unimaginable grief of losing her mother. Kate loved Bea so very much.” In the US, the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline is 1-800-273-8255. In the UK, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org.

Colangelo’s decision comes after allegations last month that he used anonymous Twitter accounts to attack his own players, his predecessor and, strikingly, to defend his dress sense. “It has become clear Bryan’s relationship with our team and his ability to lead the 76ers moving forward has been compromised,” said a statement from 76ers managing partner Josh Harris. “Recognizing the detrimental impact this matter had on the organization, Colangelo offered his resignation. We find the situation to be disappointing for our entire organization. We are determined to continue the tremendous progress we have made over the last two seasons in our quest to win an NBA Championship.” The statement did not say whether the 76ers had found Colangelo guilty of any wrongdoing but confirmed that law firm Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton &amp; Garrison had looked into the matter. The story was originally reported by The Ringer, which found several accounts that could be plausibly linked to Colangelo. Some of the tweets attacked Colangelo’s own players. Particularly damaging were ones that criticized Joel Embiid, one of the young stars the Sixers hope to build their team around. “Too bad that Embiid danced like a fool and the whole disaster happened, next time he will think twice before mocking his team,” said one tweet after Embiid had gone to a Meek Mill concert. Another asked “Why didn’t you tell docs knees hurt before Houston?” Another defended the size of Colangelo’s collars. “That is a normal collar. Move on, find a new slant,” said @Enoughunkownso1, one of the accounts linked to Colangelo after another user had questioned his dress sense. Colangelo admitted that he had used one of the accounts “to keep up with the news” but denied setting up the others. ESPN reports that Colangelo told the 76ers that his wife may have been responsible for the accounts. The NBA commissioner, Adam Silver, would not be drawn on the matter on Thursday. “The notion here was, let’s find out what’s going on,” Silver said. “You have to separate sort of the chatter and sort of what either fans or, frankly, the media are saying from the facts. And the first thing we have to do here is determine what the actual facts are in this circumstance.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"politics/2018/jun/07/labour-shouldnt-run-scared-over-brexit","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-07T17:12:37Z","webTitle":"Labour shouldn’t run scared over Brexit | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jun/07/labour-shouldnt-run-scared-over-brexit","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/jun/07/labour-shouldnt-run-scared-over-brexit","fields":{"headline":"Labour shouldn’t run scared over Brexit","bodyText":"Jonathan Freedland asks why Labour will not back membership of the European Economic Area (EEA), even though this would give it “a chance to inflict defeat on an ailing, failing government” (Opinion, 7 June). The answer should be clear to anyone who has carefully followed the statements made by Jeremy Corbyn and John McDonnell ever since the referendum, in which both gave lukewarm support to remain. They are not necessarily now committed to Brexit, but they are determined that, if it is prevented, or obstructed in any way, Labour should not get the blame. This is why they are so adamantly against having a further referendum, even though a large majority of Labour voters, and probably also of Labour MPs, would support it. Can nothing be done about this? When I was an MP back in the 1970s, on major issues the final decision on how to vote was not always made by the shadow cabinet, but could be put to a vote of the parliamentary Labour party (PLP). Such a procedure would be even more necessary today, because the shadow cabinet, since Ed Miliband’s time, is no longer elected by MPs, but is handpicked by the leader. When the PLP meets on Monday it should be given the opportunity to accept or reject the shadow cabinet’s recommendation on how to vote on the EEA amendment, and also, subsequently on the question of a referendum on the terms finally negotiated. Dick Leonard Former MP for Romford • As ever, Jonathan Freedland is right to highlight how Labour MPs in some leave-voting areas are too worried to back the Lords amendment that would keep Britain in the EEA because they fear it would alienate constituents who want a tougher stance on immigration. But how many Labour MPs have actually consulted their constituents to find out their views two years on from what was effectively a vote in the dark? Have any held public meetings or written to voters explaining the reality – and gravity – of the situation now facing our country? MPs of all parties have a duty to shine a light on the true costs, complexities and undeliverable promises of Brexit and vote for what they believe is in their constituents’ best interests. And if they are scared that voters might boot them out at the next election for doing so, they might want to consider whether they should be representing a constituency whose views are so at odds with their own. Giselle Green London • Fintan O’Toole says that Ireland would not have run Brexit as Britain did (Opinion, 30 May). It would still do good to listen, but this is not happening. After the fact of the Brexit vote, there was a Citizens’ Assembly last September in the UK, which came up with interesting, moderate conclusions. Maybe that was its mistake – it sounded more reasonable than all the campaigning positions we are hearing about. For example, it said that if a deal cannot be reached, it preferred to stay in the customs union and single market to no deal at all. The various voices on Brexit are all talking and not encouraging deliberation. Many of them are isolated from each other and encourage the same division among the public. The Labour party, Best for Britain and others should put their energy and money into consulting a representative sample of UK people, listening to them and publicising their findings, starting with last September’s Citizens’ Assembly. Ann Link Lewes, East Sussex • Thanks, Will Hutton, not just for diagnosing our current paralysis but for presenting a cure in the form of “an educational Marshall plan” (This Brexit is a dead end, 4 June). For a start, as in many other EU countries, citizenship or civics should be taught in all schools – primary and secondary – in England and Wales, by teachers trained in restorative justice, democratic politics, and history with a broad emphasis on Europe, including Britain, as well as on global dimensions. Mixing ideas and practice would produce an exciting curriculum. Bring it on, Will, and as soon as possible.

She is the mother of two sons, and – like Mathilde in Groff’s acclaimed 2015 novel Fates and Furies, named book of the year by both Amazon and Barack Obama – she is furious beyond all measure. Unlike Mathilde, though, she has children, which raises the stakes. Also unlike Mathilde, she has no name. “I have somehow become a woman who yells,” the first story, “Ghosts and Empties”, begins, as the mother tries to keep a cap on her anger for the sake of her family. To keep herself together, she goes walking at night, looking in at her neighbours, their lit windows like “domestic aquariums”: a group of nuns, a psychotherapist who had an affair with one of his patient’s wives (the patient shot the wife to death mid-coitus, then went to prison), a boy on a treadmill. Mostly, however, she observes the mothers of the neighbourhood, “bent like shepherdess crooks, scanning the floor for tiny Legos or half-chewed grapes or the people they once were, slumped in the corners”. Some nights she comes home from her walks still fuming and her husband encourages her to take another lap around the block. “It’s too much, it’s too much,” she shouts at him. When she goes to the drugstore to buy Epsom salts for her aching feet, she is struck by the shop’s “abundance … its aisles of gaudy trash and useless wrapping and plastic pull tabs that will one day end up in the throat of the Earth’s last sea turtle”. She leaves without buying the thing she has come for “because I am not ready for such easy absolution as this. I can’t.” These I can’ts and I won’ts accumulate across the collection, as each of the mothers delves into the reasons for her anger. “We need to constantly push against the narratives we are told to swallow,” Groff said in a New Yorker interview last year. This is what she shows in story after story: a heroic pushback against the way we live now, against waste, against the artificial environments in which we find ourselves maintained by corporations, but equally against the pressures on women to be flawless, effortlessly excellent mothers, wives, sisters, lovers, friends, within this dire state of affairs. Groff’s lyrical and oblique stories catch these women in the midst of becoming aware of their complicity in perpetuating these narratives – to which their response is to walk, flee, or conversely refuse to budge, as in the dazzlingly apocalyptic “Eyewall”, about a woman staying in her house during a hurricane. The well-meaning macho neighbour tries to get her to leave with him but he ends up being “wiped off the road” by the storm, “kiss[ing] the concrete rise of an overpass”. In “Above and Below”, the main character ups and leaves her graduate student existence, with its piled-up debts, and drifts into a more and more marginal life of homelessness. Other stories feature children abandoned by irresponsible adults, who weave in and out of the narratives like selfish giants. Though they are written in a moodily realist mode, the stories are poised just this side of dystopian fiction. The end of the world, or of life as we know it, hovers somewhere in the not unimaginably far-off future. The mother in “Ghosts and Empties” “can’t stop reading about the disaster of the world, the glaciers dying like living creatures, the great Pacific trash gyre, the hundreds of unrecorded deaths of species, millennia snuffed out as if they were not precious. I read and savagely mourn, as if reading could somehow sate this hunger for grief, instead of what it does, which is fuel it.” This is echoed in the last story, “Yport”: “She can’t stop the thought that children born now will be the last generation of humans … She feels it nearing, the midnight of humanity.” Not all of the stories are set in Florida, but if they range out to France several times, and to Brazil once, it is to get perspective on the “back home” from the far away, to juxtapose the Florida heat with the Normandy sea spray. The hot, humid Floridian atmosphere hangs over all the stories; the word “rot” appears in most of them, sometimes more than once. In several, the air-conditioning is out, but the organic presence of the rot and the heat is almost welcome against the “sickly fake cold air” filling most people’s houses. All manner of swamp creatures lurk and threaten; sometimes they breach the safety of the house. “Walk outside in Florida, and a snake will be watching you,” thinks the mother in “Snake Stories”: “snakes in mulch, snakes in scrub, snakes waiting from the lawn for you to leave the pool so they can drown themselves in it, snakes gazing at your mousy ankle and wondering what it would feel like to sink its fangs in deep”. There is something off-kilter in these ecosystems; perhaps it is nature reasserting its primacy against the Anthropocene. Every woman, every snake, is fighting back against the laws of nature, and the human-made Eden that threatens to imprison, or end, them all. • Lauren Elkin’s Flâneuse is published by Vintage. • Florida is published by William Heinemann.

Echoing criticisms from the Russian establishment, Putin questioned why women were coming forward decades after the alleged attacks took place and said he believed the allegations should be addressed by the courts rather than in a media campaign. He presented it as something of a conspiracy. “Certain people or certain organisations that specialise in protecting the rights of women are currently developing an entire process in several western countries, in Hollywood, raising problems that are 10, 20, or 30 years old,” he told reporters shortly after a four-and-a-half hour question and answer show called Direct Line with Vladimir Putin. “I think we need to support the interests of all citizens without regard to gender, religion, age, but the question still begs itself: why is this only being done now? Why not 10 years ago when some of these incidents supposedly took place?” He said that in “any civilised country” the courts and the police should handle similar cases. “I don’t think that we should turn these questions, especially concrete cases, into some kind of campaign,” Putin added. Scores of women have come forward as part of the campaign to reveal sexual harassment and assault by some of the most powerful men in politics and media, among other industries. Harvey Weinstein, the most high-profile target, was accused by more than 13 women of rape, assault and harassment. He was charged with rape and pleaded not guilty to a judge in New York on Tuesday. Putin was asked directly about several accusations of sexual harassment made against Leonid Slutsky, a Russian lawmaker who has been accused of attempting to kiss and grope young female journalists in the Russian Duma and at television studios. Slutsky was cleared by an ethics committee in Russia’s parliament earlier this year. “I haven’t heard about this story,” Putin told journalists."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/jul/12/world-cup-quiz-mascots","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-07-12T10:15:26Z","webTitle":"Quiz: How well do you know the World Cup mascots?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jul/12/world-cup-quiz-mascots","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/jul/12/world-cup-quiz-mascots","fields":{"headline":"Quiz: How well do you know the World Cup mascots?","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"business/2018/jun/07/us-china-zte-deal-fine-sanctions","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-07T16:16:03Z","webTitle":"China's ZTE to pay US $1bn fine in new deal to save company","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jun/07/us-china-zte-deal-fine-sanctions","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/jun/07/us-china-zte-deal-fine-sanctions","fields":{"headline":"China's ZTE to pay US $1bn fine in new deal to save company","bodyText":"The United States and China have reached a deal that allows the Chinese telecommunications giant ZTE to stay in business in exchange for paying an additional $1bn in fines and agreeing to let US regulators monitor its operations. The fine comes after Donald Trump stepped in to save the company after US regulators barred it from doing business in the US, an effective death blow for the company. In addition to the fine, a compliance team chosen by the US will be embedded at ZTE and the Chinese company must change its board and executive team. “ZTE is essentially on probation,” said Amanda DeBusk, chair of the international trade and government regulation practice at Dechert LLP and a former commerce official. “It’s unprecedented to have US agents as monitors … It’s certainly a good precedent for this situation. ZTE is a repeat offender.” The news did little to appease critics. Senator Mark Warner, vice-chairman of the Senate select committee on intelligence, said: “It is the unanimous conclusion of our nation’s intelligence community that ZTE poses a significant threat to our national security. These concerns aren’t new; back in 2012, the House permanent select committee on intelligence released a report on the serious counterintelligence concerns associated with ZTE equipment. “It’s not only that ZTE was busted for evading sanctions on Iran and North Korea, and then lied about it; it’s that ZTE is a state-controlled telecommunications company that poses significant espionage risks, which this agreement appears to do little to address.” In April, the commerce department barred ZTE from importing American components for seven years, having concluded that it deceived US regulators after it settled charges last year of sanctions violations. Instead of disciplining all employees involved, the department said, ZTE had paid some of them full bonuses and then lied about it. The decision amounted to a death sentence to ZTE, which relies on US parts and which announced that it was halting operations. The ban also hurt American companies that supply ZTE. Trump barged into the ZTE case last month by tweeting that he was working with the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, to put ZTE “back in business, fast” and save tens of thousands of Chinese jobs. He later tweeted that the ZTE talks were “part of a larger trade deal” being negotiated with China. Trump has drawn criticism from members of Congress for going easy on the Chinese company. The Democratic senator Chuck Schumer of New York immediately responded to Thursday’s announcement: “Despite his tough talk, this deal with ZTE proves the president just shoots blanks.” Still, the resolution of the ZTE case may clear the way for the US to make progress in its trade talks with China. The two countries have threatened to impose tariffs on up to $200bn worth of each other’s products in a dispute over China’s tactics to supplant US technological supremacy, including demands that US companies hand over trade secrets in exchange for access to the Chinese market. Thursday’s agreement was “a prerequisite for making broader progress”, DeBusk said. “The ZTE case was a thorn in the side for China … For the US to shut down one of China’s largest companies is a very dramatic type of move. It certainly got their attention.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2018/jun/07/sean-hannity-mueller-witnesses-bash-phones","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-07T17:45:56Z","webTitle":"Sean Hannity suggests Mueller witnesses 'bash their phones to pieces'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jun/07/sean-hannity-mueller-witnesses-bash-phones","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/jun/07/sean-hannity-mueller-witnesses-bash-phones","fields":{"headline":"Sean Hannity suggests Mueller witnesses 'bash their phones to pieces'","bodyText":"Sean Hannity is trying a new tactic in his attempts to derail special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation. He suggested to witnesses in the investigation to delete evidence and “bash” their phones with a hammer into “little itsy bitsy pieces”. The Fox News host, who it is reported has replaced Melania Trump as the last person Donald Trump speaks to before he goes to bed each night, was responding to news that Mueller has asked some witnesses to turn in their phones in order to view messages on encrypted apps such as WhatsApp. Mueller made the request after suspicion arose that Paul Manafort was using encrypted services to tamper with witnesses. Hannity gave surprisingly specific instructions: “Delete all your emails and then acid-wash your emails and hard drives on the phones, then take your phones and bash them with a hammer to little itsy-bitsy pieces, use BleachBit, remove the SIM cards and then take the pieces and hand them over to Robert Mueller and say, ‘Hillary Rodham Clinton, this is equal justice under the law.’” Hannity was referring, as he often likes to do, to Clinton’s handling of confidential information while at the state department. The FBI revealed during the election campaign that one of Clinton’s staffers had destroyed two phones with a hammer, something Hannity has brought up dozens of times since then. He prefaced his list of data-destroying techniques by saying “if I advised [the witnesses] to follow Hillary Clinton’s lead”. As Hannity acknowledges, Clinton’s phones were storing sensitive information, and many security experts believe that they were being destroyed to ensure safety rather than to avoid scrutiny. During the Bush administration, Hannity was a staunch supporter of the NSA surveilling programme, data mining and government agencies looking at private messages. He repeatedly attacked Democrats for being weak on national defence for raising privacy concerns about such programmes."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/jun/07/dutch-queens-sister-found-dead-at-home-in-buenos-aires","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-07T15:54:36Z","webTitle":"Dutch queen's sister Inés Zorreguieta found dead at home in Buenos Aires","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/07/dutch-queens-sister-found-dead-at-home-in-buenos-aires","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/07/dutch-queens-sister-found-dead-at-home-in-buenos-aires","fields":{"headline":"Dutch queen's sister found dead at home in Buenos Aires","bodyText":"The youngest sister of Queen Máxima of the Netherlands has been found dead in her apartment in Bueno Aires. Inés Zorreguieta, 33, who worked as a researcher at the United Nations in Panama and was also a talented guitarist, was reported by Argentinian and Dutch media to have killed herself. The King of the Netherlands, Willem-Alexander, and Queen Máxima are flying to Argentina for the funeral. Zorreguieta enjoyed a close relationship with her sister and was bridesmaid at her wedding to the then Dutch Crown Prince Willem-Alexander in 2002. She was godmother to the royal couple’s youngest daughter, Princess Ariane, 11. The Queen, originally from Argentina, was said by the royal household to be “very shocked and very sad”. Máxima, 47, has two brothers, Martin and Juan, and three half sisters, Maria, Dolores and Ángeles. The Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, said: “The sudden death of Queen Máxima’s sister comes as a big shock. It is intensely sad and heartbreaking news that can hardly be comprehended for those who stay behind. “With our hearts and our thoughts we are with the queen and her family. I wish them all the strength necessary to carry this horrible loss together. And I trust that they will get the peace and space for that.” A Dutch government spokesperson told Dutch NOS TV that Zorreguieta’s death appeared to have been suicide. Zorreguieta was a psychologist who worked on social policies at the office of Argentina’s president, Mauricio Macri. She had also worked for the social development ministry in Buenos Aires province and at a UN office in Panama. Her father, Jorge Horacio Zorreguieta, who served as agriculture minister during Argentina’s brutal military dictatorship, died last year in Buenos Aires, aged 89. His past caused some controversy in the Netherlands, and prompted a debate in the Dutch parliament before his daughter’s marriage to the crown prince.

Justin Rose may well add to his major haul before retirement but, if not, he will always have Merion. The tournament was also significant for one of Rose’s compatriots. With the second major of the year again within view, Luke Donald would be forgiven rueful glances. Five years ago, the 40-year-old teed off his US Open final round two off the lead and alongside Rose at one over par. A Sunday 76 and share of eighth was hardly disastrous at a brutal venue but proved a seminal moment in Donald’s career and perhaps one intensified by seeing a contemporary prevail. “It’s funny what happens when you have opportunities,” Donald says. “If I had gone there and missed the cut, the last five years could have been completely different. It’s funny how an event where you have a chance to win can affect you negatively. “I played the last round feeling out of sorts, not controlling the ball well, and thought I needed to be better. Sometimes the choice you make isn’t the right one.” This week, Donald is ranked 239 – an extraordinary scenario for someone who spent the main part of 2011 and early stage of 2012 as No 1. If injury – Donald has a herniated disc – means US Open participation this time around would be impossible anyway, this has been a dispiriting slump. “I probably listened to too many people and tried to change too many things,” Donald says. “A year and a half on from being the best player in the world I was changing swing coaches. It set me back, it didn’t work and I lost confidence. I’ve been back with Pat Goss for four years so there are no excuses now. “A lot of people ask me: ‘How was it being No 1?’ I loved it. I embraced it. Everything was going right.” Donald smiles when contemplating whether his obvious intelligence might be problematic when trouble ensues. “I think there is a certain advantage of someone who doesn’t think too inwardly and just gets on with it,” Donald says. “With Dustin Johnson it doesn’t seem like there is much going on, he is just playing golf.” At 40 and afforded an idyllic family life in the US with his wife and three children, it is to Donald’s credit that he is not minded to write his professional obituary. “Hard work and belief” are key to a renaissance, he insists. The latter has been difficult to source at times. “It has been frustrating but I haven’t lost hope,” says the man with 17 professional wins to his name. “I haven’t lost the competitive fire. It was 2015 when there was an article saying I was thinking of giving up but I think we all go through those stages. Every story has lows and highs, this is just part of the low to add to my story. I’d like to finish it on a high. “I see a lot of my peers who have gone through difficult times. Poulter, Stenson, Westwood all dropped down the rankings at some point and came back. Those three show what’s possible and that you shouldn’t give up.” In the meantime, and amid recuperation, Donald will be preoccupied with a role as part of Thomas Bjørn’s backroom team in the Ryder Cup. He is one of five European vice-captains, a number that has triggered claims relating to cooks and broth in certain quarters. Donald, a Ryder Cup specialist in his prime, readily justifies his position. “A lot goes on, it is such a busy week and buildup. The more eyes and ears Thomas has on the ground the better. I bring experience, just like the other vice-captains, and a winning mentality too. I have played in four teams and haven’t lost yet, which is a record I’m very keen to keep going as a vice-captain. “I have made notes – physical and mental – over the years of things I felt worked well or didn’t work in Ryder Cups, with the goal of eventually being a vice-captain or captain. I had four very different captains. The standout was probably Bernhard Langer. I like to see structure; Bernhard was very structured. Monty was a little different. Woosnam had very little structure. Olazábal was inspirational. And they all got the job done. “I’d still like to play a couple more Ryder Cups. I think I still have the opportunity if I can turn my golf around. I don’t think captaincy is on the table too soon, but I would like to be a captain.” Bjørn can count on Donald as already being on message about a US side who are heavy favourites for September, owing in part to the current retention of every major. “We have never minded being the underdog,” Donald says. “Winning majors is great but winning individually is different to a team. You have to bond as a team. “We have a lot going for us; we are playing at home, with home support, on a course that’s very familiar to the guys.” The setting was once second nature to Donald; how he would cherish some of that old routine."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"books/2018/jun/06/dasa-drndic-unflinching-croatian-novelist-dies-aged-71","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-06T15:10:42Z","webTitle":"Daša Drndić, 'unflinching' Croatian novelist, dies aged 71","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jun/06/dasa-drndic-unflinching-croatian-novelist-dies-aged-71","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/jun/06/dasa-drndic-unflinching-croatian-novelist-dies-aged-71","fields":{"headline":"Daša Drndić, 'unflinching' Croatian novelist, dies aged 71","bodyText":"Acclaimed Croatian novelist and playwright Daša Drndić, who confronted the atrocities of the 20th century in her writing, has died aged 71, her UK publisher has said. Drndić had been living with cancer for almost two years, and died on Tuesday night in Rijeka, her publisher MacLehose Press confirmed. Associate publisher Katharina Bielenberg called Drndić’s writing “viscerally angry and often brutal, but at the same time beautiful and entirely human”. “She herself was a tremendously warm person who embraced life and new friendships, and enjoyed them to the full,” said Bielenberg. In Drndić’s 2007 novel Sonnenschien, which was published in English under the name Trieste and shortlisted for the Independent foreign fiction prize, an old woman waits to be reunited with her son, 62 years after he was taken from her by Nazi authorities. Using everything from trial transcripts to photographs in her fiction to pin down the horrors of the Holocaust, Drndić also lists the names of some 9,000 Jews who were deported by Italy or killed by Italy during the war. In Belladonna, picked by the Guardian last month as one of the best new European novels being translated into English, Drndić writes of an elderly man’s battle with cancer. Her publisher at Croatian press Fraktura, Even Seid Serdarević, told the Guardian then that reading her books was like “being emotionally punched in the stomach all the time”. “Unflinching and uncompromising, Drndić’s writing never allowed its readers to turn away from truths, from the facts of some of the 20th century’s worst, and yet rarely spoken of, atrocities. ‘Every name carries a story’ is a refrain that runs through her books, which contain lists, tables, photographs, family trees,” said Bielenberg. In her last novel EEG, to be published in November, Drndić writes: “History remembers the names of criminals, while the names of victims are forgotten.” Bielenberg said that Drndić was a major writer in Croatia and the former Yugoslavian countries, although she was often highly critical of her country’s – and others’ - politics. In an interview with the Paris Review in 2017, she spoke of “how history is repeating itself, how its monstrous face is surfacing”. “Recently in Charlottesville, but throughout Europe and beyond, the extreme right is approaching, fortunately still on tiptoe and in les petits pas, which of course does not make it less dangerous. There are no small fascisms, there are no small, benign Nazisms,” she said. “That is what I try to talk about in my books, the importance of remembering. In this age of aggressive revisionism – which tends to brainwash our already damaged, deformed minds – without memory, we are easy prey to manipulation, we lose identity.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"politics/2018/jun/06/customs-backstop-pm-faces-revolt-david-davis-end-date-brexit","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-06T13:22:20Z","webTitle":"Customs backstop: PM faces revolt from David Davis over end date","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jun/06/customs-backstop-pm-faces-revolt-david-davis-end-date-brexit","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/jun/06/customs-backstop-pm-faces-revolt-david-davis-end-date-brexit","fields":{"headline":"Customs backstop: PM faces revolt from David Davis over end date","bodyText":"Theresa May is facing a backlash from the Brexit secretary, David Davis, over the government’s backstop plan to avoid a hard border in Ireland. Cabinet sources confirmed a BBC report that a four-page draft of the backstop proposal circulated to ministers has prompted a fresh row, because it does not include a legally enforceable end date. Davis in particular was keen to see a firm end date be put in place for the plan, which would keep the whole of the UK in key areas of the customs union until a permanent solution to the Irish border problem can be found. Davis helped to clinch agreement on the backstop in the cabinet Brexit subcommittee last month, in the face of objections from other leavers including Boris Johnson and Michael Gove. Johnson subsequently warned that the prime minister should ensure she delivered a Brexit deal that avoided the backstop having to be used. “Brexiters fearing betrayal over the customs backstop must understand that the PM has been very clear that it is not an outcome we desire; we want a deal with the EU and she will deliver it,” he said. Downing Street played down the row on Wednesday, saying the backstop was only ever intended to be temporary. “It’s important that it’s time-limited even outside of the fact that we don’t expect or want it to happen,” a source said. Pressed on whether the last meeting of the Brexit subcommittee had signed up to the details of the backstop plan, the source said, “they agreed the policy of what it would look like – and of course that there needs to be one”. The subcommittee is due to meet again on Thursday, with a related simmering dispute about Britain’s future customs arrangements still unresolved. When news of the backstop plan emerged last month, it infuriated hardline Conservative backbenchers who fear that it could become the post-Brexit norm. Jacob Rees-Mogg, who chairs the pro-Brexit European Research Group of Tory backbenchers, went so far as to question whether the government remained committed to delivering Brexit. The latest clash between the prime minister and her Brexit secretary comes after the pair also disagreed about the timing of publication for a white paper on the government’s Brexit stance. Davis was keen to produce a detailed document before the European council at the end of June but the prime minister is more cautious. May refused to give an answer when asked by Jeremy Corbyn at prime minister’s questions when it would be published. Rumours were circulating in Westminster on Wednesday that Davis had threatened to resign over the details of the backstop plan. Britain signed up to the idea of a backstop in the deal reached with the EU27 in December but May rejected a draft subsequently presented by Brussels that would in effect keep Northern Ireland in the single market. Any plan that involves a special status for Northern Ireland is anathema to May’s allies in the Democratic Unionist party, who reject the idea of any differential in treatment between the region and the rest of the UK.

Through this setup, Vampyr aims to explore the conflict between Reid’s desire to save lives and his newly acquired bloodlust – a little like the TV show Dexter, only with sharper teeth and bowler hats. Split into four districts, the smoggy sprawl of London is home to a multitude of characters, each trying to survive amid the pandemic. But even more sinister forces threaten the city (if you guessed “vampires”, then a big toothy kiss for you) and the best chance Reid has of defeating them is to fully realise his vampiric potential by feasting upon those he has sworn an oath to aid. Vampyr is at its most interesting when you’re debating whom to sacrifice, thanks to the well-rounded nature of each character’s personal story. Do you feed upon the thug shaking down local street vendors to provide a living for his sickly son, or drink deep of the gifted nurse who underhandedly charges patients for a bed? It’s even possible to construct your own moral code – feasting upon victims who are already injured or sick, for example, or focusing only on people who will provide a fulfilling meal. Sadly, while each character’s personal tale is cleverly constructed, much of the emotional heft is lost in the delivery. At its best, Vampyr’s writing is ponderously bleak, and at its worst akin to a rejected Hammer horror script. The opening hour makes a particularly poor impression. In a cutscene that calls back to Reid’s initial demise, our hero literally raises a hand to the sky and yells, “I have so much yet to accomplish!” Sitting alongside these narrative quandaries is a broader dilemma: each life taken will lower the public order of that district, making life easier for you, Doctor Vampire. Each life spared, meanwhile, means a harder road ahead, as you will have to battle powerful vampire-hunter enemies with fewer tools at your disposal. Again, though, these systems are not especially well utilised. Instead of following your lead, London’s fate largely hinges upon a handful of core plot choices that are more interested in hoisting you upon your own petard than following the game’s own logic, undermining the central concept of juggling your desire to protect people with your needs as a vampire. Some reprieve is found in Vampyr’s combat, which blends pugilistic street-fighting with ferocious supernatural powers. It’s a slick and enjoyable system that nonetheless feels at odds with the game’s loftier aspirations. Spending hours pondering the fate of one individual before stepping into the night to casually slaughter dozens of vampire hunters results in an uncomfortable dissonance between the game’s themes and the player’s actions. After the touching emotional drama of Dontnod’s previous game – the coming-of-age adventure Life Is Strange – Vampyr’s ambitious but awkward chin-stroking is disappointingly inert, while its failure to reconcile its ethical hand-wringing with its gratuitous combat leaves it as conflicted as its undead protagonist. Chewing over Vampyr’s ethical conundrums provides some entertainment, but not enough to make it worth sticking your neck out for. Vampyr is out now for £40.99."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"politics/2018/jun/06/theresa-may-israel-iran-nuclear-deal-benjamin-netanyahu","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-06T15:04:56Z","webTitle":"Theresa May faces Israeli pressure over Iran nuclear deal","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jun/06/theresa-may-israel-iran-nuclear-deal-benjamin-netanyahu","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/jun/06/theresa-may-israel-iran-nuclear-deal-benjamin-netanyahu","fields":{"headline":"Theresa May faces Israeli pressure over Iran nuclear deal","bodyText":"Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has pressed Theresa May to recognise that the Iranian nuclear deal is on the point of collapse and that a fresh plan is needed to stop Iran restarting its uranium enrichment programme. Netanyahu met May on Wednesday following his talks this week with the other European supporters of the landmark 2015 nuclear deal, the French president, Emmanuel Macron, and Germany’s chancellor, Angela Merkel. Netanyahu has lobbied for European leaders to follow the example of the US president, Donald Trump, and pull out of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) on Iran. “Along with France and Germany, the UK continues to believe [the JCPOA] is the best route to preventing Iran from getting a nuclear weapon,” May said. “We will remain committed to it as long as Iran meets its obligations. But we do recognise that there are other issues that need to be addressed in relation to Iran – its destabilising regional activity in countries like Syria and Yemen and also the proliferation of ballistic missiles.” Netanyahu told May he was focused on making sure Iran did not get a nuclear weapon and on “how to roll back Iran’s aggression in the region”. The European signatories are scrambling to save the accord, which they see as crucial to forestalling an Iranian nuclear weapon. However, the US president has said the deal is deeply flawed. The Israeli pressure is designed not only to back Trump’s decision to pull out of the deal but also to force European firms to disinvest from Iran. May also raised the subject of the UN’s call for an independent inquiry into the killing of dozens of Palestinian protesters on the day the US moved its embassy to Jerusalem. May stressed she recognised Israel’s right to self-defence but called on Netanyahu to act to alleviate the situation. The Israeli prime minister insisted the protests were driven by the militant group Hamas and that the response was aimed at minimising causalities. Rival groups of protesters gathered outside Downing Street waving Palestinian and Israeli flags before Netanyahu’s arrival. On Tuesday, Iran said it had ordered preparations for increasing uranium enrichment capacity in case the nuclear agreement collapsed. It also announced it had completed a new centrifuge assembly centre at the Natanz nuclear site. The French foreign minister, Jean-Yves Le Drian, said the move stopped short of breaching the terms of the nuclear deal, but came close to crossing the red line. “This initiative is unwelcome. It shows a sort of irritation,” he told Europe 1 radio. “It is always dangerous to flirt with the red lines, but the initiative taken … remains totally within the framework of the Vienna [nuclear] deal.” The finance ministers and foreign secretaries of the UK, Germany and France have jointly written to their US counterparts seeking assurances that the US will not impose secondary sanctions on EU firms operating in Iran. Their letter says that JCPOA is “the best means through which we can prevent a nuclear armed Iran”. Speaking in France ahead of his meeting with May, Netanyahu was confident that the EU firms operating in Iran would not be able to resist US sanctions. “I didn’t ask France to withdraw from JCPOA because I think it will be dissolved by weight of economic forces. My interest is not this or that agreement but to make sure Iran does not have nuclear weapons, and the last thing anyone wants is to have this theocratic dictatorship [with] a nuclear arsenal,” he said. Several big companies, including France’s Total and the Netherlands’ Maersk, have already said it would be impossible to stay in Iran once sanctions were fully reimposed over the next six months, unless they received explicit exemptions from Washington. Boeing also announced it was cancelling plans to provide two Iranian carriers. The European Investment Bank said on Wednesday that it could not help shield trade between the EU and Iran from US sanctions, dashing the hopes of some EU finance ministers that it might be a source of finance for EU firms operating in Iran. The bank said it “should remain a solid and credible institution on the international capital markets, and this would be incompatible with ignoring possible sanctions against Iran”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2018/jun/06/bernard-lewis-obituary","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-06T14:37:29Z","webTitle":"Bernard Lewis obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jun/06/bernard-lewis-obituary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/jun/06/bernard-lewis-obituary","fields":{"headline":"Bernard Lewis obituary","bodyText":"Both erudite and controversial, the scholar Bernard Lewis, who has died aged 101, conveyed the complexity of the Middle East with supreme confidence. His general books on Muslim-Christian relations over the centuries introduced students to a field that now defines the centre of international debate. In 2003 he was consulted by the Bush administration, though recommended the encouragement of revolution in the north of Iraq rather than invasion. British-born, he had been based in the US since the 1970s and became a familiar commentator on American TV after 9/11. Especially prophetic was his article The Return of Islam for Commentary magazine, published in 1976, well before the Iranian revolution. In 1990 another piece, The Roots of Muslim Rage, for Atlantic Monthly, he wrote of a “clash of civilisations”, a term later taken up by the political scientist Samuel Huntington. The Palestinian intellectual Edward Said called him a Zionist apologist and an orientalist who “demeaned” Arabs. To this, Lewis retorted: “If westerners cannot legitimately study the history of Africa or the Middle East, then only fish can study marine biology.” Their spat continued for a quarter of a century. In the view of another scholar of the region, Charles Tripp, Lewis’s earlier work was “substantial and influential but through his later misguided political involvement in US policymaking, he reinforced Said’s argument about how forms of knowledge are produced to service power”. The journalist Lamis Andoni depicted Lewis’s book What Went Wrong: Western Impact and Middle Eastern Response (2002) as “practically a manifesto for advocates of US military intervention”. Also contentious was his refusal to call the 1915 mass killing of Armenians “genocide”. Lewis did not see Islam itself as a threat. Rather his work illuminated its glory both as a religion and “a great civilisation in which others beside Muslims lived creative lives ... and which enriched the world”. To assume that Arabs were incapable of democracy was simply racist, he contended. He particularly admired Ibn Khaldun, the 14th-century Arab historian and pioneer of political analysis. A committed Turcophile, Lewis believed Muslim nations could both embrace modernity and reconnect with their capacity for generating ideas. Yet he also criticised the dearth of freedom and suppression of women in the Islamic world. Current extremists, argued Lewis, arise from a 300-year-long “downward spiral of hate and spite, rage and self-pity, poverty and oppression”. He described how Muslims had come to expect success after the astounding geographical expansion and sophistication of early Islam – hence their bewilderment when Vienna repelled the Turks in 1683 and the Ottoman empire was defeated in 1918. Europe’s subsequent rush for oil and its parcelling out of Arabs into bogus nation states seemed a final insult. Since 1945 Arab nationalism had suggested a solution, but already in 1964 he noted the fragility of this “secular heresy”. Its demise after the 1967 Arab-Israeli war created a vacuum that Islamists rushed to fill, one that al-Qaida exploited with the attacks of 9/11. A native of Stoke Newington, north London, Bernard was the son of Harry Lewis, an estate agent, and his wife, Jane, both immigrants from eastern Europe. At the age of 13 he became interested in Levantine languages when he had to study Hebrew for his barmitzvah. From the Polytechnic school, he went to what is now Soas University of London to study Middle Eastern history. In 1939 he gained his doctorate after researching at the University of Paris and touring the Middle East. Teaching at Soas was interrupted by wartime intelligence and Foreign Office work (1940-45). In 1949 he was appointed professor, and became the first western scholar to gain access to the Ottoman archives. Two years previously he had married a Danish Jewish woman, Ruth Hélène Oppenhejm, and they had a son, Michael, and daughter, Melanie. They divorced in 1974. He became a member of the Institute of Advanced Study at Princeton and a professor at Princeton University (1974-86). He also held a chair at Cornell University (1984-90). When painted as pro-western, Lewis responded: “Is that a crime? I do not believe in the original sin of the west and the innate sinlessness of the rest.” Nonetheless he chided westerners for condescension towards Arabs. As he joked, “that’s history” is a dismissive phrase in the US, but virtually defines the Islamic psyche. His books were translated into Arabic, Turkish and Farsi and their revelations of past self-criticism within Islam delighted readers and scholars. Among Lewis’s publications were panoramic classics such as The Middle East: A Brief History of the Last 2,000 Years (1995) and The Multiple Identities of the Middle East (1998). Other works considered more specific topics, such as The Emergence of Modern Turkey (1961), Semites and Anti-Semites (1986) and Race and Slavery in the Middle East (1990), and in Music of a Distant Drum (2001) he translated classical Persian, Arabic, Hebrew and Turkish poetry. He described fateful historic encounters in works such as The Muslim Discovery of Europe (1982), and The End of Modern History in the Middle East (2011), and his last book was an autobiography, Notes on a Century: Reflections of a Middle East Historian (2012). By contrast with the subtlety of his writing, Lewis’s televised appearances could be stridently polemical. He once likened the prospect of Yasser Arafat abandoning terrorism to Tiger Woods giving up golf. He compared the Wahhabi grip on Saudi Arabia to the Ku Klux Klan usurping Texas and using its oil wealth to promulgate bizarre doctrines. Lewis’s favourite tribute came in a preface to one of his books, published in Arabic by the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt. “I don’t know who this man is,” wrote the translator, “but one thing is clear: he is either a candid friend or an honest enemy who disdains to tell lies.” He is survived by his partner, Buntzie Churchill, and his children. • Bernard Lewis, historian, born 31 May 1916; died 19 May 2018"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"business/2018/jun/06/qatar-airways-ceo-apologises-for-suggesting-a-woman-could-not-do-his-job","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-06T12:05:30Z","webTitle":"Qatar Airways CEO apologises for suggesting a woman could not do his job","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jun/06/qatar-airways-ceo-apologises-for-suggesting-a-woman-could-not-do-his-job","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/jun/06/qatar-airways-ceo-apologises-for-suggesting-a-woman-could-not-do-his-job","fields":{"headline":"Qatar Airways CEO apologises for suggesting a woman could not do his job","bodyText":"The boss of Qatar Airways, who sits on the board of Heathrow, has offered his “heartfelt apologies” for his suggestion that a woman would not be able to do his job, which inflamed a row over sexism in the aviation industry. Referring to his role as chief executive of the Gulf carrier, Akbar Al Baker stunned a press conference on Tuesday by saying: “Of course, it has to be led by a man because it is a very challenging position.” The comments came just after he became chair of the International Air Transport Association’s board of governors for a one-year term. He later defended Qatar Airways’ record on gender equality but failed to quash mounting criticism. The airline issued a statement on Tuesday referring to his “lightheartedness” at press conferences. A day later it released another statement from Al Baker, who has run the carrier since 1997. “I would like to offer my heartfelt apologies for any offence caused by my comment yesterday, which runs counter to my track record of expanding the role of women in leadership throughout the Qatar Airways Group and has been sensationalised by the media,” he said. He added that women comprised 44% of the airline’s workforce, and “the dedication, drive and skill they bring to their jobs tells me that no role is too tough for them, at all levels of the organisation”. The Gulf carrier has a close business partnership with British Airways and is also the largest single shareholder in BA’s parent company, IAG. Qatar Airways has caused controversy in the past for its treatment of its predominantly female cabin crew, at one time firing them for being pregnant. However, Al Baker said in the statement: “Qatar Airways firmly believes in gender equality in the workplace and our airline has been a pioneer in our region in this regard, as the first airline to employ female pilots, as one of the first to train and employ female engineers, and with females represented through to senior vice-president positions within the airline reporting directly to me.” He said he supported all Iata initiatives to promote the advancement of women in the industry. It is not the first time Al Baker’s comments have provoked controversy. At a dinner speech in Ireland last year, he said US airlines were “crap” and their passengers were “always being served by grandmothers”, while boasting that “the average age of my cabin crew is only 26”. He later apologised for his “careless” remarks."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"media/2018/jun/06/ray-bellisario-obituary","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-06T11:47:44Z","webTitle":"Ray Bellisario obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/jun/06/ray-bellisario-obituary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2018/jun/06/ray-bellisario-obituary","fields":{"headline":"Ray Bellisario obituary","bodyText":"Ray Bellisario, a photographic journalist who stalked the royal family for the best part of 20 years, protested until his recent death about the way that I, and other journalists, wrote about him. In an email to me six years ago he said: “I regard you as a friend but I am profoundly offended by being labelled ‘paparazzo’. I want to be recognised for my real work as a charitable, concerned journalist who covers stories such as the Bhopal gas disaster, Aberfan … and famine in Africa and India.” However, Ray, who has died aged 82, could never escape the tag he so disliked, nor could he shake off the notoriety he gained as the first British “pap”, documenting the activities of the royals in a period when newspaper photographers were expected to show due deference. Born the youngest of 13 children in Pontefract, West Yorkshire, to Italian immigrant parents, Giuseppe and Assunta, who sold ice cream from a handcart, he was 18, a fledging freelance photographer with the Fox Photos agency, when he happened to come across the Queen in 1955 sheltering under an umbrella on the rain-soaked streets of Truro in Cornwall. Royal aides regarded his picture, a charming portrait of the young monarch, as unauthorised and intrusive. It proved to be the opening shot in a long battle between the determined Bellisario and the palace. He went on to obtain candid photographs of the Queen and her supposedly estranged uncle, the former King Edward VIII, of Princess Margaret in a bathing suit, Princess Anne falling off her horse and Prince Charles water skiing in 1970 while sitting on a chair balanced on a table top. Several members of the royal family did not attempt to conceal their dislike for him, none more so than Prince Philip, who was reputed to have asked the Queen if the troublesome photographer could be sent to the Tower of London, to which the Queen supposedly replied: “Not any longer, dear.” After Bellisario’s book, To Tread on Royal Toes, was published in 1972, he cheekily sent a leather-bound copy to the Queen “from a devoted and loyal photographer”, although as a socialist and republican he was not at all loyal. The book was returned with a wonderfully sniffy note from the Queen’s private secretary, which said: “Her Majesty does not accept the book and it is therefore being returned herewith.” Bellisario did not confine himself to images of the royal family. Among thousands of photographs in his archive, which was sold off to raise money for charity five years ago, were shots of Winston Churchill, the Kennedy family, Sophia Loren and a delightful set of portraits of Brigitte Bardot in a London pub in 1968. After turning his back on the royals in 1975, he covered the conflicts in Northern Ireland, the Western Sahara and the Nigerian civil war. He also made regular trips to Cuba to teach journalism at the University of Havana. His activities were severely restricted after 1990, when he used a wheelchair because of a spinal condition, and he then became a doughty fighter for disability rights. He is survived by three children and eight grandchildren."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2018/jun/06/pmqs-verdict-corbyn-notches-up-another-solid-win-on-brexit","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-06T11:41:41Z","webTitle":"PMQs verdict: Corbyn notches up another solid win on Brexit","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jun/06/pmqs-verdict-corbyn-notches-up-another-solid-win-on-brexit","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/jun/06/pmqs-verdict-corbyn-notches-up-another-solid-win-on-brexit","fields":{"headline":"PMQs verdict: Corbyn notches up another solid win on Brexit","bodyText":"Key points Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn pay tribute to those killed in the London Bridge terror attack and the emergency services. Corbyn asks if the government’s Brexit white paper will be published before the debate next week. May says the government wants to publish a white paper going beyond speeches and papers published so far. She says it will be an ambitious offer to be negotiated with the EU. Corbyn says his question was simple: when will it be published? Next week MPs will debate the most important legislation for a long time. He asks if the white paper will be published ahead of the June EU summit. May says next week’s votes will be important. They will be about implementing Brexit. She says, if Corbyn wants to talk about clarity, he should stand up and rule out a second referendum. Corbyn says the last time he looked it said prime minister’s questions. He says the government said this white paper would set out the government’s vision. Yet it is nowhere to be seen. He asks which of the sub-committees looking at the “max fac” and customs partnership plans have met, and when people will find out what they have decided. May says she did not ask a question. She just challenged him to stand up and say what Labour policy was on a second referendum. She urges him to rule it out. Corbyn says it is not the opposition that is conducting the negotiations. And it is not the government doing it either. He asks if a 10-mile buffer zone in Northern Ireland is now government policy. May says the government wants to ensure there is no hard border between the UK and Ireland. It continues to negotiate with the EU. She says the debate next week is important. It will show the sincerity of this house on leaving the EU. Corbyn says May has given no answer on the white paper and no answer on the buffer zone. But that plan has united people in Ireland. They say it is bonkers. Is it her plan to complete the transition by December 2020? Yes, says May. Corbyn says Damian Green, the former first secretary of state, said there would be a transition after the transition. He says the government has delivered more delays and cancellations on Brexit than Northern rail. He says the government’s incompetence threatens communities. What will last longer – the Northern rail franchise or her premiership? May says if Corbyn won’t speak about his Brexit policy, she will. Keir Starmer said Labour was not united on this. She says Labour has sought to frustrate Brexit on every stage. Labour is refusing to deliver Brexit. This government is delivering on it, she says. Snap verdict It is hard to believe now that May called a general election last year because she thought her stance on Brexit would help her win a thumping victory over Jeremy Corbyn and Labour. What was supposedly a key May issue has now turned toxic, to the extent that Corbyn has yet again notched up a solid PMQs win on the topic, seemingly quite effortlessly. He did so by the simple expedient of asking when the government’s Brexit white paper would be published. May was able to give a clear, straight answer to Corbyn’s question about the end of the transition (although it probably won’t turn out to be an accurate answer – many people think there will eventually be a post-transition transition), and she could probably have answered the 10-mile buffer zone question (sources says it’s a non-starter). But she was flailing on the white paper, and it matters because her failure to say when it will be published illustrates the government’s inability to answer crucial questions about its negotiating stance. May fought back by challenging Corbyn to rule out a second Brexit referendum, and by taunting him over what Keir Starmer said about Labour party divisions. But these felt like second-order and largely irrelevant issues, and she could not disguise the fact that Corbyn’s criticisms were spot-on.

As he looks to improve relations with Europe, at a new low since the March nerve-agent attack on Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia in Salisbury, the Russian president knows he can count on the backing of at least two capitals. Both Austria and Italy’s new governments, formed late last year and last month, include populist, far-right parties that make little secret of their sympathy for Moscow – and have even signed cooperation agreements with Putin’s ruling United Russia party. Italy’s new prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, used his maiden speech in Rome on Tuesday to promise his government would be “advocates of an opening towards Russia – a Russia that has consolidated its international role in recent years”. Conte heads a populist coalition of the anti-establishment Five Star Movement (M5S) and the far-right League that, according to its programme, sees Russia not as “a military threat” or “enemy” of Europe but as a “potential partner”. He promised his administration would “promote a revising of the sanctions” imposed by the EU on Russia after it annexed Crimea and destabilised Ukraine. A few hours earlier, Putin got much the same message in Vienna, on the first state visit of his fourth term. Russia was “a part of Europe”, said Austria’s president Alexander Van der Bellen, denying Moscow faced “a crisis of trust” with the west. Austria’s chancellor, Sebastian Kurz, who heads a coalition of his conservative Austrian People’s Party (ÖVP) and the far-right Freedom Party (FPÖ), told a press conference he hoped the sanctions could be “relaxed step by step”. The FPÖ leader, Heinz-Christian Strache – now also Austrian vice-chancellor – went further, telling local media that Europe must “end these sanctions … and normalise political and economic relations with Russia”. EU–Russian relations have been badly strained by Russia’s actions in Crimea, Eastern Ukraine and Syria, as well as by accusations of interference in assorted European elections and, most recently, the Skripal affair. But Putin, apparently now eager to build bridges, has recently begun signalling a clear desire to re-engage with Europe. Russia “does not aim to divide the EU”, he assured Austrian broadcaster ORF ahead of his Vienna visit. “We want to see a united and prosperous EU, because the EU is our biggest trade and economic partner. The more problems there are within the EU, the greater the risks and uncertainties for us.” Those words may ring hollow in most EU capitals, which – unlike Vienna and Rome – responded favourably and fast to Britain’s request for a coordinated diplomatic response to the Salisbury attack. The previous Italian government decided only belatedly to expel two Russian diplomats, in a move immediately criticised by the League – then in opposition – while Austria declined to send anyone back to Moscow because it wanted “to keep lines of communication to Russia open”. The FPÖ and the League, both now junior coalition partners, signed ill-defined “cooperation accords” with Putin’s United Russia last year based on their shared beliefs in nation-first politics and a mistrust of international alliances. Matteo Salvini, the League leader, has denied borrowing Russian money to fund his election campaigns, as Marine Le Pen of France’s far-right Front National has had no qualms doing. But Salvini has often expressed his admiration for Putin and said last month he wanted “to work for peace, not war”. Austria’s Strache, meanwhile, besides calling frequently for EU sanctions to be lifted, has forcefully criticised Nato’s expansion eastwards, arguing it “wasn’t Russia who, in recent decades, has been the aggressor”. It is too early to say what the consequences – if any – of this isolated outbreak of goodwill towards Moscow might be, for the sanctions or Russia-EU relations in general. Kurz was at pains to reassure his EU partners that Austria’s loyalty is of course to Brussels, not Moscow. But Putin will not be unhappy. • This article was amended on 7 June 2018 to clarify that the Italian government belatedly agreed to expel Russian diplomats."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jun/06/labour-problem-soft-brexit-immigration-eea-government","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-06T11:10:32Z","webTitle":"What’s Labour’s problem with a soft Brexit?

One word: immigration","bodyText":"Call me naive, but I always thought that if the opposition have a rare and clear chance to defeat the government, they would take it. Now we learn that sometimes, even when presented with an open goal, the opposition would rather kick the ball into touch. The open goal in question is the arrival in the House of Commons next week of an amendment, passed by the Lords, that would keep Britain in the European Economic Area (EEA): in other words, a soft Brexit that would see the UK leave the EU but stay in the single market. That matters, because single market membership is crucial to Britain’s economic health, and is surely the only way to deliver the “jobs-first Brexit” that Jeremy Corbyn has promised. Also, given that the referendum two years ago was so close, the EEA position would seem a fair reflection of the will of the people. (Arch-Brexiteer Daniel Hannan recently went further, hinting that the narrowness of the win might have triggered no more than a renegotiation of the UK’s EU membership rather than a departure – though he said that on Dutch TV, so perhaps he thought no one would notice.) Tory rebels reckon they have enough MPs to win a vote on the EEA plan – but only if Labour backs it. Put simply, Labour has a clear chance both to defeat Theresa May and ensure a Brexit that limits the damage Britain is about to inflict on itself. It would be good for both country and party. But now it’s clear that this is an opportunity Labour would rather pass up. the party released an alternative amendment, one that falls short of joining the EEA. Instead it talks of “full access to the internal market”. At first, some remainers seized on that as a welcome shift by the party leadership towards the single market. But gradually a more sober view took hold. This was a way to derail a move that might actually have kept Britain in the single market – the EEA proposal – and was little more than a reheated version of Labour’s repeated pledge to deliver the “exact same benefits” of the single market and also to leave it, a position Labour’s own Barry Gardiner memorably described as “bollocks”. So what explains Labour’s decision? Keir Starmer told the BBC’s Today programme it was merely a pragmatic acceptance of reality: Labour MPs would not unite around the EEA proposal, and this alternative clause is one everyone on the Labour benches can live with. But that’s worth unpacking. For what exactly is the problem some Labour MPs have with the EEA? The answer is simple: immigrants. They worry that EEA membership would entail free movement of people, and several worry that their constituents, in leave-voting seats such as Darlington or Don Valley, won’t stomach that. Indeed a briefing note to MPs explaining the decision explicitly mentions freedom of movement as a problem with the EEA. It would be interesting to hear Corbyn explain to some of his younger supporters – who are both pro-remain and relatively relaxed about migration – that he passed up the chance to soften Brexit because Labour wants to keep out immigrants. MPs from those leave-supporting seats would say they have nothing against newcomers, but they have to bow to the reality of their constituents’ feelings. And that means scuppering the EEA proposal. But does it? As it happens, Labour’s new amendment surfaced just as Gordon Brown made a valuable intervention. He said that rather than obsessing over the technicalities of Brexit, politicians needed to address the anxieties that had fuelled the leave vote. On immigration, that could be done, he argued, by a series of measures – from ensuring local people have a chance to apply for every job to registering migrants on arrival in the UK – that are all permitted under EU rules. Indeed, they include steps already implemented by that most European of EU members, Belgium. Put simply, there is a solution here to Labour’s conundrum, as it seeks to keep both leave and remain voters onboard. It could back both the EEA referendum and Brown’s package of measures on immigration. That way, it would, to adapt a phrase coined long ago by Brown himself, be tough on Brexit and tough on the causes of Brexit. And in the process, it would have a chance to inflict defeat on an ailing, failing government. The question for Labour is: why doesn’t it take it? • Jonathan Freedland is a Guardian staff columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"business/2018/jun/06/eu-tariffs-us-imports-july-steel-aluminium","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-06T14:24:28Z","webTitle":"EU to impose tariffs on US imports from July","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jun/06/eu-tariffs-us-imports-july-steel-aluminium","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/jun/06/eu-tariffs-us-imports-july-steel-aluminium","fields":{"headline":"EU to impose tariffs on US imports from July","bodyText":"The EU will impose tariffs on US imports ranging from Harley-Davidson motorbikes to jeans from next month in retaliation over Donald Trump’s decision to put duties on European aluminium and steel. Despite the apparent reluctance of the UK’s international trade secretary, Liam Fox, to publicly back the EU’s proposed “tit for tat” measures, the European commission said it had the full support of all 28 member states to act. The EU is finalising the list it will submit to the World Trade Organization (WTO) but the bloc aims to introduce “rebalancing” tariffs on about €2.8bn (£2.5bn) worth of US steel as well as industrial and agricultural products, including bourbon, peanut butter, cranberries and orange juice. The EU has also taken a complaint to the WTO. Should the case still be ongoing after three years, the EU plans to impose further tariffs of €3.6bn on US products. Trump brought in tariffs of 25% on EU steel imports and 10% on imported aluminium on 1 June, citing “national security” interests. After a meeting of senior EU officials, the European commission vice-president Maroš Šefčovič told reporters in Brussels that the EU regretted the White House’s “illegal” act. He said: “The new duties start applying in July. It is a measured and proportionate response to the unilateral and illegal decision taken by the United States.” Fox, an advocate of Brexit, has been cautious in backing the EU’s retaliatory measures in public. He has also suggested that the UK is likely to be handed an exemption from the US tariffs once the country has left the EU. However, Jyrki Katainen, the commission’s vice-president for jobs and a former Finnish prime minister, said that all the member states had agreed with the action to be taken against US importers and recognised the need to stand together. He said: “We have had the full support from all the member states on these issues which we are about to propose now. All the member states understand that if they want to defend rules and trade we have to play by the book. It is difficult to assess what President Trump will decide to do next but this is our response.” Meanwhile the UK, France and Germany have signed a joint letter demanding that European companies are spared from US sanctions imposed on Iran after Trump’s decision to pull out of the nuclear agreement with Tehran known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). The three EU member states were signatories to the 2015 deal, which sought to stop Iran from developing nuclear weapons in exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions. Their letter to the US Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, and the secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, seeks confirmation that EU interests will not be hit by secondary sanctions on companies working in Iran. They write: “Building on our discussions at several occasions, as close allies we expect that the extraterritorial effects of US secondary sanctions will not be enforced on EU entities and individuals, and the United States will thus respect our political decision and the good faith of economic operators within EU legal territory.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"money/2018/jun/11/milk-more-delivery-complaints","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-11T07:30:50Z","webTitle":"Why did my milk delivery firm’s service turn sour?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2018/jun/11/milk-more-delivery-complaints","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2018/jun/11/milk-more-delivery-complaints","fields":{"headline":"Why did my milk delivery firm’s service turn sour?","bodyText":"In April you highlighted difficulties with Milk &amp; More. We’ve been using the company for five years, and only since its takeover by Müller have we experienced problems – none a direct fault of our friendly milkman. My regular delivery was every two weeks but, since January, it started to be weekly and I kept being told this would be corrected. By the end of March it wasn’t, so I cancelled regular orders and placed one-off orders. Then we had a surprise breakfast delivery on Saturday – when our regular order used to be. Two phone calls to separate offices resulted in the promise of a call back. Instead, a message was left while I was out asking me to call “Mike” but the number was customer service and nobody knew who “Mike” was. What is worse is that under Müller’s new system, instead of paying via direct debit on receipt of an invoice, you now pay in advance by debit card – and it took the money for this order on 11 May without me even knowing. PC, Bourton-on-the-Water, Gloucs Milk &amp; More was bought by dairy giant Müller from Dairy Crest in December 2015 and has a national workforce of 1,100 milkmen and women (75% are franchisees) delivering more than 100m pints of milk in glass bottles every year. The company may well have been a victim of its own success, as growing concern about plastic waste has led to a surge in online customers. Its new website, involving the migration of 150,000 online customers from the old one, has piled on the pressure. The company says: “We are sorry that PC received an additional delivery of breakfast items and for any inconvenience this may have caused. We investigated the issue and subsequently contacted PC to explain what we believe happened and to apologise. We appreciate this took longer to resolve than usual, but have processed a full refund.” The company is still trying to sort out the website and we understand it is planning to close its Manila call centre soon, to improve customer service.

A simple rating, though, is never adequate when it comes to assessing a great racing talent, and it fails above all in the case of a steeplechaser such as Denman. A number cannot capture the regard, affection and respect in which a horse is held by the racing and betting public, and by that measure, Denman was the equal, at least, of the chaser in the stall next door at Paul Nicholls’s stable. The two horses offered a fascinating contrast for the fans, both in terms of their achievements and how they were earned. Denman did things that Kauto Star did not even attempt, the most obvious being his three starts, and two victories, under top weight in the Hennessy Gold Cup at Newbury. Denman’s first Hennessy win, in 2007, was his first start outside novice company, achieved with ease off a mark of 161. Two years later he won off 174, and 12 months on he was placed from a mark of 182 giving at least 20lb to every other runner in the field. It felt like a throwback to the black-and-white days when Arkle accomplished similar weight‑carrying feats in the same race. The 2009 race epitomised the tireless courage that made Denman such a favourite with the fans and a worthy rival to Kauto Star in their hearts. His bold jumping and merciless gallop from fence to fence saw off most of his rivals long before the home straight, and those that remained were then beaten off one by one. What A Friend, with 22lb less to carry, managed to get upsides Denman on the run to the last, but the effort alone was too much and he wilted the instant that it became clear that Denman was not to be stopped. At the peak of his powers, even Kauto Star could not cope with him. In all, the two horses lined up together for four Gold Cups, and Denman had the better of it in three, including the unforgettable seven‑length defeat of Kauto Star in 2008 which marked the start of their rivalry. Kauto Star set off at 10-11 to win the race for the second year running but Denman never seemed likely to be caught from the moment that Sam Thomas kicked him into the lead with a circuit to run. It was victory celebrated by romantics and purists alike, as Denman seemed to embody all the qualities of build, strength and inexhaustible stamina that the fans look for in a classical staying chaser. The first meeting of the two stable‑companions was a clash of cultures, with Kauto Star representing the new influx of precocious, French-bred chasers. He was hurdling at three and chasing at four, while Denman, who was bred in Ireland along impeccably traditional lines, did not even see a racecourse until three months before his sixth birthday. On that day at least, Denman was much the better of the two. Twelve months later, having suffered from a heart problem in the meantime, he was himself soundly beaten by Kauto Star, but Denman was second again, behind Imperial Commander, when Kauto Star fell four out in 2010, and in front of his old rival a year later when they were second and third behind Long Run. The chalk-and-cheese partnership between Harry ‘The Dog’ Findlay and dairy farmer Paul Barber, who owned Denman, added to his fascination, and while Findlay’s high-profile career as a professional punter crashed and burned soon afterwards, no one can take away Denman’s Gold Cup and two Hennessys among 14 career wins in all. Findlay is also credited with coming up with Denman’s nickname, and it was a good one. ‘The Tank’ summed up the sense that absolutely nothing would be allowed – or dare – to get in Denman’s way when he was bowling along at the head of affairs. In boxing terms, Kauto Star was the fighter with quicker hands and better technique, who could end a bout with a single, well-timed blow. Denman, though, was the crowd‑pleasing bruiser who came out swinging and never stopped until the final bell. He punched himself to a standstill, left it all in the ring. And we loved him for it."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"music/2018/jun/09/jorja-smith-did-amy-have-a-hit-with-frank-i-havent-had-one-and-im-not-bothered","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-09T06:00:17Z","webTitle":"Jorja Smith: 'Did Amy have a hit with Frank?

I haven’t had one and I’m not bothered'","bodyText":"Due to what she will only describe as “a sewage problem”, Jorja Smith urgently needs to move house. Her requirements – two bedrooms, a nice bathroom, presumably the absence of sewage – are generally modest, but being a pop star she will also need space for her “two huge pink velvet sofas”. She thinks she may have found somewhere in west London: it will be the 20-year-old singer’s fourth London home since moving down from the West Midlands just two years ago. “South London was good,” she explains, “but I always get recognised. And I’m not even that famous yet.” STOP RIGHT THERE. Two big words in that last statement: “that” and “yet”. The former is an acknowledgment that while Smith is not in fame’s Bieber/Grande/Madeley strata, she’s far from unknown: tracks such as powerful social commentary Blue Lights are all over the radio, the likes of Drake and Stormzy have made music with her, and she enjoyed a big primetime moment at this year’s Brits, where she won the critics’ choice award. As for the fact that she is not that famous yet, her debut album might see to that: a mix of modern jazz, contemplative soul and dancehall so perfect for summer evenings that B&amp;Q should bundle it with their barbecues. Smith seems to handle being not even that famous yet rather well, but she has put in the practice. Not so long ago, but before everyone was wanging on about her being UK pop’s brightest new hope in years and she was still working in Starbucks, she would take time out in the stock cupboard to interview herself about her career. “I used to pretend I was talking to [1Xtra DJ] MistaJam,” she laughs. (Smith laughs a lot more than you’d expect from listening to her music. Big old cackly, go-any-further-and-you’ll-snort laughs. Great laughs.) “I’d only have about 10 seconds,” she continues. “I’d go in and be like: ‘How do you feel doing this?’ ‘How will that affect this?’ I’d act out stuff all the time. I talked to myself loads when I first moved here.” Smith grew up in the house whose front room can be seen in the YouTube clip that changed her life. The video, one of many she uploaded in her mid-teens, shows her performing a 2011 Alex Clare song. “I used to watch YouTube,” she remembers, “and I’d see people doing covers and having hits. I wanted to do that too, but it didn’t really work.” It kind of worked, though: the Alex Clare cover was spotted by a music industry bloke who got in touch and asked to meet up. “I told my dad, because obviously it’s weird,” she says. But it turned out not to be weird, so Smith suddenly had a manager. I ask her to show me her childhood street on Google Street View, and before long we’re outside her old house. Smith points out the family camper van parked outside and begins a tour of the neighbourhood: where she’d get the bus to school; where the kids would play; the old people’s home where she helped out for her Duke of Edinburgh award (which she completed, although she never collected the award itself). At the top of her street, the road gets wider, the trees get leafier and the houses get bigger and have driveways; Smith used to walk her dog near there, she says, and she shows me the house she always wished she could one day live in. Then we go back down the road, right down to the bottom where it’s “a bit more rough; a lot of the stuff was closing down”. One shop that hasn’t closed is the local Co-op, and perhaps it never will because it is surely eligible for listed-building status following an episode one night last year that saw Smith – who had performed that evening in Birmingham supporting Drake – taking the gig’s headliner shopping. Just to underline that: Drake went shopping in a Walsall branch of Co-op. “I wanted wine gums and tampons, and he decided he wanted to come and see the Co-op where I grew up,” is Smith’s matter-of-fact account of the night. Did Drake offer to pay for her shopping? “No.” What does Drake smell of? “Executive realness.” So we know that Smith likes wine gums, which is great news because those are the best sweets. Other things it’s important to know about Jorja Smith: she’s furious that she has fewer social followers than spooky CGI pop star Lil Miquela (“She’s not real! She doesn’t have genitalia!”). She would rather be one inch shorter than one inch taller. She reluctantly holds the bleak belief that hats simply don’t suit everybody. On the debate that continues to rage over the versatility of the potato versus the versatility of the egg she prefers eggs “but you can do a lot with each”, and her preferred potato treatment is roast. She is also “quite dramatic”. When, as a child, she pushed her brother and he cut his mouth, her response was to flee the scene. Her mother is currently making her a dining table out of an old church altar. She isn’t unduly concerned by the fact that parrots can talk (“They can’t talk, they mimic, it’s soundwaves”), but she does express alarm (“AARGGHH!”) at the recent news that a parrot learned how to control an Amazon Echo. If parrots and AI were to conspire to take over the world, she says, she would like parrots to be the planet’s ultimate rulers. She has never touched a parrot, although she has “definitely touched an owl”. Oh, and when she won this year’s Brits critics choice, she was the first independent artist to have even been nominated, let alone take home the trophy. Jorja Smith is indeed independent, although she’s hardly in the photocopying-her-own-flyers-at-Ryman lane, and it would be a mistake to conflate her independence with total unsignedness. Smith releases music through her label FAMM, but she is also part of Platoon, a self-styled “platform for fearless creatives” invented two years ago by a venture capitalist and a former Apple consultant. Smith says Platoon “gets my music on Apple Music and Spotify and everywhere it needs to be”. It sounds like the sort of label-but-not-a-label you’d want to work with, if you – like Smith – could see the whites of stardom’s eyes in 2018. It has incubated artists such as Stefflon Don and Billie Eilish on their way to major-label deals, while current artists such as Rex Orange County and Smith have retained their independence within an impressively nimble, apparently scalable, label-style infrastructure. Which is all lovely, and Smith’s monthly streaming stats are on a par with Sigrid, who won the BBC’s Sound of 2018 poll. But while Sigrid, who is signed to a major label, has had a Top 10 hit, Smith has not yet gone Top 30. If Smith had signed a conventional deal, might she have had a hit by now? “That’s a ‘what if’ question,” she observes, adding with mock melodrama: “I don’t answer those.” Does it surprise her, then? Doesn’t she think it’s a bit weird – with her massive profile and so on – that she hasn’t had a solo hit single? “I don’t know. Did Amy Winehouse have a hit single from Frank? I love Frank, but people didn’t really pay attention to her until Back to Black. So no, I haven’t had a hit single. I personally am not bothered about that.” That is not to say that others haven’t attempted to cajole her in a different direction: one recording session, she remembers today, involved the producer trying to use sounds from Justin Bieber’s Sorry. Her publishers, Smith adds, are keen that she delivers something upbeat. “They’re like: ‘Write a fast song, write a fast song!’ No! I don’t want to. I write what I want to write. ‘Upbeat songs get played on the radio.’ So? And they want me to work with certain producers who’ve made hits, but just because they had a major hit doesn’t mean they’ll have another one.” Smith’s album seems good evidence that sticking to her guns has been a wise move. “With a label, pressure is added,” she reasons. “Being independent you don’t feel a lot of pressure. A lot of people say I’ve been putting out music slowly. But I like how I’ve done things.” Slow and steady may yet win the race. Smith talks fondly of the 70s hi-fi setup she has at home: the speakers are knackered but she enjoys the magic of listening to old music on equipment of the time. And the good thing about vinyl, she says, is that you can’t skip tracks: “That’s what records are for: not to be skipped.” As to whether Smith herself has made an unskippable album … “Well, I think I have,” she says. “But my dad told me he skipped a song.” She looks briefly appalled. “I told him he wasn’t listening to it in the right order. But it’s fine if you do skip. Listen to it once all the way through, then pick your favourites.” That’s right, ladies and gentlemen: release the doves; we finally have a recording artist who admits that the best way to consume an album is to drag, drop, order and chop. Don’t be too hasty with her album, though; beyond obvious megabelters such as Don’t Watch Me Cry there are plenty of tracks that really only reveal themselves after a few listens. There’s lots about love, including a song written during the beginning of her relationship with boyfriend Joel Compass. Created over a period of five years, it’s an album that takes its time, and deserves the same from the listener. Its title track, Lost &amp; Found, recalls the period when Smith would travel to stay with her aunt and uncle in west London and the first time she went to Ladbroke Grove, and realised she was standing right where Carnival takes place. “And I realised I’m such a small girl in this huge world,” she says. “At times you do feel quite lost, but I knew what I wanted to do. I’m not saying I found myself – we’re all constantly finding ourselves – and I feel like wherever I go I’m still quite lost, but there’s a sense of ‘found’ in that I’m right where I want to be. Lost and found is how I feel.” Jorja Smith seems like precisely the artist she wants to be, making precisely the music she wants to make, delivering it on precisely her own terms. “When I was 15,” she says, “all I wanted was to be selling out shows like Bieber. As I got older, I realised everyone’s come from a different place and everyone’s got their own path. I realised I just had to believe in myself, believe that I could do this. Now I am doing it.” Lost &amp; Found is out now"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"politics/2018/jun/06/corbyn-compares-pms-brexit-strategy-to-northern-rail-chaos","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-06T12:13:42Z","webTitle":"Corbyn compares PM's Brexit strategy to Northern rail chaos","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jun/06/corbyn-compares-pms-brexit-strategy-to-northern-rail-chaos","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/jun/06/corbyn-compares-pms-brexit-strategy-to-northern-rail-chaos","fields":{"headline":"Corbyn compares PM's Brexit strategy to Northern rail chaos","bodyText":"Jeremy Corbyn has compared the government’s Brexit strategy to the chaos on Northern trains as he again used prime minister’s questions to pressure Theresa May on what the Labour leader said was ministerial deadlock on the issue. In a tightly focused approach, the Labour leader asked May a series of specific policy questions about Brexit, which she pointedly refused to answer, bringing jeers from the opposition benches. In response, May repeatedly sought to bring the subject back to Labour’s own divisions on Brexit, prompting Corbyn to remark at one point: “The last time I looked at the order paper it said prime minister’s question time.” Corbyn began by noting that last month the Brexit secretary, David Davis, had promised a “detailed, ambitious and precise” white paper on the government’s Brexit negotiating position, asking whether it would be published before next week’s crucial votes on the EU withdrawal bill. After May responded by dodging the question, Corbyn asked whether the white paper would appear before the crucial EU summit later this month. He added: “Next week we will be debating the most important piece of legislation for a very long time, and we still have not seen the government’s negotiating position.” Again, May opted to not answer the question, asking Corbyn instead to rule out any Labour support for a referendum on a final Brexit deal. Corbyn returned to the attack, saying: “We were told three weeks ago to a great deal of fanfare that this document, this white paper, would set out the government’s ambition for the UK’s future relationship with the EU and their vision for a future role in the world. It’s nowhere to be seen, no answer is there as to when it will be published.” He then asked for details on cabinet subcommittee deliberations on the two possible post-Brexit customs arrangements, and the reported plan for a 10-mile “buffer zone” at the Irish border, saying this idea had been called “bonkers”. May responded: “We are looking at the two options for the customs model. Both of those will do what we have committed to do.” After finally getting an answer from May on whether a post-Brexit transition deal would definitely end in December 2020 – “Yes,” she replied – Corbyn used his final question to castigate the government’s approach, referring to the recent chaos to train services in the north of England. “When it comes to Brexit this government has delivered more delays and more cancellations than Northern rail,” he said, to cheers from Labour MPs. “The government’s white paper is delayed, its customs proposals have been cancelled, and it has ripped up its own timetable, just like our shambolic privatised railways. “This government’s incompetence threatens our economy, businesses, jobs and our communities. So my question to the prime minister is this: which will last longer, the Northern rail franchise or her premiership?” May replied by criticising Corbyn’s approach, saying: “Labour voted for a referendum, they voted to trigger article 50, and since then they have tried to frustrate the Brexit process at every stage.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/jun/06/grenfell-tower-inqury-kitchen-fire-resident-behailu-kebede-media-scapegoat","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-06T12:00:41Z","webTitle":"Grenfell Tower inqury: kitchen fire resident ‘did nothing wrong’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jun/06/grenfell-tower-inqury-kitchen-fire-resident-behailu-kebede-media-scapegoat","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/jun/06/grenfell-tower-inqury-kitchen-fire-resident-behailu-kebede-media-scapegoat","fields":{"headline":"Grenfell Tower inqury: kitchen fire resident ‘did nothing wrong’","bodyText":"Behailu Kebede, in whose Grenfell Tower flat the fire broke out, has been scapegoated by the media and wrongly blamed for failing to raise the alarm, the inquiry into the blaze has been told. On the 10th day of its hearings, Rajiv Menon QC, representing Kebede, gave a detailed account of events in the early hours of 14 June last year when the fire started in his kitchen in flat 16. Kebede, who is originally from Ethiopia and had lived in the tower for 25 years, was woken by a fire alarm. He immediately got up to find smoke coming from behind his Hotpoint fridge freezer. He did not see any flames. “He grabbed his mobile phone and called 999,” said Menon. He had to ring several times before connecting to an operator. At the same time he banged on all his neighbours’ doors on the fourth floor, shouting that there was a fire. “He left the flat barefoot, without his flat or car keys.” Kebede waited for the fire brigade to arrive and watched the blaze spreading out of his flat windows. “He felt utterly helpless.” Later that day, he gave a long statement to the police about what happened. “Given all the garbage that has been written about him in the past year,” Menon said, “it’s important to say that he is a significant witness and not a criminal suspect.” Some papers had even suggested Kebede was responsible for the fire, Kebede’s barrister said. The police at one stage suggested that he needed to go into a witness protection scheme and be given a new identity because he was being harassed so much by the media. “He’s a good man. He did nothing wrong,” Menon said. “He did the right thing from the start to finish. He just wants to be able to rebuild his life as best he can. He loved his life in Grenfell prior to the refurbishment.” But the refit was another matter. Windows were fitted incorrectly, leaving gaps. There were power surges. The fridge freezer that started the fire was more than five years old, the inquiry heard. It had not been repaired or tampered with. Accidental fires caused by faulty fridge freezers were not uncommon, Menon said. “Every year in the UK there are around 300. In one tragic case in Neasden, north London, six members of one family were killed in a blaze caused by a fridge freezer catching alight. Menon turned his attention to the role of the local authority, Kensington and Chelsea. He said: “There’s no coincidence that this fire occurred in a building owned by a Tory authority that has been at the forefront of promoting austerity, cuts and deregulation as well as prioritising business over health and safety.” His comments provoked an outburst of loud applause, prompting the chair, Sir Martin Moore-Bick, to plead for no further disruptions to proceedings. Leslie Thomas QC, who represents another group of the bereaved and survivors, said the companies involved in the refurbishment should engage more openly with the inquiry. “Those responsible for allowing this situation to get to the stage where 72 souls were lost in the most horrendous and awful way, should hang their heads in collective shame,” he said. “Too many tears have been shed. Enough will have been shed for an almighty river of sorrow to flow: lost lives, lost loves, lost opportunities.” If lawyers representing the bereaved were being prevented from asking relevant questions then the inquiry risked being seen as a “whitewash”, he warned. Shah Ahmed, the chair of the leaseholders association, had written to the Kensington and Chelsea Tenant Management Organisation two weeks before the fire to request a fire drill, he revealed. Stereotypes surrounding council housing should not be reinforced by the inquiry, Thomas stressed. Those who live there were “not helpless, they were just not helped”. The right to adequate housing, recognised by the UN’s international covenant on economic, social and cultural rights 1966, has not been incorporated into UK law, he noted. “Had the residents been able to enforce their rights to adequate housing then at least some of the fire risks that we know were present would have been identified and rectified before the [disaster].” Thomas questioned whether the refurbishment was necessary. “One of our clients said that the refurbishment changed Grenfell Tower from being an ugly, safe council block to a death trap that looked like a pretty, private block … A culture of corporate impunity had taken root.” He called for a temporary ban on all but non-combustible material to be imposed on cladding material used to coat high-rise buildings. The inquiry should ask whether the beautifying of the tower with new cladding was for the benefit of the residents or other wealthier residents who had to look at the building. Michael Mansfield QC, representing other survivors and relatives, also called for the inquiry to make urgent recommendations on the type of cladding permissible and the fire brigade’s controversial stay put policy rather than waiting several years for the proceedings to finish. There are currently 510 new high rise buildings over 20 storeys due to be built in the UK, he noted. Despite this, Mansfield said, deregulation of safety standards is being pursued by the government."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"artanddesign/2018/jun/10/inside-north-korea-oliver-wainwright-pastel-fairyland-built-to-forget","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-10T07:00:46Z","webTitle":"Inside North Korea: a pastel fairyland built to forget","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/jun/10/inside-north-korea-oliver-wainwright-pastel-fairyland-built-to-forget","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2018/jun/10/inside-north-korea-oliver-wainwright-pastel-fairyland-built-to-forget","fields":{"headline":"Inside North Korea: a pastel fairyland built to forget","bodyText":"When Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un finally meet face-to-face at their momentous summit in Singapore on Tuesday, it will be more than a coming together of two powerful men with a penchant for missiles and curious haircuts. Beyond the jocular Twitter exchanges over nuclear war, the president and the supreme leader share a dearly held passion for outre architecture and flamboyant interiors. The Trump style is the better known of the two. The builder-president has adorned the world with puffed-up towers swathed in golden mirror glass, his own New York penthouse is a gilded Louis XIV fantasy, while his Florida getaway heaves with marble mouldings, leaping from gothic to Moorish like an encyclopaedia of dictator chic. Kim’s taste is a more closely guarded secret. Even the locations of his many residences are shrouded in mystery. But hints can be gleaned from his ambition to “turn the whole country into a socialist fairyland”, as one of North Korea’s official patriotic slogans declares, and by the wave of startling structures that has been sweeping Pyongyang since he came to power. “Pyonghattan” was the joke nickname given by foreign diplomats to a cluster of shiny cylindrical towers that emerged in the capital in 2012, assuming this was a one-off publicity stunt. But since then, almost every year has seen the grand unveiling of another lavish trophy project, each more futuristic than the last, with parades of jaunty towers dressed in sci-fi costumes and crowned with cosmic symbols, worthy of scenes from The Jetsons. Future Science Street was well under construction when I visited Pyongyang in 2015 on an architectural tour – scenes from which are captured in a new book, out this month, which aims to provide a glimpse behind the closed doors of the famously secretive country. Armies of soldier-builders were racing to finish the new riverside district of 2,500 apartments for “scientists of the future” in time for the 70th anniversary of the foundation of the Workers’ party. One tapering concrete shaft took the form of a steroidal pagoda, while bright orange and green tiles were being hastily applied to other curving towers, designed “in the shape of an intellectual’s calligraphy brush”, according to our guides. Colour is the most surprising thing about visiting North Korea. Where you might expect to find a drab Soviet-style world of crumbling concrete slabs and inflated Stalinist ministry buildings, Pyongyang instead unfolds as a pastel panorama. There are blocks in minty green and terracotta, mustard and ochre, as well as more recent apartment towers that look like sticks of seaside rock, clad with spiralling blue balconies. It is a hipster dream of turquoise and millennial pink. The pastel palette continues inside, where behind closed doors we would find interiors as unreal as stage sets, ordered with the eerie symmetry of a Wes Anderson movie. The Rungrado May Day stadium, built in 1989, had just been refurbished, replete with locker rooms, physio clinic and media centre decked out with synthetic vinyl surfaces in sugary colours, assembled with the crisp perfection of a Thomas Demand paper sculpture. Is was unlike anything I had seen before, but entirely in keeping with Korea’s official Juche ideology, which specifies that all architectural inspiration should come only from within and be uniquely Korean in its essence. “An architect who is convinced that his country and his things are the best will not look upon foreign things or try to copy them,” Kim Jong-il declared in his 1991 160-page treatise, On Architecture. Instead, he must “make tireless efforts to create architecture amenable to his people”. The young Kim seems to have latched on to his father’s amenity principle. In an unlikely bid to boost tourism and cater to North Korea’s growing middle class, he is furnishing the country with a host of leisure facilities, from a new ski resort to plans for an underwater hotel. The capital now boasts a hi-tech shooting range, where visitors can take potshots at pheasants, as well as a new horse-riding centre, where children of the elite can have a taste of rural life for the equivalent of $5 an hour – around the average weekly wage of most North Koreans. When we departed Pyongyang for the border to the south, driven along a deserted pothole-riddled highway, past rusting pylons and ragged children playing on the street, it soon became clear that we had left a limited bubble of prosperity. It was evident that the candy colours and kindergarten kitsch are used as an architectural anaesthetic, the state’s saccharine salve to infantilise its people and numb them to the abject realities of everyday life in the Hermit Kingdom. • Inside North Korea by Oliver Wainwright is published on 22 June (Taschen, £40).

You could say things have gone downhill since. From one-night stands to long-term relationships, I’ve had about 50 sexual partners: some good, some indifferent, some loving and intimate, some just silent fumbling. But I’ve found that sex is deemed to be over once the man has come, even if I haven’t. I’ve only come about half the time, or felt obliged to fake it. It’s now a decade since I had a sexual partner. I have ME and arthritis, which means my days of falling into bed with a stranger are over. Any potential partner would first have to be instructed into my peculiarities: which limbs don’t move where, how to avoid my hiatus hernia, breathlessness, etc. Not to mention my need of sleeping pills, earplugs and an eye mask, which are not sexy, nor conducive to intimacy. Fortunately, I’ve never agreed with the common tendency to define “having sex” as “having sex with one or more partners”. From adolescent self-exploration onwards, I’ve always (even when in a relationship) had sex by myself. It’s reliable and satisfying. It happens when and where I want it, and is as inventive or as brief as I want it to be. I’m never hesitant or embarrassed, because there’s no one else to have a view on my preferences and fantasies. It never hurts, unless I choose it to. There’s a lot to be said for being in total control.

The 20-year-old’s first album finds her standing on her own two feet. A gentle record of lithe, accomplished slow jams, it toys with a myriad of genres: while delicate R&amp;B is the most obvious reference, there’s a UK dance nod too – not in the literal way of On My Mind, her 2017 garage collaboration with Preditah, but that distinctly polished percussive sound is evident throughout, in the slinkiness of February 3rd and the humid undercurrent of The One. The social commentary is limited to Blue Lights and the soft rap of freestyle Lifeboats (“Why do we watch them drown / We’re too selfish in the lifeboats”), but the album’s appeal lies especially in Smith’s silken accounts of despondent romances – soaring, hopeless ballads about adolescent crushes.

Quite apart from learning when to slow down and when to speed up, she has become much more adept at judging the right moments to act on immediate instinct and recognising the situations where it is better to pause and think things through. “I think I’ve matured,” says the England and Manchester City forward. “On an odd occasion you’ll still find me shouting at referees when I’ve become increasingly frustrated but I’ve tried to control my temper.” As she sits and chats at St George’s Park before flying to Moscow with Phil Neville’s squad for Friday’s World Cup qualifier against Russia, Parris explains that her new measured approach is not merely confined to moderating a reputation for screaming at match officials. “I’ve grown not just as a player but as a person,” says the 24-year‑old Toxteth-born half-sister of the boxer Natasha Jonas. “But my passion will always remain. It’s there because I love football and I love fighting for my club and my country. Every time I step on the pitch I think about winning and putting on a performance that ensures my team comes out on top.” Eight goals in 22 internationals during the 24 months since her England debut against Serbia suggest Parris’s capacity to learn quickly is as sharp as her warm Merseyside wit. “International football’s a much quicker environment,” she says. “You have to move the ball quicker and make decisions quicker. I’ve stretched myself and I make decisions very quickly now. You can’t overthink when chances come, you’ve got to take them. “But I’ve also got more maturity, more composure in the final third. I’m calmer in front of goal. When I was younger, I was so fixed on scoring I’d snatch at chances. I’d forgotten about the process you need to go through before you shoot. Now I know that if you get that process right, scoring’s the easy part.” It helps that Neville speaks her language. “Phil’s brought a winning mentality with him,” says a player with a personality to match her dynamic change of pace. “His background’s all about winning, look at the trophies he’s collected. That’s what we want to do, too. At the end of your career you want to be able to look into your cupboard and see all the medals you’ve amassed.” When England beat Russia 6-0 at Tranmere last September Neville’s soon-to-be-sacked predecessor, Mark Sampson, was feeling the strain of Eni Aluko’s well‑documented racism allegations. After Parris scored the opening goal she immediately led her team-mates in a race to the technical area where England’s outgoing manager was hugged in a pointed display of squad unity. Parris makes it plain that she relished being part of the environment created by Sampson – whose unfair dismissal case against the FA should be resolved soon – and is proud of a culture that helped England to reach the Euro 2017 semi‑finals in the Netherlands. Asked to identify how Neville has changed the collective mentality, her instructive reply brims with subtext. “To be honest with you, we’ve remained the same. Our values, our beliefs and our integrity – which we’ve always had – have been retained. Our culture of togetherness – which we’ve always had – has remained the same. “What Phil’s doing is making sure that we go one step further; that we go from second place [in the world rankings] to first place, that we make sure we win the World Cup in France in 2019.” More immediately, England’s men have a World Cup of their own to challenge for and, before departing for her own mission in Moscow, Parris enjoyed sharing St George’s Park with Gareth Southgate’s players. “We were in the gym with them this morning and we’ve had a few conversations,” she says. “It’s been nice to see the men here; we’ve wished them well for Russia.” With her quick, clever feet, penchant for dribbling at opponents, ability to operate either on the wing or more centrally and, of course, those goals, Parris is hoping for a starting role in Neville’s front three in France next summer. She revels in feeling the heat of competition in an attacking department suddenly feeling slightly overcrowded, as Jodie Taylor, Ellen White, Fran Kirby, Toni Duggan and Parris herself face competition from Beth Mead and Georgia Stanway. “We’ve got good young strikers knocking at the door now but having competition is essential,” Parris says. “We want to become the best team in the world and then be the best for a long time so we need to be challenged. If you don’t have competition in a squad, you can have complacency – and, if you have complacency, you won’t win.” Meanwhile, the former England forward Eni Aluko has joined Juventus Women after helping Chelsea to their recent league and cup double. Aluko wrote on Twitter: “Delighted &amp; honoured to join JuventusFCWomen - Italian champions, a club with an overwhelming history, ambition and success.

The mobile phone footage is grainy, the sounds of a riot audible in the background. A group of British soldiers grab four Iraqi boys on the street and drag them into their barracks. The camera zooms in and out as the soldiers beat them. A soldier walks up to one boy and kicks him between the legs. Another punches a boy in the head and stomach. The soldier filming keeps up a steady patter. “Oh yes! You’re going to get it,” he says. He imitates their screams for mercy. “Oh please! Please no!” Other soldiers pass in and out of shot, apparently indifferent. This footage, from southern Iraq, would be passed to the News of the World and published two years later. It was one of the first cases of British soldiers abusing Iraqi civilians to become public, and provoked fury both in Iraq and Britain. “Jail them,” demanded a Daily Star article. Across the Middle East, the footage looped on news channels. In the southern Iraqi city of Basra, where British troops were stationed, 1,000 people took to the streets in protest, chanting “No, no, Tony Blair” and burning British flags outside the consulate. The nine soldiers involved – eight carrying out the beating, one filming the attack – were questioned. But almost a year later, the Service Prosecuting Authority (SPA), the military equivalent of the Crown Prosecution Service, decided not to bring charges. Although there was sufficient evidence to prosecute two of the soldiers, the statute of limitations had expired and it was deemed not in the public interest to pursue them. This was not the only case of alleged abuse by British soldiers in Iraq. Over time, a steady drip of shocking allegations about British troops emerged in the press. One of the most notorious was at Camp Breadbasket, an aid distribution centre in Basra, where a group of soldiers beat and humiliated Iraqi prisoners, taking photographs of the abuse. As stories of torture and unlawful killings in British custody came out, they fed into the wider sense of outrage about the war. The public wanted answers about how politicians had sold the war to them in the first place, how the media had failed to scrutinise politicians’ claims in the run-up to the war, how the military had failed to prepare and equip its troops. The shocking stories of abuse and torture by British troops added to the fury. But over the past three years, the question of whether British soldiers committed crimes in Iraq, and the scale on which it happened, has been largely displaced by outrage over attempts to investigate them. In the media, rhetoric has shifted radically – from horror at the alleged crimes of British soldiers, to outrage against human rights lawyers pursuing such allegations. “Mr Cameron MUST stop these vile witch-hunts against our brave troops,” read a 2016 column in the Daily Mail. Conservative politicians have echoed this line. David Cameron, then prime minister, promised to stop “spurious” claims. Defence secretary Michael Fallon criticised “unscrupulous” lawyers; armed forces minister Penny Mordaunt described these lawyers’ actions as the “enemy of justice”. When Cameron left office, his successor, Theresa May, lambasted “activist, leftwing human rights lawyers”. The target of most of these complaints from cabinet ministers has been an investigation launched by the UK government itself. The Iraq Historic Allegations Team (Ihat) was set up by the Labour government in 2010, to draw a line under lingering allegations from an unpopular war and dispatch the idea that military misconduct was widespread. It aimed to investigate credible claims of abuses in Iraq and secure criminal prosecutions where appropriate. But if Ihat was supposed to be a way to decisively establish guilt or innocence, it failed spectacularly. By February 2017, the investigation had become the centre of a national scandal over its methods and scope, and the government announced it would shut Ihat down. “What was meant to be an administrative exercise, tidying up a few loose ends, had taken off into the stratosphere,” Nick Harvey, minister for the armed forces from 2010-12, told me. A parliamentary inquiry concluded Ihat had “directly harmed the defence of our nation” by making soldiers on the battlefield anxious about later legal repercussions. When Ihat closed, outstanding cases were reduced, overnight, from 3,400 to just 20. It had cost the taxpayer £34m and failed to secure a single prosecution. The collapse of Ihat seems likely to mark the end of serious attempts to investigate alleged crimes by British soldiers in Iraq, leaving questions about the scale of abuses and accountability unanswered. After such a public failure, what politician would want to reopen the issue? Yet, behind the headlines of corrupt lawyers and incompetent investigators, the true story of Ihat is more complicated. Both military advocates and human rights defenders agree that the scandal around Ihat was at the very least, politically convenient for the Ministry of Defence. With human rights lawyers cast as the villains, the MoD could avoid uncomfortable questions about its own role in training soldiers in procedures that breached the Geneva conventions. “At times, the MoD has been tempted to throw the uniform under the bus,” says Johnny Mercer, a Conservative MP who was instrumental in Ihat’s closure. Fifteen years after it began, we are no closer to holding any politicians or high-ranking soldiers accountable for the disaster of the Iraq war. The further we get from the events, the more elusive proper examination has become. Rather than time giving a measure of distance, the tenor of the debate has degenerated to a point where the very words “human rights lawyer” are used as an insult by top politicians. Meanwhile, anger at the government’s own investigation into alleged abuses by British soldiers in Iraq has fuelled scepticism about civilians’ right to even question the actions of the armed forces overseas. * * * When British combat operations in Iraq ended in 2009, Saddam Hussein had been ousted, but terrorism and sectarian war were surging. More than 100,000 Iraqis had been killed, as well as 4,371 Americans and 179 British soldiers. “Daily life was a mess,” says Safaa Khalaf, a journalist from Basra who covered the British occupation. “The British were saying the city was safe, but armed groups controlled residential areas. Services had been completely destroyed and there were no efforts to rebuild.” British involvement had cost £9.6bn and the war was grossly unpopular at home. A ComRes poll at the time found that 37% of the British public believed that Blair should be tried as a war criminal. Gordon Brown, keen to differentiate his premiership, established the Chilcot inquiry to help the UK to “learn the lessons” of the Iraq war. In the same month that combat operations ended, a public inquiry was also launched into the killing of Baha Mousa, a 26-year-old hotel receptionist beaten to death in Basra by British soldiers in 2003. (The inquiry would later conclude that these soldiers subjected Iraqi detainees, including Mousa, to “serious, gratuitous violence”.) Another public inquiry into claims that British soldiers murdered and mutilated nine Iraqi detainees, known as the al-Sweady inquiry, launched the same year. The families of Iraqi victims in both inquiries were represented by the same lawyer: Phil Shiner, founder of Public Interest Lawyers, a small Birmingham-based practice. Within government, Shiner was hated – “We had the strong feeling that he was a bad apple,” one former Labour minister told me – but many of his fellow lawyers admired his determination to hold power to account. In 2004, Shiner had been named human rights lawyer of the year by the campaign group Liberty, and in 2007, the Law Society named him solicitor of the year. In February 2010, Shiner began court proceedings to seek investigation into further claims of ill-treatment of Iraqis. “We were at risk of having a public inquiry for every allegation [of abuse in Iraq],” says Bill Rammell, who was minister for the armed forces during that period. “That would take years – and in the intervening period, the whole reputation of the armed forces would be besmirched.” To draw a line under the continued legal challenges, MoD officials proposed the creation of Ihat, a legal body that would investigate allegations of crimes, and where appropriate, pursue prosecutions of individual soldiers. Having been signed off by Brown, it was announced publicly in March 2010. “Ihat was a concerted attempt to pull all the allegations together, throw resources at them and process them as quickly as possible,” said Rammell. One of the central questions raised by Ihat is who, ultimately, is responsible for crimes committed by British personnel in war? Individual service personnel bear criminal responsibility for crimes they commit in war, such as murdering civilians or torturing prisoners. Under international criminal law, senior officers can also be held accountable for the actions of their subordinates if they did not take “necessary and reasonable” action to prevent it. Under the act that Britain signed when it joined the international criminal court (ICC) in 2001, generals and even politicians are potentially liable for systematic abuses by British soldiers. This has proved largely theoretical, however: the last person in Britain to be prosecuted for crimes committed by forces under their command was in 1651 during the civil war. In Iraq, this question of command responsibility was particularly important. Numerous public inquiries have concluded that five banned interrogation techniques were widely used by British soldiers. These techniques – hooding, white noise, sleep deprivation, food deprivation and stress positions – were outlawed by the UK in 1972 and breach the Geneva conventions. But by the time of the Iraq war, training manuals did not mention that these techniques were forbidden. Nor did the manuals formally advocate using these techniques – they simply were not mentioned at all. Institutional knowledge of the ban seemingly having been lost, in the chaos of the war – where thousands of Iraqi men and boys were arrested without adequate holding facilities – soldiers may have been told by commanding officers to, for instance, hood detainees. This meant that, under Ihat, soldiers could theoretically face criminal prosecution for things they were told by their commanders to do. Crucially, Ihat was set up in such a way that it could not address wider questions of accountability. Rather than considering systemic problems, it was limited to prosecuting individual soldiers. Overseen by civil servants employed by the MoD, Ihat had a main staff consisting of around 150 investigators who would look into allegations in the same way that civilian police might. If an investigation gathered sufficient evidence, the case would be passed on to the SPA, which would then decide whether to proceed. The odd structure of the organisation – not quite a public inquiry, not quite a police investigation – is a sign of how unusual it was; there are no comparable examples of a country domestically investigating allegations of crimes committed in an overseas war. By the time Ihat got going in November 2010, the Labour government had been replaced by the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition. Government insiders told me that David Cameron was reluctant to proceed, and would have preferred to shut down the whole process. But he had little choice. In 2011, the European court of human rights ruled that the UK had a duty to investigate allegations of deaths and ill treatment involving its service personnel in Iraq. If it didn’t, Britain and the politicians and generals in power at the time of the Iraq war might have a case to answer in the ICC. The view within government under Labour, when Ihat was set up, was that it would show Britain was taking responsibility by punishing the worst cases of abuse, while simultaneously proving that there were relatively few serious incidents. Despite Cameron’s reluctance, the coalition had a broadly similar attitude. “What was not anticipated at the outset was the sheer scale of what Ihat was going to end up looking at,” said Nick Harvey, the Liberal Democrat who replaced Rammell as minister for the armed forces. On launching Ihat in 2010, Harvey predicted that it would conclude its work within two years. In fact, it barely even started until 2012, as Shiner repeatedly took the government to court to dispute its structure and independence. (“He could start an argument in a phone box by himself,” said one acquaintance.) Initially, Ihat’s investigative team were mostly drawn from a branch of the British military police that had been active in Iraq during the occupation. Shiner successfully argued in court that they had a conflict of interest, and in 2012, Ihat was restructured and restaffed with civilians – mostly retired police detectives. The new aim was completion in 2019, with a budget forecast of £57m. * * * For the first few years of its operation, few people paid much attention to the work Ihat was doing. In 2013, Shiner’s daughter Bethany, a recent law school graduate, started working at Public Interest Lawyers’ Birmingham office. It was a small firm, employing around seven solicitors, and Shiner was the only partner. Public Interest Lawyers took the lead in gathering cases from Iraqis, ultimately bringing 65% of Ihat’s cases, although another firm, Leigh Day, was also involved. Public Interest Lawyers was paid a set fee for gathering statements on a case-by-case basis by the Legal Aid Agency. Bethany Shiner, who is now 30, was immediately thrust into the Iraq litigation. She and other junior lawyers took statements from Iraqis over the phone, with the help of an interpreter. Many of them were based in Basra, although calls came from around the country. “The allegations ranged from beatings, hoodings, poor detention conditions, all the way to sexual assault,” Bethany said. “You’d hear the same details again and again.” Some of the firm’s lawyers were traumatised by repeatedly hearing stories of sexual assault and torture. Most of the cases came to Public Interest Lawyers via a UK-based translation and logistics company run by a British Iraqi, which employed a fixer in Basra, Abu Jamal, to liaise with Iraqi claimants and witnesses. Abu Jamal was a prominent local figure who was well trusted in Basra, and connected Iraqis to the lawyers. In addition to working for Public Interest Lawyers, for three years Abu Jamal was hired directly by Ihat for a salary of £40,000 per year, to find witnesses, help them get visas, and sometimes accompany them overseas for interviews with Ihat staff. “Without him nothing would have happened,” one former investigator told me. It is testament to the internal chaos of Ihat that no one appears to have stopped to question whether it was appropriate for someone to be employed by both lawyers bringing the claims and the investigators scrutinising them. Although Public Interest Lawyers maintain that Abu Jamal was simply liaising, some journalists later alleged that he had directly approached clients to solicit for business. This practice – often dismissed as “ambulance-chasing” – is permitted in some countries, but is strictly forbidden in the UK. If claimants were coming to Abu Jamal – as he and Public Interest Lawyers have maintained – then that was permissible. If he was cold-calling them, as alleged, it would not. It has never been proven that Abu Jamal was paid to directly solicit clients for Ihat. Whatever was happening behind the scenes, hundreds of Iraqis were coming forward with stories of abuse at the hands of British soldiers. As the number of claims grew, a sense of purpose united staff at Public Interest Lawyers. “We were trying to find out what happened,” said Bethany. “It was about finding the truth and holding those responsible accountable.” This was no easy task. Because it was pursuing criminal prosecutions, Ihat’s cases had to meet the standard of criminal proof: it had to be beyond reasonable doubt that the alleged incidents took place. Yet most of the alleged crimes had taken place a decade earlier, in an active war zone, so crime scenes were never secured and vital evidence had not been gathered. Alleged victims and witnesses were thousands of miles away, in a still war-torn country. Ihat judged it unsafe for investigators to go to Iraq, so arrangements were made for Iraqi victims and witnesses to be interviewed in Turkey. From 2013, when investigations got underway in earnest, until 2016, these trips happened almost monthly. As Public Interest Lawyers gathered cases, they passed them on to Ihat for consideration. Usually, this would consist of a written statement, accompanied by supporting documents, such as evidence of detention, medical records or photographs of injuries. The lawyers would ensure the basic facts checked out and that claims were credible, and pass the cases on to a team of civil servants, who decided which claims merited further investigation. As the number of allegations mushroomed, there appears to have been little direction from above about which cases were worth pursuing. “There wasn’t much of a triage system to focus attention on the most serious allegations or those most likely to result in prosecution,” one insider told me. Of the hundreds of cases Ihat investigated, not one ended in prosecution. While this has been held up in the rightwing press and in government as evidence that the claims were “spurious” and the investigation incompetent, those involved feel that the structure of Ihat was the stumbling block. “My overall feeling is that there was a lot of evidence of criminal wrongdoing, and that nobody has been held to account,” said Jonathan (not his real name), who was part of an Ihat team that went on numerous trips to Turkey. Usually, these trips would last about a week, with five or six Iraqi witnesses interviewed by Ihat investigators. Legal representatives from Public Interest Lawyers would also be there. “Of course there were some false claims, but most of the people I saw I believed to be genuine,” said Jonathan. He emphasised that many interviews were with witnesses who had no financial motive as they were not eligible for compensation. Many working at the ground level – from the lawyers representing Iraqis to the Ihat investigators – felt that they were being asked to pursue the wrong target, investigating individuals rather than looking at systemic problems in the military. But they were trapped within the process. “Of course, individual soldiers had personal responsibility – but allegations often related to the way in which personnel had been trained, what they were told to do, how they were told to treat people,” said Bethany. “It was about the government and the MoD in particular.” Paul (not his real name), a retired police detective who worked as an investigator, felt frustrated that his inquiries were limited to low-ranking individuals. Some of the British soldiers he interviewed were functionally illiterate, he said: “They’d signed statements taken immediately after the event [for which they were being investigated]. But I found they could barely read or write, and they’d just signed anything so they could go home,” said Paul. Wanting to investigate the chain of command, in one case, he requested permission from Ihat’s leadership to interview a senior army officer in relation to an alleged unlawful killing. This was refused. Every time he tried to pursue this line of inquiry, he claims that it was shut down by Ihat’s leadership or MoD lawyers. According to Jonathan, many of his colleagues felt increasingly frustrated. “Many complained that they had gathered what they thought was enough evidence to prosecute, and then they’d have an MoD lawyer go to the senior leadership of Ihat and tell them to drop the case.” An MoD spokesperson denied these claims, saying that “Officers of very senior ranks were interviewed in many Ihat investigations when the evidence and line of inquiry required it, and no investigation was shut down prematurely.” Paul says: “I don’t think anyone there was bright enough for it to be a conspiracy, but I felt the MoD were putting pressure on the senior leadership to wrap things up.” Paul describes meeting the family of an Iraqi who had allegedly died in British custody. They asked how they could trust him when he was employed by the British government. “I will never forget that I looked that man in the eye,” said Paul. “I made a promise to do a fair investigation that I wasn’t able to keep.” * * * At the end of 2014, Maj Robert Campbell was on leave and about to go on holiday when he received a call from an ex-girlfriend, who told him Ihat investigators had been asking about him. It was the first indication Campbell had that he was under investigation for murder. The inquiries related to a 2003 incident where a 19-year-old Iraqi, Said Shabram, had drowned in Basra. At the time, to control crowds and prevent looting, British troops would sometimes force civilians into the Shatt al-Arab river that runs through the city, a practice known as “wetting”. The allegation was that Campbell and two other soldiers had forced Shabram into the water, which they denied. Campbell and two of his soldiers had been investigated and cleared on four separate occasions by the military authorities. Ihat’s involvement marked the fifth investigation, although it was the first by civilians. After Campbell had spoken to his ex-girlfriend, he immediately called his commanding officer. “They said ‘There’s nothing we can do, don’t worry about it’,” Campbell told me. He suffers from PTSD, and his mental health deteriorated as allegations that he had thought were settled suddenly resurfaced. In the months that followed, he received no clear information on how the investigation was progressing – a charge echoed by other soldiers investigated by Ihat, many of whom spent months or years under a cloud of uncertainty. Nor was Campbell offered support by the army or the MoD – there was no clear advice about what to do, and no financial support was provided to cover the cost of hiring a lawyer. He and the other soldiers accused felt ostracised. “We were guilty until proven innocent,” he said. One of Ihat’s principles, set out by the MoD when it was launched, was that witnesses would always be given advance warning before being approached in person, and that suspects would be informed first by their chain of command. But the MoD later admitted that over 300 potential witnesses, as well as seven suspects, were contacted without prior warning. It would later emerge that some Ihat investigators had used troubling techniques such as telling soldiers not to mention the allegations to anyone, or asking them to meet in car parks. One Ihat investigator was later convicted of impersonating a police officer after using an old warrant card to demand entry to army barracks. Campbell’s anxiety turned to anger when he found out that the army had disclosed his service records to Ihat without his consent and without informing him. “The army sold us out,” he said. “Forget the MoD. The army handed over my service records and kept me in the dark about what was going on with the investigations. So who is looking out for us?” While unaware of the murder investigation against him, Campbell was deployed to Afghanistan in 2011, where he was severely injured. He is now permanently disabled, with damaged hearing, and walks with a cane. “I would have made different decisions had I known I was under investigation for murder. I might not have continued fighting and fucking dying for these wankers,” he said. “I’m finished now. I’m broken.” For years, the day-to-day problems with Ihat attracted little media attention. But as the verdict in another inquiry into alleged crimes in Iraq became a national scandal, the controversy engulfed Ihat. On 17 December 2014, the judgment in what was known as the al-Sweady inquiry came out. A group of Iraqi complainants, represented by Public Interest Lawyers and Leigh Day, had alleged that British forces had committed serious battlefield crimes during hand-to-hand combat in a 2004 clash called the Battle of Danny Boy, culminating with the murder and mutilation of nine detainees. The judge found that nine detainees had indeed been mistreated – but that the most serious allegations, of torture and murder, were “wholly without foundation and entirely the product of deliberate lies, reckless speculation and ingrained hostility”. The al-Sweady inquiry was not part of Ihat, but both Leigh Day and Public Interest Lawyers had worked on the case and both received furious criticism. On the same day the inquiry released its report, Michael Fallon, then defence secretary, gave a statement to the Commons, calling for measures to stop “unscrupulous” lawyers receiving public money for lengthy inquiries. (The inquiry cost around £31m.) Fallon said that the al-Sweady claims were a “shameful attempt to use our legal system to attack and falsely impugn our armed forces”. This was a remarkable attack. Ihat, a state-funded criminal investigation, was ongoing, and the defence minister was criticising the lawyers involved. At Fallon’s request, the two firms were referred to the Solicitors Regulation Authority, a professional body, for misconduct. Although the al-Sweady case was separate to Ihat, in retrospect it is clear that the judgment marked the beginning of the end for Ihat – and helped transform the public conversation about British military conduct in Iraq. The day after Fallon’s speech, the tabloids went to town (“Shame of the lawyers”, said the Daily Mail’s headline). Staff at Public Interest Lawyers received death threats by email and over the phone. The more serious threats were reported to police. The firm installed a security gate and CCTV. “We felt as if we were under siege,” Bethany Shiner said. * * * By 2015, Ihat had outlasted yet another government. Among the new MPs elected in May was Johnny Mercer, a former army officer who had served in Afghanistan. Mercer is a young, dynamic man who feels strongly about the poor treatment of veterans. “We treat them like shit,” he told me when we met late last year. One of Mercer’s highest priorities upon entering parliament as the new MP for Plymouth Moor View was to fight back against Ihat. “It just struck me as a profoundly wrong process,” Mercer said. “I don’t know a single person who served who doesn’t think that those who committed offences should be held to account. But what this struck me as was the denigration of almost the entire British army on baseless evidence.” (Mercer endorses existing measures, such as internal army investigations and courts martial, as a means to hold soldiers to account.) When it comes to the scale of British wrongdoing in Iraq, many human rights advocates point to the £21.8m paid out by the MoD to Iraqi claimants in over 300 cases, citing it as a tacit admission of guilt. Mercer disagrees. “To settle without even speaking to the soldiers, you’re assuming their guilt before any sort of due process or investigation has taken place,” he said. “I certainly got the impression in Whitehall that somehow soldiers are ‘bad’. They were looking at two accounts, and always siding with the Iraqi civilian or with Shiner. I just don’t believe that that many of our servicemen and women were liars.” Mercer began asking questions within parliament about the slow progress of Ihat and the behaviour of investigators. He was shocked to find that “ministers didn’t really know what was going on”, denying that Ihat investigators had knocked on doors of soldiers without writing to them in advance. Mercer felt colleagues didn’t appreciate his probing on this issue, particularly given his low place in the “pecking order” of parliamentary politics. But at least in public, his Conservative colleagues seemed to side with him. Penny Mordaunt, then armed forces minister, accused lawyers of “churning out spurious claims against our armed forces”. Ever since the al-Sweady judgment there had been an intermittent drip of negative coverage about Ihat, which increased as politicians such as Mordaunt, Fallon, Cameron and May criticised the process. In early 2016, the backlash began in earnest, after an article in the Independent stated that prosecutions of soldiers were on the horizon. Disturbing testimonies from soldiers and veterans hit the press, as they described how old allegations had been revived by Ihat, sometimes triggering relapses of PTSD. Amid these individual tales of human suffering, a clear narrative coalesced: crooked human rights lawyers were persecuting “our brave boys”. Some newspapers even appeared to suggest that civilians had no right at all to question what the military does in the fog of war. “What other country would pay lawyers to persecute its own war heroes?” asked one Daily Mail headline. “Craven politicians and shyster lawyers are not fit to clean our soldiers’ boots,” proclaimed the Sunday Express. In the run-up to the September 2016 Conservative party conference, Fallon vowed to end Ihat, along with other historic allegations inquiries into Northern Ireland and Afghanistan. The perceived failure of the investigation into abuses in Iraq had become a way to discredit the entire idea of looking seriously at historic abuses committed by British troops. In her keynote speech to conference, the new prime minister Theresa May pledged: “We will never again – in any future conflict – let those activist, leftwing human rights lawyers harangue and harass the bravest of the brave.” In February 2017, after Mercer’s parliamentary inquiry had interviewed Ihat’s top leaders, he published a report. It described Ihat as an “unmitigated failure” that had “negatively affected the way this country conducts military operations and defends itself”. The day the report came out, Fallon announced Ihat’s closure: a direct response to its findings. Mercer describes it as the best day of his career. Meanwhile, the Solicitors Regulatory Authority was pressing ahead with its investigation of Public Interest Lawyers and Leigh Day over professional misconduct in the al-Sweady inquiry. Legally, a lawyer isn’t culpable if their client has lied – so although the central claims in the al-Sweady case were untrue, that was not the basis of the misconduct allegations. Instead, they mainly related to a complex web of financial arrangements between the two law firms and a network of Iraqi caseworkers. Leigh Day defended itself at a cost of £7.8m. In September 2017, its lawyers were exonerated of all charges of misconduct. (This verdict is being appealed.) Public Interest Lawyers could not draw upon the same kind of funds to defend itself, and shut down while the tribunal was going on. Ultimately, the Solicitors Regulatory Authority upheld 22 charges of misconduct against Phil Shiner, who did not attend the tribunal or appoint representation. Most of the charges related to improper fee-sharing arrangements but the authority also found that Shiner had “failed to take proper steps to ensure that the relevant al-Sweady clients complied with their duty of candour to the Court.” It announced he was to be struck off and charged the full costs of the prosecution, with an interim payment of £250,000 due. He declared bankruptcy soon after. (Gavin Williamson, Fallon’s replacement as defence secretary, said prison was “too good” for Shiner.) Yet despite Shiner’s misconduct in the al-Sweady inquiry, this does not mean that every claim submitted to Ihat was erroneous. In many cases, hard evidence exists – videos of interrogations, medical records, or other documents. “What the government has done is taken the findings against Phil and applied it to all the claimants,” said Bethany. In Iraq, when claimants were informed their cases had been closed, they had no opportunity to challenge it. “They’re frustrated and feel completely out on a limb,” said Bethany. “The one rope that was out there to try and deliver something for them has been cut.” As politicians rode the wave of outrage over Ihat’s treatment of soldiers, bigger questions about culpability were brushed aside. The aspects of the parliamentary report that criticised Ihat and Shiner were widely reported. Less well remarked was a paragraph towards the end: “It is not disputed that there were incidents of abuse by British armed forces service personnel. However, it appears that this may have been at least partly because the training given to military interrogators was inaccurate and may have placed them, unwittingly, at risk of breaking Geneva conventions in their work”. * * * When Ihat was closed, all but 20 of the 3,400 investigations into cases of alleged abuse were suddenly shelved, with little explanation. “I don’t think the British army has been held accountable for its actions in Basra,” says Khalaf, the Iraqi journalist. “It’s all been vague and incomprehensible. The Iraqi courts have no authority over the British, while reaching British courts presents obstacles like language, visas and people’s ignorance. Ihat followed up some cases but failed to achieve justice.” The remaining cases were passed to a new body, the Service Police Legacy Investigations. “I feel like I’ve wasted four years of my life,” said Jonathan, the Ihat employee. Paul, the investigator, felt the same. “When I started, I feared the worst and hoped for the best,” he said. “My wife said: ‘They won’t let you succeed.’ And she was right. I think, without a doubt, the MoD are happy.” Ministers in successive governments had hoped Ihat would finally put to bed the idea that British troops committed widespread abuses against civilians in Iraq. When it closed, it had certainly ended the discussion – but not with a definitive answer on the scale of abuses. Rather, the tone of public discourse had become so partisan that any who questioned the actions of British troops were cast as unpatriotic traitors, while the armed forces were valorised by the very same institution that had, in the words of Johnny Mercer, been tempted to throw them “under a bus”. Everyone involved – whether as an advocate for service personnel or for Iraqi civilians – agrees that the MoD takes great care to protect its own interests, sometimes to the detriment of those serving on the ground. “We’re just political fodder,” Maj Campbell told me. “I think Ihat was possibly set up to cover up the MoD’s lack of training and infrastructure – to cover up their mistakes,” said his lawyer Hilary Meredith. (An MoD spokesperson said: “Ihat investigations were subject to the highest level of scrutiny, including regular and detailed progress hearings in the high court and an independent review. Sir David Calvert-Smith, former director of public prosecutions, found no major flaws with the investigating process.”) In January 2014, long before his public downfall, Shiner referred Britain to the international criminal court, submitting a dossier of evidence of alleged atrocities in Iraq. This suggests that he, too, was doubtful about the Ihat process. The court only investigates when the state in question is unable or unwilling to examine war crimes domestically. When Shiner filed the motion, he said that it was about “individual culpability” for top leadership. In 2014, the court opened a preliminary investigation, and published initial findings in 2017. All the evidence presented to the ICC had been gathered by Shiner and Public Interest Lawyers, and much of this initial inquiry involved assessing whether the evidence was reliable despite Shiner being discredited. The ICC judged that it was, stating there was evidence of sufficiently widespread wrongdoing – mostly relating to treatment in detention – to merit investigation. The report noted fears of “political interference” in the closure of Ihat. The ICC looks at the decision-makers: the generals and senior politicians and officials, not at low-ranking soldiers. When Campbell complained about the Ihat investigation to his commanding officers, he was told the process was vital to avoid scrutiny by the ICC. “Why would I care about that?” Campbell asked me. “If Britain goes to the ICC, it’ll be Tony Blair in the dock, not Tommy Atkins from wherever.” He says he would welcome an ICC investigation. He was recently told that he had been referred to Iraq Fatality Investigations, a body with no powers of criminal prosecution, for yet another investigation of his case. The ICC is now progressing to the next stage, when the court will consider the state’s ability to investigate war crimes fairly itself. Experts suggest that the furore over Ihat might harm Britain’s case. “Clearly, it’s going to be an issue for the ICC,” says Thomas Hansen, a lecturer in law at Ulster University who is researching British accountability for Iraq. On a cold day in December, I met Bethany Shiner at Middlesex University, where she now lectures in law. That morning, the high court had returned a judgment on two civil cases involving four Iraqis alleging mistreatment in British detention. The judge found them to be “credible” and ruled that soldiers had breached the Geneva conventions. The Iraqis were awarded tens of thousands of pounds in damages. “These trials took place against an onslaught of political, military and media slurs of Iraqis bringing spurious claims, and strident criticism of us, as lawyers, representing them. Yet we have just witnessed the rule of law in action,” said Sapna Malik, a partner at Leigh Day who represented two of the claimants. Bethany, tentatively, shared this sense of vindication: “They were testing the facts – evidence of inhumane and degrading treatment. The court found that it was true and it amounted to a human rights violation. They found the witnesses credible. That’s really important.” Taken alongside the ICC’s preliminary assessment, this judgment demonstrated that not all the evidence submitted by Shiner and Public Interest Lawyers comprised of bogus claims from fakers, as had been suggested. Meanwhile, in Basra, hopes for a genuine reckoning are receding. The city is the largest in southern Iraq, rich in natural resources such as oil, but today it is still run by mafias, a legacy of British occupation when armed militias and religious groups flourished. “People in Basra are always angry at the British army, for the simple reason that it did not fulfil its promises of bringing us stability, prosperity, construction, and turning Basra into a wonderful city,” says Khalaf. “The British have tried to buy people by providing some compensation to those whose property was destroyed. But none of us ever really believed Britain would try its army and soldiers.” • Follow the long read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, or sign up to the long read weekly email here."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jun/06/minute-silence-school-nothing-to-say-pupils","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-06T11:20:24Z","webTitle":"Is it time to give the overworked one-minute’s silence a rest? | Giles Fraser","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/06/minute-silence-school-nothing-to-say-pupils","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/06/minute-silence-school-nothing-to-say-pupils","fields":{"headline":"Is it time to give the overworked one-minute’s silence a rest?","bodyText":"Get well soon, Nicholas Parsons. The 94-year-old Just a Minute presenter caused something of a stir this week when he missed his first programme for more than 50 years. “Just taking a couple of days off,” explained the BBC, which is fair enough. For more than 900 programmes Parsons has been refereeing the popular Radio 4 show in which guests are invited to speak for a minute “without hesitation, repetition or deviation”. He deserves a bit of a break. Elsewhere, the challenge is not about filling up a whole minute with non-repetitious twaddle – which some people find surprisingly easy – but enduring it without any content whatsoever. According to a report in the Times, the regular use of a minute’s silence in school is apparently “traumatising” the children. Or it is being done so much that it is desensitising them, leaving them “unmoved”. Apparently, in one school they have had up to “five or six” periods of silence over the past year. Poor dears, that must have been so unspeakably horrid for them. Imagine the aching loneliness, the black pool of terrifying existential angst, that might be encountered in a whole six minutes’ absence from all our yabber, yabber, yabber over 365 days. As you can see, my first reaction was entirely unsympathetic, in that what-is-the-world-coming-to kind of way. I confess, I could even feel myself reaching for the word “snowflake”. Were these schoolchildren really so mollycoddled that they couldn’t cope for just a minute without distraction, without the consolation of continuous chatter? For centuries, silence has been understood as a place where many of the world’s mysteries unfurl themselves. Silence creates the conditions for wisdom and self-understanding … and so on. But the more I thought about it, the more sympathetic I became to those complaining about the over-use of silence in schools. Because the sort of silence that is often being used in school assemblies is the lazy silence of not having anything to say. Too often, perhaps, silence is being rolled out as some good-for-all-occasions spiritual Esperanto, as something that has all the supposed gravitas of prayer but without any of the troubling religious content. And silence doesn’t take much preparation for a harassed teacher having to make up yet another dreary assembly. Silence can be profound but it can also be cheap. As Diarmaid MacCulloch explained in his fascinating study of the history of silence in Christian thought, silence isn’t just the profound silence of the desert ascetic at one with his God. There is also the silence of those who are not allowed to speak, and those who have been silenced by the authorities. Silence is an extremely various phenomenon – it can be an invitation to wonder as well as a gagging order on those who would speak up for the truth. There is the industrious silence of your children doing their homework. And the lonely silence of the house when the rest of your family go away on holiday without you. And the embarrassed silence when your granny farts in the lift. Nothing absorbs its context quite like silence. And too often, the quality that school-assembly silence takes on is the defensive silence of not wanting to say anything that might offend anyone, and the silence of not having anything to say turned into a routine. No wonder the children find it tough to sit through. In our post-religious age, contentlessness has become a cheap stand-in for something a bit religion-like. Like the ghastly airport chapel, for example, that has had its religious content stripped out, and now exhibits all the spiritual charisma of an interrogation cell. And it pleases no one. This is the reductio ad absurdum of a generation who thought that being spiritual but not religious was a sustainable thing. And in objecting to the overuse of silence, perhaps our young people are calling time on those who cannot tell the difference between deep and empty. • Giles Fraser was the author of the Guardian’s Loose Canon column, and is priest-in-charge at St Mary, Newington, south London"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"music/2018/jul/01/observer-archive-the-rolling-stones-in-hyde-park-5-july-1969","type":"article","sectionId":"theobserver","sectionName":"From the Observer","webPublicationDate":"2018-07-01T07:00:41Z","webTitle":"Observer picture archive: The Rolling Stones in Hyde Park, 5 July 1969","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/jul/01/observer-archive-the-rolling-stones-in-hyde-park-5-july-1969","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/jul/01/observer-archive-the-rolling-stones-in-hyde-park-5-july-1969","fields":{"headline":"Observer picture archive: The Rolling Stones in Hyde Park, 5 July 1969","bodyText":"This is an edited extract of a report by John Gale appeared on page 1 of the Observer on 6 July 1969 Before the Rolling Stones played in Hyde Park yesterday, Mick Jagger paid a tribute to the group’s former guitarist, Brian Jones, who died in the swimming pool of his home last week. He asked the multitude in the Cockpit, a grassy bowl above the Serpentine, to ‘cool it for a minute because I would really like to say something about Brian. I don’t know how to do this thing, but I’m going to try ... I’m just going to say something that was written by Shelley.’ And he began: ‘Peace, peace, he is not dead, he does not sleep: He has awakened from the dreams of life...’ The mighty throng heard the poem in silence, and the dust of the day rose into the sultry air amid the oaks and elms and beeches. From far off you might have supposed that this great gathering had come to hear a famed religious leader or some Eastern mystic. The thousands looked like a great dish of confetti, and the atmosphere was strangely peaceful. Could there really have been half a million? Some perched like birds in the trees: others stood on piles of tins or upturned litter baskets: girls climbed on the boys’ shoulders. And the concert was free. When Jagger had finished reading, the Stones began to blast the air, and thousands of butterflies were released from cardboard boxes. Why the butterflies? ‘Because,’ said an organiser, ‘we thought it would be nice.’ Girls and boys wore ornate Chinese robes and smocks in coloured silk with wide purple and orange trousers. Some carried children on their backs or in carry-cots. A girl slept using a small black-and-white dog as a pillow. Others collected for Biafran relief. An old man wore rectangular purple glasses. There were even Scots Guardsmen. A group of toughs in boots and jeans with their hair conspicuously shorn drew the attention of a police car. In the musicians’ enclosure below the scaffolded bandstand, rockers and Hell’s Angels acted as stewards. They wore black leather jackets, Nazi steel helmets, dark glasses, and swastikas and crucifixes swinging from neck-chains against their bare chests. Most were gentle and unmilitary and kept order well. Many in this enclosure were camp followers: beautiful girl friends and wives, some in transparent blouses, feeding their grubby, healthy children. Julie Felix was here in jeans. Marianne Faithfull carried a small child and wore a long white dress: an antique dealer wore a yellow-and-black checked plastic bowler hat. A girl official had small nipples peeking from her string dress. ‘It’s nicer that I expected,’ said a middle aged man.

Samantha Bee: ‘I never intended to hurt anyone, except Ted Cruz’ Bee returned to TV screens for the first time since her apology that followed her calling Ivanka Trump a “feckless cunt” during a segment on the administration’s immigration policy. She opened the show by saying: “A lot of people were offended and angry that I used an epithet to describe the president’s daughter and adviser last week. It is a word I have used on the show many times, hoping to reclaim it. This time, I used it as an insult. I crossed the line. I regret it. And I do apologize for that.” She continued: “The problem is that many women have heard that word at the worst moments of their lives. A lot of them don’t want that word reclaimed; they want it gone. And I don’t blame them. I want this show to be challenging and I want it to be honest, but I never intended it to hurt anyone, except Ted Cruz.” She went on: “Many men were also offended by my use of the word. I do not care about that.” Bee expressed regret, too, that the uproar over her comments contributed “to the nightmare of news we’re white-knuckling through”. She said: “I hate that this distracted from more important issues. I hate that I did something to contribute to the nightmare of 24-hour news cycles that we’re all white-knuckling through. I should have known that a potty-mouthed insult would be inherently more interesting to them than juvenile immigration policy. I would do anything to help those kids. I hate that this distracted from them, so to them, I am also sorry.” She concluded: “If you are worried about the death of civility, don’t sweat it. I’m a comedian. People who hone their voices in basement bars while yelling back at drunk hecklers are definitely not paragons of civility. I am really sorry I said that word, but civility is just nice words. Maybe we should all worry a little bit more about the niceness of our actions.” Stephen Colbert: ‘OJ, will you accept this rose?’ CBS’s Stephen Colbert discussed Trump’s commutation of the sentence of Alice Johnson, a first-time non-violent drug offender who was jailed for life for cocaine trafficking. Colbert said: “He did the right thing. She didn’t deserve to be in there. But maybe he did the right thing for the wrong reason, because there was no formal legal process or review as there normally is. Trump just commuted her sentence because of a meeting with Kim Kardashian.” Colbert was referring to Kardashian’s visit to the White House last week, where she reportedly lobbied the president to pardon Johnson. “So executive clemency is now just a reality TV show,” the host joked. “OJ, will you accept this rose?” Colbert then noted that Trump has used the pardon extensively so far, for Joe Arpaio, as well as Scooter Libby, Dinesh D’Souza, and the late boxer Jack Johnson. Colbert noted that Trump is reportedly preparing paperwork to pardon up to 30 others. He said: “OK, let’s see who we got here. Iron Mike Tyson, Charlie Sheen, the hot mugshot convict, the Noid, Hannibal Lecter, Fred Flintstone, and Osama bin Laden. Take that, Obama. Now you murdered an innocent man.” Trevor Noah: ‘Facebook figured out how to monetize our arguments’ Finally, Comedy Central’s Trevor Noah covered recent reports about Facebook’s previously undisclosed data-sharing partnerships with various Chinese tech companies. “Facebook, the Myspace of Twitter,” he began. “Are they violating our privacy? Can we trust them with our data? And why do so many people in my news feed have border collies who need kidney transplants?” The host then showed a news segment detailing Facebook’s data-sharing partnership with the Chinese electronic companies including Huawei, the world’s thing largest phone maker and, according to US intelligence, a potential national security threat. Noah went on: “Facebook says that they want to change, but I don’t know how easy it’ll be for the company, considering that the core of its business is to turn your information into profits, which they’re really good at doing.” The company, Noah noted, netted $40bn in advertising revenue in 2017, making up 98% of its total revenue. The host also showed clips of cable news commentators explaining how the company exploits polarization. “That’s right,” Noah said. “The human impulse to get into an argument, never back down, and then die before ever conceding a single point, Facebook figured out how to monetize that.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jun/08/save-planet-meat-dairy-livestock-food-free-range-steak","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-08T05:00:02Z","webTitle":"The best way to save the planet?

Drop meat and dairy","bodyText":"Whether human beings survive this century and the next, whether other lifeforms can live alongside us: more than anything, this depends on the way we eat. We can cut our consumption of everything else almost to zero and still we will drive living systems to collapse, unless we change our diets. All the evidence now points in one direction: the crucial shift is from an animal- to a plant-based diet. A paper published last week in Science reveals that while some kinds of meat and dairy production are more damaging than others, all are more harmful to the living world than growing plant protein. It shows that animal farming takes up 83% of the world’s agricultural land, but delivers only 18% of our calories. A plant-based diet cuts the use of land by 76% and halves the greenhouse gases and other pollution that are caused by food production. Part of the reason is the extreme inefficiency of feeding livestock on grain: most of its nutritional value is lost in conversion from plant protein to animal protein. This reinforces my contention that if you want to eat less soya, then you should eat soya: 93% of the soya we consume, which drives the destruction of forest, savannah and marshland, is embedded in meat, dairy, eggs and fish, and most of it is lost in conversion. When we eat it directly, much less of the crop is required to deliver the same amount of protein. More damaging still is free-range meat: the environmental impacts of converting grass into flesh, the paper remarks, “are immense under any production method practised today”. This is because so much land is required to produce every grass-fed steak or chop. Though roughly twice as much land is used for grazing worldwide as for crop production, it provides just 1.2% of the protein we eat. While much of this pastureland cannot be used to grow crops, it can be used for rewilding: allowing the many rich ecosystems destroyed by livestock farming to recover, absorbing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, protecting watersheds and halting the sixth great extinction in its tracks. The land that should be devoted to the preservation of human life and the rest of the living world is at the moment used to produce a tiny amount of meat. Whenever I raise the crucial issue of yield per hectare, I receive a barrage of vituperation and abuse. But I’m not having a go at farmers, just pointing out that the figures don’t add up. We can neither feed the world’s growing population nor protect its living systems through animal farming. Meat and dairy are an extravagance we can no longer afford. There is no way out of this. Those who claim that “regenerative” or “holistic” ranching mimics nature deceive themselves. It relies on fencing, while in nature wild herbivores roam freely, often across vast distances. It excludes or eradicates predators, which are crucial to the healthy functioning of all living systems. It tends to eliminate tree seedlings, ensuring that the complex mosaics of woody vegetation found in many natural systems – essential to support a wide range of wildlife – are absent. The animal industry demands ever-greater assaults on the living world. Witness the badger slaughter in the UK, now spreading across the country in response to the misguided requests of dairy farmers. People ask how I would justify the return of wolves, knowing that they would kill some sheep. I ask how they justify the eradication of wolves and a vast range of other wildlife to make way for sheep. The most important environmental action we can take is to reduce the amount of land used by farming. Unless you can cook well – and many people have neither the skills nor the space – a plant-based diet can be either boring or expensive. We need better and cheaper vegan ready meals and quick and easy meat substitutes. The big shift will come with the mass production of cultured meat. There are three main objections. The first is that the idea of artificial meat is disgusting. If you feel this way, I invite you to look at how your sausages, burgers and chicken nuggets are currently raised, slaughtered and processed. Having worked on an intensive pig farm, I’m more aware than most of what disgusting looks like. The second objection is that cultured meat undermines local food production. Perhaps those who make this claim are unaware of where animal feed comes from. Passing Argentinian soya through a nearby pig before it reaches you does not make it any more local than turning it directly into food for humans. The third objection has greater merit: cultured meat lends itself to corporate concentration. Again, the animal feed industry (and, increasingly, livestock production) has been captured by giant conglomerates. But we should fight to ensure that cultured meat does not go the same way: in this sector as in all others, we need strong anti-trust laws. This could also be a chance to break our complete dependence on artificial nitrogen. Traditionally, animal and plant farming were integrated through the use of manure. Losses from this system led to a gradual decline in soil fertility. The development of industrial fertilisers saved us from starvation, but at a high environmental cost. Today, the link between livestock and crops has mostly been broken: crops are grown with industrial chemicals while animal slurry stacks up, unused, in stinking lagoons, wipes out rivers and creates dead zones at sea. When it is applied to the land, it threatens to accelerate antibiotic resistance. In switching to a plant-based diet, we could make use of a neat synergy. Most protein crops – peas and beans – capture nitrogen from the air, fertilising themselves and raising nitrate levels in the soil that subsequent crops, such as cereals and oilseeds, can use. While the transition to plant protein is unlikely to eliminate the global system’s need for artificial fertiliser, the pioneering work of vegan organic growers, using only plant-based composts and importing as little fertility as possible from elsewhere, should be supported by research that governments have so far failed to fund. Understandably, the livestock industry will resist all this, using the bucolic images and pastoral fantasies that have beguiled us for so long. But it can’t force us to eat meat. The shift is ours to make. It becomes easier every year. • George Monbiot is a Guardian columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"sport/2018/jun/07/rafael-nadal-fights-hard-victory-schwartzman-french-open-tennis","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-07T12:19:44Z","webTitle":"Rafael Nadal could win another four French Open titles – Robin Söderling","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/jun/07/rafael-nadal-fights-hard-victory-schwartzman-french-open-tennis","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/jun/07/rafael-nadal-fights-hard-victory-schwartzman-french-open-tennis","fields":{"headline":"Rafael Nadal could win another four French Open titles – Robin Söderling","bodyText":"Robin Söderling, one of only two players to get the better of Rafael Nadal at Roland Garros, nine years ago in the fourth round, said on Thursday the Spaniard could add as many as four French Open titles to the 10 he has already collected. “Maybe he’s not moving as good as he did five, six, 10 years ago,” the Swede said of Nadal, who had just seen off the determined Argentinian Diego Schwartzman 4-6, 6-3, 6-2, 6-2 in the held-over quarter-final on Court Philippe-Chatrier. “But it’s a very small difference. I would say he’s probably as good now as before and it’s just amazing. If he can stay injury-free there is nothing that says he can’t win this two, three, four times more. It’s unbelievable.” Nadal at 32 is as locked in to his mission as on the day he announced his arrival here by beating another Argentinian, Mariano Puerta, in the 2005 final and embarked on one of sport’s great odysseys. In the semi-final on Friday he plays another – considerably taller – Argentinian in 6ft 8in Juan Martín del Potro, who finished a tougher assignment against the No 3 seed, Marin Cilic, 7-6 (5), 5-7, 6-3, 7-5, in just under four hours on Court Suzanne-Lenglen, in a battle of two former US Open champions. Nadal says his status on clay is neither a hindrance nor an advantage. “I just go on court knowing that every match is difficult and I can lose and I can win,” he said. The stormy Parisian weather has not helped, as he told Spanish journalists: “Thunder woke me up at 3am and I had trouble going back to sleep. But apart from that I’m resting well.” Söderling, who had his moment in the sun two years before glandular fever forced him to quit the game at 27, observed: “Even though he won it 10 times, he’s here to win 11 times. He looks even hungrier than when he won it the first time. He didn’t lose any motivation at all. It’s amazing to see. I’m really impressed about the way he plays his backhand now. Even when players put a lot of pace on his backhand he’s defending really well. “To beat him on clay, I would say the only chance for any player now is to be really aggressive. It’s an extremely difficult task. You have to take a lot of risks. Of course, he’s the favourite. But nothing is impossible.” Söderling, who went on to lose to Roger Federer in the 2009 final, has fought depression in recent years and may return on the Champions Tour. But there was a smile on his face watching his old adversary on Thursday. For Del Potro there were tears, not for the first time. The No 5 seed broke down on court after coming through a testing match against Cilic, cross at himself for losing his temper with a spectator after double-faulting to hand his opponent a 5-4 lead in the second. They resumed at 5-5 in the tie-break and spent another couple of wearying hours in the sun. Del Potro looked spent at the finish but forged an emotional bond with the crowd as he spoke. He has come through three wrist surgeries in the past four years and at one stage contemplated walking away from tennis. “It was very important for me to have the support of my family and friends in the months when I could not play. I feel at home whenever I play here.” As for the task awaiting him in the semi-finals, he told the crowd: “It’s going to be the challenge that every player wants. I don’t know if I will win but I will take big love from you. Is more important to me.” There is, however, an elephant in the room at this otherwise uplifting party: Marco Cecchinato. His should be the fairytale of the tournament and, to a large extent, it is: the 25-year-old Italian, ranked 72 in the world, who came from two sets down to win 10-8 in the fifth of his opening match and went on to put the former champion Novak Djokovic out in a heart-stopping quarter-final. Yet allegations of match-fixing have hung over him for nearly three years, even though he was allowed off on a technicality when the Italian federation failed to meet a deadline in the appeals process. As detailed in the New York Times last year Italian investigators tapped into WhatsApp messages between Cecchinato and his friend Riccardo Accardi that suggested he might recoup betting losses on Italian football at the 2015 Mohammedia Challenger in Morocco. Accardi and his father used multiple accounts to bet on Cecchinato at 7-1 to lose in straight sets to the world No 338 Kamil Majchrzak, which he did. Cecchinato denied the allegations and appealed – and the Italian federation’s processes broke down to the extent that he escaped without censure. The Tennis Integrity Unit did not respond to Guardian inquiries on Thursday as to whether they were taking the investigation any further. Cecchinato, the first Italian to get this far since Corrado Barazzutti 40 years ago and the longest long shot since 100th-ranked Andrei Medvedev reached the final in 1999, will play Dominic Thiem in the first semi-final on Friday. On Thursday, the Roland Garros website posted a heartwarming video of Cecchinato meeting his hero, Marat Safin, for the first time. The player will talk about anything on the eve of the biggest day of his career – except the dark mark on his CV. “I don’t want to speak for that,” he said after the most stunning match of his career. “I want to think for this moment in my life. And so next time, no, please. Thank you.” Next time will be interesting."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2018/jun/07/tories-michael-howard-confronts-israel-over-gaza-protesters-deaths","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-07T13:55:35Z","webTitle":"Michael Howard confronts Netanyahu over Gaza deaths","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/07/tories-michael-howard-confronts-israel-over-gaza-protesters-deaths","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/07/tories-michael-howard-confronts-israel-over-gaza-protesters-deaths","fields":{"headline":"Michael Howard confronts Netanyahu over Gaza deaths","bodyText":"The former Conservative party leader Michael Howard has confronted the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, over Israel’s recent killing of more than 100 Palestinian protesters, demanding to know why the country’s defence forces used live ammunition to curb the protests.Responding to sharp, unexpected questions from one of the most prominent Jewish figures in British politics, Netanyahu said he was looking for new technological solutions to prevent protesters scaling the fence separating Gaza from Israel. He insisted the protesters were either paid civilians or Hamas members. Netanyahu was speaking at the close of a lightning tour of Berlin, Paris and London, where he told European leaders that the Iran nuclear deal was collapsing as EU firms ended investment in Iran. The US president, Donald Trump, pulled out of the deal last month partly due to Israeli claims, rejected in Europe, that Iran was “cheating” on the 2015 deal. Netanyahu also gave a sharp warning that the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad, would face direct Israeli military strikes if he allowed Iran to entrench itself in Syria. Lord Howard said many people accepted the protests had not been peaceful, but added: “Fewer people sympathise with, and understand, the proposition that the only way to stop them scaling the fence was to kill them. Why could you not use rubber bullets? Why could you – if, in extremis, you had to use live ammunition – not shoot them in the legs? Why did you have to kill them?” The British foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, raised similar questions with Netanyahu when they met on Wednesday. Netanyahu told Howard that the methods he proposed had been tried, and claimed: “Hamas wanted the Jews to kill more. Their goal was to have as many casualties. Our goal was to minimise casualties.” He said he would be the first to use non-lethal means if they could be found, and insisted he was exploring other options for the future. He claimed his army was facing a new form of warfare. He said it was “unconscionable” that Hamas put civilians in front of its fighters as human shields. The military and political wings of Hamas were indistinguishable, he said, describing them as “the worst theocratic gangsters in the world”. He suggested that the Hamas wings believed in nothing. “They don’t believe in democracy or pluralism. They hang gays. Why are progressive forces going behind some of the least progressive forces in the world?” The answer, he said, was antisemitism. “It is important to call things as they are.” Netanyahu also sent out his clearest warning yet that he would not tolerate the Syrian civil war finishing with Iranians remaining inside Syria. It is an issue that increasingly preoccupies Russia as it tries to prevent Israel going to war against Assad if he allows Tehran’s influence to grow so close to Israel’s border. In May, Israel launched a large-scale attack on what it said were Iranian targets in Syria, raising fears of a big confrontation. Those strikes followed a barrage of rockets that Israel said were fired toward its forces in the occupied Golan Heights by Iran from Syria. Netanyahu said: “I think Mr Assad has to consider this. As long as he engages in this horrific civil war inside Syria we will not deny him a deal. Now that the war is over, and Daesh is finished, and he likes or allows Iran to come in to entrench itself with a view to attack Israel, with the intention of destroying Israel, and its sovereign territory, he is no longer immune, his regime is no longer immune. “If he fires at us we will destroy his forces. So I think there is a new calculus that has to take place and Syria has to understand that Israel will not tolerate the Iranian military entrenchment in Syria against Israel, and the consequences are there not just to the Iranian forces, but to the Assad regime as well. I think that this is something he should consider very seriously.” He said European leaders were very sympathetic to Israel’s desire to rid Syria of an Iranian presence, adding that this had been the chief focus of his round of conversations with European leaders. Netanyahu also claimed that in his talks with the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, there had been an understanding that Russia would not get in Israel’s way. He said Russia was not turning a blind eye and that Moscow could see what Israel was doing. He said the Iranian nuclear deal was “effectively defunct” regardless of European support for it, since the weight of the US sanctions was forcing firms to make a choice about whether to do business with Iran or the US. Companies were having the choose between an economy that was 3% of the size of the US economy or forgo a multi-trillion market, he said. “It is a no-brainer,” he said, “and everyone is choosing effectively as we speak. Companies are pulling out of Iran.” By removing an incentive to do business with Iran, the US had smashed Iran’s cash machine, he claimed, adding that most European leaders recognised that the nuclear deal with Iran was falling apart. • This article was amended on 7 June 2018 to correct the number of Palestinian deaths."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/jun/08/ellyse-perry-worlds-best-female-cricket-guardian","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-08T11:43:54Z","webTitle":"Ellyse Perry named world’s best female cricketer in inaugural Guardian survey","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/jun/08/ellyse-perry-worlds-best-female-cricket-guardian","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/jun/08/ellyse-perry-worlds-best-female-cricket-guardian","fields":{"headline":"Ellyse Perry named world’s best female cricketer in inaugural Guardian survey","bodyText":"Had the Guardian compiled a list of the world’s 20 best women cricketers at any stage over the past few years Meg Lanning would likely have been an emphatic choice as the world’s best, such is the way she has rewritten records with her broad and stylish blade. It shows how competitive women’s cricket is that the Australia captain’s six months out of the game, rebuilding a shoulder that needed reconstructing, was enough for her to be overtaken by Ellyse Perry and Suzie Bates when compiling this inaugural list. The Guardian asked 15 judges with specialist knowledge of women’s cricket – including Ebony-Jewel Rainford-Brent, Mel Jones and Jason Gillespie – to choose their individual top 20 from a longlist of 40. We pooled their votes to produce our own list of the world’s top 20 on the eve of England’s first match of the summer. It is not a definitive list – ask 15 other judges and you would have a different top 20 – but it does provide intriguing reading. Of course there should be no quibbling about Perry’s ascension. For the first half of her career she was the opening bowler who made handy contributions well down the list. Now she is the most consistent runscorer in the game, highlighted by her masterful unbeaten Ashes Test double hundred last November. The 27-year-old is truly at the peak of her powers and this recognition mirrors that. The margins between the top three were negligible; they were the only players in the votes from every judge. But the numerical drop to fourth was significant, reinforcing the esteem in which this Big Three are held. Second‑placed Bates, New Zealand’s captain, has been rewarded for her relentless output across formats, countries and competitions both international and domestic. Another pointer to the diversified strength of women’s cricket is that India, World Cup finalists last year, have four entries. Mithali Raj (fourth), the side’s inspirational leader, was a lock as was the veteran opening bowler Jhulan Goswami (13th), who shows no signs of tapering off. But it is Smitri Mandhana (eighth) and Harmanpreet Kaur (10th) who represent the future of a transformed team on a mission to captivate their nation. India can point to more entries than the World T20 champions, West Indies, with only Stafanie Taylor (seventh) getting the nod, and the traditional powerhouse New Zealand. For the White Ferns, the senior players Amy Satterthwaite (10th) and Sophie Devine (19th) were supported by the panel in addition to Bates. Turning to the players who held up the World Cup trophy at Lord’s last July, England are equally best represented with five entrants. Reflecting the evenness of their output, Sarah Taylor is the first of those in ninth, also making her the top-rated wicketkeeper. The bowler who dominated the final, Anya Shrubsole (12th), is the first of the trio named Wisden Cricketers of the Year ahead of Nat Sciver (15th) and the captain, Heather Knight (20th). The latter snuck in despite the fact that she was also the Player of the Women’s Ashes. As for Katherine Brunt (18th), the evergreen seamer-turned-smasher keeps on going. Five Australians also made the 20. The swing specialist Megan Schutt joined the aforementioned Perry and Lanning in the top six after topping the Women’s Ashes wickets column. After finally clicking with the bat at the top level, Alyssa Healy (16th) also made the cut, as did the frugal finger spinner Jess Jonassen (18th). In the battle of the specialist seamers, Schutt was one place behind South Africa’s Marizanne Kapp (fifth) who boasts the best economy rate in the game. Her Proteas captain, the leg-spinner Dane van Niekerk (18th) is also there, one of only two front‑line spinners. So much for the adage in women’s cricket that the only way to win is to spin. Not in this survey, at least. Of those who missed out, the England opener Tammy Beaumont has every right to be peeved. Named the player of the World Cup last year, she was also overlooked on Wisden night. Beth Mooney, the ICC’s T20 player of the year, also fell short, but it will not be long before she is a mainstay of this list. All signs suggest it will be the same for the England T20 all-rounder Danielle Wyatt. The youngsters Ash Gardner (Australia), Hayley Matthews (West Indies) and Laura Woolvaart (South Africa) were all in the votes without getting over the line. That they all play on the semi-professional circuit helps their case in the future: 18 of the top 20 have featured in the Women’s Big Bash League in Australia. With visibility comes value. As a process, the top 20 was exhaustive. You can see the full voting here. As a debate, it is ongoing; emblematic of a talent pool never deeper and a game never healthier."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"music/2018/jun/10/beyonce-jay-z-review-cardiff-on-the-run-2-tour","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-10T08:00:46Z","webTitle":"Beyoncé and Jay-Z review – still crazy in love after all these years","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/jun/10/beyonce-jay-z-review-cardiff-on-the-run-2-tour","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/jun/10/beyonce-jay-z-review-cardiff-on-the-run-2-tour","fields":{"headline":"Beyoncé and Jay-Z review – still crazy in love after all these years","bodyText":"To paraphrase a line from Family Feud, a track aired tonight from Jay-Z’s most recent album, 4:44: “What’s better than one billionaire music superstar whose baby pictures melt the internet? Two.” The last time Beyoncé – said billionaire (actual net worth $350m) – and her husband Jay-Z – said other billionaire (actual net worth $860m) – toured together, in 2014, their On the Run tour did not come to the UK. Now, the Welsh capital finds itself hosting the very first night of the couple’s On the Run II world tour, in which a mature, battle-worn, convincing love affair between two huge entertainers is played out on a vast stage with a set the size of a small city block, with double-jointed dancers, live horn and string sections and mobile hydraulic platforms. If you were pitching the whole thing to a producer in a lift, it’s Beyoncé’s Formation tour of 2016-meets-Watch the Throne, the hip-hop double-header undertaken by Jay-Z and Kanye West in 2011 and 2012 – except with a lot more pictures of small children woven into the slightly strained Caribbean Bonnie and Clyde visual narrative that frames the show. This is not the Afro-American extravaganza of signifiers that Beyoncé put together for the Coachella festival in the US in April, in which she reunited Destiny’s Child and packed her stage set with symbolism. But there is no shortage of wow factor here, if perhaps for slightly different reasons than anticipated. The couple haven’t released many images of their nearly one-year-old twins, Rumi and Sir, to the public. So on one level this entire two-hours-plus gig feels like one long slow musical tease, building towards grainy holiday snaps of Beyoncé holding twins, Jay-Z holding twins, the sleeping twins’ fingers touching and Blue Ivy, their eldest child, getting cuter every time the US entertainment power-family holiday in the Caribbean. Judging from the reaction on social media after the show, it’s as though the entire internet is a nosy aunt, impatient with the formalities – the elegiac singing, the word-perfect rapping, the gluteal dancing, the constantly changing costumes – and instead lunging for the photo album with liver-spotted talons. Now, it transpires that the babies being held in the videos were perhaps not Rumi and Sir after all, casting the tour’s opening claim – “This is real life” – into some doubt. The last time the Carters toured en famille, the landscape was unrecognisable: fake news wasn’t even much of a thing. The Met Ball lift incident, where Solange Knowles, Beyoncé’s sister, attacked Jay-Z, shining a spotlight on the tumult in Beyoncé and Jay-Z’s marriage, happened in spring 2014, shortly before the first On the Run tour. Since then, we’ve had Lemonade, the jaw-dropping Beyoncé album, in which Jay-Z’s infidelity was laid bare, and 4:44, the groundbreaking Jay-Z record in which the rapper owned up and aimed to be a better man. He’s certainly a changed-looking man. Previously short-cropped and dressed down, tonight Jay-Z is startlingly laid-back: slim, rocking Rastafarian-inspired high fashion, unprecedentedly stubbly, hair grown out. Beyoncé, meanwhile, is pure glowing halogen: an encyclopaedia of dance moves; unrelentingly Beyoncé-esque. When one holds the stage on their own, the other does a costume change. When they take a break for an interlude, a metaphorical gangster fantasy set in Jamaica in which houses burn and vows are renewed unfolds on what is rumoured to be the widest screen ever to hit an arena. The detail can be intriguing – why is that most un-American word “FUCKERY” displayed upside down? The Jamaican influence, at a guess – and exquisite. Beyoncé ends Naughty Girl with a snippet of Destiny’s Child’s Say My Name, but sung in Indian devotional style, which segues sublimely into the Egyptian sample of Jay-Z’s Big Pimpin’, subject of a recent court case over royalties. Given the seismic shifts, On the Run II is – necessarily – more than just a romp through the foundation texts of this most public of American musical romances, fun as they remain. The track where it arguably all began, ’03 Bonnie and Clyde (2002), plays out across twin runways with Beyoncé and Jay-Z trading lines across a lake of fans. There are bald patches in the stands and bald patches on the ground, too; the stadium is only semi-full, but not to a level where questions need to be asked. Much later, Crazy in Love, arguably still the best song the Carters have ever done together, sounds hyped with the generous application of a live horn section: multiple trumpets, a couple of trombones and two tubas; the reaction of the place certainly sounds sold out. Déjà Vu, another bit of ancient history, hasn’t aged as well and the artists’ most recent his’n’hers outing – a DJ Khaled track called Top Off – didn’t really meet with much enthusiasm when it was released in March. It doesn’t exactly rock the house live, either. Obviously, there are umpteen solo tracks from each artist’s multi-platinum careers to chuck into this generous – perhaps a little too generous – two-and-a-half-hour extravaganza. Hearing the hits from back when the world was younger – Jay-Z’s 99 Problems, say, or Beyoncé’s Run the World (Girls) – is no chore. Beyoncé’s Drunk in Love manages to retain its horny recklessness, even when it forms part of the vast military exercise that is a stadium gig. Behind the stage is a structure like an unfinished block of flats, where the band, the dancers and the musicians cavort in cubes; at one point, Jay-Z descends it on a window-cleaner’s lift. There’s a giggle when a dancer does the floss. Then there are the slightly confusing songs, where Beyoncé stands in for someone like Justin Timberlake – on the Jay-Z opener Holy Grail – or where he does a track where the spirit of absent collaborators hovers uncertainly. N***** in Paris was the triumphant highlight of that long-ago Jay-Z/Kanye collaboration, being repeated multiple times as the outro to their tour. It feels strange to hear it as a Jay-Z track tonight, an echo of another complicated alliance whose status still remains unresolved. On the Run II is – unequivocally – way more interesting than On the Run I must have been, because of gyrations this marriage has taken. It is the bitter Lemonade songs that remain the most unbearably exciting: Don’t Hurt Yourself and Freedom are enduring assaults on all the senses.

Written by Marjorie Hillis, an editor at American Vogue, and a bestseller in its time, it was aimed at a new generation of women who, whether by design or default, suddenly found themselves living the single life in tiny flats and rooms in cities in both the US and Britain. I don’t live alone, but I look at it quite often. It’s one of those books that, in certain moods, works on you like a really good cocktail or a blast of exactly the right music: an antidote, if not to despair, then to the existential angst that dogs us all every now and again. Hillis covers everything: soft furnishings, what to keep on your drinks trolley, the matter of boyfriends and whether they should stay or go. But it’s the chapter about eating alone I like best. Among its pages, you won’t find any dreary recipes for one; though she rightly regards corned beef hash as a very fine thing indeed, she would rather leave that sort of stuff to stodgier, less inspiriting writers than herself. You will, however, find plenty of other advice. Dress up for dinner, she says – or don’t, if you want to wear your pyjamas. Be sure there’s something in the fridge besides three-day-old leftovers (one-day-old leftovers, on the other hand, are supremely delicious). Make full use of, and don’t ever despise, cans (tinned crab is good, gussied up, and so are tinned peaches, especially with raspberry sauce). Above all, remember that proper nourishment equals strength, mental and physical. Feeding yourself is more important even than taking off your makeup. Back in the 21st century, the evidence mounts that eating alone is a bad thing. A survey published last month based on research carried out among 8,000 British adults found that doing so is more strongly associated with unhappiness than any factor other than mental illness; other studies have suggested that solitary dining is both a risk factor for depression, and that those who do it often are at increased risk of heart disease and diabetes. Such stories tend to get widely reported, and no wonder: a lot more of us eat alone now than in Marjorie Hillis’s day, just as a lot more of us do everything else alone (television, sex, you name it). In 2018, even those who live with other people can be isolated, running on their own timetables, shutting the rest of the world out. None of these findings seem particularly surprising to me, and not only because it’s pretty obvious that cooking only for yourself can seem, at the end of a long day, like far too much effort (thus, we slump on our sofas and eat junk). Everyone knows that there aren’t many things lovelier or more affirming than eating supper with someone you love; when my grandpa died, it was mealtimes that made my granny most miserable. But then again, I’ve never minded eating alone, at least at home (it’s a different story if you’re talking about restaurants, which aren’t always exactly a pleasure for the single woman). This is when I get to eat all the things that other people hate (chicken livers, mostly). This is when I’m allowed to read at the table. This is when I can take as little time, or as long, to scoff whatever happens to be on my plate. Admittedly, there’s now an element of luxury in this for me. Peace and quiet. No one else to please. The sense of a pause opening up. But even in the years – they were quite long – when I did live alone, doing so never seemed to be too bad, perhaps because, like Hillis, I’ve always been a great one for the rituals of dinner. Napkins, candles, all that. Small things, carefully deployed, can make the quotidian not only softly comforting, but quietly radiant, too: a favourite mug, a beloved knife, that slightly chipped dish you found in some market. Taking one of the few old bits of china I’ve inherited out of the cupboard somehow makes me feel connected, even when I’m entirely alone."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"guardian-masterclasses/2018/jun/07/feature-writing-and-digital-storytelling-with-jon-henley-bespoke-training","type":"article","sectionId":"guardian-masterclasses","sectionName":"Guardian Masterclasses","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-07T10:22:03Z","webTitle":"Feature writing and digital storytelling | Jon Henley","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/guardian-masterclasses/2018/jun/07/feature-writing-and-digital-storytelling-with-jon-henley-bespoke-training","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/guardian-masterclasses/2018/jun/07/feature-writing-and-digital-storytelling-with-jon-henley-bespoke-training","fields":{"headline":"Feature writing and digital storytelling with Jon Henley","bodyText":"Senior Guardian feature writer Jon Henley reveals how to make the most of digital journalism, including using social media to source ideas and adapting to multimedia storytelling.

If Eddie Jones’s team are half as quick to the breakdown against the Springboks as they have been in fast-tracking the 27-year-old Kiwi into their first-Test squad, their hosts will not have a clue what has hit them in Johannesburg this weekend. That is certainly how Shields must be feeling amid this week’s blur of new faces and unfamiliar kit. As recently as last Friday he was captaining the Hurricanes in Dunedin and, in 2011, played against several of his team‑mates for New Zealand U20s. Following only a couple of days of proper training, however, he has been thrust into Saturday’s huge contest at Ellis Park, after Joe Launchbury’s sore calf forced Jones to ask the bearded forward to provide bench cover at both second-row and flanker. There is no disputing Shields’s right to wear the red rose, courtesy of his English parents, but even he was slightly worried how he would be received by the rest of the squad. Jones described him as “undoubtedly nervous” upon his arrival in South Africa on Sunday but the head coach has been pleasantly surprised by how swiftly he has settled in. “It is difficult when you come to a different team, particularly when you have been playing domestic rugby in another country. But he has fitted in extremely well and everyone knows he is genuine about wanting to play for England. “He is a very serious and driven player and is determined to make a fist of playing for England. He understands he gave it his all in New Zealand and they didn’t select him. You don’t want players who carry around baggage, you want players who see opportunity and want to take it.” Not everyone, including World Rugby’s Agustin Pichot, believes that nationality should be so casually traded but England’s fly-half George Ford reckons Shields could prove a very useful acquisition. “He’s come in and honestly he’s been brilliant,” said Ford. “It’s mind-blowing in a way that he’s been able to pick everything up so quickly. He seems to be a no-nonsense guy who works as hard as he can and he’s really physical, so he’ll be a great addition for us.’” Ford was in the English U20 side who encountered a black-clad Shields at the 2011 Junior World Cup but he insists Shields’s subsequent change of loyalties will not pose any problems for squad morale. Given the internationally green Shields still has Super Rugby commitments in New Zealand to fulfil before he completes his summer move to Wasps, however, it will be truly remarkable if the new cap makes the immediate impact England would ideally like. The same could be said for Jones’s whole selection, which has involved him making more tweaks and alterations than a busy tailor. If some appear to have been plucked out of thin air that may just be deliberate with the game taking place at altitude. England have never started with so many long‑range kickers at their disposal with their captain, Owen Farrell, Elliot Daly and Henry Slade equipped to send the ball practically into orbit. With another accomplished box-kicker in the uncapped Saracen Ben Spencer on the bench, the Boks could find garryowens raining down on them from all angles. The territory game is certainly one Jones’s team would like to win, with the Springbok starting selection containing a mere 320 caps in total. Under the captaincy of South Africa’s first black Test captain, Siya Kolisi, will be three new caps in the shape of the wingers S’busiso Nkosi and Aphiwe Dyantyi plus the lock forward RG Snyman, although Wasps’ Willie le Roux and Sale’s Faf de Klerk have been included at full‑back and scrum‑half respectively. If no one is absolutely sure precisely what gameplan Rassie Erasmus is planning, Jones is absolutely clear in his own mind that England, tactically, need to make some adjustments of their own. Picking Mike Brown on the left wing was not a conspicuous success against the Barbarians last month but Jones believes the game is changing and wants the Harlequin to spend more time buzzing around the breakdown. “I think there’s a real opportunity in rugby, the way it is played at the moment, to have an industrious strong runner around the ruck. If you look at Brownie’s best attributes they are in and around that area, not in open play. He’s a tough no-nonsense player and I think he can become a really valuable winger for us. “To me you have a left full‑back, a central full‑back and a right full‑back and they interchange all the time anyway. I don’t see that as a massive issue at all.” Daly and Slade, similarly, will be asked to use their rugby instincts to find space where, latterly, England have struggled to find any. There is no room, for now, for Danny Cipriani or Alex Lozowski but up front Jones is hoping the youthful promise of the 20-year-old Nick Isiekwe, making his first Test start, and Tom Curry, winning only his second Test cap, can be translated into instant influence. Curry, according to Jones, has been making a big impact at training. “He’s been injured for most of the season so he’s a bit of an unknown, but the general comment from the senior players has been: ‘This kid could be the real thing.’” England must now pray that Shields proves a similar diamond."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"cities/2018/jul/06/side-effect-why-people-walking-past-walls-is-an-instagram-hit","type":"article","sectionId":"cities","sectionName":"Cities","webPublicationDate":"2018-07-06T06:30:00Z","webTitle":"Side effect: why people walking past walls is an Instagram hit","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2018/jul/06/side-effect-why-people-walking-past-walls-is-an-instagram-hit","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/cities/2018/jul/06/side-effect-why-people-walking-past-walls-is-an-instagram-hit","fields":{"headline":"Side effect: why people walking past walls is an Instagram hit","bodyText":"Amanda Taylor, a London-based English teacher, is behind the hashtag #peoplewalkingpastwalls.

Vulnerable people with serious mental health problems too often receive poor care in an environment that is unsafe and far from therapeutic. You would not want to your loved one to be somewhere like that unless there were no other options. So it is scandalous that increasing numbers of people are being left on mental health wards when they are well enough to leave because of the lack of available social care. NHS England data – obtained by the BBC – found that the rate of delayed discharges in mental health is increasing faster than in other areas of the health service. From November 2015 to October 2016, there was a 56% rise in the number of bed days lost to delayed discharges in mental health trusts. This is almost twice the rate of the increase in acute trusts. There is also a huge financial implication, with the crisis costing the NHS [pdf] more than £170m a year. Delayed discharges disproportionately affect those who are already socially disadvantaged and addressing this issue should be central to Theresa May’s pledge to tackle “burning injustices”. The latest findings from the independent review of the Mental Health Act [pdf] have identified that people from black and minority ethnic (BME) communities continue to be over-represented as patients on mental health wards and are more likely to have been compulsorily detained. This reflects my own experience of working to reduce delayed discharges in a London mental health trust. The majority of patients were from BME communities and nearly all were on low incomes. I found that delays were often the result of conflict between local authorities and clinical commissioning groups about who should pay for a person’s care. Frequently, healthcare professionals, patients and their families would push for a higher level of support while commissioners wanted evidence that a less expensive alternative had failed. This sometimes resulted in patients being discharged with an inadequate level of support – and finding themselves readmitted to hospital. It is important to recognise the transformative effect that providing someone with the right care and support can have. Vea (not her real name) was a middle-aged woman of Caribbean descent who had long-standing psychosis and a lifetime spent under the care of mental health services. When I began working with her, she had recently been sectioned after becoming acutely unwell. Before this she had been turning up frequently at the hospital begging for food. While Vea was in hospital, I visited her housing association flat. It was bare, with a broken window and toilet and no food other than a packet of cereal, which was years out of date. Months later I visited Vea in the supported accommodation I had worked with her community nurse to secure funding for. The improvement in her mental health and quality of life was immense. Without this intervention, I have no doubt she would have soon been back on the ward. It is too easy to blame commissioners for the delayed discharge crisis in mental health. They are forced to meet increasing demand for social care when their budgets have been reduced by almost 50% [pdf] since 2010-11. Responsibility rests with a government that has cut spending on vital services for some of the most vulnerable people in our society. The long overdue green paper could have been an opportunity to prove the government is serious about addressing the social care needs of people with severe mental health problems. The fact that it is to solely focus on the needs of older adults means this crisis will continue at the expense of both patients and the taxpayer.

Black cloud hides the sun rising above the water, and it feels cold in the wind. Crunching on the stones, I tread on thousands of shells, in so many forms, textures and colours, as well as the broken shells and claws of crabs, the white and soft bony plates of cuttlefish, and dark tangles of seaweed. I also find a bright blue plastic bottle top, and another, and a square piece of blue plastic fishing net, green plastic string, a grey plastic bag. I instinctively pick them up and put them in my pockets, but I soon run out of room. And everywhere there are black rubber shards – fragments of vehicle tyres. I make a note to return with large rubbish bags. Among the detritus, towers of red valerian shake in the wind and sea kale plants explode in a flurry of wavy green leaves. Little white flowers are starting to emerge on some of the sea kale. It thrives on the shingle along the south coast, and used to be harvested and eaten to such an extent that it nearly disappeared altogether. Its greatest threat now in some places is the construction of sea defences, which replace the loose shingle with solid walls and banks. I reach a wire fence with a little yellow RSPB sign: “Temporarily closed”. The fencing is to protect nesting seabirds – especially little terns – on the beach and nearby island from predators and disturbance by walkers and their dogs. The multi-organisation, five-year project to help them re-establish here and at 19 other UK sites has been part-funded by EU Life and the UK government. The sun finally breaks through the cloud and the water glows gold. Two little birds – ringed plovers – whizz past me, and settle next to the tide line, where they preen. One of them lacks the orange bill and black on the head of an adult – it’s a young bird, recently fledged. I look up and watch the glimmering sea. Against the brightening sun, the silhouettes of terns flicker as they bounce and flutter, then hover – more like butterflies than birds. One spears down into the water with a short splash, and rises to hover again."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/jun/20/drowned-restrained-shot-life-stories-migrants-case-studies","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-20T05:01:31Z","webTitle":"Drowned, restrained, shot: how these migrants died for a better life","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/20/drowned-restrained-shot-life-stories-migrants-case-studies","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/20/drowned-restrained-shot-life-stories-migrants-case-studies","fields":{"headline":"Drowned, restrained, shot: how these migrants died for a better life","bodyText":"The Guardian is today publishing a list of 34,361 people who have lost their lives trying to get into Europe over the past 25 years. Many are just anonymous entries, but our reporters have investigated a few cases to put faces and stories to the victims. Rubel Ahmed Born: Bangladesh, 1988. Died: UK, 2014. Rubel Ahmed only came to Britain out of curiosity, on a short-term working holiday visa. The oldest sibling from a poor family from Sylhet in Bangladesh, he felt keenly the responsibility on the firstborn to earn and provide for younger siblings. He started work as a chef. He was so good at his job that different restaurants asked him to work for them, promising to sponsor him. Rubel had started sending money home, to turn the family shack in Shangiray into a brick house. He decided to stay on. He applied for leave to remain in the UK. But this application was refused. He was detained under immigration powers on 21 July 2014 and taken to Morton Hall, the immigration removal centre in Lincolnshire that holds people subject to deportation orders. He was devastated when the Home Office informed him on 29 August that he would be removed to Bangladesh on 8 September. “When he was initially detained in Morton Hall he thought he would get bail and be released after a week or so,” said a cousin, Ajmal Ali. “But when the release didn’t happen I think he lost hope. He couldn’t understand why he was locked up and treated like a criminal when he had committed no crime.” Ahmed hanged himself in Morton Hall on 5 September 2014. He is one of more than 400 migrants and refugees on the List who have taken their own lives. Both the inquest into Ahmed’s death and the investigation into it by the Prisons and Probation Ombudsman were critical of procedures before his death. The coroner said that there had been inadequate communication between officials, and the inquest jury found that removal directions contributed to and caused him to hang himself. They came to an open conclusion about his death. Ahmed’s family expressed concern about the lock-in regime at the centre – detainees were locked in for most of the evening as well as overnight. Ahmed’s family said that if Ahmed had been able to speak to other detainees in the hours before he took his life his death may have been prevented. “Although his death happened a few years ago the impact on us, his family, of losing him, hasn’t really got any easier,” Ajmal Ali said. Alan Kurdi Born: Syria, 2012. Died: Turkey, 2015. The vast majority of refugees and migrants who die in their quest to seek a new life in Europe do so in wretched anonymity. But occasionally there is a case that cuts through, shakes public opinion and even changes policy. Alan Kurdi was found on a Turkish beach three years ago. The image of the Syrian toddler lying face down in the surf sickened millions of Europeans, and prompted softer, more welcoming approaches to refugees in Germany, Britain and elsewhere. Kurdi was from Kobani, a border town in northern Syria that for months was the epicentre of fighting between Islamic State and Kurdish forces. Syria was already at war when he was born in 2012. The family lived in a single unheated room with a hole in the floor for a toilet. His father decided to move his wife and two children to Turkey, but subsequently decided to try to get to Canada, where Alan’s aunt Tima lives. The dinghy they travelled in to try to get from Bodrum to the Greek island of Kos quickly sank. It was built for eight people but there were 16 inside as it was launched for the short by dangerous passage from the Turkish coast to Kos. The lifejackets they were wearing were said to be either fake or ineffective. Alan’s brother, Galip, and mother, Rehanna, also drowned. Abdullah survived. He and Tima have since established the Galip and Alan Kurdi Foundation to help children whose lives have been ruined by war. Almost 10,000 people have died trying to get into Europe since Alan Kurdi died, according to the List. Turkish military policeman Mehmet Çıplak was the first person to find Alan’s body, and his voice still shakes when he remembers what happened next. “I checked for a signal of life, hoping he was still alive,” says Çıplak. “I was so sad. I am a father first. I have a six-year-old son. I empathised, I put him in my son’s place. There was an indefinable pain. Beyond being a military police officer, I behaved as a father.” Joy Gardner Born: Jamaica, 1953. Died: UK, 1993. Joy Gardner was born in 1953 in Jamaica to a 15-year-old mother. She never knew her father. When she was seven, her mother moved to the UK to work. She would not follow her over until 1987, by which time she had a grown-up daughter of her own and was pregnant with her son. She had the boy, Graham, while in Britain and sought leave to remain to be with her mother, but was refused. Although her mother was British, rule changes meant her adult offspring had no right to remain. A team of police and immigration officers arrived at her north London flat without warning on 28 July 1993 with instructions to deport her and her son to Jamaica. She was bound, gagged and restrained with a body belt. She collapsed, fell into a coma and died of asphyxiation. Festus Okey Born: Nigeria, 1982 Died: Turkey, 2007 When he left Nigeria in 2004, Festus Okey dreamed he would become a great footballer in Europe. “He was just a very cool guy,” said his brother, Tochukwu Ugo, who now lives in South Africa. “He was a very humble, cool guy. He wanted to go to London, and live a happy life.” Instead, Okey got as far as Turkey. In August 2007, Okey was arrested by police in Istanbul, and shot dead while he was being questioned inside a police station. In 2011, a Turkish policeman, Cengiz Yildiz, was sentenced to four years in jail for involuntary manslaughter, after saying that Okey’s death was an accident that occurred when the man tried to grab his gun. A murder conviction would have resulted in a life sentence. During the case, the court heard that there was an absence of security footage from the police station, and the shirt that Okey was wearing at the time of the shooting disappeared. Campaigners said that forensic analysis of the shirt would have clarified the distance between Okey and the police officer at the time of the shooting. There were also reportedly cameras in all the other interrogation rooms. Ugo, 42, says he has never understood what happened to his younger brother, who was arrested on drug charges. “A friend of Festus’s called me, and told me a little bit about what happened, but it still isn’t clear. He was shot, but I still don’t know why. They say he got into an argument with the police. “It was so painful, hearing that. At first, I didn’t believe, but they sent me photographs, and it was him. It was so sad. They said it happened in the police station, but I never understood why it would happen like that in a police station.” Ugo said that the family had faced serious challenges in Nigeria. “In Nigeria, the poor get poorer, and the rich get richer,” he said. “It was very hard for a long time.” As an asylum-seeker, Okey struggled to work in Turkey. “I know he was having problems in Istanbul,” said his brother. “But he wouldn’t tell me about it.” Alp Tekin Ocak, the family’s lawyer, said that the shooting had revealed serious problems within Turkey’s police forces. “The way the incident took place and the methods show us that those who have the authority to employ state’s monopoly of violence, have abused their authority. In this incident, there had been immense human rights violations, including violations of right to live, right to a fair trial and of prohibition of discrimination.” Ugo said that Okey had spent in time in Gabon before attempting to travel to the UK. Instead of travelling directly to London, Okey got a visa to Iran, before continuing to Turkey. “Before he set off, we spent lots of time talking, and hoping his journey went well,” said Ugo. “He had so many hopes, and I told him he was going to be great. I still can’t believe I am never going to see him again.” Semira Adamu Born: Nigeria, 1978. Died: Belgium, 1998. Semira Adamu fled Nigeria to escape a forced marriage with a man three times her age back home. She was originally en route for Berlin, but when her plane stopped in Belgium she was forced to claim asylum there under so-called “safe third country” principles. Her asylum request was refused and a team of 11 policemen were sent to deport her on 22 September 1998. Amnesty reported at the time: “After being seated [on a Sabena aircraft] and bound hand and foot she began to sing loudly to attract the attention of fellow passengers. “When officers then pushed her face into a cushion placed on the knees of one of them and pressed down on her back, she began to struggle. Her face was pressed against the cushion for over 10 minutes and she fell into a coma as her brain became starved of oxygen.” Getu Hagos Born: Ethiopia. Died: Paris, 2003. Getu Hagos entered France in January 2003 claiming to be a Somali called Mariame. His asylum claim was denied, and five days after his arrival he was dragged back on to a plane at a Paris airport. Air crew heard screams as the 24-year-old asylum seeker was forced into his seat. By the time the screams stopped, the Ethiopian man was dying. In 2006, three police officers were charged with manslaughter over the 2003 death, with a court hearing that Hagos was forced into a “folding position” when he resisted the boarding process. Stéphane Maugendre, Hagos’s lawyer, said that the young Ethiopian’s death had been one of a series of assaults on people facing deportation at the time. “We knew that they were being forced on the planes, and we knew that there was violence, but we couldn’t prove it. These things were happening regularly, but there was nothing we could do.” The prosecutor found that two officials of the border police “were careless or clumsy,” with their actions leading to the death of Hagos. Maugendre said that he had found the hearing frustrating, but was relieved that it went ahead at all. “I wasn’t surprised when Hagos died, but I was surprised that the prosecutor let us go to court. My real regret is that we weren’t able to go for a more serious charge. But we were so relieved to be able to go to court, and at least we got that.” Maugendre said that Hagos had no family or friends in France, but that the Ethiopian community there had been very supportive of the case. “The local community really threw themselves into this battle, and that was very important,” he said. The court heard that Hagos had claimed to be ill in the waiting zone of Roissy-Charles de Gaulle airport before being forced into an Air France plane to Johannesburg, South Africa. The officers said they believed Hagos was faking an illness. According to reports, Hagos was hobbled with Velcro at the knees and ankles, but continued to resist, with one police officer saying that the man preferred to “die rather than leave”. The “folding position” involved one police officer keeping Hagos bent over in his seat, with another officer keeping pressure up on Hagos’s handcuffs, which were behind his back. A third officer occasionally pushed down on his head. Hagos is believed to have been kept in this position for 20 minutes before suddenly going silent. According to medical evidence heard in court, the folded position resulted a lack of oxygenation. Hagos was in a coma for two days before dying. An autopsy found that he had suffered a “cardiorespiratory arrest”. The police officers said they had followed standard practice when someone attempted to resist deportation. They were all allowed to rejoin the border force.

Paid-for Facebook messages suggested to 16-year-olds that a career in the army would still be open to them if they did not get the grades they hoped for. Campaigners against the recruitment of child soldiers accused the army of cynically trying to recruit young people at a time when they are worried about their results and future prospects. Rachel Taylor, the director of programmes at Child Soldiers International, said: “Targeting army advertisements at teenagers when they are stressed and vulnerable is abhorrent. These adverts prove once again that the MoD is deliberately targeting children at the lowest limit of the legal recruitment age to fill the lowest qualified, least popular and hardest-to-recruit army roles. “Using Facebook to target the country’s young people unwittingly and exploiting the anxiety of those who may be disappointed with their GCSE results with idealised and unrealistic advertisements is shameful.” The Plaid Cymru MP Liz Saville Roberts said: “The government’s recruitment ads on social media tell young people that exam results don’t matter. If they truly have potential army recruits’ best interests at heart, they should prioritise their education budget over the army’s social media budget.” There has been growing concern about some of the army’s tactics for drawing in new recruits. The Guardian revealed last year that it had targeted young people from working-class backgrounds in a glossy recruitment campaign called This Is Belonging, despite claiming to aim advertising at all socioeconomic groups. New information released after a written parliamentary question by Saville Roberts revealed that the army spent £1.7m on social media content between 2015 and 2017, the vast bulk of it on Facebook. Examination of the links to some of the posts reveal that some young people have been targeted in the run-up to GCSE results and on the day itself. Just before results day in August 2015, for example, a Facebook post said: “No matter what your results will be, you can still improve yourself in the army.” It was accompanied by an image of two soldiers on a quad bike riding through surf on a shingle beach. On 20 August, results day, an image of a young soldier happily driving a military vehicle appeared with the same message. The following August the army told young people via Facebook: “Whatever happens on results day, we’ll help you learn, earn and stand on your own two feet.” The image showed an open-topped army vehicle during a beautiful sunset or sunrise. Readers were encouraged to click on to a button that took them through to the This is Belonging campaign. On exam day itself the message appeared: “Got your GCSE results? With 200+ roles available, talk to us about your next step today.” Not all Facebook users were taken in. One replied: “Yes man … If I get Fs in all my subjects I’ll get an A in the army.” Another wrote: “I love how they time this just before results day!” The Guardian revealed last year that a briefing document on the This Is Belonging campaign spelled out that the key audience was 16 to 24-year-old “C2DEs”, marketing speak for the lowest three social and economic groups. The document also made it clear that while the campaign was UK-wide, there were “up-weights” to cities in northern England including Manchester and Sheffield and to Birmingham, Belfast and Cardiff. British soldiers are not allowed to be sent to war zones until they are 18. Campaigners such as Child Soldiers International claim 16 and 17-year-old soldiers have higher rates of mental health and behavioural problems than older recruits and receive lower standards of education than their civilian peers. Critics also say they are more likely to be injured in training. The UK is the only country in Europe to recruit soldiers at 16. In the US the minimum age is 17. The UN committee on the rights of the child is among the organisations that have challenged the UK’s position. Would-be recruits can apply when they are at least 15 years and 7 months old. The army points out, however, that if a young person decided to apply after poor GCSE results, the earliest they could start as a junior soldier at the army foundation college in Harrogate would be the following March so there would be a cooling-off period. Junior soldiers are allowed to leave within the first six months of their contract if they have been in the army for more than 28 days. The army defended the Facebook messages. A spokesperson said: “It should be no surprise that, like most major employers, our recruitment campaign applies some focus on individuals leaving school, college and university, as this is when they make career decisions. “As the UK’s largest provider of apprenticeships, the army is proud to offer all education leavers the opportunity to better themselves while enjoying an army career.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"stage/2018/jun/07/my-name-is-lucy-barton-review-laura-linney-triumphs-as-a-writer-confronting-her-past","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-07T10:22:24Z","webTitle":"My Name Is Lucy Barton review – Laura Linney triumphs as a writer confronting her past","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/jun/07/my-name-is-lucy-barton-review-laura-linney-triumphs-as-a-writer-confronting-her-past","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2018/jun/07/my-name-is-lucy-barton-review-laura-linney-triumphs-as-a-writer-confronting-her-past","fields":{"headline":"My Name Is Lucy Barton review – Laura Linney triumphs as a writer confronting her past","bodyText":"Novels, depending on the stream of time, rarely make good plays. Elizabeth Strout’s first-person narrative, longlisted for the Man Booker prize in 2016, however, breaks the rules and fits perfectly on the stage. That’s partly because of the quality of the writing and partly because of a beautifully nuanced solo performance by Laura Linney: a space that recently looked underpopulated with a four-character play, suddenly feels colonised by Linney’s commanding presence. Fans of the book will know that it is the reminiscence of a writer hospitalised for nine weeks in New York by a mysterious illness. But the focus is on five days when the eponymous heroine renews acquaintance with her mother, who has come to visit her from rural Illinois and from whom she has been long estranged. The two women talk, gossip about people from Lucy’s past, warily seek each other’s love. In the end, the mother departs as abruptly as she came and you feel the two women have briefly bonded without ever addressing their shared guilt: in the mother’s case, over Lucy’s impoverished childhood and, in Lucy’s, over her own necessary desertion. It sounds slight: in fact, it’s a story full of mysterious resonances. What comes out in performance, even more than in reading the book, is the idea that, even if you totally reinvent yourself, your past remains inescapable. Lucy has sought to overcome a childhood in which she and her siblings were beaten and deprived of the consolations of TV, films and magazines. Her father, who fought in the second world war, suffered from what we would now call post-traumatic stress disorder. Fleeing Illinois, Lucy has settled in New York, married, had children and acquired the ruthlessness that is part of a successful writer’s equipment. Yet, as Lucy admits, the Barton family provided a structure she was unaware of, until it was ended by death. Although I was sorry not to hear more of Lucy’s literary mentor, Sarah Payne, Rona Munro’s adaptation is sensitive to Strout’s structure. Richard Eyre’s production also has a distilled clarity: Bob Crowley’s set consists of a hospital bed and chair, while Luke Halls’s video design modulates between vistas of the gleamingly geometric Chrysler building and Illinois acres of soybeans and corn, which seem to stretch to infinity. But it is Linney who triumphantly carries the evening. I’d seen her once before on stage, in Eyre’s Broadway production of The Crucible, where she caught perfectly Elizabeth Proctor’s puritan severity. Here she switches easily between different modes. She talks to us, the audience, with warmth and ease. When she characterises Lucy’s mother, prattling on about the marital misfortunes of sundry relations, her voice acquires a rasping, midwestern edge. As Lucy relives her hospital memories, Linney is even more extraordinary: she shifts between exasperated fury at her mother’s wilful incuriosity and loving astonishment at this unworldly old woman’s ability to negotiate labyrinthine hospital corridors and the New York jungle. You can see the story in several ways but it is partly about the enforced loneliness of the writer who, at the same time, reinforces our common humanity. Linney, as a performer, has mastered the art of public solitude and gives you the uncanny feeling that you are listening not to an invented story but a slice of lived experience. • At Bridge theatre, London, until 23 June.

Ikea said plastic straws, plates, cups, freezer bags, bin bags, and plastic-coated paper plates and cups would all be phased out and where possible replaced by alternatives. A spokesperson said: “We don’t have all the answers yet but we are working together with our suppliers to find solutions that are good for both people and the planet.” The Swedish furniture chain is already committed to phasing out oil-based plastics and is aiming to ensure all its plastic products are made using recycled materials by August 2020. It has invested in a plastics recycling plant to help push the plan forward. The latest move comes amid growing concern over plastic pollution in the world’s oceans, where it can harm and kill wildlife such as turtles and seabirds. The retailer, which has more than 363 stores worldwide, says it also wants to help its customers live more sustainably by offering products such as a tap nozzle that could save more than 90% of water used. It will also be offering solar panels in 29 markets, up from five at present, by 2025 and introducing more vegetarian foods into its cafes. “Through our size and reach we have the opportunity to inspire and enable more than 1 billion people to live better lives, within the limits of the planet”, Torbjörn Lööf, the chief executive of the retailer’s parent Inter Ikea group, said. “Change will only be possible if we collaborate with others and nurture entrepreneurship. We are committed to taking the lead working together with everyone – from raw material suppliers all the way to our customers and partners.” The retailer has already invested in windfarms and put solar panels on its stores as part of plans to rely on renewable electricity and heat in its stores by 2020. Ikea’s commitment on plastic comes after Iceland, the grocery chain, said it would ditch plastic packaging on its own brand products by 2023. British MPs have called on other supermarkets to follow suit and eliminate plastic packaging from their products over that period. Tesco has told suppliers it wants to stop using non-recyclable plastic packaging from next year, while Waitrose is phasing out black plastic trays that are hard to recycle. A UN report issued on Tuesday – World Environment Day – showed dozens of nations acting to cut plastic, including a ban on plastic bags in Kenya, on styrofoam in Sri Lanka and the use of biodegradable bags in China. A tax on single-use plastic bags in the UK has slashed their use and ministers have banned microbeads in personal hygiene products. However, Theresa May’s pledge to end avoidable plastic waste by the end of 2042 has been criticised as far too slow. The Greenpeace UK oceans campaigner Elena Polisano welcomed the Ikea move and said: “We now need to see other big retailers come up with ambitious plans to cut the amount of throwaway plastic on their shelves. With one truckload of plastic waste entering our seas every minute and spreading everywhere from the Arctic to the Antarctic and to the deepest point of the ocean, we need bold action – and fast.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/live/2018/jun/07/grenfell-tower-inquiry-fire-brigade-to-give-evidence-live-updates","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-07T12:03:06Z","webTitle":"Grenfell tower inquiry: Met to investigate fire brigade over 'stay put' policy  - as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/live/2018/jun/07/grenfell-tower-inquiry-fire-brigade-to-give-evidence-live-updates","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/live/2018/jun/07/grenfell-tower-inquiry-fire-brigade-to-give-evidence-live-updates","fields":{"headline":"Grenfell tower inquiry: Met to investigate fire brigade over 'stay put' policy  - as it happened","bodyText":"Here’s a summary of developments today from the inquiry and Scotland Yard. • London Fire Brigade and its senior officers are facing a police investigation over the “stay put” policy which resulted in Grenfell Tower residents being told to remain inside their homes, Scotland Yard said today. Detectives are attempting to establish whether the order - issued as the tower block blazed in June last year - could have breached health and safety law. • Fire commanders marshalling the battle against the Grenfell Tower inferno had “no obvious and safe alternative strategy” than telling residents to stay put, an inquiry has heard. The London Fire Brigade (LFB) has been criticised for the length of time taken to abandon the policy - nearly two hours after the blaze was first reported - despite flames reaching every floor. • Both the LFB and the Fire Brigade Union (FBU) have flatly denied claims made on Tuesday that firefighters could have been guilty of unconscious racism as they tackled the blaze. The claim had been made by lawyer for bereaved and survivors Imran Khan QC, who cited the “stereotypes” used in firefighters’ descriptions of residents from black or minority backgrounds. • Legal counsel for the FBU have questioned whether, given “multiple” safety failings within the building, “the firefighters were always chasing a sinister fire they had no realistic chance of defeating”. It was suggested that the inquiry should consider whether early incident commanders had training and procedures on issues such as tackling cladding fires, looking out for signs of a breach of compartmentation and when to abandon a stay-put policy. London Fire Brigade and its senior officers are facing a police investigation over the “stay put” policy which resulted in Grenfell Tower residents being told to remain inside their homes, Scotland Yard said today. Detectives are attempting to establish whether the order - issued as the tower block blazed in June last year - could have breached health and safety law. In a statement to the Grenfell Tower Inquiry, the Brigade has said its personnel were placed in “intolerable positions” during the fire, and would have been unaware of any defects caused by refurbishment of the 24-storey building. Detective Superintendent Matt Bonner, who is leading the police investigation, said also that 36 companies and organisations that had been involved in the construction, refurbishment, maintenance and management of the building were now of particular interest. So far, two organisations - the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea and the Kensington and Chelsea Tenant Management Organisation - are known to be under investigation as corporate manslaughter suspects. Police also disclosed that eight men and one women were arrested this morning for questioning over alleged fraud, having obtained money and services ranging from £25,000 to £100,000 after claiming to be survivors of the fire. Shahin Sadafi, chair of Grenfell United, has been reacting to those developments at Scotland Yard. He said: It is hurtful and saddening that people would take advantage of a tragedy like this. It is not just that they have taken funds and charity that was not for them, it is disrespectful to the real victims of the fire and people who lost their lives. Our community has shown strength, determination and dignity throughout the last year. Grenfell Tower was a community of good decent people, and we were proud to be each others’ neighbours. These people have absolutely no place here. We are relieved they have been identified and rooted out. More details emerged in relation to those police arrests over alleged fraud. Officers raided 11 addresses, predominantly in west London, at around 7am. Detective Superintendent Matt Bonner said: All those arrests are in connection with what we believe to be fraudulent claims for housing and/or support of one kind or another, arising out of false claims from people that they were associated with Grenfell Tower.” We thought long and hard, there’s obviously a need for us to act quickly once we are able to but also wanted to show due respect to events that have been going on in recent weeks in terms of the commemoration hearings and events that are forthcoming in terms of the anniversary. We have consulted with the community where we could and we timed them with utmost respect to all considerations. We will bring you more details shortly about the police briefing on those arrests. In the meantime, the inquiry has placed material from today’s hearings online. Eight men and one woman have been arrested by Scotland Yard in a series of dawn raids on Thursday over allegations of fraud in connection with the Grenfell fire. Police believe two of the individuals are linked but said all the offences are separate, the Police said in a briefing. Some of them were living in hotels when they were detained, and the value of the frauds range from £25,000 to £100,000. The Grenfell inquiry may be in a position to make certain urgent interim recommendations even before the phase one report of the judge overseeing it is complete. That’s according to Richard Millett QC, counsel for the inquiry, who has just been addressing Sir Martin Moore-Bick. While no date has been given for the publication of the report, phase one hearings are due to be completed by late October. The Inquiry has kept under close and regular review the question of whether and if so what recommendations could and should be made as a matter of urgency, Millett said. “Our present view is that it may very well be possible to make certain urgent interim recommendations before your phase one report is published, although we doubt whether it would be sensible or possible to do so before the phase one factual or expert evidence.” Millett said that there was a “broad measure of agreement” among core participants for the judge to make urgent recommendations as soon as possible. The inquiry has now broken for today. It will resume on Monday June 18 for the first expert presentation. Here’s a wrap-up ( via the Press Association) of some of opening statements from the Fire Brigades Union (FBU) and London Fire Brigade (LFB): FBU The Grenfell Tower inquiry should consider whether firefighters were put in an “impossible situation” when battling the blaze, the union has said. The Fire Brigades Union (FBU) used an opening statement at the probe to question whether, given “multiple” safety failings within the building, “the firefighters were always chasing a sinister fire they had no realistic chance of defeating”. Martin Seaward, representing the union, said on Thursday it should be considered whether early incident commanders had training and procedures on issues such as tackling cladding fires, looking out for signs of a breach of compartmentation and when to abandon a stay-put policy. Addressing the stay-put controversy, Mr Seaward asked “what alternative strategy might have been implemented” in the fast-moving situation. He said: “There remains no obvious and safe alternative strategy nor detailed plan.” The inquiry was told the FBU would back new measures to ensure all high-rise flats have fire blankets in kitchens, as well as a ban of combustible cladding on all buildings over 18 metres tall. LFB It is a “fundamental misunderstanding” of the events of the fire and of fire service capability to assume the building’s stay-put policy can be changed to a simultaneous evacuation at the stroke of a fire incident commander at whatever time, according to legal counsel for the LFB. “If there is no policy applied by the building owner which provides for a policy of simultaneous evacuation and there are no evacuation plans and there are no general fire alarms - what is an incident commander on the fire ground to do? Mr Walsh said firefighters responding to the blaze that night would have been “wholly unaware of the defects in the fabric on the building”. He echoed concerns that criticisms have been made of their strategy with the “benefit of hindsight”. Here are some of the highlights - as picked out by other correspondents who are at the inquiry: The inquiry is now taking a break Counsel for the LFB comes now to the controversy over the “stay put” policy - or the “stay put unless” policy as was described earlier. He says that he is going to refer to it as the “Stay Put” policy and begins by saying that the principle is linked to building design, which underpins the policies that are in place for fire safety. Strict adherence to the policy of compartmentalisation is obviously critical to the handling of such fires, adds Stephen Walsh. If during the life of such a building, that compartmentalisation policy is not maintained to the required standard to the extent that the whole building is compromised then the entire basis of fire service approach is fundamentally undermined. Walsh goes further into the application of the “Stay Put” policy. Rather than being told to stay in their homes no matter what, on the contrary he adds, part of the advice to residents on the night of the fire and nationally at other times was to leave if it is safe to do so. This is where some of the real dilemmas of the night will come into view, he adds. The emergency calls reveal that many of those who called said that they could not leave because of the conditions in the lobbies, including the moke and lack of visibility. This was said as early as 1.30am, he says. Some said that they were physically unable to do or due to factors including conditions in the lobbies. While there was a catastrophic failure of compartmentalisation at Grenfell, Walsh says, the regulation has historically been generally successful from a fire safety perspective. The Inquiry and those following it will have to hear much of the evidence but certain things are clear from the beginning, according to counsel for the London Fire Brigade (LFB) The LFB is clear that the event was “a singular one,” he adds. This included the rapidity with which the fire spread . While the incidents of external fire spread on high rise buildings is not entirely unprecedented, it is extremely rare and has never occurred on the scale of the Grenfell fire. Similarly, internal spread such as that which occurred elsewhere is not unknown but is a rare occurence in the UK, says Stephen Walsh QC. The extent to which the fire spread inside Grenfell was also wholly extraorindary In case there is any doubt “and there appears to be some doubt”, Walsh adds, the LFB is aware that there can be breaches of fire compartmentalisation in these events and that there can be external fire spread. The LFB does have policies and tactics that have been applied successfully on many occasions, he adds. Those polices are the result of learning from other fires and the difficulties that were apparent. Walsh says that the policies and procedures were tested to their limits and there is likely to be examples of departures from those policies because of the challenging circumstances. The LFB is not a “faceless corporate” and its ranks range from novice fire fighters right the way through to its head, who was herself a novice fire fighter once, according to its opening statement. Stephen Walsh, QC, for the LFB says that the fire fighters “collective instinct” was to protect life and property -often resulting in physical and mental injury for many At the commemorative hearings the bereaved reiterated their justifiable demand for many answers, he adds. The LFB will provide answers with full candour, he adds. Walsh opened by describing the fire as the most challenging incident which the LFB experienced in living memory “For the fire fighters whose job it was to carry out the fire fighting and rescue operation and the control staff who took calls, the memory of their experience and the events they witnessed will never leave them,” he adds. Browne, for the FOA, goes on to say that the inquiry may well be left in little doubt that the men and women acted selflessly and at great risk on the night. This was particularly so in circumstances where the building and the condition it was in “positively impeded” efforts to save life. An written statement provided by the FOA - including recommendations - can be found here. The magnitude of the fire cannot be overstated and has had life changing consequences for fire fighters who were deeply affected that they were not able to save more lives, according to a statement by the Fire Fighters Association (FOA) We’re hearing an opening statement from that association now, read out by Louis Browne QC. He echoes the rejection earlier of the FBU’s counsel that discrimination based on race or class played any role in the actions and decisions of the fire fighters. “What did motivate their actions was their desire to do all they could to save the lives of those who were in the tower,” says Browne. The FBU prefers to refer to the policy of advising residents to stay put in in their homes while the fire was taking effect as a “Stay Put Unless” policy, Seaward says. But the policy which has been the focus of considerable criticism over the past week and before, was certainly not a “rigid” one, he insists. He asks the inquiry to bear in mind what he describes as the longstanding success of the “stay put unless” policy and to bear in mind what can be seen with the benefit of hindsight and what can have been said was the situation on a night when control staff for the fire brigade were flooded with calls Clearly there is a huge concern over the continued application of the ‘stay put unless’ policy and there remains no obvious safe and detailed strategy. The FBU invites the inquiry to consider what alternative strategy might have been implemented. I’ll try to come later to some of the recommendations which the FBU have put forward during their statement. The London Fire Brigade did not create this “highly combustible death trap,” says to Seaward. There is also no evidence that those who responded to what initially seemed to be a routine call were aware of the state of the building. “Any criticism of the emergency response should be assessed against this background and should not be exploited by those who created the danger,” he adds. Seaward asks if the firefighters were placed in an impossible situation, with those from top to bottom being asked make impossible decisions with those in the frontline being required to do their best with procedures and equupment made available to them. The evidence is likely to raise questions about the equipment used, he says, including communication equipment and may require further expert advice from sources including the military Speaking about the fire service staff who will give evidence, he points out that many will never have given evidence in a setting like this before and will be dreading it. Moreover, many of them will be haunted by their memories of that night Seaward also says that control says staff will also be haunted by their memories. He says that the inquiry will doubtless ask when the fire spread from the fourth floor up the exterior and back again. When did the control staff know this? Where they overwhelmed by calls? The fire fighters who were involved on the night will never forget it and some of them remain traumatised, the inquiry has been told at the outset of a statement being made by lawyer Martin Seaward, representing the Fire Brigades Union (FBU) The fire fighters were presented with challenges beyond their knowledge and proceedures. Even so, their bravery has been widely praised. The FBU agrees that public confidence in the fire and rescue service is of vital importance and the union recognises the public interest in a successful public inquiry The FBU agrees that following the refurbishments, as others have said, Grenfell was “a higly combustible death trap. Not only was there serial non compliance with building regulations but there was no evidence of any sustained attempt to make up for that, according to Seaward. The FBU invites the inquiry to consider whether there was a complete failure of thefire safety regime at each stage of works. Furthermore after the works, further opportunities mitigate the risks were missed. A written statement provided by the FBU for the inquiry’s opening phase can be read here.

But this is not the case with Patterson’s most recent title, The President Is Missing, where the name of his co-author, Bill Clinton, shares equal prominence. Reviewing the novel in the New Yorker, Anthony Lane remarks that “collaboration is a murky trade”. Perhaps so, but it can be made less murky by stylometric analysis, the purpose of which is to statistically cluster texts by style, based on authorial fingerprints. Simply put, stylometry uses computers to figure out who wrote a text. Last year, I co-authored a paper that used such techniques to determine how much Patterson actually contributes to writing his collaborative novels. The findings, published in Digital Humanities Quarterly 11.1, showed that Patterson’s less illustrious associates are the ones committing the vast majority of the prose to paper. Our study raises considerable questions around authorship, and whether it is plot or language that makes a storyteller. It also explores the place of style in a literary marketplace where the novel is seen as the major commodity; the role of artistry is somewhat diminished when the aim is to sell an accessible and entertaining story. For “brand-managed” authors such as Patterson, writing is about the efficient production of leisure-time materials, a process to which eager junior colleagues can significantly contribute. Lane was kind enough to draw from our study in his review, though our analysis, published before The President Is Missing had been announced, only left him with a natural sense of unsatisfied curiosity. “Who ghosted whom?” he asks. “Did Patterson supply the bones of the story, as is his wont, and Clinton tack on the flesh? Or did Patterson reverse his usual process, merely tinkering and smoothing after Clinton, musing on his years in office, had brought forth a plot – in essence, his reverie of responsible power?” Thanks to methods developed by Maciej Eder, Lane’s questions can be answered. The findings are clear: Patterson’s is the dominant style throughout the novel – with the exception of the finale, where the signal shifts to Clinton. This is precisely what Lane concludes from his reading, describing the novel’s twilight as an exudence of the former president’s “politico-historical thoughts”. This graph represents the novel on the x-axis, broken into segments: the thicker the bottom line, the more certain the decision made by the classifier, which can be intuitively interpreted as the proximity to the relevant author’s style. Considering Patterson’s fingerprint is represented by green, it is plain to see that, contrary to our previous study, this is a co-authored novel in which he was the scribe. The authorial fingerprints are generated using a selection of Patterson solo-authored texts, alongside Clinton’s books My Life, Giving and Back to Work. Herein lies a slight limitation to this study: Clinton’s previous books are all non-fiction. While my experience is that authorial signals outweigh those produced by genre, the results would be more conclusive had Clinton previously tried his hand at fiction. It is both troubling and fascinating to see literary capitalism reach this height. What better way to sell a book, than to have a mogul of commuter fiction combine with a former US president? When you have sold millions of books on the back of your brand, I suppose the only thing left to do is find an even more recognisable mark – at the very least, you find a name worthy of a similar font size.

Robinson had broadcast an hour-long video to Facebook outside Leeds crown court, making comments that risked the collapse of a trial, which still has reporting restrictions placed on it. He had previously received a suspended sentence for another incident of contempt, after he attempted to film defendants in a rape trial in Canterbury last year. Hundreds of Robinson’s supporters massed outside Downing Street in protest following his arrest. Speaking on blogging site Tremr, Morrissey said: “It’s very obvious that Labour or the Tories do not believe in free speech … I mean, look at the shocking treatment of Tommy Robinson.” His comments came as he underlined his support for the rightwing party For Britain, set up by ex-Ukip candidate Anne Marie Waters. Having previously voiced support for them because “they have the best approach to animal welfare”, he now adds: “Anne Marie Waters seeks open discussion about all aspects of modern Britain, whereas other parties will not allow diverse opinion. She is like a humane version of Thatcher ... if such a concept could be. She is absolute leadership, she doesn’t read from a script, she believes in British heritage, freedom of speech, and she wants everyone in the UK to live under the same law. I find this compelling.” For Britain describes itself as “a positive, pro-British, pro-democracy party, which believes in preserving the culture and values of the decent British majority”. Elsewhere in the interview, the former Smiths frontman opened up about his diet, saying he orders from the children’s menu in restaurants, adding: “I’ve always found food to be very difficult because I only eat bread, potatoes, pasta and nuts … all stodge. I can’t eat anything that has any flavour.” Long given to controversial statements about politics, animal welfare and more, Morrissey recently gave another interview in which he made a link between halal meat producers and Isis, and attacked Theresa May, Sadiq Khan, Diane Abbott and others."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jun/06/the-untold-story-of-the-death-of-the-nbn","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-06T07:30:47Z","webTitle":"The untold story of the death of the NBN | First Dog on the Moon","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/06/the-untold-story-of-the-death-of-the-nbn","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/06/the-untold-story-of-the-death-of-the-nbn","fields":{"headline":"The untold story of the death of the NBN","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/jun/07/victoria-on-brink-of-passing-treaty-legislation-as-greens-accept-labor-deal","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-07T08:12:15Z","webTitle":"Victorian lower house passes treaty legislation after Greens accept Labor deal","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/jun/07/victoria-on-brink-of-passing-treaty-legislation-as-greens-accept-labor-deal","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/jun/07/victoria-on-brink-of-passing-treaty-legislation-as-greens-accept-labor-deal","fields":{"headline":"Victorian lower house passes treaty legislation after Greens accept Labor deal","bodyText":"Victoria is one step closer to signing a treaty with Aboriginal people after legislation to create the framework for the treaty process passed the lower house on Thursday. It is the first time legislation committing to treaty negotiations has ever been considered by an Australian parliament. The legislation passed with the support of the Greens after the Aboriginal affairs minister, Natalie Hutchins, proposed amendments that went some way towards addressing concerns raised by Gunnai-Gunditjmara woman and Northcote MP Lidia Thorpe. Thorpe proposed additional amendments on the floor of parliament, particularly demanding an acknowledgement of Aboriginal sovereignty by the state of Victoria, but they were not adopted. The historic vote comes a week before hearings are due to begin in a parliamentary committee on the proposal for constitutional recognition of Indigenous people outlined in the Uluru Statement, which was substantially rejected by the Turnbull government in October. • Sign up to receive the top stories every morning The Victorian Greens wrote to Hutchins on Wednesday confirming they had accepted her revised amendments on the advancing the treaty process with Aboriginal Victorians bill 2018. The legislation will create the framework to establish the Aboriginal representative body, which has been described as a prototype Indigenous voice model to elevate the concerns of Aboriginal Victorians. That in turn will help establish the process for the negotiation of a treaty, or several treaties, between Aboriginal people and the state of Victoria. Other states and territories are also moving to negotiate a treaty, with the Northern Territory is set to sign a memorandum of understanding with all four territory lands councils on Friday. The signing will take place at Barunga, where the former prime minister Bob Hawke famously promised to deliver a treaty in 1988 and then reneged. The Western Australian Aboriginal affairs minister, Ben Wyatt, announced on Thursday that he would begin a two-year consultation process to establish an Independent Office for Aboriginal People, which would give Aboriginal people a voice to parliament comparable to the nationally proposed voice to parliament. South Australian treaty negotiations have been shelved by the Marshall government. The amendments to the Victorian legislation were moved in response to concerns raised by Thorpe, the only Aboriginal person in Victorian parliament, who said she was concerned about a lack of engagement with elders; a potential sidelining of Victorian traditional owners in favour of government-appointed people on the representative body; and the failure of the legislation to explicitly acknowledge the sovereignty of Aboriginal clans in Victoria. The latter remains a significant concern for Thorpe, who said in parliament on Thursday that she was disappointed the government had decided against including a firm acknowledgement in the legislation that traditional owners in Victoria retained sovereignty over their lands. “Treaties are between two sovereigns, and to talk about treaty or to go ahead with treaty negotiations and not actually recognise that Aboriginal people are the sovereign people of this land, then I think that’s one of the major failures of this legislation,” Thorpe told Guardian Australia. “If we can’t start by addressing sovereignty, then that’s a joke.” The reference to Aboriginal sovereignty in the bill is currently confined to the preamble, which states that: “Victorian traditional owners maintain that their sovereignty has never been ceded.” Thorpe argued for that to be amended to represent an express acknowledgement by government that the sovereignty of Aboriginal clans in Victoria is not and has never been ceded. She said the treaty process risks losing the support of Aboriginal people if sovereignty is not emphatically asserted. “We need to ensure that any treaty process does not cede sovereignty, particularly when there’s a federal process happening,” Thorpe said. “There could be a better deal on the table federally.” Hutchins said amendments proposed by Thorpe that would determine who could vote on the membership of the Aboriginal representative body were too narrow and impinged upon self-determination, saying it was for the 30,000 Aboriginal people in Victoria to determine the make-up of the body and who was allowed to vote. “Aboriginal Victorians will continue to be at the centre of this process, every step of the way,” Hutchins said after the vote. On Tuesday she announced a $700,000 grants scheme to fund greater community consultation and treaty circle talks with Aboriginal Victorians. She has also supported a Greens proposal to establish an elders council, which would work with the Treaty Commission, as part of negotiations to secure Greens support. The Coalition does not support the treaty process and did not vote for the legislation. The opposition leader, Matthew Guy, said on Wednesday that he was opposed to a state-based treaty and that “a national approach would be a much better way to go”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2018/jun/06/queensland-ministers-will-be-targeted-if-state-funds-roads-for-adani-warn-activists","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-06T06:17:20Z","webTitle":"Queensland ministers will be targeted if state funds roads for Adani, warn activists","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jun/06/queensland-ministers-will-be-targeted-if-state-funds-roads-for-adani-warn-activists","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/jun/06/queensland-ministers-will-be-targeted-if-state-funds-roads-for-adani-warn-activists","fields":{"headline":"Queensland ministers will be targeted if state funds roads for Adani, warn activists","bodyText":"Activists say they will relaunch a disruption campaign targeting Queensland government ministers and MPs after reports the government has considered financing road upgrades required for access to Adani’s Carmichael coalmine. The ABC reports that documents, obtained under right-to-information laws by the consultancy Energy and Resource Insights, reveal ongoing discussions about upgrades to the local dirt roads. Sign up to receive the top stories in Australia every day at noon Labor has consistently pledged that no public money will go to the Carmichael project. The premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, vetoed an application by Adani for a federal government loan under the Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility (Naif) scheme late last year. Palaszczuk and her ministers were targeted by anti-coal protesters almost daily during last year’s election campaign. The government managed to walk a fine line between support for the project and its opposition to public subsidies. Polling of city electorates, where Labor picked up seats and won its majority, showed voters were opposed to any financial support for Adani. In the months since the election, with Adani apparently unable to secure finance to proceed with the megamine and progress stalling, opponents have been less visible. Galilee Blockade spokesman Ben Pennings told Guardian Australia the government could expect citizen activists to redouble their attempts to disrupt Labor politicians. “Labor spending $100m of our money on Adani infrastructure would break a key election promise and betray the trust of Queenslanders,” Pennings said. “This money could be spent on schools or hospitals rather than help a multibillionaire.” “We will not let Labor fund Adani through the back door. We will disrupt their events and press conferences until they keep their election promise, take all royalty or infrastructure deals for Adani off the table.” The Galilee Blockade group said it would also target any road-building operations that would help Adani. The activists claim responsibility for a decision by Downer EDI to end a $2.6bn contract to build and operate the mine last year. Downer’s roadbuilding operations were among those targeted. “Any roadbuilder using our money to help the Adani mine will face the wrath of citizens who have been promised their money won’t be used to help Adani,” Pennings said. “We’re 100% confident we can save taxpayers this $100m planned for Adani.” The ABC reported the government was considering a state takeover of about 90km of dirt roads that would need to be upgraded to provide reliable year-round access to the Carmichael site. The government has said significant projects can have an impact on local road users, and that costs associated are recovered by the state on a commercial basis. The documents refer to discussions that mostly took place last year. Guardian Australia understands government, local councils and others are in an effective holding pattern on the Carmichael mine, given the uncertainties about the future of the project. Decisions are unlikely to be made given increasing skepticism that Adani will be able to make the mine stack up financially. Last week, Indian news site the Wire reported Adani was considering filing for bankruptcy protection for its Mundra power plant, which was shut in February after heavy losses. When Adani bought the Carmichael site from Linc Energy in 2010, it wanted to build the mine in order to supply coal to Mundra. Adani told Guardian Australia it has not approached the relevant tribunal or applied for bankruptcy, but said it was working to resolve challenges faced at Mundra, and that “various options are being evaluated in consultation with procurer states and lenders”. No significant work has been conducted at the Carmichael site or along the proposed rail route this year, despite the onset of the dry season. Last month it was revealed that AECOM, the company designing the rail line, had “demobilised” from the project. Adani did not answer directly when asked whether the company had since engaged another contractor to complete the rail design. “We remain 100% committed to the Carmichael project,” an Adani spokeswoman said. “Work continues to prepare for mine infrastructure construction and operation.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/aug/18/bespoke-education-are-australias-private-schools-worth-the-price-tag","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-08-17T22:00:32Z","webTitle":"'Bespoke education': are Australia's private schools worth the price tag?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/aug/18/bespoke-education-are-australias-private-schools-worth-the-price-tag","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/aug/18/bespoke-education-are-australias-private-schools-worth-the-price-tag","fields":{"headline":"'Bespoke education': are Australia's private schools worth the price tag?","bodyText":"If you want to ruin a dinner party, try lobbing this on the table: are private schools better than public schools? Or this: are they worth the money? For parents who have the relative luxury of choice in these matters, the question is a vexed one. Finding the right school for your child is an emotional decision, clouded by prejudice, guilt and hope, distorted by wealth and peer group and the carefully curated aura of private school reputations. In a country that still wants to think of itself as egalitarian, evidence of the growing disparity between Australia’s richest and poorest schools has politicised it too. But parents want to do the best they can for their children. Lured by the ever-more luxurious facilities of private schools, the smorgasbord of extracurricular activities, the boaters and blazers, the solid feeling of generations of institutional history; some are captive to the idea they are doing children a disservice by sending them to the more modest local public school – particularly in high school, where these decisions seem to bite harder. But does any of that make private schools better? “Independent school offers a much more bespoke education,” says Sharon Leifer, who has three children who’ve attended the same private school. “They can be accelerated, they can get extra help, it’s not done on norms, it’s done on each individual child. And they have high expectations of and for the kids. I wish everybody had that choice.” Leifer says her oldest son was a quiet kid in class. Very bright, with dyslexia and dyspraxia, he struggled with handwriting, and had become quite miserable at the local public school. But she says the school told her his problems were not “bad enough” to get him extra help. “We found that at public school, if you’re in the middle, the quiet kid at the back, if you’re not doing anything [disruptive], you can pretty much go unnoticed,” she says. So the family from Sydney’s northern beaches settled on St Luke’s Grammar in Dee Why, a small Anglican co-ed K-12 school that charges fees of up to $24,000 in year 12. “When we walked around the school every teacher knew every child’s name, and every child stopped and talked to the teachers,” she says. “The ambience of the place, the whole thing, really just caught us and we knew that he would be much happier there, and he has been.” Her oldest, who his mother says was rejected from a public selective school on the basis of his Naplan results, is studying law at ANU. But for every story like the Leifer family’s, there’s another who’s gone the other way. Bradley Stringer’s family wanted to go private for their two kids. But they were disappointed with their private inner Sydney primary school, and didn’t feel they were getting their money’s worth. “Our experience of the teaching staff was not what we had expected for one of our kids, and certainly not what we were paying for,” Stringer says. “That disappointment was compounded by annual fee increases of between 6% and 15%, with little to no communication to the parents regarding the need for greater fees.” They are much happier with their kids’ new public school in Balmain. ‘We don’t fuck them up, and we take all the credit’ Broadly speaking, choosing a school is not a process you can use trial and error to improve on. Most families don’t want to move their kids around a lot of different schools. So how do you get a sense of how good a school is from the outside? University entrance results are one obvious place to start, and high-fee schools tend to sell hard on their high marks. But if you’re only interested in academic achievement, the results from most of the 30-odd Australian studies since 2000 suggest that private schools are no better at progressing students’ learning than state schools, once you’ve controlled for socioeconomic background. That’s also been the case for Australia’s results in the past three Pisa tests, the OECD’s international comparison test for student learning. “On average private schools superficially appear to achieve higher student outcomes,” concedes education researcher and public schools advocate Trevor Cobbold. “But public schools enrol the vast majority of disadvantaged students … and this is what largely accounts for differences in school outcomes.” The Grattan Institute’s yet-to-be released study of five years of Naplan results contrasted students’ progress between Naplan tests rather than the raw scores, because it says that is the best measure of what value a school is adding. Comparing like with like schools by socioeconomic background across sectors, it found there is no significant learning advantage conferred by private schools. Researcher Peter Goss says, “it’s a pretty clear finding that the differences in progress between the three sectors are just not there, on Naplan. So if parents are choosing their sector based on Naplan results, then they kind of miss the point.” The academic excellence of high-fee schools might owe more to a virtuous circle or feedback loop, rather than anything particularly unique to the school’s teaching and learning. Those schools are also in a position to lure bright students with scholarships. It’s like the (probably apocryphal) comment a senior figure at Harvard University in the US reportedly made to a private audience of overseas educators, in explaining the secret to the university’s global prestige. “It’s simple. We choose the best people, we don’t fuck them up, and we take all the credit.” Naplan is a narrow benchmark, and data available for research comparing school outcomes is very limited. There is, for example, some research to suggest that public school kids do better at university than private school kids with the same Atar. The researchers say this may reflect the ability of some private schools to maximise tertiary entrance scores for their students, who revert to “underlying ability” once they’ve left. But none of it can answer the question for an individual child: is your child going to do better at one school or another? The old school tie Don’t look to the dismal science for help. Whatever it is, paying high fees for private school is not an economically rational decision, says Sean Leaver, a behavioural economist specialising in education choices. He compares it to a luxury consumption decision, like buying a top-end BMW over a good cheap Toyota. Both will get you there. “As an investment? Clearly no,” he says. “There’s no real benefit from attending a private school compared to a public school once you take into account that private schools skim the best kids and screen the worst kids out.” “The big question for me, with my parent hat on,” says the Grattan Institute’s Peter Goss, “is what is the school going to contribute to helping my children grow up healthy, happy, having choices in life and being prepared and set up to succeed in those choices? … I just don’t think we gather that data. So … everything else is a bit of a proxy.” So why are so many families – more than 50% of students in Sydney and Melbourne attend non-government schools – choosing to pay for private schools? In a measure of the sensitivity around the issue, Guardian Australia found it difficult to find parents willing to speak publicly about why they chose private schooling for their children. It might be a mark of status within private school communities, but in the public arena, very few want to articulate the reasons. Many talk in private about the stress of paying high fees, but don’t want to go on the record about their private financial decisions. Likewise, most private school principals approached by Guardian Australia declined the invitation to talk about what private schools offer in exchange for their fees. “I talk to people a lot about this,” says Philip Heath, the principal of Barker College in Sydney’s north-west. “A lot of kids come here at year 10 having been in very good government schools before they come here. So it’s a discretionary spend; so what’s driving that decision?” Barker is a co-ed independent Anglican day and boarding school that was founded in 1890. Year 12 costs $32,000. Including its Indigenous school, Darkinjung Barker, near Wyong, it has about 2,200 students. “I reckon there are probably four key things,” Heath says. “[The first is] broadly cultural and spiritual allegiances … that’s ethics and values; where their families are from. “The second would be they are seeking an individualisation of experience … so teacher connection, discipline, access to opportunities, flexibility of the structure to adapt to that child’s interests or needs. “Third would be the ability to influence school policy and practice at a local level … and to participate more in decision making. “The fourth one, that’s not popular to talk about, would be aspirations for academic and social engagement, lifelong friendships … Improperly expressed it would be ‘the old school tie’. Put more generously, you’re building friendships that last a long time.” Choices driven by anxiety “If I was paying $40,000 a year, I would want two swimming pools!” jokes the former NSW education minister Adrian Piccoli, who now heads the Gonski Institute for Education at UNSW. “No one should resent a school like Kings for that, people are spending 40k a year to send their kids there.” Associate Professor Piccoli, who was a leading advocate for needs-based funding while he was minister from 2011 to 2017 is also a supporter of school choice, with his own kids in the Catholic system. But he says the key difference between school sectors is “the ability of the non-government sector to choose who their students are.” Public schools have to take all comers, but through fees, entrance exams, targeted scholarships, interviews, discretion and discipline proceedings, private schools can pick and choose. He believes many parents make a high school decision based on perceptions of student behaviour, or of a school’s level of discipline. The extensive disclosure and reporting requirements about critical incidents or teacher dismissals for government schools can impact badly on the public sector’s reputation, he says. “I don’t think the playing field is even,” he says. “If Catholic and independent schools were also subject to freedom of information applications, that would make it a bit more equal. Public schools are much more publicly accountable. Catholic and independent schools don’t have to provide that kind of information, and that gives them in a sense a marketing advantage. “You only hear about it in independent schools if a parent complains about or it goes to court,” Piccoli says. Leaver, the economist, says parental choices are typically driven more by anxiety than reason but it could be a rational choice to go private if your local public high school is small and does not offer the range of subjects your child wants. “[However], in most cases you’re probably better off buying a house in a suburb with a nice public school than actually paying the fees to go to a private school,” he says. “It’s more of a consumption choice. They’re paying for all the extras. The nice facilities, the segregation effects, the screening out of the ‘undesirables’.” Are private schools really stricter, better at instilling discipline or shaping the good character of children? That is certainly conveyed in the rhetoric and marketing of many private schools. But it might be simply that such schools have easier raw material to work with – and, as Piccoli pointed out in a public brawl with Trinity College in 2014, the fact they can just expel problem kids. “The idea independent schools might be somehow morally superior – I don’t buy that at all,” says Dr Mark Merry, principal of Yarra Valley Grammar in Victoria, a private co-ed school in Melbourne with fees up to $27,000 a year. “I think that parents who choose to send their children to our school choose to do so subscribing to the values of the school, so we perhaps don’t have the diversity of viewpoints ... It’s far more – not monocultural – but it’s more homogeneous.” Better teachers? Independent school advocates argue that the concentration of private resources is not the key point to private schools. What they offer is choice: giving parents options to fit their own values, faith or beliefs, or their kids’ special needs. “There’s probably more differences within the sectors than there would be between them,” says Carolyn Bladden, the principal of the independent, no-fee Warakirri College in Sydney’s Fairfield and Blacktown, which helps disadvantaged young adults finish high school. Bladden, who has previously worked at high-fee private schools in Sydney including Knox and Meriden, says sprawling grounds and gleaming facilities aren’t what makes the difference to a child. “The most important thing is the relationship between the teachers and the students, and their engagement. It can happen or not happen within either sector.” So where are the teachers better? Even those working in the public sector admit underperforming teachers in public schools are harder to get rid of. Accordingly, principal autonomy in hiring and firing is a key factor many parents cite for going private, believing they will get better teaching quality as a result. Yarra Valley’s Merry says: “A key difference [between sectors] is the autonomy of the head of the school to make decisions pertaining to that school. It comes out in lots and lots of different ways. Certainly it comes out in hiring colleagues. You’re able to really work out who you need, whether the person fits the specific school environment.” A NSW public school principal who requested anonymity because of the Department of Education’s restrictions on talking to the media, says the process for dismissing an underperforming teacher is so onerous and drawn out that most principals just don’t have the time to do it. The easier option is to wait out the bad teacher, or get them transferred. “Bureaucracy is the worst thing about public schools – it’s a huge employer, with creaky systems; one size must fit all. It is very hard to get rid of teachers who are not performing well,” the principal says. But the Grattan Institute’s Goss says, while the freedom to fire the worst teachers may be attractive to parents with a business mindset, it’s importance may be overstated. “No good international research says you can lift the system by getting rid of the worst teachers,” he says. “Lots of international research says you can lift outcome at scale by providing appropriate support to all teachers.” The somewhat maddening conclusion from talking to principals and researchers is that schools cannot be judged by sector – it is rationally meaningless to argue private schools are better. There is too much diversity between schools, and the research points to individual school cultures being the most important factor. That comes down to the teaching and learning culture cultivated by the principal. “Some parents just like the uniforms, talk more about the grounds and the nice jackets than the quality of teaching and learning,” the public school principal says. “The question I always tell parents to ask is what professional development are the teachers doing? Unless there’s a continuous investment in that happening, go somewhere else.” Read about school choice and the cost to society in part two of this series"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/jun/06/james-sutherland-to-stand-down-as-cricket-australia-ceo","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-06T01:32:51Z","webTitle":"James Sutherland to resign as Cricket Australia CEO","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/jun/06/james-sutherland-to-stand-down-as-cricket-australia-ceo","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/jun/06/james-sutherland-to-stand-down-as-cricket-australia-ceo","fields":{"headline":"James Sutherland to resign as Cricket Australia CEO","bodyText":"Cricket Australia has suffered another high-profile resignation, although James Sutherland has denied the recent ball tampering saga was behind his decision to stand down from his role as the organisation’s chief executive.

It’s something I’ve been talking about for a long time.” Sutherland’s tenure has seen plenty of highs and lows but some of his biggest achievements have also come in the past year, during which he brokered a lucrative broadcast rights deal and, after an ugly and lengthy standoff with players, a new pay deal. “In the last 12 months we have laid key foundation stones which have included a new strategy for Australian cricket, a new memorandum of understanding with the Australian Cricketers’ Association that provides certainty for our male and female cricketers, and just recently, a new domestic broadcast rights deals that will see broader TV coverage and significant increases in revenue flowing into the game,” Sutherland said. “With these foundations in place, I feel that it is a good time to hand over the reins to a new CEO.” Sutherland has also overseen the introduction of the men’s and women’s Big Bash Leagues, both of which have proved hugely successful ventures and have been seen by some as revolutionising the sport. Day-night Test cricket was also introduced in Australia under his stewardship. David Peever, chairman of CA, paid tribute, saying Sutherland had been “instrumental” in driving change in the game and strengthening it for future generations. “The game has never been in a stronger position and we are looking forward to continuing to work with James while we conduct a search to find a suitable replacement,” said Peever. Sutherland, 52, joined the organisation in 1998 before replacing Malcolm Speed as chief executive position in 2001. CA’s board has appointed an executive search agency, Egon Zehnder, to find the next incumbent, with Cricket Australia chief operating officer Kevin Roberts an early frontrunner. “My successor will have a strong and stable platform from which to lead our national strategy and to deliver on our bold aspirations to grow cricket as Australia’s favourite sport and a sport for all Australians,” Sutherland added."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jun/06/abolishing-the-family-court-could-deliver-votes-but-also-harm-vulnerable-families","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-06T05:17:34Z","webTitle":"Vulnerable families deserve better than a government courting One Nation | Van Badham","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/06/abolishing-the-family-court-could-deliver-votes-but-also-harm-vulnerable-families","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/06/abolishing-the-family-court-could-deliver-votes-but-also-harm-vulnerable-families","fields":{"headline":"Vulnerable families deserve better than a government courting One Nation","bodyText":"Australia’s attorney general, Christian Porter, has announced a major structural overhaul of the family court. It will be merged with the federal circuit court. It’s the single largest change since the family court was established in 1975. Why? Well, there have been ongoing calls for reform - there’s a conspicuous lack of funds for the family court, and a shortage of judges. Back in 2016, a Fairfax investigation discovered that the “average wait for trial has ballooned to two years”. Delays within the justice process contribute to the vulnerability of – specifically – women and children. In 2017, the family court’s then chief justice announced that the court didn’t have adequate resources to “protect parents and children from violence”. Anti-violence advocate Rosie Batty campaigned with the Women’s Legal Service of Australia to make family courts “a safer place for those affected by family violence”. But necessary resources have not been forthcoming. In March this year, journalist Jenna Price described the resulting situation as “turmoil”, which she says is the responsibility of “successive governments who have refused to fund the court according to its need or legislate to improve the process.” Christian Porter is not delivering more money. In fact, given that there are many family law cases being heard by the less-specialist circuit court, he’s claiming that his merger of the two courts will reduce backlog merely by reaping efficiency dividends with a single point of entry, “driving faster, cheaper and more consistent dispute resolution”. Sound an alarm. Porter’s statement that should chill the bones of any Australian with a political attention span longer than a biscuit’s. “Faster, cheaper” was the same promise Turnbull made about the NBN. Legal scholars are expressing concerns. As Porter abolishes the family court, he’s also dispensing with the specific expertise now obliged of its judges to be “suitable person(s) to deal with matters of family law”. The importance of this suitability to those cases that get heard there cannot be understated. “Child custody cases can be wickedly complex, especially when one or both parents are alleging abuse,” wrote Jess Hill in an terrifying 2015 expose. “Making the wrong decision can be devastating; children may be ordered into the care of an abusive parent, or prohibited from seeing a safe and loving one ... (Decisions) require great skill and understanding to get right.” Porter’s own decision has not even come at the end of a review. Curiously, his merger preempts a review currently taking place, run by the Australian Law Reform Commission, helmed by a University of Melbourne law professor. The review is due for delivery in March 2019 - Porter’s reforms are scheduled for 1 January. His response to criticism of a threadbare consultation for his review-free restructure? “It’s the government’s decision”. He spoke to some judges, but not advocates, stakeholders or the community. Asked whether judges were supportive, he replied: “it’s not a matter of supporting or not supporting”. The question arises about what informs Porter’s – and his Liberal-National government’s – own judgment. The spokesperson from the Women’s Legal Service Queensland is presently “demanding answers about whether Malcolm Turnbull has done a backroom deal with Pauline Hanson” on the court merger. Sound more alarms. Maybe sound all of them. Pauline Hanson’s double-decade, consistently bonkers political CV has been characterised by choices whose “highlights” include posing for photos with neo-Nazis, picking fights with drag queens, fear of Asian lesbian cyborgs, videos of herself claiming she’s been murdered, climate denial, halal food conspiracy theories and statements she admits get her called “racist”. Her most memorable contribution as a senator for Queensland was attending parliament both in a burqa and with slightly less dignity than a nude five-year-old disrupting a dinner party, arms striped with Nutella, parental underpants on their head. Her judgment is so fragile she can’t even maintain a senate bloc of a mere four people with enough power to make or break government legislation; of the Pauline Hanson’s One Nation party’s four senators elected two years ago, two have been disqualified, a replacement has switched parties and she expelled another last week. Hers is not the leadership for the challenging and sensitive business of family law, with its extreme and personal emotions, its intersections of violence, sexual abuse, substance abuse and crises of parental capacity, its vulnerable children. But the whole Hanson story is never to let abject lack of capacity dissuade you from wading in. Hanson has demanded the abolition of the family court since her political arrival in 1996. When returned to parliament in 2016, Hanson insisted on a meeting with the chief justice, claiming “What needs to be addressed is domestic violence orders. Women, most of them are women, are going out and throwing them around left, right and centre.” To Hanson child support payments are “punitive”, and – unless one parent is a convicted criminal – joint custody should be default. In 2016, critics found her attacks on domestic violence protection and child maintenance “laughable, a rehash of the language and agenda of men’s rights groups” – “terrible”, according to the principal lawyer of Victoria’s Women’s Legal Service. And yet Hanson met with prime minister Malcolm Turnbull that year and was “very grateful for his attention” while declaring the family court’s abolition “huge on my agenda”. Turnbull’s attorney general is unlikely to legislate Hanson’s demands for judges to be replaced with “mainstream Australians” in custody cases. But with a speciality court collapsed into a general one, judges relieved of expertise requirements in return for efficiency dividends and resources maintained at insufficient levels, he doesn’t need to. Family law academics Stephen Parker and John Dewar once mapped the trajectory of the Howard Liberal government tilting the family law system “more and more against women, either by accident or design”. Further compromises under a Turnbull government render the “men’s rights” agenda Hanson represents increasingly likely to win out. There just might be votes in it, of course. Responding to the surge of votes for Hanson’s party in Queensland at the last election, the ABC reported “some Nationals MPs believe the One Nation leader’s push to abolish the Family Court struck a chord with angry dads battling custody issues” in 2016. Queensland is the electoral battleground that the Liberals and Nationals need to secure to retain government – and rumours are certainly firming for an election this year. What fortuitous timing that Porter has abolished the family court at the very point that courting the “angry dads” that voted for Hanson may be in his government’s interests. It’s a judgment perhaps more tactical than even ideological. And vulnerable parents and their children are just expendable to it. • Van Badham is a Guardian Australia journalist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"us-news/2018/jun/06/voters-recall-judge-in-stanford-campus-sexual-assault-case","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-06T10:38:56Z","webTitle":"Voters oust California judge in Brock Turner sexual assault case","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jun/06/voters-recall-judge-in-stanford-campus-sexual-assault-case","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/jun/06/voters-recall-judge-in-stanford-campus-sexual-assault-case","fields":{"headline":"Voters oust California judge in Brock Turner sexual assault case","bodyText":"The California judge in the Stanford sexual assault case has been recalled from office by local voters, an extremely rare outcome in the US court system and a major victory for activists who waged a two-year campaign against the official. Judge Aaron Persky faced international scrutiny in June of 2016 after he sentenced the ex-Stanford University student Brock Turner to six months in jail. Turner, whose name became synonymous with campus sexual assault across America, had been convicted of three felonies for assaulting an unconscious woman outside of a fraternity party on the elite campus in northern California. The law prescribed a minimum of two years in state prison for Turner’s offenses, but Persky ordered more limited jail time and probation, which resulted in the then 20-year-old being released after three months. Persky, who recently said he had no regrets about the case, is the first judge to be recalled by US voters since 1977, and the first in California since 1932. Two women ran to replace Persky, and Cindy Hendrickson, a Stanford graduate herself as well as a local prosecutor with a strong record of prosecuting sex crimes, was declared the winner. She was a vocal supporter of the campaign to recall Persky. The Stanford case ignited international debates about sexual violence long before the #MeToo movement shone a light on assault, harassment and abuse in a wide range of industries. The case went viral after the victim read a powerful 7,000-word statement in court about rape culture and the trauma she endured in the aftermath of the attack and during the trial. The judge also received backlash for expressing sympathy to Turner during sentencing, saying: “A prison sentence would have a severe impact on him.” Turner’s father was also criticised for lamenting that his son was facing consequences for “20 minutes of action”. Days after the sentencing, Michele Landis Dauber, a Stanford law professor and family friend of the victim, announced the launch of a recall campaign, eventually collecting enough signatures to qualify for the 2018 ballot. The initiative received the backing of celebrity activists, including Rose McGowan and Amber Tamblyn, with supporters casting the recall effort as a movement to fight for survivors of sexual assault and take on a criminal justice system that has long failed victims. The campaign, however, quickly divided the traditionally liberal Palo Alto and faced intense opposition from a coalition of legal experts, judges, public defenders, criminal justice reformers and some feminists and sexual assault survivors. Critics have argued that, even if they disagreed with Persky’s individual sentencing for Turner, it would set a dangerous precedent to recall a judge based on outrage over a light sentence. Recall opponents have said that judicial discretion helps defendants receive fair treatment, and that if judges are pressured to issue harsher sentences, it would harm low-income people and people of color disproportionately charged and convicted in US courts. Advocates for the recall effort analyzed Persky’s old cases, bringing to light other rulings that they said revealed his biases and indifference to female victims. The Guardian interviewed a domestic violence victim upset with her ex-boyfriend’s minor jail sentence in Persky’s courtroom and reported on another case in which the judge was overseeing a much harsher sentence than Turner’s for a Latino sexual assault defendant. Proponents of Persky, however, have argued that he has been consistent in criminal cases, following probation recommendations and approving plea agreements between defendants and prosecutors. Two months after the controversial Turner sentencing, Persky also removed himself from all criminal cases, but the recall campaign continued. Hendrickson, as well as being a Stanford graduate, served as a civil trial attorney before she joined the local district attorney’s office. “We voted today against impunity for high status perpetrators of sexual assault and domestic violence,” Dauber said in a statement on Wednesday. “We voted that sexual violence is serious and it must be taken seriously by our elected officials.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/jun/07/australian-students-feel-lonelier-and-more-left-out-than-a-decade-ago","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-06T18:00:21Z","webTitle":"Australian students feel lonelier and more left out than a decade ago","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/jun/07/australian-students-feel-lonelier-and-more-left-out-than-a-decade-ago","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/jun/07/australian-students-feel-lonelier-and-more-left-out-than-a-decade-ago","fields":{"headline":"Australian students feel lonelier and more left out than a decade ago","bodyText":"Australian students are lonelier and feel more out of place at school than they did a decade ago, a new report from the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development has found. The latest study from the Program for International Student Assessment – or Pisa – has revealed that Australian students’ rank well below the global average when it comes to how comfortable they feel at school. The report measured students’ “sense of belonging” at school by asking questions such as whether they “feel like they belong at school” or whether they felt lonely or left out. It found a significant decline in how Australian students felt at school between 2003 and 2015, with Indigenous students, females and students from low socio-economic backgrounds recording the lowest sense of belonging. Dr Sue Thomson from the Australian Council for Educational Research – which published the report in Australia – said the report offered an insight into students “at risk of becoming disengaged”. “Although these results don’t tell us why some students have a lower sense of belonging, they do highlight where the social issues are – among students who are Indigenous, female, Australian-born, from low SES backgrounds and country areas,” she said. Pisa ranks students from across the OECD on a variety of academic measures. The last survey completed in 2015 found that Australia’s reading, maths and science literacy had all declined. The new report said sense of belonging “has been shown to be an important schooling outcome in its own right” and for some students is indicative of educational success and long-term health and well-being. “Research shows that a sense of belonging is an important schooling outcome,” Thomson said. “For some students it really makes a difference to their educational success and long-term health and wellbeing.” But Australia now ranks below countries such as the United Kingdom and United States, and well below the OECD average. Spain recorded the highest sense of belonging amongst its students. But the decline within Australia will be of most concern to education officials. In 2003 88% of Australian students agreed that they “feel like they belong at school”. By 2015 the figure had decreased to 72% , almost double the average decline across the OECD. Similarly, in 2003, 92% of Australian students disagreed with the notion that they “feel like an outsider” at school. By 2015 it had decreased to 77%."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/jun/06/australia-remains-preferred-destination-for-millionaire-migrants","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-06T06:55:47Z","webTitle":"Australia remains preferred destination for millionaire migrants","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/jun/06/australia-remains-preferred-destination-for-millionaire-migrants","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/jun/06/australia-remains-preferred-destination-for-millionaire-migrants","fields":{"headline":"Australia remains preferred destination for millionaire migrants","bodyText":"Australia is the millionaires’ migration destination of choice for the third year running, according to a new report, with wealthy individuals lured by the country’s proximity to Asia, relative safety and no inheritance taxes. About 10,000 high-net-worth individuals, with a personal wealth of US$1m or more, migrated to Australia in 2017 – mostly from China, India and the UK. • Sign up to receive the top stories in Australia every day at noon Melbourne and Sydney were among the top 10 cities around the world to have a net immigration of millionaires, as was Auckland in New Zealand. Sydney is one of the wealthiest cities worldwide. It is part of a growing global movement of millionaires who, according to the 2018 Global Wealth Migration Review published by the AfrAsia Bank this month, are the canaries in the coalmine of economic collapse. The number of millionaires swapping countries increased by 15% in 2017, to 95,000. Countries that recorded a net deficit of millionaires – including the UK, which suffered a net loss of 4,000 millionaires in 2017 – should view it as a bad sign, according to the authors. “If one looks at any major country collapse in history, it is normally preceded by a migration of wealthy people away from that country,” the report said. Australia is a popular destination because it is safe, politically stable and, importantly, does not have any inheritance taxes. The proximity to Asia also makes Australia a good base for doing business in China and Japan. It was ranked as the safest country in the world for women by the review in 2018 – a metric, the report says, historically has a 92% correlation to growth in wealth. The report does note, in parentheses, that some of the super wealthy view Australia as “a nanny state with too many rules”. It says arguments against immigration do not apply to the very rich, who are “unlikely to take low-paying jobs … unlikely to claim benefits ... [and likely to] send their children to private schools”. The “only possible negative”, the report says, are increased property prices. It commends Australian laws preventing foreign investors from buying second-hand homes as a safeguard against property price hikes, although house prices in Sydney and Melbourne nonetheless increased in 2017. The report said the cost per square metre of property in Sydney rose by 19% in 2017 to US$25,000 ($32,600) per square metre, making it more expensive than traditional playgrounds for the mega rich like Lake Como in Italy. The Sydney housing market has cooled slightly in 2018. Australia is ranked the ninth-wealthiest country in the world, with a private wealth of US$6.142tn, but is forecast to overtake Canada and France to be the seventh-wealthiest country by 2027. It is the fifth-wealthiest country per capita, with an average personal wealth of US$279,200, overtaking the US, where the average wealth is US$193,400. Both figures are skewed by supremely wealthy individuals at the top of the scale, but the report says Australia is one of the “most equal” countries in the world, with 28% of the total personal wealth in the country held by individuals with a personal wealth of US$1m or more. The ratio should be less than 30%, the report argues. Anything above 40% leaves “very little space for a meaningful middle class”. There were 2,252 billionaires in the world in 2017, 584,000 multi-millionaires with a net-worth of US$10m or higher, and 15.2 million millionaires. The average global personal wealth was US$28,400.

It’s coming to a head this week with a minister facing the real prospect of being ejected from the upper house because his government has refused to produce three crucial documents to the house, despite being ordered to. So, what’s it all about? For the last three decades power has shifted in the Australian political system from parliaments to the ministers and unelected bureaucrats who form the executive government. Most parliaments, state and federal, operate as little more than a rubber stamp to the decisions of the executive. So much so that most people see no real distinction between the government and parliament. However, our entire system of responsible government is founded on the idea that parliaments are separate sources of power and authority to the government of the day. It’s the job of parliaments to hold governments to account, to demand transparency, to question government decisions and if necessary, to remove ministers from office. Accountability starts with getting access to information. Since the mid-1990s the NSW upper house has been quietly developing a new set of constitutional norms that have confirmed it has the power to demand information and documents from the executive. This is often referred to as the “call for papers” power. In the mid- to late-1990s the upper house’s “call for papers” power was challenged by the Carr Labor government. In two separate cases, Egan v Willis (1996) and Egan v Chadwick (1999), the courts held that the upper house had the power to compel the government of the day to produce documents to it. What wasn’t decided in the Willis and Chadwick cases was the extent to which the upper house could demand documents that were protected by a claim of “cabinet in confidence”. Time after time journalists and members of the community have been prevented from getting access to crucial government documents because the government of the day has declared they are “cabinet in confidence”. Traditionally a document was only “cabinet in confidence” if it would reveal the actual deliberations of a cabinet meeting. This was a narrow set of documents that included the minutes of a cabinet meeting and specific briefings created for a cabinet meeting. The rationale for protecting these documents from public scrutiny is that it allows ministers sitting around a cabinet table to have a frank discussion and assessment of the issues presented without having to fear their robust exchange will end up on the 6pm news or the front page of a newspaper. But over time, the range of documents that governments declare “cabinet in confidence” has grown and grown and grown. They are now routinely claiming that any document, created at any level of government that may at some point inform a cabinet deliberation, is cabinet in confidence and they don’t have to produce to the upper house or answer to any freedom of information request. This has seen a shroud of secrecy settle over many actions of the government. Right now, the upper house is in dispute with the executive because the government has refused to produce three crucial documents in answer to three separate calls for papers. The government has declared that each is “cabinet in confidence” and not subject to the house’s call for papers powers. The documents in question are a 2016 independent review of child protection services called the “Tune report,” the business case for moving the Powerhouse museum to Parramatta and the business case for the knock down and redevelopment of the Sydney Football and Olympic stadiums. On Tuesday the NSW upper house censured the leader of the government for failing to comply with these orders. If the minister does not produce the documents on Wednesday, he faces the very real prospect of being removed from parliament. If that happens it is highly likely the matter will once again end up in the courts. The long-suffering public should welcome this independent streak in the NSW parliament. Finally a parliament is striking back at executive overreach. Parliament is challenging the culture of secrecy that prevents real scrutiny of how government works and how billions of dollars of taxpayer funds are spent. We can only hope that other parliaments also grow a backbone and do their job by holding governments around the country to account. • David Shoebridge is a New South Wales Greens MP and the party’s spokesperson for justice"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/2018/jun/06/wednesday-briefing-brexit-market-of-ideas-gets-crowded","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-06T05:29:07Z","webTitle":"Wednesday briefing: Brexit market of ideas gets crowded","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/06/wednesday-briefing-brexit-market-of-ideas-gets-crowded","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/06/wednesday-briefing-brexit-market-of-ideas-gets-crowded","fields":{"headline":"Wednesday briefing: Brexit market of ideas gets crowded","bodyText":"Top story: Keir Starmer’s ‘internal market’ pitch Good morning – it’s Warren Murray helping you bend and stretch into the news day. Labour has thrown another kind of EU trade deal into the mix, with Brexit spokesman Keir Starmer tabling an amendment to create an “internal market” arrangement with the EU. It gives shape to Jeremy Corbyn’s previously stated goals but opens a divide with remainers who want Norway-style full membership of the single market. The EU withdrawal bill on its way back from the Lords already has an amendment supported by both Labour and rebel Tory MPs to keep Britain in the European economic area (EEA). Labour remainers argue their Tory counterparts are much more likely to support this amendment than Starmer’s. Chris Leslie, one of the Labour MPs, said: “If the frontbench are missing the opportunity to secure the EEA single market as a UK negotiating objective, there will be utter dismay and shock across the Labour movement.” Gordon Brown has intervened, meanwhile, with a call for ministers to concentrate on tackling the main concerns of leave voters rather than getting stuck on the “technical details of what kind of Brexit”. The former PM said Britain should register migrants on arrival and stop them undercutting local wages; make sure jobs are advertised locally before abroad; and deport them if they fail to find a job. * * * Trouble for TSB chief – The IT meltdown at TSB that locked up to 1.9 million customers out of their bank accounts has drawn a stinging rebuke from City regulator the FCA. It blasted chief executive Paul Pester for not being “open and transparent” enough about the upgrade gone wrong, which is still causing disruption for customers more than a month on. Pester is due to make a second appearance in front of the Commons Treasury committee today. During his first appearance, he was accused of being “extraordinarily complacent” after saying the bank’s move to the new IT system had mostly run smoothly. * * * Quick catch-up – Wednesday has crept up on us again.

Police think it was placed there after Yulia arrived on Saturday 3 March, having flown to the UK from Russia. She and her father left by car at 9.15am on Sunday, and were found gravely ill at 4.15pm that day. “Our enquiries are focused around the people and vehicles that were in the vicinity of the Skripals’ address and leading up to where they fell ill in the Maltings,” said deputy assistant commissioner Dean Haydon. * * * Grenfell panel maker defiant – Arconic, the company that made the combustible cladding on Grenfell Tower, has denied it was anything more than one “contributing feature” in the fire’s spread. At the inquest into the blaze which resulted in 72 deaths, lawyers for the US company said the windows of the tower should have had greater fire protection. It contradicts the view of fire safety experts including Prof Luke Bisby who said the panels were “the primary cause of upward vertical fire spread, downward vertical fire spread, and lateral fire spread”. The fire is thought to have broken out from a fourth floor flat when a uPVC window melted. Flames spread through the combustible cladding system until they enveloped all four sides of the building. * * * Weaponised broccoli – Science has shown its evil side today with the invention of broccoli coffee.

It was used as a Japanese prisoner of war camp after British and Australian forces surrendered in 1942, and was the site of many executions. Its modern-day name means “peace and tranquility”. For the meeting, which Trump says will “hopefully be the start of something big”, security is paramount – and it is readily achieved here, since Sentosa is connected to the Singaporean “mainland” by a single causeway that can be easily closed off.

The Ivory Coast midfielder, who left City in May after eight years at the club, accused Guardiola of “having a problem with African players” in an interview with France Football, also claiming the manager had ruined his final season in Manchester. But De Bruyne said he had not seen any evidence of Touré’s claims during his time at City and believes the 35-year-old’s frustration at his lack of game-time may have played a part in his accusations. “I never saw something. It would be weird if the trainer was racist – with all the black guys in our team,” De Bruyne told BBC World Football. “So I don’t know what Yaya said or if it’s wrongly written or exaggerated. When you don’t play there’s always something you try to find.” De Bruyne added: “We had the best season ever, so in the end the coach took the right decision to play with the team who played a lot. This year the trainer probably thought he [Yaya] wasn’t doing enough, wasn’t fit enough. I’ve never seen something racist at the club, ever.” Earlier on Tuesday Guardiola had refused to comment when asked to respond to the accusations. “I am not going to talk about the words of Yaya Touré,” he said. But Touré’s agent continued the offensive by saying that his client would practically play for free for a top six Premier League club against Guardiola. “Yaya has received many offers from different countries, big money offers, but we have decided to devote the next season to Guardiola,” Dimitri Seluk told sport24 . “To proving to the Manchester City fans that Yaya is not finished with football. He is full of strength and energy and wants to play in England this season. “At a time when English clubs are spending huge sums of money on players, I officially declare that Yaya is ready to move to any top-six English club as a free agent with a salary of £1 per week. As long as a success-based bonus system is in place.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/2018/jun/05/belmont-stakes-draw-justify-no1-post","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-05T21:46:49Z","webTitle":"Justify to run from rail in Triple Crown bid after drawing No1 post for Belmont","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/jun/05/belmont-stakes-draw-justify-no1-post","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/jun/05/belmont-stakes-draw-justify-no1-post","fields":{"headline":"Justify to run from rail in Triple Crown bid after drawing No1 post for Belmont","bodyText":"Justify will run out of the No1 post in Saturday’s 150th running of the Belmont Stakes and is a better than even money favorite to become only the 13th horse to win thoroughbred racing’s Triple Crown. The chestnut colt, trained by Bob Baffert and rode by Mike Smith, was installed as the 4-5 morning-line favorite despite pulling the dreaded one slot in Tuesday’s draw at Citi Field ahead of the New York Mets’ game with the Baltimore Orioles. “I never do like to draw the rail,” Baffert said. “My horses seem to live in it. We have it, can’t change it, have to deal with it. “I just feel like most importantly the horse is doing well.” The son of Scat Daddy will attempt to become the first three-year-old to sweep the Kentucky Derby, the Preakness Stakes and the Belmont, America’s three most celebrated races, since American Pharoah ended a 37-year drought three years ago – and only the second since Affirmed in 1978. The most likely spoiler in the well-rested 10-horse field, which features only two challengers that ran in the Preakness three weeks ago, is second choice Hofburg, the seventh-place finisher in the Derby who opens at 9-2. Vino Rosso and Preakness runner-up Bravazo both were installed at 8-1. The rest of the field is 12-1 or longer. “I think, like all of us, we need Justify to wake up on the wrong side of the bed to have a chance,” said Todd Pletcher, the trainer of Vino Rosso and Noble Indy with three previous Belmont wins to his name. Should Justify pull off the historic bid in the one-and-a-half-mile Belmont, the third and most difficult of the Triple Crown legs staged at the venerable race course just outside New York city limits, the colt will set a record for number of rivals defeated with the storied feat on the line. Justify, who is undefeated in five outings, had been regarded as a freakish talent but an untested one until he ended a 136-year-old hoodoo at the Kentucky Derby on 5 May with his fourth win in as many tries, running from the No7 post on a sloppy track and becoming the first horse to win the famed race at Churchill Downs having not raced as a two-year-old since 1882. He followed it up two weeks later at Pimlico, fending off an extended challenge from Good Magic in an enveloping fog on another muddy course, and also from the seven hole, to win by a half-length over Bravazo. Now he enters the $1.5m race at Belmont Park as America’s next great equine sensation, looking to join a famous roll of thoroughbreds to capture the Triple Crown that includes Sir Barton (1919), Gallant Fox (1930), Omaha (1935), War Admiral (1937), Whirlaway (1941), Count Fleet (1943), Assault (1946), Citation (1948), Secretariat (1973), Seattle Slew (1977), Affirmed (1978) and American Pharoah (2015). Baffert, who was scheduled to throw out the ceremonial first pitch before Tuesday night’s game, can become only the second trainer to saddle more than one Triple Crown winner after ‘Sunny’ Jim Fitzsimmons, who trained Gallant Fox and Omaha. Additionally, Justify will attempt to become the only undefeated horse besides Seattle Slew to achieve what has long been considered among the most difficult feats in all of sport: winning three prestigious races at varying lengths in three different states over a five-week span. Justify is scheduled to arrive at Belmont Park on Wednesday afternoon after traveling on a special transport plane from Louisville International Airport to Long Island’s MacArthur Airport in the morning. “He’s doing well,” said Baffert, who will also send out longshot Restoring Hope in Saturday’s main event. “So I think we just – once he gets here tomorrow, we won’t feel until he gets on that plane and gets here, so we still have a few days to go – but everything has been really smooth since the Preakness, so we’re happy about that.” A total of 23 horses have taken the Belmont from the No1 post since records were kept in 1905, making it the winningest post position. But none have won from the rail since Empire Maker in 2003. The full slate of post positions and morning-line odds was revealed on Tuesday afternoon: No1 Justify (4-5), No2 Free Drop Billy (30-1), No3 Bravazo (8-1), No4 Hofburg (9-2), No5 Restoring Hope (30-1), No6 Gronkowski (12-1), No7 Tenfold (12-1), No8 Vino Rosso (8-1), No9 Noble Indy (30-1), No10 Blended Citizen (15-1). The post time for the 150th running of the Belmont Stakes is 6.46pm ET."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2018/jun/05/donald-trump-north-korea-summit-kim-jong-un-explained","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-05T22:00:56Z","webTitle":"What will be the outcome of Trump and Kim Jong-un's nuclear summit?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/05/donald-trump-north-korea-summit-kim-jong-un-explained","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/05/donald-trump-north-korea-summit-kim-jong-un-explained","fields":{"headline":"What will be the outcome of Trump and Kim Jong-un's nuclear summit?","bodyText":"Rarely in modern in history has there been a summit with higher stakes and greater uncertainty over its outcome than the planned meeting in Singapore a week from now between Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump. On one side of the table will be the leader of a highly reclusive, isolated state that has devoted the past three decades to the development of nuclear warheads and missiles. Kim Jong-un claims to be on the point of a historic pivot toward economic development – but the regime has made similar claims before and stopped well short of surrendering weapons it believes to be a guarantee of survival. Across the table will be a US president unlike any other in history: capricious, disdainful of advice from even his own officials and entirely convinced that his instincts – his feel for the “art of the deal” – are always the best guide to action. That unpredictability has driven several whiplash turns in the past few days alone. Trump threatened the regime with Libyan-style “decimation” if Kim did not do a deal, called the summit off, then declared it back on and welcomed Kim’s right-hand man to the White House with more personal warmth than he has hitherto shown to any US ally. In these circumstances, there is no absolute guarantee that both men will be at Singapore Capella hotel at the appointed hour of 9am next Tuesday, for what would be the first ever encounter between a sitting US president and a North Korean leader. But advance teams are in Singapore urgently working to prepare the meeting at short notice. And the opening moves have already been made, well ahead of the formal negotiations. North Korea has stopped its nuclear and long-range missile tests, and made some moves towards dismantling a nuclear testing site – though the significance of what was blown up is in doubt. For his part, Trump has given the regime more respect and recognition than it has ever received from the US in its 70-year history, with his effusive welcome of top aide Kim Yong-chol on Friday and his abrupt abandonment of previous US negotiating positions the same day. He accepted the North Korean insistence that any future denuclearisation would not be an “all-in-one” event as US officials had insisted, but a drawn-out phased process, involving multiple summits along the way. And the president unceremoniously dropped his mantra of “maximum pressure” that had hitherto defined his North Korea policy. US sanctions are rooted in congressional legislation and by law can only be lifted once North Korean behaviour changes demonstrably. UN sanctions are similarly grounded in security council resolutions but their enforcement varies considerably. There are already signs that China is relaxing restrictions on North Korean trade. The road to an agreement immediately gets much steeper on 12 June if and when the two leaders sit down. Trump has sought to play down those expectations, characterising the meeting as “getting-to-know-you, plus”. But without a substantial “plus” in the form of progress in the direction of disarmament, the meeting will widely be deemed a failure. And to achieve that progress, Trump will have to make significant gestures towards what Kim wants most – security guarantees. Both leaders will go into the Singapore meeting with cards in their hands, representing quick, deliverable concessions. The big question next week will be which cards they play and in what sequence. At a minimum, Kim will be expected to formalise the current suspension of nuclear and missile testing. He could go further by declaring a cap on his existing arsenal freeze on other nuclear activity like uranium enrichment. His biggest element of his opening offer, however, would be a statement on his plans to dismantle his nuclear weapons programme, and here everything will be in the details – how clearly denuclearisation is defined, and whether Kim commits to a timetable. “I do believe that North Korea is most probably willing to say that at the end of the day they are willing to denuclearise, but there will be fine print, and that fine print has to be negotiated,” said Joseph Yun, a former US special envoy for North Korea policy now an adviser at the US Institute of Peace. For Robert Gallucci, who led negotiations with the North Koreans in the Clinton administration, a detailed declaration on denuclearisation will be the key to Trump’s success or failure in Singapore. “If he doesn’t get anything else, that would be a win,” Gallucci said at a discussion at the Stimson Centre thinktank in Washington. “And if he gets everything else but doesn’t get that, that’ll be a loss.” Another element that would be expected to be in Kim’s opening offer is an agreement to allow international inspectors to visit the regime’s declared nuclear sites, principally the nuclear complex at Yongbyon. “When I think of what would be a big success coming out of the summit, I think getting the inspectors back in has to be one of our top goals,” said Suzanne DiMaggio, a director at the New America foundation who has led backchannel negotiations with the North Koreans. Such concessions would be on a par with what North Korea has offered in previous agreements. To break new ground, Kim would have to go further. At this summit or in subsequent meetings, the US is likely to ask for a full inventory of its nuclear programme, declared and undeclared – an issue on which previous deals broke down. To be meaningful, that would be have to be verified by access for inspectors, whether they come from the International Atomic Energy Agency or a specially assembled ad hoc inspection organisation. Trump has various ways in which he can reciprocate. One is “negative security assurances”, a pledge not to attack, something the president has already gone a long way towards in his tweets and casual remarks. He has also hinted he might be ready to start negotiations aimed at a formal peace treaty to end the conflict that currently is subject only to the 1953 armistice. At the same time, the US could establish a liaison office in Pyongyang and allow a North Koreans to set their own up in Washington, a step towards mutual recognition. Another way the US could demonstrate flexibility and sensitivity is to tone down its joint military exercises with South Korea, curbing the use of what Pyongyang views as “nuclear and strategic assets”, like F-22 stealth fighters and B1-B bombers. The fear in Seoul and Tokyo is that Trump will be persuaded to give too much away under this category, offering to withdraw troops or otherwise weaken US alliances in the region, to which the president has not shown much commitment anyway. Anxiety in the region has swung from concerns Trump will not engage to anxiety he will be too eager to please. The full dismantling of the North Korean arsenal (estimated at between two and three dozen warheads), the destruction of missiles and the removal of fissile material and production capacity is likely to take a decade at least, according to Siegfried Hecker, a Stanford-based physicist with firsthand experience of the North Korean nuclear programme. At the same time, Pyongyang would be expected to join the Nuclear Non-Proliferation treaty (NPT) and sign the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT), to set its non-nuclear status in stone. On the other side of the ledger, sanctions would have to lifted in tranches, and North Korea’s place in the international institutions would be secured, as part of a general normalisation of diplomatic relations. Such aspirations are likely to lie beyond the horizon as seen from Singapore. What will matter next week is whether the summit negotiations end up headed in that general direction, and whether Kim shows some proof that this time the regime is serious about foregoing its nuclear arsenal. “Kim Jong-un is 34 years old. I think he’s looking to live another 40 years or more, and he has experience living overseas,” Ambassador Yun told a Senate committee on Tuesday. “All through their history they have not shown any signs that they want to denuclearise, but … it is a hypothesis worth testing … War is not an option.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"money/2018/jun/06/mps-urge-home-secretary-to-review-right-to-rent-policy","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-06T05:00:05Z","webTitle":"MPs urge home secretary to review 'right to rent' policy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2018/jun/06/mps-urge-home-secretary-to-review-right-to-rent-policy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2018/jun/06/mps-urge-home-secretary-to-review-right-to-rent-policy","fields":{"headline":"MPs urge home secretary to review 'right to rent' policy","bodyText":"A cross-party group of MPs has written to the home secretary urging a review of a controversial immigration policy forcing landlords to check whether tenants are legally allowed to rent, saying there has been no proper assessment of its impact. The group, comprising MPs from Labour, the Lib Dems, SNP, Plaid Cymru and the Greens, told Sajid Javid that the “right to rent” scheme, part of the wider hostile environment approach, needed reassessment following the Windrush scandal. Since 2014 landlords have been required to carry out “reasonable enquiries” as to whether would-be tenants are in the UK legitimately. A subsequent law created an offence of knowingly leasing a property to a disqualified person, with a maximum jail term of five years. One of the many problems faced by people caught up in the Windrush scandal has been the inability to find anywhere to live when they cannot prove their immigration status. The letter, whose signatories include Diane Abbott, Harriet Harman, Joanna Cherry, Ben Lake, Caroline Lucas and Tom Brake, cited a report from March on the right to rent scheme by the Independent Chief Inspector of Borders and Immigration (ICIBI), David Bolt. The report found right to rent “had yet to demonstrate its worth as a tool to encourage immigration compliance”, Bolt said, making a series of recommendations for change. The letter noted that the ICIBI “was particularly concerned with the lack of any monitoring or evaluation mechanisms that would allow the government to ascertain whether the scheme was having its intended effect, or whether it is creating unintended consequences”. It said the government had refused to implement one of his recommendations – an improved landlords’ consultative panel – and had seemed unwilling to properly monitor the effect of the scheme. “The Windrush scandal has drawn attention to the effects of the so-called hostile environment,” the letter said. “It also provides a stark warning of the consequences that can be expected when ministers and officials fail to respond to the repeated warnings of experts about the impact of their policies.” While the best option would be to immediately end the scheme, the letter said, at the very least ministers should commit to evaluating it properly, particularly how it might make people homeless, or at risk of modern slavery and trafficking. It ended: “We therefore ask that you implement the recommendations set out by the ICIBI as a matter of urgency.” A Home Office spokesman said: “The term ‘hostile environment’ as a description of Home Office immigration policy is incorrect, unhelpful and does not represent our values as a country. “We noted the Independent Chief Inspectors’ recommendations on the right to rent scheme and we continue to take steps to ensure it is implemented and communicated as effectively as possible. “The Home Office engaged extensively with a variety of groups prior to the roll out of the right to rent scheme and it has been subject to evaluation, which found no evidence that the scheme was causing unlawful discrimination, homelessness or additional burdens on local authorities.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jun/05/the-guardian-view-on-heathrow-expansion-better-never-than-so-late","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-05T17:07:46Z","webTitle":"The Guardian view on Heathrow expansion: better never than so late | Editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/05/the-guardian-view-on-heathrow-expansion-better-never-than-so-late","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/05/the-guardian-view-on-heathrow-expansion-better-never-than-so-late","fields":{"headline":"The Guardian view on Heathrow expansion: better never than so late","bodyText":"The decision to go ahead with the third runway at Heathrow was taken two years ago; Chris Grayling’s confirmation yesterday marked the point when it seemed to its promoters that enough of the opposition on the ground had been defeated, so it was safe to proceed with a final vote in three weeks’ time. If that is won, and all goes according to plan, the bulldozers will go in around 2021, when the inevitable cycle of cost overruns and slipping deadlines can begin, 31 years after the project was first mooted. By then the UK may be two years into a lengthy “transitional” post-Brexit period, and the bright economic forecasts which are used to justify the plan may be no more use than hot air balloons. There is a case that air travel has made life better for many people and that more of it would continue to do so. Nearly two-thirds of Heathrow’s present traffic is leisure flying. Mass tourism has boosted the economy of many countries and greatly enlarged our experience of the world, and perhaps our sympathies as well. However unpleasant the experience of a modern airport can be, through which we are run like rats in a maze of shopping malls and security checks, it still seems better to many of us than being trapped in our own countries all year round. Heathrow as it stands today is an unimposing portal to Britain. Failing to expand it is simply sabotaging the country. Beyond that, the country is dependent, like all others, on air freight. So the plans for expansion are in some ways well motivated. We can even overlook the fact that they are promoted by Mr Grayling, a man notoriously unable to make even trains run on time. Much of the opposition is simply nimbyism. Those West London Tory MPs who claim to be opposed to Heathrow’s third runway on environmental grounds, and then propose that it be built onto Gatwick or Stansted instead illustrate this clearly. There is some amusement to be derived from the rumoured machinations to allow the foreign secretary (the MP for local Uxbridge) to be out of the country on the occasion of the vote, so that he does not have to live up to his stated determination to oppose it even if he has to lie down in front of the bulldozers, but this is a frivolity, like most things about Mr Johnson. The serious objections to the plan remain, as they have been for most of this century, the environmental ones. The simple fact is that it is impossible to combine a commitment to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 80% by 2050 with the strategic encouragement of air travel. Mr Grayling’s statement made much play of technological advances. Aircraft will be quieter, cleaner, and greener, he said. It is entirely possible that they will be quieter, and the promise of an enforceable night time curfew when even the quieter planes will be silent must have done much to still some of the opposition from under the flight path. But the lasting damage the planes do is silent and far from the airport. It is their emissions in the upper atmosphere which drive climate change and all its disastrous effects. Nor can those be confined to the poorer parts of the world, as we’re already seeing. As the world warms, the price of mass tourism will be paid in mass migrations. It is true that aircraft have got lighter and more fuel efficient, but this is of no benefit to the environment if there are more of them, flying more often – and that is the underlying logic of the Heathrow expansion. In the long term, which gets closer every day, the only answer to the problem of fossil fuels is to keep them in the ground. Doing so demands that we keep aircraft on the ground as well. MPs should reject this plan when it comes to the vote."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"environment/2018/jun/05/india-will-abolish-all-single-use-plastic-by-2022-vows-narendra-modi","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-05T16:57:56Z","webTitle":"India will abolish all single-use plastic by 2022, vows Narendra Modi","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jun/05/india-will-abolish-all-single-use-plastic-by-2022-vows-narendra-modi","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/jun/05/india-will-abolish-all-single-use-plastic-by-2022-vows-narendra-modi","fields":{"headline":"India will abolish all single-use plastic by 2022, vows Narendra Modi","bodyText":"India will eliminate all single-use plastic in the country by 2022, the prime minister, Narendra Modi, has announced. The pledge is the most ambitious yet of the global actions to combat plastic pollution that are taking place in 60 nations around the world. Modi’s move aims to drastically stem the flow of plastic from the 1.3 billion people living in the fastest growing economy in the world. “The choices that we make today will define our collective future,” said Modi on Tuesday. “The choices may not be easy. But through awareness, technology, and a genuine global partnership, I am sure we can make the right choices. Let us all join together to beat plastic pollution and make this planet a better place to live.” A UN report issued on Tuesday – World Environment day – showed dozens of nations acting to cut plastic, including a ban on plastic bags in Kenya, on styrofoam in Sri Lanka and the use of biodegradable bags in China. A tax on single-use plastic bags in the UK has slashed their use, and ministers have banned microbeads in personal hygiene products. But the prime minister, Theresa May’s, pledge to end “avoidable plastic waste by the end of 2042” was criticised as far too slow. Millions of tonnes of plastic enter the seas each year, choking whales and other creatures, much of it in Asia. Plastic pollution has been found across the globe, from the most remote oceanic islands to high Swiss peaks. Microplastics have now also been found in tap water and human food around the world, with unknown implications for health. Writing in the Guardian on Tuesday, Erik Solheim, head of UN Environment, said: “Let there be no doubt: we are on edge of a plastic calamity.” But he praised India’s initiative: “They have shown that political motivation, turned into practical action, can inspire the world and ignite real change.” India, which has 7,500km of coastline, also announced a national marine litter action campaign and a programme to measure how much plastic enters India’s coastal waters. The nation will also pledge to make 100 national monuments litter-free, including the Taj Mahal. “Environmental degradation hurts the poor and vulnerable the most,” Modi said. “It is the duty of each one of us to ensure that material prosperity does not compromise our environment.” In 2014, Modi pledged to bring electricity to the almost 20,000 that still lacked power by 2019. On 28 April, he claimed this had been achieved."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/jun/06/our-concerns-about-the-arrest-of-abbas-edalat-in-iran","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-06T17:26:42Z","webTitle":"Our concerns about the arrest of Abbas Edalat in Iran | Letter","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/06/our-concerns-about-the-arrest-of-abbas-edalat-in-iran","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/06/our-concerns-about-the-arrest-of-abbas-edalat-in-iran","fields":{"headline":"Our concerns about the arrest of Abbas Edalat in Iran","bodyText":"We are 129 members of the academic community in the United Kingdom and beyond, including Austria, China, Finland, France, Germany, Iceland, Italy, Korea, Mexico, Russia, Serbia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, and the US, working at the forefront of computer science, mathematics and machine learning. We are deeply concerned about the arrest of our colleague, Professor Abbas Edalat, in Iran (Report, 3 May). Many of us have known Abbas for decades as a kind, caring, decent and honourable man, of great intellect and integrity. It is particularly surprising that Abbas was arrested specifically in Iran. He deeply respects his own rich heritage, background and ethnicity, and we have heard him say only positive things about the Iranian nation and people. He has always been ready to express his love for his native country. In addition to being a prominent academic, making fundamental contributions to mathematical logic and theoretical computer science, Abbas has worked ceaselessly to bridge the gap in technology, education and development between the developed and developing worlds. Abbas has taught many generations of students at Imperial College. Some of us have written our PhD dissertations under his supervision. Many of us owe Abbas our own achievements in computer science, mathematics and machine learning – strategic areas of research for the United Kingdom and for the world – through his generous teaching, advice, and truly visionary thought leadership over many decades. In addition to inflicting inexplicable suffering on our colleague, teacher and friend, Abbas’s detention is causing a lot of harm to the academic community in the United Kingdom, in Iran and worldwide. By signing this letter, we are not trying to make a political statement or influence international affairs one way or another. We are expressing concern for our colleague, teacher and friend.

I have been coming here for 30 years, and while I have experienced just a small part of the city’s history it has had an outsized impact on my life. I fell hopelessly in love on the spot – hooked by its openhearted people and weathered beauty. No one looks you more in the eyes than the Habaneros. It is the city of stares, of sincerity and of kindness. Come here to be mesmerised by the eclectic architecture, with a surprise around every corner; to sway to the Cuban rhythms in surround sound as you stroll; to be inspired by cutting-edge contemporary art; and to taste the creative cuisine of the next gastronomic capital of the world. And whatever you do, explore beyond the borders of beautiful Habana Vieja (Old Havana), to discover the city’s distinct neighbourhoods. Malecón 663 Opened last year, Havana’s most striking boutique hotel is the brainchild of Sandra Exposito and her husband Orlandito Mengual. It has four guestrooms, each by a different local designer and in different styles: retro eclectic, art deco, vintage 1950s and contemporary. There is a cocktail and tapas bar on the ground floor, as well as a shop selling artisanal soaps and one-off jewellery. The roof terrace has great views of the Malecón, Havana’s famous promenade. • Doubles from £135 B&amp;B, malecon663.com Niels Reyes Niels Reyes is one of the most exciting artists on the roaring Cuban art scene, prized by collectors from New York to Beijing. Up close, his large-scale portraits look abstract but from further away they speak volumes about the human condition. After graduating from Havana’s Instituto Superior de Arte in 2006, Reyes was soon exhibiting around the world. He is represented in Cuba by Galería Artis 718 (Avenida 7, corner Calle 18, Miramar) and Collage Habana (San Rafael #103, between Consulado and Industria, Centro Habana). • Niels Reyes is on Facebook Nazdarovie Nazdarovie is a Soviet-style paladar (privately owned restaurant) set up in 2014 by Gregory Biniowsky, a Slavo-Canadian lawyer who had lived in Cuba for two decades, and wanted to bring a flavour of the motherland to thousands of Soviet expats. Russian and Ukrainian chefs cook favourites (from £5) such as borscht with smetana (sour cream), savoury varenikis (dumplings), chicken kiev, traditional beef stroganoff, and Russian black bread. They also make cocktails such as black or white Russians with Stolichnaya or Putinka vodka. Customers include ambassadors from former Soviet republics, and the place is decorated with old propaganda posters and huge matryoshka dolls. There’s also memorabilia from some of the many Cubans who studied in the USSR; the CCCP hockey shirt by the bar is my donation from 10 years in Moscow. • Malecón #25, 2nd floor, between Paseo del Prado and Carcel, Centro Habana, open daily noon-midnight. nazdarovie-havana.com El Bosque de La Habana El Bosque (the forest), between the neighbourhoods of Vedado and Miramar, is often called the lungs of Havana, where 300-year-old banyan, carob and jagüey trees are draped in vines that make them look like green monsters. It was laid out in the 1930s by French landscape architect Jean-Claude Nicolas Forestier (designer of the Eiffel Tower’s Champs-de-Mars gardens) as a “fusion of nature, architecture and city”. After the 1959 revolution, it was expanded to include Parque Almendares, with its playground, pony rides, mini-golf, lake and amphitheatre for marionette shows. This is where a new generation of Habaneros come for bike rides along the Almendares river or to barbecue and party. Belview ArtCafé Every last detail of Belview ArtCafé is carefully thought out, from the world globes over the bar to the photographs by German photographer Sven Creutzmann, who has lived in Havana for nearly 30 years and is married to owner Clara Veliz. Sit on the sleek 1957 Bel Air sofa or one of the padded Thonet chairs and order one of the house specialities (around £3) such as pulled pork crepe, sweet potato fries with tzatziki or spaghetti amatriciana. For dessert, there are brownies with ice-cream or a crepe with banana and chocolate cream. On Saturdays, it sells homemade bread including black, sourdough, ciabatta, brioche and challah, as well as croissants and other pastries. • Calle 6 #412, corner 19, Vedado, closed Mon. laesquinadelpan.com Salchipizza In the 19th century, Havana’s population spread west from the old city into what is now known as Centro Habana. Gritty and raw-feeling, this densely populated working-class area is the perfect place to experience everyday life in the capital. Michelin-starred chef Alberto González, who spent 14 years as a chef in Italy and studied at El Bulli in Spain, set up his shop and community project bakery here in 2014. At Salchipizza, González encourages everyone to taste his breads made with quality ingredients, including seeds, grains and flours he brings back from trips abroad. He also bakes gluten-free loaves (£1.80), and wholewheat sourdough made with an 80-year-old starter. Banana bread and dreamy coffee cake are sold by the slice. Look out for the photographs of Martin Luther King, Malcolm X and Barack Obama at the entrance. • Calle Infanta #562, between Valle and Zapata, Centro Habana, Tues-Sat 9am-4pm. On Facebook TocaMadera Enrique Suárez leads Cuba’s New Food movement and his latest venture, TocaMadera (touch wood), is the talk of the town. Suárez travelled the world to learn his trade but has returned to his Cuban comfort food roots to serve “traditional food with modern flavours”. His seasonal menu changes depending on the availability of produce, and many ingredients are sourced from Fernando Funes’s organic farm 12 miles west of Havana. His hamburgers cost £3, but fancier dishes such as truffle risotto, torched tuna with capers and black olives, penne with chicken and truffle salsa or avocado and shrimp salad start at about £9. For dessert, in season, there is mango tarte tatin with vanilla ice-cream. • Calle 38 #118, between Avenida 1 and 3, Miramar, Tues-Sat lunch and dinner, and Sun brunch. On Facebook Fábrica de Arte Cubano In a former cooking oil plant near the banks of the Almendares, Fábrica de Arte Cubano (FAC) is still the hippest place in Havana. There’s always a queue around the block to get into this extraordinary venue, part cultural centre, part night spot. Imagine Bauhaus mixed with a hot avant-garde Caribbean vibe in a number of galleries and performance spaces. It’s so big you can get lost in its multimedia labyrinth: lounge, chill, think, drink, eat, meet people, shop, dance, catch a film or concert or enjoy ever-changing art exhibitions. A clever way to avoid the inevitable queue is to book a table at its new Tierra restaurant, in former shipping containters, whose globetrotting menu might include salmorejo (tomato and bread soup from Andalucía), shrimp moqueca (a Brazilian-inspired seafood stew) and South American steak with mustard and fries (around £40 for two). The interior has a comfortable country kitchen atmosphere but outside there’s an Astroturf patio with bar. • fac.cu, Calle 26, corner 11, Vedado, Thurs-Sun 8pm-3 am, entry £2.25. To book at Tierra (essential) ring +535 565 2621 El Café After six years working in restaurants and cafes in London, Nelson Rodríguez Tamayo returned to Havana to open El Café. It’s in a beautiful Spanish colonial building that took eight months to renovate, and is the place to go for everything fresh and local. Coffee beans from Café O’Reilly (a Havana institution), freshly squeezed guava, pineapple, carrot or beetroot juice, and breakfasts of fried eggs, tomato, avocado and bacon (around £3). For lunch, there are veggie sandwiches (pictured) with homemade hummus , avocado, red pepper, kale and grilled aubergine on homemade sourdough bread, or the pulled-pork sandwich with yucca and orange marmalade sauce (from £3.75). It also does one of the best mojitos in Havana (£2.25). • Amargura #358, between Aguacate and Villegas in Habana Vieja. On Facebook, open daily 9am-6 pm Café Teatro Bertolt Brecht All the great Cuban musicians play at Café Teatro Bertolt Brecht, from Telmary (pictured), Cuba’s premier female hip-hop artist, to Interactivo, who play Afro-Cuban jazz fusion every Wednesday night. Formerly the Jewish Community Center, this intimate basement venue now hosts live music throughout the week. There is a cool bar at the back of the 1950s modernist structure (with a Star of David on the facade and elegant front doors covered in Semitic symbols), as well as a small outdoor cafe on the second-floor terrace, where local actors and artists congregate for coffee in the afternoon before rehearsal. • Calle 13, between I and J, Vedado. On Facebook. Entrance fee around £3.70 Getting there Virgin Atlantic flies from Gatwick to Havana from £516; KLM from Heathrow via Amsterdam from £498.

The left must speak for England","bodyText":"We will be hearing a lot about England over the next few weeks as the World Cup gets under way. But this column is not – at least not explicitly – about football, English or otherwise. It’s a column about England itself. It is a column about the country whose name is surprisingly rarely referenced outside the sporting context, yet a country with which the overwhelming majority of people living in these islands strongly identify. A lot has been written since 2016 about whether the Brexit vote marked an eruption of English nationalism. My experience is that this debate gets ahead of itself rather too easily and that those who make the claim sometimes put their fingers on the scales for reasons of their own. Explicit English nationalism remains nonexistent or dormant, not active, unlike other nationalisms in these islands. That the Brexit vote was, in part, an immense expression of English identity is, on the other hand, beyond dispute. Throughout this week, the BBC’s Mark Easton has been reporting on English identity. Most of it is based on a large survey by YouGov that explores the language, contours and contexts of that identity. Its findings should be a real wake-up call for anybody who is serious about modern British politics, especially on the left. The fundamental finding in the BBC’s English Question surveys is that 80% of people in England strongly self-identify as English. On one level this is hardly surprising. England is where they live. It’s where most of them were born. But let the idea and its implications sink in. And note also that there are almost no exceptions at all. This isn’t just coastal towns or leafy lanes. In every region, every class, every age group and almost every other demographic subset, a majority strongly – note “strongly” – self-identifies as English. The only subset exceptions, though they are important ones, are black and minority-ethnic adults (but only by a whisker), people who self-identify as British not English, and people of other nationalities altogether. Almost as important a finding, however, is that a strong sense of English identity actively coexists with other identities. Again, this is hardly surprising. Which of us is not like this in some way? Which of us self-identifies as one thing alone? The most common of these other identities, not surprisingly, is a British one, with 82% strong identification. On this, with the sole exception of other nationalities, every subset in the survey (this time including black and minority-ethnic adults) strongly identifies with Britishness – again, note the word “strongly”. Additionally, half of the survey strongly feel an English regional identity – up to 74% in the north-east. Around a quarter strongly feel European too. There is much else in the BBC/YouGov survey, but we must press on into the politics of what this all means. What the survey shows is that England means an awful lot to an awful lot of people. It also shows that it can’t be treated as more or less the same thing as Britain. It shows that political silence and evasion about England are no longer an option. Many on the left prefer the silence. Some find England embarrassing – a “not in my name” country. Many prefer to navigate the multiple identities of Britishness while leaving the self-identifying English alone. As a result the left of centre is not much represented in the English conversation. I suspect that the English have noticed. Labour embodies this unease. Few Labour policy documents mention England at all, even when they concern policy areas such as the health service or education, which are devolved and on which, therefore, “national” policy actually means English policy. Faced with English identity, Jeremy Corbyn is little different from Tony Blair or Gordon Brown. This week Brown made a fine speech about bringing the country together with a programme of reforms. Yet the word England appeared just once in his speech, and only in the context of English regionalism, not English identity. It is hard to think of any senior Labour politician since Tony Benn or Michael Foot who talked about England with any degree of comfort. Their view of England may have been unduly romantic and radical, but at least it existed. This isn’t intended as a bash-Labour point. For the most part, Labour is no better and no worse than anybody else on the liberal left in this regard. There are honourable exceptions, notably the former minister John Denham, no longer in parliament but actively pushing his English Labour Network. A recent Institute for Public Policy Research speech by the maverick shadow cabinet member Jon Trickett was another important recognition of the need for a political conversation to develop on the left that includes, not ignores, England. England is not going to go away. And the current English mood is a challenge to every aspect of the progressive tradition. As the BBC/YouGov survey shows, England is not just a place with a real sense of identity. It is also a pessimistic place. Most people in the survey think England was better in the past. The pessimism is widely shared across all parts of England. Only one in six people in England think the country’s best years lie ahead of it. But this pessimism is not something that need embarrass the progressive traditions in politics. There isn’t much sign of a harking back to whiteness or for the empire. It’s about feeling that the country is incredibly beautiful, has a rich history, and is witty and polite. But the country also used to make things, used to matter more, used to be more caring and connected. The England that cries out from this survey is not at ease, is disempowered, is disconnected from Westminster and insufficiently able to shape its own future at local, never mind national, level. English identity is a cultural issue that requires more than just a constitutional answer. Nevertheless, England is the largest nation in Europe without its own parliament and it has become difficult to argue against one, with powers similar to those in the rest of the UK. An English parliament would force the progressive wing of politics to engage seriously with England’s mood and England’s needs. Compared with an English parliament, combined or regional authorities just don’t cut it. And what is the alternative? If the progressive tradition in British politics cannot find ways of listening to, connecting with and speaking for England, its sense of itself and its sense of place, it risks not just electoral failure but the loss of a much larger argument. To cede the politics of England to the right is to ensure that it is the right that speaks for England. That is what is happening. Yet it does not have to be this way. Bear that in mind as you watch Harry Kane and his team. • Martin Kettle is a Guardian staff columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"fashion/2018/jun/06/kate-spade-obituary","type":"article","sectionId":"fashion","sectionName":"Fashion","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-06T16:19:11Z","webTitle":"Kate Spade obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2018/jun/06/kate-spade-obituary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/fashion/2018/jun/06/kate-spade-obituary","fields":{"headline":"Kate Spade obituary","bodyText":"In a fashion fan’s mind, the name Kate Spade immediately transforms into “kate spade”, spelled out in New Baskerville typeface, underscored by “NEW YORK” and surmounted by a nifty little deck-of-cards ace. That was the logo on the labels inside her first handbags, which were so free of surface detail, without plaques, grommets or zips, that they looked almost too austere; so, before launching them at a 1993 trade show, she stayed up all night hand-sewing the labels on to their outsides. From those bags, put together without a business plan or bank loans, there emerged an extraordinarily successful brand. The designer, who has taken her own life at the age of 55, was at the time of sewing Katy Brosnahan; she did not marry her partner, Andy Spade, until the following year, when the firm had coalesced enough to rent a rat-infested office in Tribeca, New York – they wed on the premises. She created, he marketed, and their approach was all-American: make what you want but can’t find; keep it simple – the initial bags, especially a definitive black nylon specimen, were as stripped-down and functional as a Jeep; have fun with novelty, but never let it get dumb. It mattered to her apparently carefree identity that her family was Irish; Katherine Noel, born on Christmas Eve in Kansas City, Missouri, was the fifth of six children of Earl Francis Brosna- han, who was in the construction business, and June Mullen, once a flight attendant on Braniff Air- way’s glamorous Caribbean-South American routes. June’s in-flight uniform of up-do, sharp-shaped shoes and box bags permanently influenced her daughter’s taste. Not that the girl wanted a fashion career; she studied journalism at the University of Kansas, then Arizona State University, where she met Andy as they worked at college jobs in a Phoenix store. She fetched up in Manhattan after a post-college trip to Europe, down to her last seven dollars and sleeping on a friend’s couch. A temp firm matched her to a gofer vacancy on the Condé Nast magazine Mademoiselle, where she rose over five years to be senior fashion editor, specialising in accessories. (Andy joined her in New York as a copywriter for an ad agency.) She grew exasperated with the bags available – high-end luxury; big designers heavy on the logo; chic if ditsy boutique lines – and returned to an idea from her college years, to create her own. Slowly and secretively, drawing on Andy’s savings and their credit cards, she developed that idea through prototypes mocked up with paper and sticky tape. They both sourced raw materials, including hessian from a potato-sack maker; auditioned Brooklyn machinists to make up the samples; and, when the department stores Saks Fifth Avenue and Neiman Marcus upped their orders from 1,000 to more than 20,000 items in 1995, found and nursed American factories into urgent delivery. Fashion in the 1990s was not often locally supplied, with small production runs, short turnaround times and the designer in total control. But that is how the Spades did it and it worked; customers responded to the practical, classless bags with unexpected affection. A Kate Spade shop opened in SoHo, Manhattan, in 1996, and the couple traded up to rodent-free offices. By 1999, the label had such wide appeal that Neiman Marcus bought 56% of the firm, encouraging its expansion into stationery, shoes, clothes, household goods and lifestyle books. Spade’s book Contents (2000), on what lurks within bags, is sound social as well as visual history. The shop grew into an international chain. Andy devised its advertisements, with accessories as set-dressing for an agreeable, often familial, life; the Spades were their own best ads. (And the bags achieved their proper place in the Cooper Hewitt design museum in New York.) In 2006, Neiman Marcus sold the company on to Liz Claiborne, ending the Spades’ considerable control over decisions, and in 2007 the couple sold their 44% to Claiborne, too, and walked away, leaving Kate Spade with no rights to “kate spade”. Andy applied his skills to other American brands; Kate withdrew into domesticity, raising their daughter, Frances Beatrix, born in 2005, and chairing the board of the New York Center for Children. When she returned to work in 2016, she concocted a fresh brand, Frances (after her daughter) Valentine (after her grandfather), legally adopting it as her own name: “I am the designer formerly known as Kate Spade. I am Kate Valentine.” The approach was again cautious and self-funded, though the Spades started this time with shoes and sold them online, with limited retail exposure. Only a few longtime collaborators were on the payroll and neither Spade wanted to repeat their old runaway success. They wanted just the satisfaction of making. Andy and Frances survive her. • Kate Spade, designer, born 24 December 1962; died 5 June 2018"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"music/2018/jun/07/readers-recommend-playlist-songs-about-volume","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-07T11:00:40Z","webTitle":"Readers recommend playlist: songs about volume","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/jun/07/readers-recommend-playlist-songs-about-volume","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/jun/07/readers-recommend-playlist-songs-about-volume","fields":{"headline":"Readers recommend playlist: songs about volume","bodyText":"Here is this week’s playlist – songs picked by a reader from hundreds of your suggestions last week.

A more nuanced approach now, with a rockabilly number that neatly encapsulates the physical effects of experiencing a live performance featuring proper amplification: “Those big bass notes / Thunder in my chest / Mmm, stuck in my throat / Pulling me down” At least I think that’s what it’s all about. You’d possibly need to ask Imelda May whether I’ve got hold of the wrong end of the stick with Johnny’s Got a Boom Boom. There were a number of nominations proposing that excessive volume was an effective means of annoying one’s neighbours. Some indicated a guilty conscience on the part of former members of garage bands who experienced the domestic friction home rehearsals can cause, but overall the song that nailed the subject was one by the Toy Dolls that roundly rejected any feelings of remorse. Sod the Neighbours, they exclaim – quickly and distortedly. Lateral thinking was also much in evidence in your recommendations, and my “less obvious” section kicks off with One Man Guy by Loudon Wainwright III. I don’t know if the song is an affirmation of self-reliance, an acknowledgement of isolation or something else entirely, but the lines “These three cubic feet / Of bone and blood and meat / Are what I love and know” could have been written just for the topic, so it makes the cut. Liquid-specific volumes next. There were excellent proposals for songs mentioning spoonfuls; various gallon-sized containers; big hats; and even bushels and pecks. For its comprehensive approach, however, I couldn’t see past the Irish Rovers, who cram references to barrels, half-barrels, gallons, half-gallons, pints, half-pints, gills, half-gills, quarter-gills, and nipperkins into The Barley Mow. Another perspective from the Church: “They have pages / They take ages / To read and to learn / They’re heavy to carry.” Volumes. Succinct and very much on message. Tom Waits, meanwhile, in Step Right Up, has a lengthy list of items that he’s looking to sell, at what appear to be bulk discount rates: “How do we do it? / How do we do it?/ Volume, volume, turn up the volume.” That’s a line virtually echoed by Van Morrison in Caravan, albeit with a more traditional interpretation given that he is exhorting the turning up of the radio. Or “rah-dio” to be more accurate. Reader dave56 nominated the song, but a mention in dispatches goes to hiddendepths, who provided the link to what is indeed a “stonking live version from The Last Waltz”. Most of the songs put forward had the volume on an upward course, but occasionally a different approach is required, particularly if, like Jim Reeves, you’re intent on a quiet telephone conversation with your beloved. In that case (a) the jukebox has to be turned way down low, and (b) the third wheel in the relationship has to be warned off: He’ll Have to Go. There’s really only one place for the noise level to go after that, which inevitably results in the Sound of Silence. Reaction to this cover version by Disturbed may vary, but by the time singer David Draiman gets to people bowing and praying he’s imbuing a song on the subject of silence with remarkable raw power and volume. And if that’s your preferred listening mode then Warren Zevon’s ironic/scathing/cynical take on the Southern lifestyle choice in Play It All Night Long might also find favour: “Sweet Home Alabama / Play that dead band’s song / Turn that music up full blast / Play it all night long.” Approaching the final selection and reviewing things thus far, I notice with some consternation that it’s populated almost entirely by male artists. Maybe the topic lends itself to folk that insist on being heard of course, but it didn’t feel right to leave things quite so unbalanced. Accordingly we finish with a celebratory anthem which significantly increases the volume of female representation – even if not by artist – on this week’s list. It’s AC/DC and Whole Lotta Rosie.

Yet though there are some interesting genre flourishes, and a set piece involving a gorgeous, shadowy gothic mansion, this overlong instalment is merely serviceable. The volcanic, dinosaur-inhabited island of Isla Nublar is about to erupt, and so Bryce Dallas Howard’s Claire Dearing (in combat boots rather than heels this time) and animal behavioural expert Owen Grady (Chris Pratt) have been flown in by Benjamin Lockwood’s estate to help transport the dinosaurs to safety, helped along by a sweaty, jittering coder named Franklin (The Get Down’s Justice Smith, playing the underdog with tongue-in-cheek relish) and a tough-talking palaeoveterinarian named Zia Rodriguez (Daniella Pineda). Predictably, some people in on the plan have other designs for the dinos and so the rescue mission becomes a collection of increasingly tense, video game-like scenarios. The film ends up being a bludgeoning political satire that queries the ethical implications and economic advantages of poaching genetically engineered animals, be it for biopharmaceutical weaponry, corporate seed money or to keep as collector’s items. There’s also an embarrassing coda about how we’re “causing our own extinction by way of avarice and political megalomania”. It shouldn’t be a bad thing that Claire, Zia and Maisie, Lockwood’s spunky granddaughter (Isabella Sermon), are signposted as the bravest characters with the most agency, yet the film’s overt girl-power politics date it. A close-up of Claire’s high heels, followed by one of her combat boots and a scene that sees Zia called a “nasty woman”, grasp at cultural relevance but end up too on the nose. The foreign villains – a Chinese geneticist and a Russian oligarch – are further causes for eye-rolling."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2018/jun/07/argentina-museum-egomaniacs-imf-marcos-pena","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-07T09:00:38Z","webTitle":"Argentina is 'a museum of egomaniacs' says official as country appeals to IMF","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/07/argentina-museum-egomaniacs-imf-marcos-pena","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/07/argentina-museum-egomaniacs-imf-marcos-pena","fields":{"headline":"Argentina is 'a museum of egomaniacs' says official as country appeals to IMF","bodyText":"Argentina “is a museum of egomaniacs who said they were saviours of the country and failed one by one” the country’s cabinet chief said on a visit to London, as he insisted that his government’s appeal to the IMF to fend off a currency crisis will not affect the country’s growth. Marcos Peña said the centre-right government of Mauricio Macri will reach a deal with the IMF that will accelerate existing plans to cut the fiscal deficit next year. But Macri is facing growing discontent at home after failing to deliver on his campaign promise to kickstart the economy with massive foreign investments, and observers wonder if his administration might not eventually end up on Argentina’s roll call of failed saviours. Macri’s government has been praised internationally for its efforts to stabilise Argentina’s economy but has faced widespread protests at home over its austerity policies. Meanwhile, huge home utility hikes are wearing the patience of Argentina’s middle class thin and have made a mockery of his campaign promise of “zero poverty”. Amid soaring interest rates and inflation – and a 20% fall in the peso – Macri was last month forced to go to the IMF to obtain a $30bn credit facility. Market turbulence across a range of emerging economies was largely prompted by investors’ flight to the dollar in anticipation of high US interest rates. Peña said the shock underlined the degree to which the Argentinian economy is exposed to external events. He said: “That exposure is a rule for everyone today, but we are very conscious of vulnerability to external events. We are living in an accelerated time of globalisation. We think it is going to be exponential in the next decades, but we are positive about that. “No one can guarantee stability at a time of such deep change. As a country we have a PhD in volatility. We have now got to get a PhD in institution building and relying on our own strengths.” Although the IMF is deeply unpopular in Argentina – where it played a central role in the 2001 financial collapse after insisting on harsh austerity measures – Peña said the current return to the Fund was not comparable since “there is a synchronisation” about how to address Argentina’s problems – including the need to cut the fiscal deficit faster than planned next year. Peña said that any bailout package will be compatible with growth and poverty reduction targets. He said: “We do not intend for one second to blame our problems on the IMF or anyone else, if what is proposed is good for our economy.” Peña added the government would meet its fiscal deficit target of 2.7% of GDP this year, down from 3.2%. But he denied the turn to the IMF was unpopular, saying only an ideological minority opposed what was a preventive measure. Neverthless observers now forecast tougher than expected elections in October next year. Large anti-IMF protests in Buenos Aires last month, and political resistance to cuts in energy subsidies, could be harbingers of future trouble. But Peña said one of Macri’s main tasks was to normalise a country after too much turbulence and volatility, claiming that the administration was putting an end to a culture of power that depended on saviour figures and populism. Peña was in London to meet British cabinet ministers, evaluate the chances of a bilateral Mercosur-UK trade deal after Brexit, and set out Argentina’s agenda for the G20 summit in Buenos Aires in November. Peña, who also laid a wreath in honour of all the soldiers who fell in the Falklands conflict, said that differences over the islands need not sour relations and trade between the two countries."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2018/jun/06/bulletproof-backpacks-school-present-students-graduation","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-06T17:38:15Z","webTitle":"Middle schoolers given bulletproof shields for starting high school","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jun/06/bulletproof-backpacks-school-present-students-graduation","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/jun/06/bulletproof-backpacks-school-present-students-graduation","fields":{"headline":"Middle schoolers given bulletproof shields for starting high school","bodyText":"Students at a school in Pennsylvania have received a bulletproof backplate for their backpacks as a gift for graduating eighth grade. The ballistic shields were donated by a local company and given to students at St Cornelius school in Chadds Ford, Pennsylvania, as a leaving present before high school. The manufacturer, Unequal, claims on its website that the shield is “kid friendly” and allows you to “be prepared” when “terror strikes”. The shield retails at $149 (although when the Guardian checked, the site was offering 10% off for people using the somewhat tasteless discount code “battle ready”). In footage of the gifting ceremony, children were left speechless by the sombre tone of the gift. The president of Unequal was also invited to speak, telling students “it’s sad that times have called for such a product to be invented, but we have answered such a call”. It comes at a time when sales of bulletproof backpacks, and other products that claim to provide protection during a school shooting, are booming. Manufacturers of the Bullet Blocker backpack, for example, say they saw a 300% increase since the Parkland shooting. Sales of school security equipment reached $2.7bn last year and technology analytics firm IHS expect that to increase this year. Other products on the market include door barricade systems, software that scans social media for the threat of an attack and “active shooter kits”, which claim to offer “the essential items needed to administer first aid prior to the arrival of Fire or EMS personnel”. Students at some schools, including at Majory Stoneman Douglas high school in Parkland, are now only allowed to wear clear backpacks. These products are marketed by private companies and often play on parents’ and students’ fears. But those fears are considerable: a Pew poll in April found that 57% of American teenagers and 63% of American parents say they are either somewhat or very worried about the possibility of a school shooting happening in their school. Fear of shootings was also considerably higher among poorer and non-white students. Some parents are going as far as to remove the children from school entirely. Tim Lambert, president at the Texas Home School Coalition told the Washington Times that they number of calls they receive has doubled in the past few moths, from 600 to around 1,400. At a time of heightened anxiety, the one measure that does not seem to be discussed is gun control. Yesterday, Betsy DeVos said that the new school shooting safety panel created in the wake of Parkland will not consider any gun control measures, or even study the role of guns in school safety. When asked if the commission would be looking at the role of firearms, the education secretary answered “that is not part of the commission’s charge, per se”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/jun/16/mum-and-dad-had-never-been-happy-then-moved-mistress-in","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-16T05:00:36Z","webTitle":"‘Mum and Dad had never been happy.

Then he moved his mistress in’","bodyText":"It was 1968 and we sat in the car outside my grandparents’ house in West Norwood, London. My father and his mistress in front, my mother and I in the back. We were there to pick up or drop something off. My father turned to me, aged seven, and said forcefully, “If your nan or grandpa ask, Alison is your teacher and she is staying with us while she finds somewhere to live.” He’d told me, when she had come to live with us earlier in the year, that she was the housekeeper. She was 19 – 13 years younger than my father – and I’d never seen her do any housework. And I knew she wasn’t my teacher. I looked to my mother for explanation but she was turned away from me, gazing out of the window as if this were all perfectly normal, ignoring what was going on around her. My parents had not been happy for as long as I could remember. I was an only child, born in south London in 1961. By the mid-60s, we lived in Croydon and my father was a bank clerk, ambitious to escape his working-class roots. My mother worked part-time in a local factory, my grandparents helping out with me as and when needed. It was not a peaceful home. My father was quick to raise his voice if he came in from work and his tea was late or everything wasn’t just so. There was always tension in the air, with both my mother and I tiptoeing around him. He never struck me, and possibly not my mother, but he was always full of suppressed anger, with the sense that he could blow at any moment. Alison appeared, staying weekends at first, from some time in 1967. They’d met at work. I didn’t realise what was happening, the only difference for me being that I had to move out of my bedroom so she could sleep there. I lay wedged between my mother and father in their double bed on Friday and Saturday nights. My parents sleeping in the same bed at this time must have been for appearances’ sake. I vividly remember my mother going to kiss my father goodbye on the cheek one morning as she left for work. He pulled away so violently that I thought he was going to hit her. He was big on appearances, my father. He was always smart, with slicked hair and a collar and tie. He expected us to be perfect, polite and respectful to him, and well turned out so we didn’t let him down. He worked for the Midland Bank and was going to be a manager some time soon – an important role in the community in those days. By late 1968, we had moved across Surrey from Croydon to leafy Woodham – my father, Alison, my mother and I – as if we were one big happy family. He became an assistant bank manager in nearby Weybridge. My mother and Alison both had jobs and I spent my time after school and during holidays with a local family, paid to look after me. The year that followed was disturbing. My mother slept in a double bed in one bedroom. My father and I had twin beds in another. Alison was in the third bedroom. Appearances’ sake again – I never recall my father coming to bed or being there when I woke. Our family, such as it was, had never known love, words of affection or hugs, and it became a horror show as the months went by. My father and Alison were on one side, my mother and I on the other. No one seemed to speak, other than my father shouting at my mother over something or nothing, whenever she irritated or annoyed him, which was most of the time. I recall my mother and I playing a board game on the floor in the hall, the living room door shut so we could not “make a mess” in there. My mother and Alison never spoke – messages about washing and other humdrum matters were passed through me on little slips of paper. Starved of affection, I developed a mix of tics and facial grimaces and a need to be loved by someone, anyone. At school, there were two dinner ladies who watched over the children in the playground at break times. One would allow smaller children to walk either side of her underneath her large cloak. I was so desperate to do that, to have her arm around me, to be inside that cloak. One day, I plucked up the courage to ask if I could join in. “No, you’re too big.” Towards the end of 1969, my mother left. At eight years old, I did not understand how she could, but she was bullied into submission by my father. The only visible emotion I saw was when she came back to visit me. This was before a court ruled I was to spend weekdays with my father and weekends with my mother. I do not recall what happened during the visit, but I do remember walking with her afterwards to see her off on the bus at the top of the road. We waited silently, next to two chatty girls who were there to meet someone. As the bus came into sight, my mother started crying, saying to the girls that I was not old enough to cross back over the road on my own. They saw my tearful mother on to the bus – she barely turned and looked at me – before taking me across the road. At the time, I was indignant: “I can cross the road on my own!” Now I see more meaning in those tears as my mother watched me walk to my father’s and Alison’s house. As we moved into the 1970s, with my parents now divorced, I spent weekdays with my father and Alison in their big detached house in Woodham and weekends with my mother in her rundown flat, eight miles away. In those days, divorce laws favoured men and my mother left the marriage with little more than the clothes she was wearing. My father’s home was a cold place. I was expected to be quiet and polite to Alison. I had to kiss her goodnight, but only on her hand, which she held out imperiously night after night. They never had children and I was clearly not wanted there. They had married by this time, too – though I was not invited to the wedding or told about it. I only found out years later when I saw Alison’s cheque book with the name “Maitland” in it. I much preferred being with my mother, never knowing until much later how she went without food and heating in the week to look after me at the weekend. These were happier times and we would go the park, walk along the river and sometimes stay at my grandparents’. She would buy cream soda and sweets, and we sat eating and drinking and watching Doctor Who. My mother met Alf at work and they moved in together, a relationship that seemed to enrage my father. One night, coming back with my mother and Alf, I found all my belongings in black bin bags on the doorstep, dumped by my father, who wanted me out. But Alf didn’t want me, either, and sent me back. Years later, Alf died of cancer, and I moved in with my mother; I never saw my father or Alison again. I’m told my father died of pancreatic cancer, a legacy of smoking 40 cigarettes a day, aged 64 in 2000. I don’t know if he had a happy life; I suspect not. If I’m honest, I hope he didn’t. He made ours a misery for many years. I have no idea what happened to Alison. My mother found happiness, marrying Alf’s best friend Tony and helping him raise two sons before they retired to the Sussex coast. She saw me find love, too, before she died. I have been married for 36 years, and have three children – the happy family life that my mother and I never had all those years ago.

Twickenham Studios – famous for award-winning films such as Blade Runner and The Italian Job as well as more recent TV hits Three Girls, McMafia and Black Mirror – has agreed to take 8,000 sq metres space in the enormous art deco Littlewoods building, which was once home to the football pools. The £50m project is being overseen by regeneration specialists Capital &amp; Centric, who bought the 17,000-sq metre site in 2017. Completed in 1938, the complex began life as the headquarters of Littlewoods, then the country’s largest family-owned business empire, covering department chain stores, catalogue shopping, and football pools. It was requisitioned just a year after it opened, becoming the wartime home of the government’s postal censorship department, its vast printing presses used to print 17 million National Registration cards. Littlewoods took it back in peacetime, but the last occupants moved out in the 90s and the building has been empty ever since. Capital &amp; Centric plans to build two 2,000-sq metre sound stages for Twickenham studios next to the main building. Liverpool council wants to turn the city into a film making Mecca and last year bought the old bus station next to the Littlewoods building to develop for the industry, with mayor Joe Anderson describing the purchase as “a major statement of intent to cement our reputation as the Hollywood of the North”. Liverpool is becoming ever more popular with TV and film producers. In recent years blockbusters such as Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them and Film Stars Don’t Die in Liverpool have been filmed in the city, as well as TV shows such as Peaky Blinders. Last year alone, the city clocked up 1,359 days of filming across 289 projects. Tim Heatley, co-founder of Capital &amp; Centric, said: “Littlewoods is one of Liverpool’s most loved buildings – it’s only fitting that we give the city something they’ll be proud of. Twickenham Studios couldn’t be a better fit. They’ll bring a century’s worth of film-making heritage and help to write a new chapter for the creative industries in and around Liverpool.” Maria Walker, chief operating officer of Twickenham Studios, said: “Liverpool’s architecture, accessibility and can-do attitude sees film-makers return to the city time and time again. With the added benefit of our studios, they’ll have access to gold-standard interior facilities right on the doorstep of unique exterior locations. It will be great to see Liverpool become an international focal point for TV and film.” The announcement comes just a week after Liverpool made the shortlist of cities to become the new home to Channel 4’s regional base – with Littlewoods a core part of the city’s bid. • This article was amended on 8 June 2018 because an earlier version was wrong to say that sound stages for Twickenham studios were being built on the site of an old bus station."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2018/jun/08/lykke-li-so-sad-so-sexy-review","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-08T09:00:07Z","webTitle":"Lykke Li: So Sad So Sexy review – despair you can dance to","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/jun/08/lykke-li-so-sad-so-sexy-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/jun/08/lykke-li-so-sad-so-sexy-review","fields":{"headline":"Lykke Li: So Sad So Sexy review – despair you can dance to","bodyText":"From the post-adolescent ennui of Lorde’s Melodrama to the Weeknd’s My Dear Melancholy EP and Drake naming his latest single I’m Upset, lugubrious pop is all around. Indeed, a recent study found that the genre has become sadder over the past 30 years, a kind of Adele-ification process, if you will. Despite this, it’s also “more danceable” and “party-like”, which may explain why the latest album from Sweden’s sad-pop champion Lykke Li has the power to trigger both shape-cutting and existential crises. So Sad So Sexy marks Li’s return to music after having a baby, losing her mother and experiencing a creative dry spell, and is defined by overt, intoxicating emotion in lieu of her more quaint, contained sadness of old. From opener Hard Rain, whose polyphonic R&amp;B swagger jars with its message of lovers needing to be put “back together / though we never been apart”, all the way to closing track Utopia – released on Mother’s Day – and its touching, if simple, chorus of “we could be utopia, utopia”, a sense of bittersweet happiness and streamlined sadness flows through its 10 tracks. At times it’s a hard sell; Deep End’s water noises and lines like “bae, you burned me” could feel naff, if not for the rawness in Li’s voice, while Last Piece’s pared-back drum machine and synth haze staggers between vulnerable and understated. But when this juxtaposition works – as on the title track, a worthy entry to the sad pop canon – the effect is sad, sexy and enthralling."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"technology/2018/jun/06/amazon-committed-to-post-brexit-britain-plans-2700-new-jobs","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-06T16:20:26Z","webTitle":"Amazon committed to post-Brexit Britain and plans 2,500 new jobs","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/jun/06/amazon-committed-to-post-brexit-britain-plans-2700-new-jobs","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2018/jun/06/amazon-committed-to-post-brexit-britain-plans-2700-new-jobs","fields":{"headline":"Amazon committed to post-Brexit Britain and plans 2,500 new jobs","bodyText":"Amazon is to create more than 2,500 jobs in the UK this year, including 650 head office roles, as the online retailer says it remains committed to expanding in Brexit Britain.

But the disclosure is likely to raise further questions about the extent and nature of Assange’s alleged ties to Russia. US intelligence agencies concluded with “high confidence” last year, in an unclassified intelligence assessment, that the Kremlin shared hacked emails with WikiLeaks that undermined Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign as part of its effort to sway the 2016 election in favour of Donald Trump. Waldman is a lawyer and consultant in Washington and Deripaska’s primary lobbyist. He also represents other clients including Hollywood stars. Last year Deripaska paid Waldman about $562,000. According to filings to the Department of Justice (DoJ) by Waldman’s firm, the Endeavor Group, his work for Deripaska focused on advising the oligarch’s company UC Rusal on legal issues. When Deripaska first hired him, in 2009, Waldman’s firm was on a $40,000-per-month retainer. The Russian magnate was having problems obtaining a visa because of alleged connections to organised crime, which Deripaska denies. Waldman lobbied the US government to get Deripaska a visa. Waldman also served as a counsel for Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov. A 2010 DoJ filing showed that the Endeavor Group was hired by Lavrov to help ease the “persistent state of limbo” that Deripaska faced as a result of his being refused entry into the US. In a letter to Waldman, Lavrov hailed Deripaska as one of Russia’s “prominent business leaders”. Waldman declined to answer questions from the Guardian about his meetings with Assange or whether they were connected to the Russian billionaire. Waldman has not registered himself as a lobbyist for the WikiLeaks founder. A report last year by Fox News, which obtained leaked text messages between Waldman and the US senator Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate intelligence committee, suggested Waldman tried to broker a deal between Assange and the DoJ and that the negotiations were fruitless. It is not clear whether Waldman was brokering the deal on Assange’s behalf or someone else’s. One text sent by Waldman in April 2017 said: “I convinced him [Assange] to make serious and important concessions and am discussing those [with] DoJ.” The logs, obtained by the Guardian and Focus Ecuador, reveal details of Assange’s life inside the Ecuadorian embassy, where he has been staying since June 2012. Waldman allegedly visited Assange twice on 12 and 13 January 2017, days before Trump’s inauguration as president, and again immediately after the ceremony, on 27 January. The Guardian has separately corroborated that Waldman was in London in late March, when he saw Assange twice more. He visited the embassy three times in April and made two more visits at the end of November 2017. Deripaska is a key person in the investigation by the special counsel Robert Mueller into alleged collusion between the Trump campaign and Moscow. According to the Associated Press, Trump’s future campaign manager Paul Manafort began work for Deripaska in 2005 and pitched a plan that would “greatly benefit [Vladimir] Putin’s government.” In 2006 Manafort signed a $10m annual contract with Deripaska, a close ally of Russia’s president. In summer 2016, when he was Trump’s campaign chief, Manafort offered Deripaska a confidential briefing, emails turned over to Congress and Mueller show. The briefing never happened, Manafort says. Deripaska was filmed soon afterwards on his luxury yacht discussing the forthcoming US election with Russia’s deputy prime minister, Sergei Prikhodko. Deripaska was subjected to more US sanctions in April. They were imposed on close associates of Putin’s in retaliation for alleged Kremlin meddling in the US vote. Meanwhile, Manafort faces multiple charges of money laundering arising from his work in Ukraine, and accusations of tampering with potential witnesses. He denies all charges. His bail was revoked last week and he is now awaiting trial in prison. Waldman’s relationship with Deripaska goes beyond consultancy. According to filings, in 2008 he travelled to Moscow, Amsterdam and Siberia with the oligarch for the purpose of “friendship”. In 2015 Waldman and his German second wife, Barbara Sturm, posed for photos with Deripaska at Munich’s Oktoberfest. Sturm, a dermatologist and beauty expert, has a major business presence in Russia. In April Waldman placed an article by Deripaska with the conservative Daily Caller news website, sources say. The oligarch called allegations of collusion “invented” and said he and the Russian government were victims of a “deep state” Washington plot. Waldman has cultivated connections with senior Democratic politicians and spent summers with many of them in Martha’s Vineyard. According to filings, Deripaska has paid Waldman via a series of offshore firms, with cash routed via shell companies in the British Virgin Islands, Belize and Jersey. At least one of Deripaska’s companies, Sea Chaika Corporation, appears in the Panama Papers. In 2010 it transferred at least $85,000 to Waldman’s accounts. Sea Chaika is connected to anonymous firms registered in Cyprus. Deripaska and UC Rusal did not comment. Assange has denied the hacked Democratic party emails released by WikiLeaks in 2016 came from Moscow. Last month Lenín Moreno, the president of Ecuador, said Assange could continue to live in the embassy as long as he complied with the conditions of his stay and avoided voicing political opinions on Twitter. In March, Moreno restricted Assange’s visitors, cut his internet access and shelved a $5m (£3.7m) secret spy operation to protect him, called “Operation Hotel”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/jun/06/spycop-ex-wives-we-support-the-lush-campaign","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-06T17:11:09Z","webTitle":"‘Spycop’ ex-wives: we support the Lush campaign | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jun/06/spycop-ex-wives-we-support-the-lush-campaign","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/jun/06/spycop-ex-wives-we-support-the-lush-campaign","fields":{"headline":"‘Spycop’ ex-wives: we support the Lush campaign","bodyText":"We are ex-wives of undercover police officers who had relationships with other women without our knowledge, while we were married with families, and write with regard to the Lush campaign and reaction to it (Report, 5 June). We trusted our husbands (and their managers) and now feel betrayed. Although we have been recognised as core participants in the undercover policing inquiry, our voices have yet to be heard in public or within the public inquiry. When she was home secretary, Theresa May set up a public inquiry to investigate undercover policing and the related concerns of significant malpractice. It was due to report back within three years. Three years on, the inquiry has yet to hear any evidence, including our own. Although the events in question took place many years ago, they continue to have a profound effect, and we are still waiting for the officers concerned (as well as their chain of command) to give an account in public. These officers, together with the Metropolitan police, have spent a significant part of the last three years seeking both anonymity and continuing secrecy as to their conduct within the inquiry. While this process continues and the evidence stage is further delayed, our view is that the amount of public money spent to date for such little progress is of far greater concern than the Lush campaign. In bringing this issue to the attention of the general public, Lush has achieved far more in a weekend than the inquiry has in three years. Its campaign has not only drawn attention to the plight of some of the victims, but has also brought into focus legitimate concerns about how the inquiry is proceeding, which we also share. We would like supporters of the police who are criticising Lush to be aware that we, as affected police ex-wives, endorse the points that Lush are now publicising. Although we are not involved in the Lush campaign, we recognise that it draws attention to legitimate concerns about how the inquiry is proceeding. Lush’s campaign is not an attack on hard-working police officers and we ask critics of the campaign to hold an open mind, look into the facts of this issue (which relate to a specific unit of undercover officers only – see uk.lush.com/article/spycops-statement) and to note that the families of undercover officers are also victims of this scandal.

EU officials have rubbished as “unfounded” claims made by Jan Wörner, the ESA’s director general, that a restructuring of arrangements would “take decades and cost billions”. The European commission had proposed on Wednesday that the EU make a large rise in investment in its space programmes from €12bn over the last seven years to €16bn for 2021 to 2027. However officials argued that in order to maximise efficient spending of EU taxpayer’s money, and the “autonomy” of the bloc’s space strategy, the European Global Navigation Satellite System Agency in Prague – responsible for the Galileo and other satellite programmes – would be rebadged to become the EU Agency for the Space Programme. The ESA, which is independent from Brussels and has as members the non-EU states Norway and Switzerland, would “remain a major partner in the technical and operational implementation of the EU space programme” but the newly named EU agency would increasingly make key decisions. The UK is seeking a continued role in shaping EU space programmes, and in particular it wants full access and privileges in relation to Galileo, the £8bn satellite navigation system intended to rival the US-controlled Global Positioning System. It has been suggested that UK ministers may use their seat on the ESA’s space council to slow down procurement for the satellite programme should the EU continue to argue that the country has to give up its central role when it leaves the bloc. Wörner had suggested there could be ways to protect the EU’s autonomy within the ESA, to allow all the partners to work together seamlessly, but that effectively creating a duplicate body would be to the detriment to all of Europe. He wrote: “Let us think European, I mean really European. Astronauts always report that they do not see any national borders in Europe. In that sense we should work for United Space in Europe and for the other way around, namely for United Europe in Space … “Europe, this is to say at least the EU, ESA and their respective member states together, must join forces … “There is no need to develop a new Space Agency in parallel in Europe, the ramp-up of which would take decades and cost billions and would therefore in itself be a major risk to the programmes it manages. We need to streamline, not double administrative layers.” Senior EU officials insisted that the European commission was not engaged in a “power grab”, and that Wörner’s comments had been made before he saw the published proposal. The row between the EU and the UK has been particularly vicious with British ministers threatening to take back past financial contributions to the bloc’s space programme. EU officials have responded by saying that the UK is “chasing a fantasy” and that it will not “negotiate under threat”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jun/06/labour-brexit-plan-remainers-leavers-norway-model-customs-model-eu","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-06T14:15:03Z","webTitle":"Why Labour’s bespoke Brexit plan will work | Tom Kibasi","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/06/labour-brexit-plan-remainers-leavers-norway-model-customs-model-eu","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/06/labour-brexit-plan-remainers-leavers-norway-model-customs-model-eu","fields":{"headline":"Why Labour’s bespoke Brexit plan will work","bodyText":"For Britain’s future prosperity, it is vital that close economic cooperation with our European partners is secured and sustained. Nearly half of the UK’s international trade is with the other EU member states, and our place in the EU single market is at the centre of the UK investment case. Departing from single-market regulations simply means more complexity for business, not more competitiveness; there is no evidence whatsoever that the agility of an independent trade policy trumps the benefits of scale in trade negotiations. That’s why it is important for Britain to stay aligned with the single market and to form a new and comprehensive customs union. Brexit is a political departure but it does not need to be an economic rupture. The question is how these goals can be achieved while respecting the referendum result. Compromise is inevitable. Labour’s shift in Brexit policy appears to reflect this understanding, and is a better approach than remaining in the European Economic Area (EEA), the approach known as the Norway option. Here’s why. Advocates of Britain rejoining the EEA argue that time is running out, so we must take an “off-the-shelf” model. In the spirit of best is the enemy of good enough, is the EEA good enough for Britain? The short answer is no. Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein must implement single-market regulations; and the four freedoms – goods, services, people and capital – apply just as they do to EU member states. The EEA states participate in committees to influence draft legislation, but they are not members of the single market’s decision-making structures. They have influence, but little leverage and no formal power. EEA membership would mean Britain would have little option but to adopt regulations that it had no role in deciding. There would be no requirement to take into account British interests or objections. It would be democratically intolerable for a government to systematically implement decisions over which it had no say. And joining the EEA would substitute one European court for another. If Britain were to join, there would be a very real risk of a double-Brexit: leaving the EU and later crashing out of the EEA. It would allow exploitative politicians on the populist right and left – and opportunist politicians in the centre – to continue to attribute Britain’s very real but self-authored problems to others and not to ourselves. The great deceit of British politics for the past 40 years has been passing off unpopular choices made in Westminster as instructions received from Brussels. EEA membership would allow that cowards’ game to continue, and resentment to build, nourishing a narrative of betrayal. It is also a moot point. The EEA is not on the table in the Brexit negotiations because, while EEA members are bound to adopt single-market regulations, there are no consequences for failing to do so. For EU negotiators, this is a loophole so large that the world’s fifth largest economy could be driven through it. Moreover, they see it as a functioning agreement that they have no appetite to disrupt. The EU is not insisting on the EEA, so why promote an off-the-shelf model when a bespoke one could be negotiated? The past two years should have been dedicated to building a new British partnership with the EU, a compromise that keeps us economically close while respecting the referendum result. Even now, Michel Barnier has said that the EU would be open to further negotiation during the transition, and indeed to a more comprehensive renegotiation, should there be either a change of prime minister or a change of government open to it. It makes sense for the UK to seek a model that better reflects its priorities, in particular a clear and feasible option to diverge if future rules are introduced that run counter to our interests. Last December, we at IPPR proposed building what we call a “shared market”, based on regulatory alignment between the UK and the EU single market, and a new and comprehensive customs union, underpinned by a new, independent UK court of justice and UK supervision authority. The proposal has gathered interest from Brussels and other European capitals. It would solve the Irish border problem, too. It would aim for Britain to stay in alignment but allow for the possibility of divergence over time, with a “declaration of incompatibility” that would give either side six months to bring regulation into alignment again. If they chose not to, then there would be proportionate consequences. Britain could choose to pursue a different path, not in the costless fantasy of the extreme Brexiters, but rather fully cognisant of the consequences. Some aspects of single-market regulation could be more fixed than others. For example, workers’ rights and environmental protections could be subject to “non-regression” clauses that would protect British workers and assuage the concerns, particularly in Scandinavia, that the UK would undercut standards. Allowing for the possibility of divergence would make it clear that Britain was making an active, positive and sovereign choice to be part of the single market. Moreover, it would give Britain a degree of leverage in how the European economic project develops. We would have traded power for influence with leverage. As a new agreement, Britain would be able to negotiate a compromise on freedom of movement. This might include implementation of existing enforcement measures, restricting access to welfare payments as negotiated by David Cameron in 2016, and a Swiss-style local labour market system that allows for priority to be given to job-seekers based in the UK over European workers in certain sectors. The shared market approach would honour the vote to leave, while reflecting the reality that the result was close. Compromise is never fashionable. But the vast majority of UK people, whether they voted to leave or to remain, want the government to negotiate a deal that respects the referendum result without damaging the economy. In a shared market, there is the kind of compromise that might just work for both sides of the Brexit divide. If only the government were prepared to negotiate for it. • Tom Kibasi is director of IPPR and co-author of The Shared Market: A New Proposal for a Future Partnership between the UK and the EU"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"film/2018/jun/10/lek-and-the-dogs-review-andrew-kotting","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-10T07:00:45Z","webTitle":"Lek and the Dogs review – a boy’s best friends revisited","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/jun/10/lek-and-the-dogs-review-andrew-kotting","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/jun/10/lek-and-the-dogs-review-andrew-kotting","fields":{"headline":"Lek and the Dogs review – a boy’s best friends revisited","bodyText":"When it comes to immersive cinema, few film-makers can hold a candle to British maverick Andrew Kötting. From the acclaimed coastal journey of Gallivant to the discursive odysseys of By Our Selves and Edith Walks, Kötting’s films place us within the landscape of their narratives – physical, historical and literary. Dividing his energies between installations, performances, books and films, his interdisciplinary works blur the lines between documentary and drama, invention and investigation. While his concerns may at times seem alienatingly esoteric (philosophical abstractions are a recurrent feature), his films are tactile, earthy works that provoke pleasingly gut-level responses. Watching an Andrew Kötting movie is like digging your hands deep into a steamy midden of ideas, leaving you to pick the conceptual dirt from under your fingernails for days. Kötting’s latest (distributed by Manchester’s adventurous Home Artist Film) is a typically polymorphous affair, the concluding chapter of his Earthworks trilogy that arrives alongside an imposingly hefty book. Blending elements of dystopian sci-fi fantasy, recent-history social realism and timeless metaphysical allegory, Lek and the Dogs takes inspiration from a 2010 Hattie Naylor play that itself draws upon the real-life 90s story of Ivan Mishukov. Having either fled or been thrown out of his home at the age of four, the young Mishukov spent two years living on the streets of Moscow, befriending a pack of wild dogs that became his companions and guardians. In Kötting’s film, the adult Lek (Xavier Tchili) looks back upon his feral life, armed with a cassette recorder on which his younger self (voiced by Clay Barnard) recorded his formative experiences. French actor and performance artist Tchili played incidental characters named Lek in previous Earthworks instalments This Filthy Earth and Ivul, which respectively played out upon and above the ground. Completing the cycle, Lek and the Dogs ventures beneath the apocalyptic surface of the world, into the pipes and caves where Lek seeks refuge. “We are under the ground,” he says, “in our secret den”, a canine sanctuary from the cruel and depleted human world. “I called for my dogs” becomes a repeated refrain as Lek recounts his return to human society and his inability to shed his pack past. “You are so full of dog,” says Mina, the partner whom he will abandon as he retreats once more from the upright world. While Tarkovsky and Beckett are obvious points of reference, some altogether more random (and quite possibly spurious) connections seem to emerge from the alluring montage of drama, home movies, and archive footage. Alongside familiar stylistic similarities to the works of Guy Maddin and Derek Jarman, the shadowy spectre of the bald Lek appears to recall Brando’s Colonel Kurtz confronting “the horror, the horror” in Apocalypse Now. Visions of the “valley of ashes” from The Great Gatsby are brought to mind by depictions of a smog-ridden world, while images of groaning industry have something of the nightmarish quality of David Lynch’s Eraserhead. Meanwhile, haunting sequences shot in the Atacama desert, Chile, reminded me of both the otherworldy weirdness of Nic Roeg’s The Man Who Fell to Earth and of the soul-searching investigations of Patricio Guzmán’s Nostalgia for the Light. Just as Guzmán’s documentary meditated upon the cosmic coexistence of past and present, so Kötting pointedly quotes Eugene O’Neill’s dictum that “there is no present or future, only the past, happening over and over again, now”. While film footage is flipped and reversed, friendly “wizard” Alan Moore muses upon concepts of “personal apocalypse” and “solid time” in which “we are all composing our worlds individually from our moment-by-moment perceptions”, a core theme of this strange and alarming film. Moore’s voice is just one of many that litter the rich soundscape of Kötting’s movie. Along with Lek’s own ramblings (delivered in an imagined eastern European “grammelot” with English subtitles), we hear from a “body psychotherapist” and a “child psychologist”, interspersed with fragments of distorted transmissions that seem somehow linked to images of cratered moonscapes and outer space. Ultimately, whatever one takes from this overwhelming collage of sound and vision will be wholly personal. Enigmatic chapter titles (“The Ancient Customs”, “A Natural History of Destruction”) do little to establish definitive readings, and I suspect that Kötting, whose playful sense of humour should not be underestimated, would shy away from restrictive interpretations. Yet a final note of hope seems incontrovertible, bringing matters to a close on a positive note that reduced me to wholly unexpected tears."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"}]}}
