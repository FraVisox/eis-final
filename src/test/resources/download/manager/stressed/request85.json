You can start them off virtually as soon as they can walk. The problem is they grow out of the trainer so quickly, which makes investing in one seem like a waste of money. But this dinky ride from Pedibal spares you the monetary misery with its clever 3-for-1 design. It’s a lightweight frame with 12in rubbery wheels, and it works brilliantly as a balance bike. You can then fit a footplate for those inbetweenies who want to use it as a seated scooter. Once they’ve mastered that you can fit the pedals and watch them ride off into the future. The Scampa comes in four colours and includes all the parts you need, even a miniature tool kit.

Now a similar transformation is sweeping over the city’s car industry. For decades, Seat was the go-to guy for steady yet uninspiring cars. If Barça were winning championships, Seat was battling to stay out of the relegation zone – but new signings, such as the Ateca and the Arona, are giving Seat plenty of attacking flair. The key battle Seat faces is in the small-car sector. In sales terms this is where the big numbers are and it’s a nice parallel that Barça’s most lethal weapon is the diminutive Leo Messi, while Seat’s giant killer is all set to be the titchy Ibiza. Already Spain’s best-selling model, the Ibiza was launched in 1984. It was designed by the legendary Giorgetto Giugiaro, while the engine was developed with the collaboration of Porsche, and Karmann helped build the bodywork. In terms of car pedigrees, that’s Best in Show. Since then almost 5.5m have been sold, with a remarkable 3m of them still on the road. The current model is being built in the super-modern Martorell factory just outside the Catalan capital, and each day 700 new Ibizas roll off its production line. Most are exported to 80 different countries around the world, and more than half its buyers are women. Seat is clearly doing something right as far as international women are concerned. Seat has always liked to name its cars after Spanish cities, so far they’re up to 13, including Toledo, Alhambra, Marbella and Leon. People who purchase the Ibiza tend to be about a decade younger than those buying any of the other cars in the VW group, it’s appropriate therefore that this upbeat model is named after the party island. But before the chilling begins there are a few basics you need to get your head around. The most important is that the Ibiza has been chosen by VW to debut its latest production platform. It’s called MQB A0 and will eventually underpin the VW Polo, Audi A1 and Skoda Fabia, plus a range of small SUVs. This hi-tech platform means the new five-door Ibiza is blessed with lots of safety, connectivity and luxury extras that never normally get a showing at this level. There’s pedestrian detection with auto braking, adaptive cruise control, wireless charging for mobiles, LED lights and Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. The overall impression is of a small car that handles like a big car. Several times during the week I spent with the car, I pulled over to check the spec sheet and the price. At times it seemed too good to be true. There are endless choices available, even for the dashboard clock – you can scroll through four alternative displays. Design follows the template Seat has set across its line-up for sharp edges, pronounced creases and a slightly snarky face. Despite its modest foot print, it feels unexpectedly roomy inside. There’s space for five (chunky) adults and their luggage, too. The finish is impressive, with rich suedes, soft-touch plastics and plenty of chrome.Seat is no longer a boring budget alternative. Engine wise there are three versions of VW’s mile-busting 1-litre three-cylinder on offer with power choices of 74, 94 and 114bhp. There’s also a 148bhp 1.5-litre petrol unit due out soon. The top seller will be the 94bhp option. It’s remarkably efficient and offers a diligent, pleasant drive. A decision has been taken not to offer a diesel alternative, which will suit urban drivers on low mileages, but these smaller engines can struggle on longer journeys. It only comes with a three-year warranty, which is mean considering longer warranties are offered by the likes of Kia and Hyundai. Good-looking, affordable, loaded with tech and with a proven track record… This is a little Seat which deserves a big standing ovation.

As Gove points out, rules and regulations for waste disposal differ vastly around the UK, making the collections confusing for many families. This has not escaped the notice of Whitehall, where civil servants calculated, in a 2015 report (pdf), that standardised waste collection could save £70m a year. If that were combined with more joint procurement by councils, the savings would be even greater. Standardisation and joint working can also create jobs. The former leader of Tameside council, the late Roy Oldham, was ahead of his time in developing the idea of converting plastic waste into products such as outside seating, fencing, paving and children’s playground equipment. Other councils were less keen, and a promising opportunity to create many jobs in the north west was lost. There are companies today doing a similar thing, and local government should be actively working with them. There are other plastic waste recycling businesses in the UK, mainly turning plastic into fuel. However, local government has preferred to see 2.7m tonnes of plastic waste shipped to China since 2012 – and put 1.2m tonnes annually into landfill. With a ban by China on importing plastic waste, the UK’s haphazard approach to waste collection and disposal appears incapable of handling the consequences. Local rivalries and poor working relationships have played a big part in UK local government’s failure to standardise waste collection. As director of the North West Centre of Excellence from 2004 to 2008, my remit covered 47 local authorities in the north west of England. Despite some visionary personalities, personal (and often longstanding) disputes, and defensiveness and rivalry between leaders, chief executives and senior managers of different councils prevented greater joint working. One failure, for example, was the attempt to persuade several councils in Greater Manchester to harmonise waste collection fleets, with potential savings of £16,500 per vehicle. The councils involved offered up such lame excuses as “we are different” or “waste collection is the issue that causes most complaints”. In Cheshire, waste vehicle depots in one district council were often almost adjacent to a neighbouring council’s depot. The same applied to waste recycling depots. Despite a study showing that a single regime could save 15%, the councils would not agree to join forces. Now, with local government reorganisation, Greater Manchester, Cheshire East and Cheshire West each have their own common regimes. The argument for standardisation applies to all significant categories of procurement spend and will also apply to in-house teams. It is one of the most powerful tools that procurement professionals have. Past reluctance to standardise on waste collection and adopt innovative ideas has killed off UK business opportunities, with similar instances in other service sectors. Although joint working and standardisation has become more acceptable in local government and has been given a boost by the creation of combined authorities, the huge potential benefits from comprehensive and innovative standardised services are still eluding too many councils. I hope chief executives, council leaders and senior managers will now step forward and provide the proactive leadership to work together to secure the real benefits.

The contractual lines should be the same – fair salary, paid holidays, disciplinary measures if anything goes wrong – but they are also a civilised gloss on something far messier: physical and emotional intimacy, a requirement of absolute trust in a stranger and a power relationship whose collateral damage, if things go wrong, can easily be visited on a defenceless child. And not only the child. In her Prix Goncourt-winning novel, which has taken France by storm, Leïla Slimani’s brilliantly executed insight is that there is great emotional jeopardy for everyone involved. She begins with the children, her first lines – “The baby is dead. It only took a few seconds” – setting the plot efficiently, relentlessly in motion. Everything is tinged with dread, the reader questioning how the baby and his older sister came to die – material that Slimani weaves into a wide net in which to snare all sorts of wriggling creatures. Louise, the nanny, was perfect (there are clear nods to that other perfect fictional nanny, Mary Poppins). The children loved her. She cooked and she cleaned for Myriam, a lawyer of north African heritage, and her music producer husband Paul; the mechanism of the household ran smoothly at last. Moreover, Louise seemed to gain total satisfaction from enabling others to thrive. Slimani, a French-Moroccan writer and journalist, has two children, and in her first novel to be translated into English she puts “the warm secret world of childhood” front and centre: the banal details of bathtime, the ins and outs of a game of hide and seek. Louise enters into the children’s games, more fully, sometimes, than the children themselves. In one game she observes them from her hiding place as they are distressed by not finding her, she “watches them as if she’s studying the death throes of a fish she’s just caught, its gills bleeding, its body shaken by spasms”. Their relief when they discover her binds them to her, holds them close. Slimani presses all the obvious buttons: the fear of what happens when the parents are not there, and the coldness possible with children who are not one’s own. The self-delusions: “It’s too hard for her. It must be tough, seeing all the things she’s not allowed to do,” says one of Louise’s previous employers, justifying why they will not include Louise’s daughter in the games their children play. The hypocrisies, and especially liberal hypocrisies – Paul is the son of a radical 1960s mother who turns out to be socially conservative when it comes to Myriam’s motherhood; and he finds it impossible to be a boss honestly, because of what that does to his comforting vision of who he is. Myriam has been a brilliant law student; Slimani is forensic about the choices presented to women who have assumed they can attain equality and intellectual self-fulfilment, but suddenly find themselves “confined to the world’s edge”, as she describes a new mother in a playground. These women, desperate to hold on to their sense of self, unintentionally help to perpetuate the subjugation of other women: it is no accident that Slimani chose to make Louise, unlike most of the other nannies she encounters, not African or Filipina, but white, and French; the inequality is more clearly about income and educational opportunity. “A white woman doing an immigrant’s job,” Slimani has said, “is extremely demeaning”; Louise is also, of course, working for someone of immigrant background – yet another potent element to add to a relationship already full of possibilities for thoughtless humiliation. Louise’s emotional background is another minefield. When Myriam and Paul are away, she does show true affection to her charges – and here Slimani finds even more dangerous buttons to push. Nanny books advise prospective employers to ask about the applicant’s childhood and relationship to their own parents – which is appallingly intrusive, but solid advice, because nannies, like parents, bring all their previous emotional life to the care of children, whether they choose to or not. Why are they doing this work? What, apart from economic necessity, is being played out? Louise has one friend, another nanny, an undocumented immigrant called Wafa who cheerfully tells her “the details of a life that will never be recorded” – which is really the conceit of Slimani’s novel: who is the nanny really, behind her professional smile? What is the emotional effect of her work? Louise is haunted, eventually, “by the feeling she has seen too much, heard too much of other people’s privacy” – when they have never registered that she might have such a thing herself. It would have been easy, and narratively effective, for Slimani to build a picture of a psychopath; it’s clear, in the kind of mythic language she uses and from the occasional slightly overdone gothic touch, that she was tempted. She achieves the far more interesting feat, however, of playing entirely valid points of view against each other, sometimes in consecutive sentences: one minute we are seeing things from Louise’s point of view; in the next her face is blank and we are outside again, with the parents. Rather like childhood, Slimani’s novel arrives at its inevitable climax through an accretion of seeming banalities and mundane pressures. This is a political book about emotional work, about women and children and their costs and losses. But, partly because Slimani looks so clearly at these losses, not only giving them their due, but placing them carefully for full narrative impact, Lullaby also works as a thriller, which is quite a balancing act to pull off. • Aida Edemariam’s The Wife’s Tale will be published by 4th Estate in February.

Analysis by the Bank and the Financial Conduct Authority showed it was common for people to remain in debt even after paying off one of their credit cards, as they shift debts from one lender to another. Previously, Threadneedle Street had believed that credit cards were paid off more quickly, particularly in relation to mortgages. Nine out of every £10 of outstanding credit card debt in November 2016 was owed by people who were also in the red two years earlier, according to the study. The analysis follows the rapid growth in personal borrowing on credit cards, loans and car finance, now rising at almost five times the rate of growth in UK pay. Households are finding themselves increasingly squeezed by meagre earnings growth and rising inflation, as the weak pound after the Brexit vote pushes up the cost of imported goods. Bank data shows personal debts have risen to the highest level since before the credit crunch, reaching more than £200bn – with credit cards accounting for more than £70bn of the total. Households are also facing a year of stagnant real earnings growth in 2018, which may push them further into debt should they wish to maintain their living standards. Writing on the Bank Underground blog – where Threadneedle Street staff can air their views in public – the officials said: “Although a consumer may clear their debt on one credit product, it is not uncommon for them to remain in debt as they transfer balances, take out new credit products or draw down on existing credit lines, such as credit cards.” The Bank has become increasingly worried about the boom in personal debt over recent months, forcing banks to beef-up their financial reserves to protect against any losses. It warned against reckless lending standards emerging after a period of economic stability since the financial crisis, saying Britain’s banks could incur £30bn of losses if interest rates and unemployment rose sharply. The study found some crumbs of comfort for the Bank, finding that the growth in consumer credit had not been driven by people with poor credit scores – known in the finance industry as “subprime” borrowers. This would help to suggest that the growth in consumer credit has been less risky than feared. But while the proportion of borrowers with bad credit scores remained roughly the same over the two years to November 2016, officials said there should have been an improvement because of the economic recovery over the same period of time, which points to banks still being at risk from bad debts. • Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"football/blog/2018/jan/08/can-benevento-stay-up-after-massimo-codas-golden-spell-against-sampdoria","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-08T12:49:08Z","webTitle":"Can Benevento stay up after Massimo Coda's golden spell against Sampdoria? | Paolo Bandini","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2018/jan/08/can-benevento-stay-up-after-massimo-codas-golden-spell-against-sampdoria","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/blog/2018/jan/08/can-benevento-stay-up-after-massimo-codas-golden-spell-against-sampdoria","fields":{"headline":"Can Benevento stay up after Massimo Coda's golden spell against Sampdoria?","bodyText":"Sampdoria were seeing witches on Saturday. So was everyone else in Italy, to be fair. This was the weekend when La Befana made her annual visit, dropping off gifts for good children and lumps of coal for the naughty. Whether this kindly old lady, riding a broomstick that she uses to sweep each house before she leaves, should technically be considered a witch is the subject of scholarly debate but she is widely depicted as one. It is not La Befana, though, who appears on Benevento’s crest. Their witch is a manifestation of the city’s pagan traditions, dating back to the 17th century. As Samp would discover at the Stadio Ciro Vigorito, this place has a little magic left yet. Benevento’s hopes of surviving their first season of top-flight football appeared nonexistent after they collected a point from their opening 18 games. A 1-0 win over Chievo in their final fixture of 2017 brought raucous celebration but few would have tipped this team to follow up with a further victory over opponents who were sitting in sixth place. What else but witchcraft could explain the performance of Massimo Coda? The Benevento forward is a hard-grafting journeyman, 29 years old and playing only his second season of Serie A football. The previous one yielded two goals in 18 appearances for Parma in 2014-15. Coda has played for 13 teams in 14 years, and looked set to add another to that list this January. He had failed to score in 12 top-flight games for Benevento and was expecting to be sold when the transfer window opened. But he broke his duck with the winner against Chievo and then followed that by obliterating Sampdoria. It was not only the fact that he equalised after Gianluca Caprari gave the visitors a first-half lead but the manner in which he did it. Chasing a ball into a blind alley down the right, he cut back inside and bamboozled the centre-back Gianmarco Ferrari with a stepover worthy of a sportswear commercial before curling a shot into the top corner. His second should perhaps have been saved, a free-kick that dipped sharply over the wall, but flew close enough to Emiliano Viviano for the keeper to get a hand on the ball. Coda was due a break, though, after hitting the woodwork twice when his team was trailing. Crucially, he did not settle for that. Benevento have suffered a series of injury-time indignities this season – infamously on their visit to Cagliari, where they equalised in the 94th minute, only to concede again in the 95th – so even with moments left to play a 2-1 lead still felt precarious. Coda ensured the three points by teeing up team-mate Enrico Brignola for a simple finish as the game moved into added time. Good thing, too. Benevento maintained a trend by conceding at the death yet again. For once, it did not matter, as the game finished 3-2 to the hosts. Can they truly avoid relegation after such a hapless start? Crotone’s great escape last season offers grounds for encouragement. The Calabrians were nine points from safety after 20 games. For Benevento, that gap is down to a meagre eight. The prospect is certainly bewitching but this result also had implications at the other end of the table – sixth-placed Sampdoria’s defeat allowed Atalanta to pull level with them on 30 points. It was the culmination of an extraordinary week for the Bergamese club, who beat Napoli away on Tuesday night to reach the Coppa Italia semi-final, then followed that with a win by the same 2-1 scoreline over Roma at the Stadio Olimpico. You could say they have been fortunate with their timing. Napoli fielded a heavily rotated team, an understandable decision for a side pursuing greater prizes on modest resources. And Roma deprived themselves of Radja Nainggolan, the midfielder omitted from their match-day squad as punishment for a boozy Instagram post on New Year’s Eve. His absence was undoubtedly felt but that should not take away from the manner in which Atalanta took the game to their hosts, scoring twice inside 20 minutes. Andreas Cornelius punished Federico Fazio’s loose tracking with a precision finish, before Papu Gómez, this week sporting a Peppa Pig armband, teed up Marten de Roon for the second. The latter player would collect a harsh red card before the interval but even with 10 men Atalanta continued to hold their own. None should be blind to Gian Piero Gasperini’s tactical savvy by now but once again the manager got the big calls spot on, starting Cornelius ahead of Andrea Petagna and prioritising his team’s width by restoring the fresh legs of Leonardo Spinazzola and Hans Hateboer at the wing-back positions after both were rested against Napoli. He has kept this team punching above their weight despite losing key players in the summer, and fielding strong teams, and winning with them, in both the domestic cup and the Europa League. You would not need to check La Befana’s notes from the past 12 months to know that he has been very good indeed. Talking points • As Roma struggled, Lazio moved up to third with a 5-2 win over Spal. Ciro Immobile hit four, becoming the first player across Europe’s top five leagues to reach 20 goals this season. But if he has the numbers, then it’s still Luis Alberto who brings the style. • An unconvincing win for Juventus, with Cagliari raging over a penalty not awarded to them late on. Although the ball clearly struck Federico Bernardeschi’s arm inside the area, the referee Gianpaolo Calvarese judged it involuntary. The Cagliari president, Tommaso Giulini, was furious over the failure to overturn the decision using VAR, but it had been applied correctly. The replay official was in contact with Calvarese, but the latter made plain that he had seen the incident clearly and believed the action to be involuntary. Subjective assessments cannot be overturned by replay, only objective ones. • Welcome back, Walter Mazzarri, whose tenure at Torino began with a 3-0 rout of Bologna. The manager installed M’Baye Niang at the centre of a three-man attack and was rewarded with a goal from his former Watford charge. The player himself, though, dedicated his strike to the man Mazzarri replaced, Sinisa Mihajlovic. “He signed me to get him results, and I didn’t manage it,” said Niang. “If he was fired, then that’s my fault, too.” • Yet another draw for Inter, with Luciano Spalletti giving an exasperated response to questions about their squad depth and need to invest in January: “Even my mum, who is 80 years old, sitting at home, knows that I need another centre-back.?” • The final word this week goes to Federico Chiesa, asked as a toddler who would replace the goals scored by the departing Gabriel Batistuta at Fiorentina. He first suggests Francesco Toldo, only for his father, Enrico, to remind him that Toldo is a keeper. Upon further consideration, Federico nominates himself. Detto fatto. At 20 years old, he trails only Giovanni Simeone (who grabbed the equaliser this weekend) in the Viola’s scoring charts."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/jan/13/tim-dowling-dump-what-if-the-man-there","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-13T06:00:50Z","webTitle":"Tim Dowling: we’re off to the dump – but what if the man is there?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jan/13/tim-dowling-dump-what-if-the-man-there","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jan/13/tim-dowling-dump-what-if-the-man-there","fields":{"headline":"Tim Dowling: we’re off to the dump – but what if the man is there?","bodyText":"The first half of January doesn’t feel like the beginning of anything. It’s more a drizzly, twilit interruption; a chance to fix broken things before moving on. Some of the broken things are emotional, some infrastructural. One of them is the oven. “It’s not the fuse,” I say, peering into the blackness beyond the glass. “The clock comes on.” “I’m buying a new oven,” my wife says. “This is a new oven,” I say. “It’s new to us.” “I’ve already found one,” she says. “Same size. And they’ll install it and take this one away.” “I think it might be just the dial,” I say. “I don’t care,” my wife says. Another problem is a staggering backlog of rubbish: bags of bottles and tins and paper; Styrofoam exoskeletons from unboxed appliances; Christmas detritus. It’s all out there in the dark, getting rained on. In the January interregnum, the bin men come on different days, as if to surprise us. “We’ll have to go to the dump,” my wife says. “Why are you making a face?” I say. “You love the dump.” “I do love the dump,” she says. “But I don’t like the man.” “You love the man, and the man loves you,” I say. “Tomorrow,” my wife says. “Early.” On the day of the dump I find myself with an early deadline, so I head to my shed first thing. Anyone looking into our garden on this freezing morning would see a woman dragging wet rubbish to a car, while a man in a cardigan sits in a warm glass box and types. “Right, I’ve done everything,” my wife says, sticking her head through my office door. “Let’s go.” “You’re letting the cold in,” I say. “Five minutes.” We drive to the dump, which is busy. We have to wait for a bay. “There he is,” my wife says, nodding toward the man who runs the dump. He sits in a lawn chair in a high visibility vest, barking orders. We pull into a bay. I climb out and open the back. “Not in there!” the man shouts at someone else. “That’s the wrong sort of plastic!” Our rubbish has been bagged for collection rather than dumping and now, I realise, will have to be re-sorted by hand. I pull open a bag of mixed glass, and grab the greens. “We don’t accept paint here!” the man shouts, generally. My wife holds up a mirror in a busted frame, tilts her head and raises an eyebrow. “General waste, madam,” the man says. I grab a stack of flattened boxes and head for the cardboard container, getting about halfway. “Cardboard goes in general waste!” the man shouts. I stop and turn, boxes held high for an overhead throw. “But it’s cardboard,” I say. “Cardboard is full!” he shouts. Back at the car, my wife is displaying a torn lampshade. “You can leave it just over here, madam,” the man says, pointing. I hold up a sack of tins. “Metal?” I say. “Metal is metal!” the man shouts, with righteous fury. Eventually the car is emptied of everything, including some stuff that has lain under the seats for a year, and we drive off unburdened. “That was quite satisfying,” I say. “We should bring some motor oil next time.” “It’s better when the man isn’t there,” my wife says. “What are you talking about?” I say. “You’re his favourite.” “I’m there a lot,” my wife says. “It’s like going to the dump with Princess Margaret,” I say. “Shut up,” she says. “We can go to the supermarket, now I’ve got you.” An hour later I’m home, staring at a chicken. “I completely forgot about the oven,” I say. “What’s wrong with the oven?” the oldest one says. “I’m buying a new one,” my wife says. “Tomorrow.” “I guess I could spatchcock it and cook it on the hob,” I say. “Spatchcock,” the oldest one says. “New year, new oven,” my wife says. “This oven is fixable,” I say. “Make do, or do without.” My wife looks out into the darkening back garden. “And then,” she says, “I’m getting a pony.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"social-care-network/2018/jan/10/new-care-deal-ageing-population","type":"article","sectionId":"social-care-network","sectionName":"Social Care Network","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-10T10:09:44Z","webTitle":"We need a new care deal to tackle the challenges of an ageing population | Joel Charles","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/social-care-network/2018/jan/10/new-care-deal-ageing-population","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/social-care-network/2018/jan/10/new-care-deal-ageing-population","fields":{"headline":"We need a new care deal to tackle the challenges of an ageing population","bodyText":"I hope this year will mark a step change for adult social care; without decisive action, the gap between those in need of care and the provision of appropriate services will widen further. It’s time to agree a new approach to ensure older people can remain active and well for as long as possible. Investment in technology is also urgently required to better promote independent living and communities designed for mobility and age. We have launched Mind the Care Gap, a campaign to encourage an honest conversation about the challenges we face as our population ages. The campaign looks at the challenges facing older people, but draws conclusions about adult social care provision more widely. Much of the debate about adult social care has been dominated by funding and what the state can do to tackle key long-term pressures. It is right to explore these issues, but our campaign draws on the views of frontline health and care professionals, as well as learning from the experiences of older people – providing or in need of care – to explore key facets of the care deficit. Our aim is to highlight the everyday problems people encounter and to determine the parameters of a new settlement for health and care that provides the right services for everyone, while recognising the benefits of living longer. We need a new care covenant. The campaign will explore loneliness, social isolation and living with long-term conditions, the care workforce, community responses to health and care needs, and what future provision could look like. The care professionals and older people we spoke to told us that access to adult social care support is difficult for people managing a number of conditions in later life, and that there needs to be better coordination between health and care professionals. They also told us that a large number of people in sheltered accommodation are living with more complex, long-term mental and physical health conditions. An unpaid 81-year-old carer, who looks after her 90-year-old husband with partial sight and hearing and early-stage dementia, told us: A challenge we face using social care services is that you don’t always see the same support staff so you can’t really form a relationship or build up a rapport. This means a lot of questions can get asked repeatedly. There must also be a greater focus on the care workforce. To help with the recruitment and retention of staff, we need clear progression pathways, access to appropriate training and professional recognition. One solution could be to establish a professional body for the sector – a National Institute for Care. An adult social care worker told us about the difficulty of splitting health and care budgets, and who should take the lead for a person’s care. They suggested a consolidated pot to fund local health and care needs may help break down barriers: One of the issues I find – and again it comes back to funding – is it’s ‘not your responsibility’ if the funding belongs to another team ... One budget per patient, that’s what’s needed. To build on the campaign and deliver on our objectives, we are holding a Mind the Care Gap summit in April in London. The summit will incorporate these campaign themes and bring together representatives of the public, private and charitable sectors to discuss what a national care plan should include before the adult social care green paper is published in the summer. We believe this is an opportunity to set out a new way forward to tackle some of the long-term challenges faced in later life.

His safety-first policy here amounted to keeping most of his big-name attackers but reshuffling his defence, perhaps not the wisest policy against adventurous opponents full of confidence and on a hiding to nothing. Bristol City would have been delighted to see Sergio Agüero left on the bench, and surprised that both Fabian Delph and Kyle Walker were keeping him company, so that Oleksandr Zinchenko could continue where he left off against Burnley on Saturday. That is to say at left-back, just where one would expect to find an attacking midfielder who happens to be Ukraine’s youngest international goalscorer. “I trust all my players to perform,” Guardiola explained. “Even if they are playing in unfamiliar positions.” Possibly Guardiola has spent the festive period watching repeats of Eric Morecambe at the piano, though however eccentric the methods, his results demand respect. It was still likely to be Bristol City who needed to be careful, whether or not they have something going on. While Lee Johnson’s side have slipped down the Championship table slightly since eliminating Manchester United last month, they still retain realistic hopes of promotion and this is the sort of standard top-flight teams have to live with. Or not, as the case may be. Manchester United have yet to visit the Etihad this season but Bristol City’s three other Carabao Cup victims – Watford, Stoke and Crystal Palace – all foundered here while conceding 15 goals between them. The visitors can reflect that they outperformed all three and, even if last-gasp heartbreak is also something that goes with Premier League territory, this encounter suggested the divisions within the top flight may be greater than the gulf that separates it from the top of the second tier. Hordur Magnusson could testify that a class gap nevertheless exists after a couple of minutes, when after being turned inside out by Bernardo Silva on the right touchline, he regained position just in time to see his opponent slip the ball square to an unmarked Kevin De Bruyne. The home’s side captain not only has the knack of finding space almost anywhere on the pitch but using it well, and for the next few minutes he enjoyed himself at the Robins’ expense, whether testing Frank Fielding with a shot disguised as a cross or finding Raheem Sterling with a superb pass from halfway that really should have brought a better response from the England forward. Yet Bristol City did not reach the last four by standing back and admiring opponents, and a glimpse of their true character was seen when Jamie Paterson skipped past Ilkay Gündogan in the centre circle as if the German was wading through wet cement. A few minutes later Joe Bryan set off on a run and produced a diving save from Claudio Bravo. Marlon Pack brought another Bravo stop shortly before the interval as the visitors began to gain encouragement. The reserve goalkeeper is one of the areas where Guardiola’s theory of complete trustworthiness is worth testing, and on this evidence Danilo at right-back might be another, for the defender had trouble all night containing Bryan. Had Paterson made more of one opening he engineered, the underdogs could have been in front even before Bobby Reid’s penalty. A certain indecisiveness had characterised the home side’s attacking play up to that point, with plenty of possession and opportunity but no one demanding the ball or providing a go-to man in front of goal. Sterling seemed to struggle with the responsibility of being pushed further forward. While much improved this season, his finishing is still far from deadly in situations where one would expect him to score, though he did play an important part in De Bruyne’ equaliser. As, to be fair, did the oft-maligned Bravo. A few home supporters must have been peeping through their fingers as the goalkeeper allowed a back pass from John Stones to run across the face of goal before clearing at the last moment under pressure from an opponent, but the eventual clearance found De Bruyne in space and the invitation was not wasted. Significantly Walker, as well as Agüero, was on the field by the time the late winner arrived. Both should probably start at Ashton Gate. In cup competitions, after all, one cannot be too careful."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"environment/2018/jan/10/china-on-track-to-lead-in-renewables-as-us-retreats-report-says","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-10T03:08:49Z","webTitle":"China on track to lead in renewables as US retreats, report says","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jan/10/china-on-track-to-lead-in-renewables-as-us-retreats-report-says","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/jan/10/china-on-track-to-lead-in-renewables-as-us-retreats-report-says","fields":{"headline":"China on track to lead in renewables as US retreats, report says","bodyText":"China is moving towards becoming a global leader in renewable technology as the US pulls away, a new report has said. China is the world’s biggest emitter of greenhouse gases and still invests in coal but in recent years it has become the largest investor in domestic renewable energy. The country is now on track to lead international investment in the sector, according to the report by the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA). “As the global transition toward renewables gains pace and as battery storage and electric vehicles technologies pick up momentum, China is setting itself up to dominate these sectors globally over the next several decades of this century,” said IEEFA. IEEFA identified a record high spend of more than US$44bn by China on international takeovers and projects worth more than $1bn – a 38% year-on-year growth. China’s One Belt One Road agenda, which drives infrastructure investment along ancient trade routes, is leading the country’s growth. $8bn of solar equipment has been exported from China since it began, and the country has overtaken the US and Germany to become the number one exporter of environmental goods and services. “China’s presence in wind power globally is also on the rise, led by international activities of companies such as Goldwind and by China Three Gorges’ diversification away from hydroelectricity,” the report said. The trajectory is in stark contrast to that of the US, which last year pulled out of the Paris climate accord and has renewed its support for the coal industry. The decision to abandon the Paris agreement “led to China’s quick reaffirmation of its emissions-reduction pledge”, the report said. “That allows it to further project itself globally as a responsible major power while addressing its domestic air pollution concerns and building world-leading capacity in new energy markets.” As part of its Paris commitments, China pledged to peak its emissions by 2030 while making best efforts to peak earlier. It would also increase the share of renewable or nuclear energy sources to 20%. Co-author of the report and director of IEEFA, Tim Buckley, said China was setting itself up as a global technology leader “whilst the US government looks the other way”. “Although China isn’t necessarily intending to fill the climate leadership void left by the US withdrawal from Paris, it will certainly be very comfortable providing technology leadership and financial capacity so as to dominate fast-growing sectors such as solar energy, electric vehicles and batteries.” The report noted the August 2017 merger of China’s top coal mining company, Shenhua Group Corp, with one of the “big five” power utilities, China Guodian Corp. The newly named China Energy Investment Corp created the world’s largest power generator, and with the clean-energy assets of Guodian, Shenhua’s growth was no longer dependent on the pursuit of coal. “[This] strategic posture [of pursuing coal] has burdened China’s power companies and limited their appetite for innovative new clean energy technologies,” the IEEFA said. The report also found China was “outmanoeuvring other economies” in securing energy commodity supplies such as lithium, nickel and cobalt, allowing them to dominate manufacturing of batteries and electric vehicles. On Monday, the US federal energy regulatory commission rejected a plan by the Donald Trump-led US administration to provide subsidies for coal-fired and nuclear power plants. Last year the energy secretary, Rick Perry, proposed moves to slow the phasing out of the ageing plants and Trump vowed to repeal Obama-era environmental regulations in a bid to end a so-called “war on coal”. However, independent analysis found the subsidies plan would cost taxpayers $10.6bn a year, and the commission on Monday said there was no evidence that retiring coal-fired power plants threatened the reliability of the nation’s electricity grid."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/jan/10/union-slams-outsourcing-of-home-affairs-department-call-centre","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-10T04:44:58Z","webTitle":"Union denounces outsourcing of home affairs department call centre","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jan/10/union-slams-outsourcing-of-home-affairs-department-call-centre","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jan/10/union-slams-outsourcing-of-home-affairs-department-call-centre","fields":{"headline":"Union denounces outsourcing of home affairs department call centre","bodyText":"The Australian government will pay multinational corporation Datacom to run the Department of Home Affairs’ call centre, the latest in a string of critical government services to be privatised. Under the deal Datacom will handle 1.5m visa and immigration queries a year through an Adelaide call centre, which will replace a Sydney-based operation. The decision has provoked a furious response from the Community and Public Sector Union. The union’s acting deputy secretary, Brooke Muscat-Bentley, said it put sensitive personal information at risk, reduced transparency and would degrade the quality of service. “This is a devastating decision for the 250 dedicated staff currently doing this work, along with their families,” Muscat-Bentley said. “But also for the people who are so reliant on their assistance to navigate Australia’s complex immigration rules and processes. “Outsourcing this kind of work to a private company like Datacom means paying more and receiving less in return.” The decision follows a similar privatisation at the Department of Human Services last year. The government announced multinational corporation Serco – a business that has attracted significant controversy in Australia and abroad – would take over the Centrelink call centre to improve wait times. Datacom already has significant business from the federal government. It provides customer support services to the Australian Taxation Office, and has produced a virtual assistant for the government agency responsible for patents and intellectual property. The home affairs department had sought “long term, cost-effective client enquiry services”, according to Datacom. The government was seeking to cut wait times and improve access to information. In a statement, the chief executive of Datacom, Jonathan Ladd, said the company went through a rigorous procurement process to win the contract. He said it showed the company’s “leadership and innovation in the provision of customer care services in Australia”. “Datacom Connect will establish a contact centre service that provides an efficient optimised client experience, providing information and assistance to people enquiring about coming to Australia, whilst the department will retain all decision-making powers,” Ladd said. The CPSU said said the 250 Datacom workers in the new operation would be paid less and placed under worse working conditions without scope for advancement into other roles. Muscat-Bentley said the privatisation placed sensitive information at risk. “Staff in the current call centre are well trained and work under strict commonwealth guidelines to ensure the sensitive personal information they have access to is protected,” she said. “We have serious concerns about the training and protections that will be in place under Datacom.” The union also raised questions about Datacom’s tax record. The latest corporate tax accountability report showed the company had a slight profit margin in Australia. That meant its taxable income was $11m in 2015-16, from a total income of $432m. It paid $2,417,381 in tax. But Datacom said it was fully compliant with “all financial and legal obligations for all the countries in which we operate”. “We do not artificially reduce profits in order to reduce tax liabilities,” it said in a statement. “With regards to Australian tax obligations, Datacom pays the full corporate tax rate of 30% with deductions for R&amp;D offset.” The home affairs department has been contacted for comment."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2018/jan/09/louisiana-teacher-handcuffed-forcibly-after-asking-questions-at-board-meeting","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-09T20:29:47Z","webTitle":"Louisiana teacher handcuffed forcibly after asking questions at board meeting","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jan/09/louisiana-teacher-handcuffed-forcibly-after-asking-questions-at-board-meeting","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/jan/09/louisiana-teacher-handcuffed-forcibly-after-asking-questions-at-board-meeting","fields":{"headline":"Louisiana teacher handcuffed forcibly after asking questions at board meeting","bodyText":"A Louisiana teacher who was forcibly removed from a school board hearing was booked on two crimes and bonded out of jail on Tuesday morning, court documents show. Deyshia Hargrave, a middle school English teacher in the Vermilion Parish School District was handcuffed and dragged out of the meeting by a town marshal on Monday night after voicing her concerns about a contract that would give a raise to the district’s top administrator. During the public comments period, Hargrave was asked to stop asking questions, and she obeyed. Then when she was called on again by the board, the marshal stepped up and asked her to leave. The exchange was captured in video footage that has since gone viral. Hargrave exited the room on her own, but once she reached the hallway, the officer took her to the ground and handcuffed her, leaving onlookers shocked. Court documents suggest she spent several hours in police custody before paying a bond to be released. “What are you doing, can you explain!” Hargrave yelled as the officer picked her up from the floor and pushed her towards an exit, commanding her to “stop resisting”. Hargrave responded: “I am not, you just pushed me to the floor!” School superintendent Jerome Puyau, the man whose potential pay raise was being discussed in the meeting, said that no charges were filed by him or the board against Hargrave. She was, however, charged with “remaining after being forbidden” and “resisting an officer”, both of which can be brought by a marshal, and do not require the school board’s cooperation. It is unclear if the marshal was acting on his own accord or on the orders of board members or the superintendent. “Deyshia Hargrave’s expulsion from a public meeting and subsequent arrest are unacceptable and raise serious constitutional concerns,” said Bruce Hamilton of the American Civil Liberties Union of Louisiana. “The constitution prohibits the government from punishing or retaliating against people for expressing their views, and the fact that a schoolteacher was arrested at a public meeting of the school board is especially troubling.” The Abbeville town marshal’s office, which made the arrest, the superintendent’s office and the school board president all declined further comment on the incident. After Hargrave was removed, the board ultimately voted to approve Puyau’s new contract."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jan/10/school-marks-are-important-but-resilience-is-the-real-indicator-of-success","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-10T02:27:02Z","webTitle":"School marks are important.

But resilience is the real indicator of success","bodyText":"School reunions are funny places. The adolescent nicknames reborn over tepid buffets, the standard platitudes (“You haven’t changed a bit!”), the shock at the domestication of the surly malcontent you once had a crush on. Most of us are keen to find out what became of the school standout, the person voted “Most Likely to Succeed”. Is their research published in peer-reviewed journals? Are they climbing the corporate ladder? Have they developed an app? Sometimes the high achievers go on to fruitful and varied careers, but sometimes their light burns out early. Stories filter back of how they “lost it” at university. Not used to studying in an unstructured environment, they gulped down their freedom too quickly and greedily, and the last anyone saw of them was a chance encounter at a pool hall somewhere up the coast. Often it’s the rebel who takes everyone by surprise. They’ve got four side hustles, three books to their name, and a reliable stream of passive income. While you have spent a fortune to come to the reunion, they’re making money off their online deals website while chatting over canapés. As the nation’s most recent school leavers contemplate their futures — whether to take a gap year, whether to do the law degree their parents are hoping for — it’s important to remember that school marks are not the only predictors of achievement. They’re important, of course, especially in gaining entry to tough courses, but the more you pull away from formalised learning and move into the workforce, the more vital other skills become. US psychologist Angela Duckworth studies what makes people successful. In her bestseller, Grit: The Power of Passion and Perseverance, Duckworth argued that the prime indicator of achievement isn’t IQ or talent, but the possession of “grit”, the ability to dig in and keep going despite the headwinds. It’s what educators also refer to as resilience, and yet some school leavers appear to have slipped through the cracks. A study last year by Headspace of Australian university and Tafe students found that close to 70% rated their mental health as poor or fair, and two-thirds reported high or very high psychological distress over the previous 12 months. Headspace CEO Jason Trethowan said the results were “alarming, but not surprising” as school leavers faced a range of new adult responsibilities that many were struggling to cope with. Of course, some of the university students’ problems are due to tough circumstances that cannot be fixed by deploying grit alone, but the better equipped students are to handle adversity, the more likely they will go on to achieve the goals closest to their hearts. The World Economic Forum’s 2016 The Future of Jobs report emphasised the importance of emotional and social skills for employees of the future, a high-tech landscape they referred to as “the fourth industrial revolution”. The report states that by 2020, on average more than one-third of the desired core skill sets of most occupations will be social skills, such as persuasion, emotional intelligence and teaching others — skills that robots and forms of artificial intelligence cannot easily replicate. My own work life has certainly included the gentle art of persuasion. I was a dedicated swot at school, earning a university scholarship and later a traineeship in journalism. But after almost 20 years in the workforce, I look back and notice a common thread: many of the job opportunities and highlights have not been the ones I formerly applied for. They were things I blagged my way into, opportunities I convinced someone to give me. When I arrived jobless in London in 2006, I phoned and emailed the daily Fleet Street papers until I was given a chance. A very accomplished poet friend of mine displayed impressive dedication to her craft even when she was in her early 20s. She kept a hand-written list next to her home computer outlining the literary journals to submit work to, the dates they were due, and a marker next to submissions denoting whether they had been accepted. I remember thinking that anyone with that kind of list in their life, whether it be for literary submissions or scholarship applications, was already half-way there, destined not only for great things, but also possessing the crucial inner resources to handle life’s inevitable headwinds. • Johanna Leggatt is a Melbourne-based journalist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"football/2018/jan/09/stoke-martin-oneill-gary-rowett-derby","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-09T22:30:31Z","webTitle":"Stoke interest in Martin O’Neill grows after Gary Rowett opts for Derby stay","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jan/09/stoke-martin-oneill-gary-rowett-derby","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/jan/09/stoke-martin-oneill-gary-rowett-derby","fields":{"headline":"Stoke interest in Martin O’Neill grows after Gary Rowett opts for Derby stay","bodyText":"Stoke City’s interest in Martin O’Neill is expected to gather momentum after their search for a manager narrowed following Gary Rowett’s decision to pledge his long-term future to Derby County. It is understood Stoke have sought to make initial contact with O’Neill with a view to holding talks about the possibility of the Republic of Ireland manager making a return to club football, although they are continuing to weigh up the merits of other candidates. Stoke had placed O’Neill and Rowett near the top of their shortlist as soon as Mark Hughes was dismissed on Saturday night following the FA Cup defeat at Coventry City. Although Slaven Bilic has been installed as the bookmakers’ favourite, Stoke are not minded to make a move for the former West Ham United manager as they work their way through a long list of names. Rowett’s impressive work at Derby, who are pushing for automatic promotion in the Championship, made him a leading contender for the vacancy but he is now out of the picture after signing an extended and improved contract with Derby that runs until 2021. Although O’Neill reached a verbal agreement about a new two-year contract with the Republic in November, towards the end of their World Cup qualification campaign, he has yet to sign that deal. The 65-year-old has a proven track record in the Premier League and is highly respected by senior figures at Stoke. With Stoke third from bottom in the Premier League and away at Manchester United on Monday, the club are keen to make an appointment as soon as possible and ideally before the end of the week. A short-term deal would be their preference so they can widen the net again in the summer, although nothing is set in stone."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"technology/2018/jan/10/consumer-electonrics-show-ces-2018-lack-of-innovation","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-10T10:56:39Z","webTitle":"CES 2018: less 'whoa', more 'no!' – tech fails to learn from its mistakes at annual pageant","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/jan/10/consumer-electonrics-show-ces-2018-lack-of-innovation","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2018/jan/10/consumer-electonrics-show-ces-2018-lack-of-innovation","fields":{"headline":"CES 2018: less 'whoa', more 'no!' – tech fails to learn from its mistakes at annual pageant","bodyText":"It’s standing room only in a swirly-carpeted room at the conference centre attached to the Mandalay Bay hotel in Las Vegas. There’s a sea of technology journalists, mostly men, with name badges dangling from lime green lanyards and clear plastic backpacks (a conference freebie) reminiscent of a 1990s Gwen Stefani. Dubstep starts playing. “CES 2017 brought the whoa,” appears on screen, followed by a sequence of fast-cut shots of robots, drones and VR headsets. “This year we’re turning things up. So get ready for more whoa than ever before.” If this year’s Consumer Electronics Show is anything to go by, it’s less “Whoa, that’s awesome” and more “Whoa there, do we really need this?” The annual tech trade show seems less about real innovation breakthroughs solving unmet needs and more about incrementally improved nice-to-haves for the 1%. The technology industry does not appear to have learned from all of the soul-searching it did last year in the wake of the demise of companies like Juicero, which made a $400 internet-connected juice-maker that attracted $120m in funding. The company folded six months after Bloomberg showed that its pre-portioned fruit and veg packets could be squeezed just as effectively by hand. Given the other scandals that rocked the industry in 2017, including sexual harassment, poor factory working conditions and exploding batteries, and mounting evidence that people should spend less time glued to their devices, one might have hoped for a more cautious or conscientious display of mass consumerism. Here’s hoping for 2019. Among the exhibits at CES Unveiled, a curtain-raising showcase of products ahead of the main show, were wifi-connected showers, skin-analysing smart mirrors, and a clothes-folding robot. “If you’re lying in bed and want to get into a hot shower you can either use an app or talk to Alexa and have your shower start up at your favourite temperature,” said Lindsy Argenti, marketing communications manager from Moen, demonstrating internet-connected showers, which solve the apparent problem of having to manually turn the faucet. Another stand features a water bottle with a large electronic base with three replaceable pods to squirt in different supplements depending on your activity data. “If you went on a 10-mile cycle in Las Vegas in the summer we would know the weather, the level of activity and intensity, so the bottle would know you’d need to hydrate and would dispense electrolytes,” said Rob Lawson Shanks, co-founder of Life Fuels, whose water bottle needs charging once a week via USB. Forward X was one of several companies to have built a robotic suitcase that follows the owner around the airport so he or she doesn’t have the inconvenience of holding a handle. It’s a neat idea in theory, but in demos the prototype was slow and inconsistent in its ability to follow its owner. Plus it requires a heavy battery that must be removed to go through security and needs recharging after four hours. There were some attempts to tackle difficult problems with clunky solutions. Two products designed to help the elderly in the event of a fall included Helite’s bulky $800 airbag belt that inflates to protect the hip bones and E-Vone’s smart shoes that alert a loved one if the wearer trips. You subscribe to the footwear (and their accompanying alert service) for around $30 per month. It’s shoes-as-a-service. “I really feel like CES is becoming fairly irrelevant to the actual innovation that matters. It’s no longer a place that leads,” said Ankur Jain, founder of Kairos Society, an organisation that helps entrepreneurs solve societal problems. “It used to be a place where you would see an Alexa [Amazon’s virtual assistant] being announced and everything would follow throughout the year. Now all of the products follow and are not meeting any unmet needs, they are just ‘nice-to-haves’.” In recent years, many of the large tech companies have focused on creating their own events to launch their products, which has dampened the impact of CES’s annual extravaganza. For those that were making announcements, including South Korean giants Samsung and LG, it was less about any particular product but more about the AI glue binding them together more seamlessly. “Last year we announced that all of our home appliances would be wifi-enabled. In 2018 we’re adding AI to all of our appliances,” said LG’s David VanderWaal on stage on Monday morning as he walked through a host of smart refrigerators, washing machines and ranges. What did this added intelligence bring to the table? Well, in one promo video the company showed a man trying to work out what to have for dinner. His fridge told him what food was soon to expire: chicken, mozzarella, lettuce and tomato. What on earth could he make with these ingredients? It’s impossible to tell. So he pulls out his smartphone app, which automatically identifies the ingredients and searches for an appropriate recipe. This gets sent to cute voice-controlled robot Cloi (pronounced Chloe) who not only reads the cooking instructions out loud but sets the oven temperature. So far, so futuristic. But what was the net result of this AI-powered assistance? A chicken, mozzarella, lettuce and tomato sandwich. Things took a turn for the worse during Cloi’s live demo on stage. The desktop device, which can control other LG products in the home, was introduced as the “ultimate in simplicity when managing your smart home”. “She’s so cute … talk about innovation that makes you smile,” said VanderWaal. Minutes later, the robot stopped responding to VanderWaal’s questions, making for a disastrous debut for the presentation’s centrepiece. “Cloi, what recipes could I make with chicken?” he asked in one of three failed attempts to elicit a response from the robot. There was awkward laughter in the audience. VanderWaal continued with his script: “This smart kitchen is changing the game, it’s doing it all for you seamlessly and effortlessly.” That is, provided the robots choose to cooperate."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2018/jan/09/us-to-loosen-nuclear-weapons-policy-and-develop-more-usable-warheads","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-09T19:43:06Z","webTitle":"US to loosen nuclear weapons constraints and develop more 'usable' warheads","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jan/09/us-to-loosen-nuclear-weapons-policy-and-develop-more-usable-warheads","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/jan/09/us-to-loosen-nuclear-weapons-policy-and-develop-more-usable-warheads","fields":{"headline":"US to loosen nuclear weapons constraints and develop more 'usable' warheads","bodyText":"The Trump administration plans to loosen constraints on the use of nuclear weapons and develop a new low-yield nuclear warhead for US Trident missiles, according to a former official who has seen the most recent draft of a policy review. Jon Wolfsthal, who was special assistant to Barack Obama on arms control and nonproliferation, said the new nuclear posture review prepared by the Pentagon, envisages a modified version of the Trident D5 submarine-launched missiles with only part of its normal warhead, with the intention of deterring Russia from using tactical warheads in a conflict in Eastern Europe. The new nuclear policy is significantly more hawkish that the posture adopted by the Obama administration, which sought to reduce the role of nuclear weapons in US defence. Arms control advocates have voiced alarm at the new proposal to make smaller, more “usable” nuclear weapons, arguing it makes a nuclear war more likely, especially in view of what they see as Donald Trump’s volatility and readiness to brandish the US arsenal in showdowns with the nation’s adversaries. The NPR also expands the circumstances in which the US might use its nuclear arsenal, to include a response to a non-nuclear attack that caused mass casualties, or was aimed at critical infrastructure or nuclear command and control sites. The nuclear posture review (NPR), the first in eight years, is expected to be published after Donald Trump’s State of the Union speech at the end of January. Wolfsthal, who has reviewed what he understands to be the final draft of the review, said it states that the US will start work on reintroducing a sea-launched nuclear cruise missile, as a counter to a new ground-launched cruise missile the US has accused Russia of developing in violation of the 1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) treaty. Wolfsthal said that earlier drafts of the NPR was even more hawkish. The final draft drops proposals to develop a nuclear hyper-glide weapon, and to remove assurances to non nuclear weapons states that the US will not use its nuclear arsenal against them. “My read is this is a walk-back from how extreme it was early on. It doesn’t have as much terrible stuff in it as it did originally,” Wolfsthal said. “But it’s still bad.” “What I’ve been told by the people who wrote the thing was what they were trying to do was to send a clear deterrent message to Russians, the North Korean and the Chinese. And there is pretty good, moderate but strong language that makes clear that any attempt by Russia or North Korea to use nuclear weapons would result in a massive consequence for them and I think that’s actually moderate, centrist and probably very much needed.” “Where they go overboard, is where they say that in order to make that credible the US needs to develop two new types of nuclear weapons,” he added. Wolfsthal said the modified Trident warhead, with just the primary (fission) part of its thermonuclear warhead, was “totally unnecessary” as the US already has low-yield weapons, B61 gravity bombs and air-launched cruise missiles, in its arsenal. He also said it was “pretty dumb” to put a low-yield “tactical” weapon on the planned new Columbia-class ballistic missile submarines, because firing it would give away a submarine’s position. “We spend $5bn per submarine to make it invisible and we put a lot of warheads on each submarine and so what they want to do is take one missile, put one small warhead on it and launch it first, so the submarine is vulnerable to Russian attack.” Wolfsthal said. “That strikes me as being unsustainable from a naval strategy point of view.” The development of a low-yield warhead for a sea-launched ballistic missile is based on the belief that in any conflict with Russia on Nato’s eastern flank, the Russians would use a tactical nuclear weapon early on, to compensate for their relative weakness in conventional arms. The Russians, the argument goes, would count on US reluctance to use the massive warheads on its existing weapons, leading Washington to back down. Hans Kristensen, the director of the nuclear information project at the Federation of American Scientists, said that justification for developing the new weapons was incoherent. “It assumes that the intelligence community has determined that one or several adversaries out there are gambling that the US would be self-deterred from using a ballistic missile warhead because they have larger yield. Thats just not the case. We have never, ever heard anyone say that is so,” Kristensen said. “I don’t think any adversary – certainly not Russia, – would gamble that if they did something with nukes that were low yield that we would not respond. That’s completely ludicrous,” he added. “I think this is about having some warhead work at the laboratories and exploring options. I don’t see this as a real mission.” Daryl Kimball, the head of the Arms Control Association, said that the development of new weapons in the US nuclear arsenal was “dangerous, Cold War thinking”. “The United States already possesses a diverse array of nuclear capabilities, and there is no evidence that more usable weapons will strengthen deterrence of adversaries or compel them to make different choices about their arsenals,” Kimball wrote on the Arms Control Today website. He also cautioned against moves to broaden the circumstances in which nuclear weapons would be used. “The use of even a small number of these weapons would be catastrophic,” Kimball said. “Threatening nuclear attack to counter new kinds of ‘asymmetric’ threats is unnecessary, would increase the risk of nuclear weapons use, and would make it easier for other countries to justify excessive roles for nuclear weapons in their policies.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jan/09/the-guardian-view-on-the-future-of-fracking-keep-it-in-the-ground","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-09T19:30:35Z","webTitle":"The Guardian view on the future of fracking: keep it in the ground | Editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jan/09/the-guardian-view-on-the-future-of-fracking-keep-it-in-the-ground","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/jan/09/the-guardian-view-on-the-future-of-fracking-keep-it-in-the-ground","fields":{"headline":"The Guardian view on the future of fracking: keep it in the ground","bodyText":"Just a few short years ago, fracking – the underground extraction of gas from rock – was to revolutionise Britain’s energy production as it has transformed it in the US. Under David Cameron and George Osborne, it was to produce the fuel that would build a bridge from the high-carbon past to the no-carbon future. Just 18 months after the two leading politicians of their generation quit the scene, fracking’s prospects are uncertain. Now companies are preparing for a make-or-break year. On Tuesday Cuadrilla won permission from West Sussex county council to test for oil at its site in Balcombe, where five years ago hundreds of local protesters saw off the company’s efforts to explore its potential. Cuadrilla may read this as a positive message, and insists it is not interested in fracking. But well-organised objectors do not believe the company, and it may be wise not count its chickens just yet. Another of the big four frackers, Ineos, has also aroused antagonism after a freedom of information request revealed at the weekend that while it had denied in public that it wanted to prospect for gas beneath the scientifically sensitive parts of Sherwood Forest, it has in fact now acquired permission to do just that. It has also announced a legal challenge to Scotland’s fracking ban. Meanwhile, the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy is imminently expected to approve fracking by the oil and gas company Third Energy at a site in North Yorkshire. It would be the first well to be fracked in the UK since 2011. It would also be a leap of faith. After the activism of the Cameron-Osborne years, Theresa May has shown no interest. She abolished the climate change department, and sounds more concerned about cheaper energy than cleaner energy; last October’s Clean Growth strategy failed to mention fracking at all. Yet Britain is committed to huge cuts in carbon emissions by 2030 – a 57% reduction on 1990 levels. The role for shale gas needs explaining. There is a chance that what might have been a useful stopgap on the road to zero-carbon energy is running out of road to secure a return on the large investments already made. With each passing month, the advantage of leaving gas in the ground along with coal and oil gains traction. In these columns in December Mrs May stressed her commitment to tackling climate change. On Thursday she will make her first big speech on the environment. Voters care about green policy. She must come clean on fracking."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"football/2018/jan/09/arsene-wenger-arsenal-eden-hazard-penalty-chelsea-semi-final","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-09T22:30:31Z","webTitle":"Arsène Wenger still riled by Eden Hazard penalty but has to revive Arsenal","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jan/09/arsene-wenger-arsenal-eden-hazard-penalty-chelsea-semi-final","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/jan/09/arsene-wenger-arsenal-eden-hazard-penalty-chelsea-semi-final","fields":{"headline":"Arsène Wenger still riled by Eden Hazard penalty but has to revive Arsenal","bodyText":"In a week when two of his counterparts have been unable to let sleeping dogs lie, something is still biting away at Arsène Wenger too. The injustice he feels at the penalty awarded to Eden Hazard during Arsenal’s 2-2 draw with Chelsea last Wednesday has not yet faded and, when the pair meet again in Wednesday’s League Cup semi-final first leg, any repeat of a decision he called “farcical” would risk something akin to spontaneous combustion high in the Stamford Bridge stands. That is where Wenger will spend the match, as a continuing legacy of his similarly outraged reaction to West Bromwich Albion’s spot-kick on 31 December but he is not yet ready to view what he saw as a dive from Hazard at a remove. Initially misunderstanding a question about Antonio Conte’s claim that it was his “way” to query referees, he ended up inadvertently agreeing with the Chelsea manager while airing his grievances about Hazard again. “I questioned the decision of the referee. Then, we are objective. You look at the picture. You see how Hazard goes down and you see how quickly he takes the penalty when he gets the penalty,” he said of the forward’s reaction to a challenge offered by Héctor Bellerín. “If he was so injured why did he take the penalty? He made more of it, [like a] professional, basically, and shouts. I can understand that. I do not blame Hazard. He acted in a very professional way to get the penalty for his team, which he did well.” Another objective view is that it was a clear penalty and that, Hazard’s overreaction notwithstanding, Wenger’s energy is misdirected on a call nowhere near as egregious as that taken by Mike Dean at The Hawthorns. Yet it is the latter that has cost him his place in the dugout and, as he watches his team battle to retain their only chance of a domestic trophy, there will be familiar feelings of helplessness. Last February a four-match ban for pushing the fourth official Anthony Taylor – coincidentally the referee who judged Bellerín to have fouled Hazard – included a 3-1 league defeat at Stamford Bridge. He watched from a designated area in the East Stand and remembers the situation as “very uncomfortable” and “awkward”, not aided by his location near the home support or the time-consuming walk to the dressing rooms. “I will try to find a different place,” he said of Wednesday evening’s seating plan and he will hope the same can be said of his players, too. Wenger was rattled by Arsenal’s lifeless FA Cup surrender at Nottingham Forest on Sunday, describing himself as “very disappointed with some individual performances”. It is certainly not a good look when Alex Iwobi, a young player who has no business feeling sure of a future in the top bracket at this stage, is purportedly seen partying on the weekend of a Cup tie, especially when the manager subsequently felt compelled to defend his own attitude towards knockout competitions. “Nobody has won the FA Cup more than I did but still it is [seen as] an absolute disaster,” he said of the 4-2 defeat. “Get somebody to win it more and then I say, ‘OK, well done.’ But nobody in the whole history of English football won it more, so I always took the competition in a serious way. I am unhappy to go out, of course, but you must accept as well that there’s no guarantee you will win it every year.” Wenger’s next segue, though, told more about what is at stake over these two legs. His argument was unfashionable but compelling: the cups will grow in significance because, with so much money around and only one title winner, tangible reward becomes increasingly precious. “Many, many teams today invest a huge amount of money and are all hungry for trophies,” he said. “Nobody wants to fold that away. I think it will become even more important because so many teams are hungry for trophies that everybody goes for it.” The theory holds some weight, although it would require a recalibration of what, nowadays, is popularly defined as success for the top six clubs. For Arsenal anything will do at this stage and their recent attacking performances, certainly at home, suggest a return to their best cup form is not beyond them. The difficulty is that it would take supreme confidence to predict the makeup of Wenger’s squad for the rematch a fortnight from now: his eyes offered less confidence than his words when he said there had been no contact with Manchester City over Alexis Sánchez, a counterproductive presence this season whose future will be resolved if a £20m offer is accepted. Squad players like Francis Coquelin, Mohamed Elneny and even Theo Walcott could also move on; Arsenal can damage Chelsea but not if a team in flux has a significant first-leg deficit to claw back. Up in the gods, Wenger will hope a combination of his defence and – if necessary – the officials can subdue Hazard this time. It will be tough viewing from afar but perhaps he will keep good company. When he took that unsatisfactory vantage point 11 months ago, he was wrong-footed to find himself sitting next to his own gardener. An embarrassed Wenger had failed to recognise him; in the event of a repeat arrangement he might feel tempted to ask whether, just this once, everything could come up smelling of roses."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"politics/2018/jan/10/changing-drug-laws-too-much-hassle-for-tories-says-nick-clegg","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-10T00:01:33Z","webTitle":"Changing drug laws too much hassle for Tories, says Nick Clegg","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jan/10/changing-drug-laws-too-much-hassle-for-tories-says-nick-clegg","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/jan/10/changing-drug-laws-too-much-hassle-for-tories-says-nick-clegg","fields":{"headline":"Changing drug laws too much hassle for Tories, says Nick Clegg","bodyText":"The former deputy prime minister Sir Nick Clegg has accused Theresa May of “ostrich-like sticking her head in the sand” over the reform of drug laws. Clegg, who served alongside May when she was home secretary in the coalition government, said the main obstacle to much-needed reform was that politicians on the right were afraid of the “political hassle” of changing the law. Speaking at a lunch hosted by the Global Commission on Drug Policy, of which he is a member, Clegg said: “I experienced coalition with the Conservatives, and I couldn’t find a sensible Conservative who didn’t privately entirely agree that the law is a complete ass and everything should be changed. They just didn’t think it was worth the political hassle. “Our current prime minister is the exception. She is, genuinely and authentically, ostrich-like sticking her head in the sand. But most – [David] Cameron, [George] Osborne, [Oliver] Letwin, all those people – they don’t need persuading of the case, they just need persuading that it’s politically worth doing anything about it.” The commission, set up in 2011, counts among its 25 commissioners the former UN secretary general Kofi Annan, a number of former senior officials from the UN, and former presidents of Nigeria, Switzerland, Poland, Chile and Colombia. Clegg was speaking before the launch of the commission’s latest report, which calls on policymakers to change their perception of people who use drugs and the language they use to frame the debate about drug laws. “Leaders must be bold when disputing perceptions about drugs which are not grounded in facts and which may be discriminatory towards people who use drugs, and stand their ground in the face of public opinion,” the report recommends. “When political leaders choose to stoke fears about drugs and drug use in order to retain or intensify prohibition, they are indirectly causing serious hardship to some of their most vulnerable citizens.” Helen Clark, the former prime minister of New Zealand, said the stigmatising language in the debate about drugs dehumanised people who suffered as a result of drug use. “I understand in this country [the UK] at the moment there is quite a spike in drug-induced deaths,” she said. “In my country that would lead to some action, but perhaps perceptions here are such that nothing has happened.” Ruth Dreifuss, the former president of Switzerland, who is chair of the commission, said many of the negative perceptions towards drugs were enshrined in the wording of the UN conventions and declarations that form the basis of the international drugs control system. According to these documents, “there is a world drug problem, the substances are evil, the people are playing with their life and they are criminals,” Dreifuss said. The commission is calling for a review of the use of the language used in these documents at the UN Commission on Narcotic Drugs ministerial segment in 2019."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2018/jan/09/the-strong-case-for-a-citizens-wealth-fund","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-09T19:27:19Z","webTitle":"The strong case for a citizens’ wealth fund | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jan/09/the-strong-case-for-a-citizens-wealth-fund","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/jan/09/the-strong-case-for-a-citizens-wealth-fund","fields":{"headline":"The strong case for a citizens’ wealth fund","bodyText":"I strongly endorse your editorial (30 December) suggesting that a UK citizens’ wealth fund could make a major contribution to reversing the worrying growth in inequality, particularly wealth inequality, in the last few decades. The estimates by my project team suggest that it would be feasible to create a £1tn citizens’ wealth fund within a generation, partly based on making better use of our estimate of £3tn in publicly owned assets. In our view, such a “Next Generation Fund” could make an important contribution to reducing intergenerational inequality as well, and ensure that an increased level of public spending and public investment can be afforded in the future when the revenue that can be raised from taxation will be constrained by the increase in the number of older people relative to those in work. As well as the successful implementation of such schemes in countries as diverse as Norway, Singapore and Australia, they also exist on a smaller scale in the UK, including the Shetland and Orkney trusts and the crown estate. I believe that introducing a citizens’ wealth fund in the UK – not run by the government but by the people – could be the key to boosting productivity, tackling inequality, and giving citizens a new sense of control over their lives. The idea deserves cross-party support.

But it’s not as much fun, mostly because you have no real control over the end product. There are exceptions. I had a wonderful experience recently doing a four-part television adaptation of Howards End for the BBC, which was then beautifully directed by Hettie Macdonald. Nothing turns out exactly as you imagined, whether you direct your scripts or not. On director’s cuts They’re all so different. Apocalypse Now Redux, for instance, seems like this great creative experiment after the fact. I prefer the original Apocalypse Now myself, but I can see that doing the longer version so many years after was a tremendously enjoyable experiment for Coppola – just to see what the film would look like if he put absolutely everything he shot back in it. But it doesn’t seem like the kind of director’s cut that represents the director’s original frustrated intention. It’s pretty well known that Ridley Scott was unhappy with the original release of Blade Runner and that his subsequent versions were his attempts to get the film back to where he had wanted it to be all along. The extended edition of Margaret absolutely meets that description. It represents my best attempt to bring the film to life as I conceived and wrote it, and as I came to understand it as a director. On working with Martin Scorsese on Margaret Martin Scorsese stepped in when we were at a standstill in the politics of the editing process. The theatrical release represents the cut I had submitted to Fox Searchlight in 2008 or 2009. I was unhappy with it and continued working on a version of my own that I could live with. I suggested bringing Marty in as a respected third party who could work with me to create a final version of the film that everyone could be happy with. Searchlight had dug their heels in about the contracted two-and-a-half hour length – mistakenly, I think – and I’d been equally mistaken in trying to find a satisfying version of the film at that length, long after it should was obvious that I couldn’t do it. With Marty’s imprimatur on the film I thought the studio would be less apt to feel affronted if the running time increased a little – as I had learned it obviously had to if the film was to work. Marty’s always been incredibly supportive of me, but he really outdid himself this time. He worked really hard on the cut; he tried and I thought found a way to maintain the integrity of the movie while keeping the running time down. We passed the movie back and forth until we were happy, and in the end we turned in a cut that was about 12 minutes longer than the theatrical release. I signed off on it, Searchlight signed off on it but unfortunately [producer] Gary Gilbert did not. Without his OK, Searchlight couldn’t release anything over the contracted length, so they released the two-and-a-half-hour version instead. I should also say that the length of the film per se is of zero importance to me. What matters is how long it feels, and doing whatever it takes to realize the film as fully as possible. Manchester by the Sea, for instance, feels about 10 minutes too long to me. But I wouldn’t go back in to cut it down because I feel it’s about as close to what it should be as I can get it. On editing Margaret I found myself focused on what felt like a new way of telling a story on film. One of the elements that felt very different from anything else I’d ever done or seen was this idea of letting the scenes play out much more as if they were happening in real time than is normal in a movie. In Margaret I tried really hard to create a more naturalistic rhythm, so that even if it feels a bit slow at first, after a while you get absorbed into the story as if it was something you were really watching in real life. But I certainly didn’t go to all that trouble just for the sake of being different. This particular story demanded this particular treatment. For one thing, the film is about a teenager who discovers that the center of the world resides not in herself but in everybody’s self equally. And since teenagers – and some grownups too – tend to see their lives in very dramatic and cinematic terms sometimes, it was very difficult trying to tell that story effectively through conventional or ordinary cinematic means. The structure of the film exemplifies the story. Whenever we tried to shorten the scenes to meet the demands for a shorter running time, the whole film fell apart. For a long time I really thought that I could get the film down to two and a half hours and still be happy with it. But it turned out to be impossible. The two-and-a-half hour version – the theatrical version – is my best effort to meet my contractual requirements while doing the best job I could, but I never considered it finished and I was never particularly happy with it. Because I was being sued for having supposedly failed to release a cut of my own, I wasn’t able to express any preference or dissatisfaction with the theatrical release publicly. But I wouldn’t have anyway, while the film was still in release; it would have been unethical, for one thing. I did express my unhappiness behind the scenes at great length, in a vain effort to secure the release of a version I liked better. Happily they approved the extended edition, which apart from some technical deficiencies which I hope to correct some day, is very close to the movie I wanted to make in the first place. On the difficulties of director-studio diplomacy Negotiating with a studio or whoever is paying for the movie or intruding themselves into the editing process, has nothing to do with editing – except in the broadest sense which includes politics and negotiation and personal relations in the equation of any collaborative creative enterprise. When you are editing you are trying to put the movie together from thousands of pieces, shots, performances, takes; you are making decisions about the pacing, content, shape, etc, of the picture; you are trying to find a way to tell the story as best you can. Arguing with other people about how long or short the movie is or how long or short the scenes should be, assuaging generally ephemeral but extraordinarily pressing anxieties from people who are invested in and worried about the success of the film when it’s finished – all that is a totally different and unrelated process. When the two processes collide, it’s a real problem for everybody. Talking about the editing has nothing to do with the editing itself. It has to do with diplomacy, mutual trust, mutual respect, and sometimes blind faith. Working well in an adversarial environment is really hard for me. It’s not so much a test of your will; it’s a test of your concentration. I’m worried about when to cut to the next scene and which shot to use; I don’t want to be thinking about the conversation I had the day before with three people in California. But the fact remains that the director is not the only person with a stake in how the movie turns out and if I could do things differently, I’d do them very differently. I think I had a lot more authority than I realized – I think in a way the studio and I felt bullied by each other and didn’t realize we were doing any bullying. I know that had they taken a leap and left me alone in the first place, and been patient, the movie would have turned out beautifully and on time and that the extra length would have been self-evidently justified. But since they were unable to do that it’s pretty clear that I failed to find a way around their concerns and apprehensions. It doesn’t work to just say, ‘Please trust me, leave me alone, and it’ll be all right.’ People get very anxious when they write those checks; they want to know what’s going on. I don’t know that they would’ve accepted a three-hour movie no matter what, but had I been more vigilant in dealing with and calming their fears instead of just trying to get them off my back, I would’ve probably served myself better and they might have accepted a longer cut of the film in the end. It’s possible there no was good solution at the time. I’m very happy they paid for the Extended Edition and we all get along fine now – most of us, anyway.

Last night began Next of Kin (ITV), a six-part thriller that puts Archie Panjabi – Kalinda the Semi-Murderous Sexbomb PI Extraordinaire in The Good Wife – at last front and centre, where she belongs. She plays Mona Shirani, a Pakistan-born, London-bred GP, in whose house her extended family are gathering to welcome home her brother Kareem from his latest stint out at the medical charity he runs in Lahore.

And while plot points are sown – Kareem’s son Danny, they discover, left the country weeks ago and not for Spain as he claimed – and tensions heightened by a terrorist bomb in the city, it is the family’s shock and grief that are most comprehensively charted. The all but wordless sorrow of Mona and Kareem’s mother (Shabana Azmi) posed the silent question that most of us have when we hear about the executions of hostages and terrorists alike – how does anyone they leave behind bear it? Every one somebody’s son. By the end of the opening episodes, fissures in the family are beginning to appear and suspicions to bud. Why is Mrs Shirani the only one to have her grandson’s new phone number? Guy (Jack Davenport, playing an almost-likable corporate smoothie), Mona’s British-born-and-bred husband, moves too easily for her comfort to the questions of whether Danny has been radicalised. A cousin didn’t meet him when he said he would; he was at loggerheads with his dad. If Danny has found solace in the ideologies of terrorism, who will be to blame? I suspect from the trailer to next week’s episode – which teased numerous shenanigans, including Mona galloping off to Lahore to launch a one-woman investigation into her nephew’s whereabouts – that the series will not be interested in drilling too deeply into many of these questions. But it was, if nothing else, refreshing to see a Muslim family portrayed so naturally – a gaggle of individuals bound by love, frustrations and jokes and whose normality is as suddenly and thoroughly upended by tragedy as anyone’s could be. Let us grant ourselves a boon and turn our faces towards unadulterated, real-life joy, namely, First Dates Hotel (Channel 4). The second series of the spin-off began last night and I am already a fibrillating mass of happiness. The setting is different – a beautiful hotel in Campania, Italy – but the formula, praise be, is the same. Our singletons are matched by unseen toilers hoping to let love blossom rather than televisual carnage lay waste to hope and human hearts. There is kindness and generosity at its core instead of the brutal pursuit of humiliation and ratings. Nursery assistant Kaylee – sweet, funny, direct, charming – was matched with Keiren, a highly depilated and personable bricklayer from Essex, but by the time of their date had already lost her heart to another (and remarkably similar, so no shame should attach to those unseen toilers, who so nearly got it right) hotel resident, Charlie. They sparked and sparkled together by the edge of the pool that morning, but she must wait in trepidation while he goes on a date with Jayda, his arranged match. Jayda is 10 gallons of hotness poured into a two-ounce bikini. In his interview, Charlie says that, after a lot of fun in his 20s, he is looking to become the man he should be. We must all have faith in Charlie. I could write a book about the beauty of what unfolds between middle-aged Vanessa – brokenhearted by both a fleeting marriage to a chancer she met on holiday and bad news from the vet about her cat – and 55-year-old Julian, one of life’s natural nurturers, but I cannot do it justice here. My tear-stained notes read: “She’s broken but he can MEND her! He SEES her!” In their post-date interview, they nuzzle each other and he tells her there is an even lovelier person and even bigger character inside her waiting to come out. And there is! We can all see it! And he can, too! Oh, it’s too much, I tell you. Just watch it. Thank you, toilers. Your work here is done."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jan/08/churchill-genius-working-class-radicalism-darkest-hour-wartime-labour-pro-fascist-british-elite","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-08T17:20:03Z","webTitle":"Churchill’s genius was understanding how to keep working-class radicalism in check | Paul Mason","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jan/08/churchill-genius-working-class-radicalism-darkest-hour-wartime-labour-pro-fascist-british-elite","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/jan/08/churchill-genius-working-class-radicalism-darkest-hour-wartime-labour-pro-fascist-british-elite","fields":{"headline":"Churchill’s genius was understanding how to keep working-class radicalism in check","bodyText":"‘For days past there has been no real news and little possibility of inferring what is really happening,” wrote George Orwell in his diary, on 28 May 1940. “Last night, E[ileen] and I went to the pub to hear the 9 o’c news. The barmaid was not going to have it on if we had not asked her, and to all appearances nobody listened.” That was the second day of the Dunkirk evacuation, and just hours after Churchill had made his speech to the Cabinet, which said: “If this long island story of ours is to end, let it end only when each one of us lies choking in his own blood upon the ground”. By 28 May Belgium had surrendered, the French army collapsed and fighter cover for thousands of troops massing for evacuation on the beach at Dunkirk was exhausted. Yet an educated insider like Orwell had to guess at what was happening and most people in the country didn’t care. We’ve had two biopics of Churchill in the last 12 months and a spectacular movie about Dunkirk, but none of them really captures the peril Britain was in – and none of them adequately frames Churchill’s heroism for what it was. My grandparents – miners who had lived through the 1926 general strike – couldn’t wait to see the back of Churchill and voted him out at the first opportunity in 1945. That was because he had been on the wrong side not just of history but of statecraft for most of his political career: wrong at Gallipoli, squandering the lives of 45,000 troops through bad planning and hubris; a vindictive class warrior, from Tonypandy in 1910 to the general strike and an outright racist in his rationalisation of imperial rule in India. Churchill had told Mussolini that the fascist dictator had “rendered a service to the world” by destroying the Italian labour movement. “If I had been an Italian, I am sure I should have been whole-heartedly with you from the start to finish in your triumphant struggle against the bestial appetites and passions of Leninism,” he announced, during a visit to Italy in 1927. On the principle that all good stories are about redemption, it should not have been hard to turn Churchill’s triumph of May 1940 into a cracking yarn – and Darkest Hour, which opens this week starring Gary Oldman, by all accounts does a decent job. The problem is, even now few people watching these movie portrayals understand what was at stake during the Dunkirk crisis. And that is because so few retellings of the story are prepared to confront its class dimension. Class divisions and antagonisms were enormous in the Britain of 1940. The scale of elite collusion in the effort to appease Hitler was unknown by most members of the public. The scale of the military disaster unfolding was also unknown. And, as Orwell repeatedly recorded, very few people were interested in news about the war. Unlike today, where tabloids and broadcast news programmes deliberately dumb down news content to keep a mass audience engaged, journalists in the 1940s kept it straight, self-censored, boring and therefore largely unintelligible. The front page of the Daily Mirror, for example, on 28 May 1940, assured its readers that the Germans had been “checked” in a “big battle”. Page two led with a story about the French “generalissimo” Weygand meeting King Leopold of Belgium; the Reuters correspondent captured the detail that Weygand “entered a village inn and ordered a cup of coffee and an omlette” but omitted the fact that Leopold had just surrendered the entire Belgian army to the Nazis. When tens of thousands of troops returned, defeated, the national mood radicalised. Orwell’s diaries describe May 1940 as the beginning of a “revolutionary situation”, which would unfold as London and other cities were smashed by the Luftwaffe. A month after Dunkirk, Orwell wrote, privately, that “the belief in direct treachery in the higher command is now widespread, enough so to be dangerous …” Though he discounted stories that the officers at Dunkirk had fled, leaving ordinary soldiers in the lurch, he recorded their widespread acceptance and understood its political significance. Churchill’s choice to fight – even though, as the writer of the Oldman movie claims, he veered dangerously close to the idea of a compromise with Hitler – was the result of a patriotic calculation. If you don’t fight, you lose the empire, was one line of argument. The other, implicit, but understood above all by the Labour moderates around the Cabinet table of the all-party coalition – Clement Attlee and Arthur Greenwood – was about domestic politics. Boris Johnson, in his recent biography of Churchill, constructs a convincing alt-history around the question: what would have happened to the world in a “non-Churchill universe”? Nazi tyranny across Europe is the answer – but Johnson can’t quite bring himself to complete the picture by asking what it might have done to British politics. The answer is, they would have exploded. In a non-Churchill universe, the Labour leaders, under pressure from their mass base, might never have joined the National Government. They would certainly have broken with it if, under cover of a semi-press blackout, the British government had handed Malta, Gibraltar and some African colonies to Germany and then sued for a separate peace. To sell that peace to the public, the entire supercilious apparatus of the media, monarchy and civil service would have been deployed. Churchill’s genius in 1940 was not just that he understood the military situation, but that he understood the dynamics of the British class system and what kept working-class radicalism in check better than any Conservative member of the cabinet. Both the current Churchill biopics portray him as a flawed elitist, past his prime, drawing on emotion and willpower to make an otherwise inexplicable break with his blundering past. Meanwhile the Dunkirk movie portrays Britain as a kind of sepia postcard, in which people manning the flotilla boats stand like model figurines against fragments of Nimrod from Elgar’s Enigma Variations. Though all three films are eminently watchable, it is important to understand that a false reality is being constructed, in which class conflict, ignorance and the deep pro-fascist sympathies of the large sections of the British elite are edited out. Once you factor them back in, the redemptive character of Churchill’s actions become all the more impressive."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"cities/2018/jan/16/beginning-end-trump-real-estate-empire","type":"article","sectionId":"cities","sectionName":"Cities","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-16T07:15:18Z","webTitle":"Is this the beginning of the end of Trump's real estate empire?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2018/jan/16/beginning-end-trump-real-estate-empire","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/cities/2018/jan/16/beginning-end-trump-real-estate-empire","fields":{"headline":"Is this the beginning of the end of Trump's real estate empire?","bodyText":"It takes all of 30 seconds for the doorman at Trump Place to kick me out of the building. “Ma’am, you need to leave,” he says, when I tell him I am a journalist. Then he practically shoves me out the marble lobby, back through the revolving doors . Tensions are high at Trump Place, 200 Riverside Boulevard. The luxury condominium complex on New York’s Upper West Side is currently embroiled in an increasingly contentious legal battle with the Trump family. Like many of the towers bearing the Trump brand, 200 Riverside Boulevard isn’t actually owned by the Trumps; it simply licenses the name, which is plastered on the building in big brass letters. And now many residents don’t want it any more. Audrey Nelson lives with her boyfriend in Trump Place. Speaking to me on the street outside, she explains that the condo board surveyed residents about the Trump branding following the 2016 election. “Most people want to get rid of it,” she says. But DJT Holdings, a company largely owned by Donald Trump, got wind of this and was threatening the building with legal action. “I don’t think we’re supposed to talk about it,” says another resident, eyeing me suspiciously. Plastering the Trump brand – which can cost tens of millions of dollars to lease – on your luxury hotel or apartment complex once added a veneer of prestige and upped profitability; Trump used to boast it would increase a property’s value by 25%. Licensing his name certainly seems to have increased his personal fortune. A financial summary Trump issued when he kicked off his presidential campaign in 2015 valued his “real estate licensing deal, brand and branded developments” at $3.3bn – the most significant single source of what Trump then claimed to be an $8.7bn total net worth. While these numbers are impossible to verify and have been the subject of much debate, it is unambiguous that the Trump brand has traditionally been a source of considerable value. That may no longer be the case. Since the Donald embarked upon his political career his surname appears to have become a liability. Speaking to me over the phone, previous 200 Riverside Boulevard tenants told me that Trump’s foray into politics has been disastrous for property prices. Harvey and Peggy Koeppel put their apartment on the market just before the 2016 election. “It sat there for months,” Harvey Koeppel says, until they were forced to “accept 10% less than their asking price”. It’s not just the Koeppels who have seen the value of their Trump-associated property fall. According to a recent report by CityRealty, a real estate listings and research service, prices in the 11 Trump-branded condo buildings in Manhattan dropped below the borough average for the first time ever at the end of 2017. While the average price per square foot for all Manhattan condos fell by 1%, the price per square foot for condos in Trump buildings fell 7% in the 12 months to November 2017. “Any building that chooses to end its association with the Trump brand is likely motivated by financial reasons … [and] no doubt greatly influenced by beliefs about how the brand affects the building’s bottom line,” says Gabby Warshawer, director of research for CityRealty. All of which, she says, raises “questions about the viability of the Trump brand”. Indeed, just down the road from where I’m standing, three other apartment buildings were also once known as Trump Place. Just eight days after the 2016 election, the rental buildings rebranded as 140, 160 and 180 Riverside Boulevard, after hundreds of the building’s residents petitioned the owner, Equity Residential, to “dump the Trump name”. The brand no longer signified premium, but prejudice, said residents: it had become an embarrassment. (The Trump Organization declined multiple times to contribute to this story.) More recently, a hybrid hotel and condo building in downtown Manhattan also disassociated itself from the president, rebranding from Trump SoHo to the Dominick last December. The building’s owners bought out the Trump Organization’s management contract following unrelenting bad press and reports of low occupancy, some of which, to be fair, predated Trump’s entering the White House. In 2006 construction of the building was halted when human remains from an old burial ground were discovered on the site, and a construction worker died after falling 42 floors from the building in 2008. The Manhattan District Attorney’s office also opened a criminal case (which it dropped last October) against Donald Jr and Ivanka Trump, investigating them for misleading investors about the value of the SoHo hotel. With this chequered history, things still took a turn for the worse when Trump entered the White House: 11 of the 12 NBA teams that had once stayed at Trump SoHo boycotted the hotel and Koi, a high-end sushi restaurant that had once been frequented by celebrities, closed in April 2017 after seeing a slump in business that may have related to the new president. Even the Trump Organization itself seems to have realized that the family name has depreciated in value. In late 2016 Trump Hotels announced a new hotel brand aimed at millennials – called Scion.The choice of name perhaps reflected prevailing public opinion towards the Trump hotel collection. YouGov data compiled exclusively for Guardian Cities shows that high-income Americans have a dramatically lower impression of Trump-branded hotels than they do other hotel brands at the same price point. While Americans with a family income of more than $100,000 had positive impressions of the Ritz-Carlton, JW Marriott, Four Seasons, Westin and Omni hotel brands, sentiment of Trump hotels alone was overwhelmingly negative: reaching a high of -5.4 in November and a low of -17.1. (YouGov first started tracking attitudes towards Trump brands in June 2017). By comparison, impressions of Ritz-Carlton were 44.6 in November. But not everyone is pessimistic about the long-term prospects of the Trump name. “The fact that a few Trump affiliated hotels are changing brands is insignificant when you consider the same could be said of a hundred other hotel brands,” says John W O’Neill, a professor at the Center for Hospitality Real Estate Strategy at Pennsylvania State University. “Hotel owners change brands for all sorts of reasons, so it isn’t necessarily negative.” For example, it is possible that some leases may have been up for renewal. What’s more, some of Trump’s properties are booming thanks to his presidency. Trump’s DC hotel is making record profits and, according to the president’s last financial disclosure about his business assets, released last June, income from his Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach was around $37m, up from $30m in his May 2016 financial report. But these properties seem to be very much the exception not the rule, particularly if one looks at the state of his brand outside the US: the Trump name is being scrubbed from skylines all over the world. In the two-and-a-half years since he announced his presidential bid, his brand has come off at least seven buildings in four cities: Panama, New York, Rio, and Toronto. Trump-branded hotels in Vancouver and Chicago are also rumoured to be attempting to sever their ties. Canadians, in particular, have been very clear that they don’t want the Trump name associated with their cities. In December 2015, shortly after he called Mexicans “rapists” and criminals, Toronto councillor Josh Matlow campaigned to get the owners of what was then the Trump Tower to change the building’s name. “Toronto’s city motto is ‘diversity our strength’,” says Matlow now. “My view, along with many other Torontonians, was there no place for Trump’s name in the skyline of the world’s most diverse city.” In June 2017 the building’s owners spent millions of dollars exiting their contract with the Trump Organization and the Toronto skyline is now Trump-free. Matlow concedes that “a number of ingredients” factored into the decision to remove Trump’s name, including legal battles by unhappy investors over poor management of the development itself. The final decision was likely “a combination of financial trouble – and then Donald Trump imploding his own brand due to his hateful and divisive rhetoric”. Today the only Trump-branded hotel left in Canada is in Vancouver, and there are rumoursit may not last there. Brent Toderian, Vancouver’s former chief planner, says he spoke out as soon as the name was first attached to the building, saying “that the Trump name and brand was incompatible with Vancouver’s brand”. His feelings are widely shared. Vancouver mayor Gregor Robertson refused to attend the opening ceremony of the hotel last year, telling reporters at the time that Trump’s brand had “no more place on Vancouver’s skyline than his ignorant ideas have in the modern world”. The Trump name may also soon also be scrubbed from Central America. In 2015 owners of the Trump Ocean Club, a luxury apartment building in Panama City, fired Trump’s management company and removed his name from the building. The Trump name remained on the adjoining hotel, with whom the Trump Organization had a separate agreement, but there have been multiple reports that the owners are now looking to follow suit: the Trump name is hurting business. Data shared with Guardian Cities shows that occupancy rates for Trump Panama in the beginning of January was around 25%, well below the 43.7% average occupancy for luxury hotels in Panama in January 2017 recorded by STR, a data and analytics specialist. “Not even the US embassy staff stay at the hotel,” says a source close to the matter who wished to remain anonymous, citing the Trump Organization’s proclivity for litigation. “We’re at the heart of the hispanic world and he’s alienated most everyone in Latin America and most of the rest of the world. The hotel unit owners are desperate.” (On Friday the US ambassador to Panama resigned, saying he could no longer serve under the Trump administration.) With so many buildings publicly cutting ties with the president, or seeking to, are we witnessing the beginning of the end of Trump’s real estate empire? One industry expert, who also wished to remain anonymous, says they doubt the Trump name has long-term viability on either residential buildings or hotels. “My instinct says [Trump] is going to end up in a bad situation and developers are going to want to distance themselves. The damage to the name is already profound and will only get worse.” There are ample signs that the longer Trump remains in DC, the less welcome his name will be in cities around the world. While the president may be “a very stable genius”, his real estate empire is beginning to look more than a little shaky.

The BBC is also facing the prospect of lawsuits from female employees who believe they have been paid less than men for doing the same jobs. The EHRC has the power to bring legal action – as well as name-and-shame organisations about inequality and discrimination – and its intervention into the pay row is embarrassing for the BBC. A spokesperson for the public body said: “We are aware of claims by Carrie Gracie of unlawful pay discrimination at the BBC. Women have a legal right to equal pay with men for equal work. “We will be writing to the BBC and requiring them to provide us with information on their pay policy and the facts in this individual case. We will consider whether further action is required based on this information.” Gracie announced her resignation in an explosive open letter that was published on her website on Sunday. She accused the BBC of breaking pay laws and said she did not trust management to deal with gender inequality. The journalist, who has worked for the BBC for 30 years, said the corporation had offered to increased her pay from £135,000 a year to £180,000 but she refused because it did not guarantee her equality with its other international editors. Jon Sopel, the BBC’s North America editor, collects between £200,000 to £249,999. The corporation also became embroiled in a censorship row on Monday after it emerged that journalists who tweeted support for Gracie were blocked from presenting on-air segments about the pay row. Dozens of the biggest names at the BBC, including Today presenter Mishal Husain and Newsnight host Evan Davis, backed Gracie on social media after her letter was published. Many used the hashtag #istandwithcarrie. More than 130 female employees at the BBC signed a statement expressing their “wholehearted” support for Gracie and calling for action to ensure equal pay for equal jobs. However, editors at the BBC moved to enforce its editorial guidelines by stopping journalists reporting on the issue if they had supported Gracie or have been campaigning for pay equality. The BBC said: “Where a presenter or reporter has publicly expressed a view on a particular issue, they would no longer be perceived as an impartial voice, therefore it is right they do not conduct interviews on that issue. This is in keeping with editorial guidelines.” The City lawyer advising Gracie said she and other female BBC staff could sue if the corporation failed to deal with the pay gap internally. Gracie had a grievance hearing in November but is yet to hear the result so concluded that “enough was enough” and resigned. Jennifer Millins, employment partner at Mishcon de Reya, is advising more than 10 senior women at the BBC. She said: “They don’t feel their complaints are being dealt with in a meaningful way. The process has taken a very long time. If the BBC does not resolve this internally, then individuals will be forced to sue.” Asked what the chances were of the BBC resolving the issue internally, Millins said: “Low.” Up to 200 women at the BBC have made a formal complaint about pay. This includes a collective grievance lodged on behalf of 121 women by the National Union of Journalists. Michelle Stanistreet, the general secretary of the NUJ, said: “Carrie is one of many women at the BBC who are not being paid equally compared to male journalists doing the same jobs or work of equal value. “The initial shock that many women felt was accompanied by hopes that the BBC would do the right thing – this has been replaced by a mounting sense of anger and frustration that a swifter resolution has not been reached to this scourge of unequal pay at our public service broadcaster.” The pay row began last summer when the BBC published a list of its top-earning stars, which revealed that only a third were women and the top seven were all men. In response to heavy criticism, the BBC published a series of pay reviews and audits in October that concluded that men were being paid 9.3% more than women on average – less than the UK average of 18.1% – but that there is “no systemic discrimination against women”. However, this judge-led review did not include the vast majority of on-air presenters, editors and senior managers, sparking frustration among women at the BBC. The review also found that in about one in 10 cases where there was substantial difference in pay between men and women doing similar jobs there was no clear reason for the disparity other than gender and it did not rule out individual cases of discrimination. The row is likely to take a further twist when the BBC publishes a highly-anticipated report by accountancy firm PwC into the pay of on-air staff, which is expected within the next couple of weeks. BBC insiders say this will analyse whether there are discrepancies in pay and that the corporation will “stand by the judgements be they helpful or unhelpful”. However, Millins said: “I suspect time and money is being thrown at it [the report] but whether it will be significant is another matter.” In response to the EHRC’s intervention, a BBC spokesperson said: “The BBC was one of the first to publish a gender pay report showing we are significantly better than national average. We have already published an independent judge lead equal pay report for rank and file staff, which showed no systemic discrimination. “Also a PwC led report on presenter pay will be published shortly and people will be able to make informed judgements on that report and how we act on it.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/shortcuts/2018/jan/08/tiny-french-village-treasure-hunters-rennes-le-chateau","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-08T16:02:00Z","webTitle":"Le gold rush: why a tiny French village is a magnet for treasure hunters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/shortcuts/2018/jan/08/tiny-french-village-treasure-hunters-rennes-le-chateau","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/shortcuts/2018/jan/08/tiny-french-village-treasure-hunters-rennes-le-chateau","fields":{"headline":"Le gold rush: why a tiny French village is a magnet for treasure hunters","bodyText":"For more than 50 years, tales of buried gold have sent the curious, conspiracy theorists and treasure hunters to the tiny hilltop village of Rennes-le-Château near Carcassonne in south France. Many have dug or dynamited holes around and under the church of Saint Mary Magdalene, where the mysterious former priest Abbé Bérenger Saunière, who went from rags to riches, is rumoured to have interred a trove of gold coins and jewels before taking the secret of their whereabouts to his grave. Over the decades, nothing much apart from skulls and bones has ever emerged, but still the gold-diggers with pickaxes and explosives come to Rennes-Le-Château, flouting a 1960s ban on unauthorised digging after complaints the village was fast becoming a “Swiss cheese”. Last week, police were called to investigate the latest bout of vandalism: a large hole under the church wall. The myth of mysterious hidden treasure at Rennes-le-Château emerged in the 1950s, boosted by this part of the Languedoc region’s colourful history and rumours that it conceals not just pots of gold but also religious relics including the body of Jesus Christ, the holy grail and the ark of the covenant. The modern treasure hunt has its roots in the 1880s, when Saunière, an impoverished Catholic priest, appears to have come into a fortune that enabled him to throw money around to renovate the church. The clergyman refused to say how he came into his sudden wealth before he died in 1917. In the 1970s, Rennes-le-Château mania reached its height with treasure hunters using explosives to smash through stone walls, digging into burial areas and sewers and tunnelling into the church before going away empty-handed. Such was the damage done by gravediggers, the then local mayor Jean-François L’Huillier was forced to have Saunièr’s body dug up and reburied. “He’s at peace at last under a three-tonne sarcophagus surrounded by five cubic metres of concrete,” L’Huillier told me in 2004. Then, just as a kind of peace also descended on Rennes-le-Château, the mystery was resurrected with Dan Brown’s bestselling The Da Vinci Code, whose plot included the claim that Jesus did not die on the cross but survived, married Mary Magdalene and fled to France. One of the thriller’s main characters is named Jacques Saunière. Rennes-le-Château’s deputy mayor, Marcel Captier, said the latest hole-digging had awakened bad memories of previous attacks by vandals. “Above all, this kind of thing mustn’t start happening again. We don’t want to find ourselves with another wave of treasure hunters,” Captier told Le Parisien. Most historians have concluded the treasure never existed and Saunière raised money through criminal means, including stealing donations and charging for mass services. Another theory is even more prosaic: a local hotelier, lamenting a lack of guests and his own failure to find any treasure, made the story up."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/jan/08/andy-murray-hip-surgery-stubbornness-succeed-recovery-daughter","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-08T15:30:14Z","webTitle":"Andy Murray’s stubbornness to succeed is crucial to his recovery from surgery | Kevin Mitchell","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/jan/08/andy-murray-hip-surgery-stubbornness-succeed-recovery-daughter","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/jan/08/andy-murray-hip-surgery-stubbornness-succeed-recovery-daughter","fields":{"headline":"Andy Murray’s stubbornness to succeed is crucial to his recovery from surgery","bodyText":"Andy Murray’s decision to go under the knife in a Melbourne hospital on Monday morning – defying a swathe of expert and amateur opinion – looks like it has mended not only his right hip but revitalised the stubborn streak that has made the Scot such a remarkable player. It would seem he is not done yet, not by a long way. There should be no doubt, though: Murray may have put his faith in one of the world’s best hip surgeons (a friend he has known for nine years, it emerged) but this was a calculated gamble. Plenty of players have tried hip surgery and discovered their playing days were pretty much done. There are no guarantees but Dr John O’Donnell looks to have delivered Murray the result he will treasure alongside winning any of his three grand slams, two Olympic gold medals and reaching the pinnacle of his sport, when he ground his peers into submission in an astonishing run of 24 unbeaten matches in 2016 to unseat Novak Djokovic as the world No1. Murray paid the price for that surge of manic passion when his body collapsed six months ago. Since then he has endured not only the misery of tedious rehab – his preferred option – but other false dawns and setbacks, first at the US Open, when he withdrew two days before the tournament, minor groin surgery on 18 December and further drama last week in Brisbane when he cancelled his scheduled comeback. Now, though, he can smile a little. Dr O’Donnell was, Murray says, “very happy about how it went”. While “it” remains a vague entity, Murray, mercurial as ever, described the problem and the cure in the most general terms. What we do know is there was immense and constant pain. For the first time he elaborated on the suffering on the day he lost to Sam Querrey in the quarter-finals at Wimbledon but the causes he chose to keep to himself. “At Wimbledon, everything was hurting. I had never been in pain like that before. The thing that was stopping me from playing – and the reason I decided to have the surgery – was I was struggling to do extensions. Any time I had to sprint, with my right leg behind me, or like when I was walking, I was in pain. I could move about 80% [efficiently] but that last 10, 15 or 20%, when I would have to sprint or move extremely fast or very explosively, I wasn’t able to do it. It wasn’t that my leg couldn’t get into those positions. I was stopping myself extending my leg because of the pain.” Murray worried about surgery; he had come through a back operation in late 2013 and was not keen to go through the process again but he put his total trust in O’Donnell at St Vincent’s hospital. “It depends on what they see when they go in there,” Murray said of the risk factor. “When you look at my hip on an MRI scan just now, it doesn’t look very good. Most tennis players’ hips, if you scanned them, wouldn’t look particularly good. If he said: ‘Right, I’m going to literally do everything to have your hip look clear on an MRI scan’, the potential is that the time out [would be] long – and also there is a good chance you don’t recover to a level to play tennis. “When we discussed it with him, it was, look, let’s try to do as little as possible with the highest chance of success but with the knowledge that, when he goes there if there’s things he sees that need to be done, he repairs and sorts them. That is what he did.” Murray described the fraught final moments in a Brisbane hotel, where he sat alone for 10 hours, mulling over his future. “The decision was made on Wednesday, late afternoon or evening. But, on the Tuesday night when I withdrew from the tournament, I had pretty much made my mind up. I met with John on the Wednesday. He’s one of the best in the world and he’s known me since I was 20, 21 years old, I’ve seen him lots of times over the years and felt like he was the right person to do it. “In terms of how I recover from it, I don’t need to say: ‘Yeah, I’m going to get back to being the best in the world, or try to compete for the biggest tournaments.’ A lot of it is down to your determination and your work ethic and how well you rehab, how much you listen and do all the correct things. “We have to wait and see how all of that goes and how I recover. When I start playing again I won’t have played a match for 10 or 11 months. But it’s not like I’ve had surgery after Wimbledon and haven’t hit a ball until now. I was practising daily pretty much through to the US Open and then after having three weeks off post-US Open I’ve been hitting balls for the last three or four months. Hopefully I’ll be hitting balls on the court after seven or eight weeks. “It’s not like I’m going to not hit a tennis ball for eight months and then practise for two months and then start playing again. I’ve been fairly competitive with top 50 players in the world in Brisbane, when I’ve been struggling to move, and I made the quarter-finals at Wimbledon when I literally couldn’t walk. So, if I can get myself to 95% of my best, I believe that’s enough to compete at the highest level. No question.” Murray admitted he has thought about hip surgery after he stops playing. “From speaking to a lot of people who have had [hip replacements], they are extremely successful and that’s always an option when you are older. “When I’ve been doing nothing for the last five or six days, then I can cope. My hip is not massively sore; I just have to walk with a bit of a limp. But the reason for having it done was to allow me to get back competing and play tennis. That’s what I want to keep doing and I’m not finished playing tennis yet. “I had spoken to my wife about [surgery]. One of the things I would like to do is play until my eldest daughter is able to watch me and have a small understanding of what it is I’ve done for my living. That’s one of the things that’s motivated me to keep playing. “The rest of my body feels fantastic. I feel really good physically, apart from this one issue. The surgery allows me to extend my hip well and I’ll be able to sprint. I think I’m going to be back on the court competing at the highest level again.” Others were not sure. Murray was never in doubt."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"society/2018/jan/08/we-need-to-raise-taxes-to-fund-our-care-needs","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-08T19:06:42Z","webTitle":"We need to raise taxes to fund our care needs | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jan/08/we-need-to-raise-taxes-to-fund-our-care-needs","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/jan/08/we-need-to-raise-taxes-to-fund-our-care-needs","fields":{"headline":"We need to raise taxes to fund our care needs","bodyText":"The obvious answer to saving the NHS is to train and recruit more care workers in both the NHS and social care – which would not only (alone) meet current crying care needs but provide good professional human-interface jobs in the coming hi-tech age (killing two currently worrying birds with one stone). This does, however, mean raising more public revenue by getting people to pay more taxes. But to achieve this we must first counter the common idea that providing something that people want, and raising the revenue to provide it by appropriate pricing, is a clear case of “positive wealth creation” if done in the private sector – not only creating wealth for the sector in question (which may be private healthcare, as in the US) but stimulating activity in the rest of the economy – but is simply a “negative burden” if done in the public sector. Providing separate healthcare budgets, linking specific tax increases to specific public care improvements (disinterring what we need to pay for care from more general taxation), which I think Chris Ham is recommending, may be the best way to get people to focus on the real issues. But until the debilitating myth of private good / public doubtful is scotched, we will not reach square one in solving our current healthcare crisis.

The Washington-based organisation said that much of the rich west was running at full capacity as a result of a broad-based upswing in activity, but were now vulnerable to a period of rising inflation that would prompt action from central banks. Launching the Bank’s global economic prospects, the lead author Franziska Ohnsorge said: “There could be faster than expected inflation that would mean faster than expected interest rate hikes.” Ohnsorge added that stock markets were at levels similar to those seen before the Wall Street Crash of 1929, while bond markets were assuming that low inflation would keep official borrowing costs down. “Financial markets are vulnerable to unforeseen negative news. They appear to be complacent,” she said, while announcing that the Bank has revised up its 2018 forecast for the global economy following a better than expected performance in the US, China, the eurozone and Japan in 2017. In its half-yearly assessment, the Bank said a recovery in manufacturing, investment and trade would mean global growth of 3.1% this year, up from the 2.9% pencilled in last June. But it warned the acceleration in growth would be temporary unless governments implemented structural reforms to raise long-term growth potential. “The broad-based recovery in global growth is encouraging, but this is no time for complacency,” said Jim Yong Kim, the World Bank’s president. “This is a great opportunity to invest in human and physical capital. If policy makers around the world focus on these key investments, they can increase their countries’ productivity, boost workforce participation, and move closer to the goals of ending extreme poverty and boosting shared prosperity.” After a prolonged period in which its forecasts have been too optimistic, the Bank raised its 2017 projection for global growth from 2.7% to 3% and revised up estimates for both 2018 and 2019. The eurozone provided the biggest positive surprise, with its growth rate in 2017 upgraded by 0.7 points to 2.4%. The World Bank said the good news would continue in 2018, raising its forecast for the year by 0.6 points to 2.1%. There were smaller growth upgrades for the US - from 2.1% to 2.3% in 2017 and from 2.2% in 2018 - and for Japan, where growth estimates were raised by 0.2 points to 1.7% in 2017 and by 0.3 points to 1.3% in 2018. Of the leading developing economies, only India performed less strongly than the World Bank anticipated last summer, with growth of 6.7% in 2017 and 7.3% in 2018 representing downgrades of 0.5% and 0.2% respectively. But China, Russia and Brazil have all been given growth upgrades by the Bank. China’s expansion in 2017 is now put at 6.8%, up 0.3% on last June’s estimate, with a smaller 0.1 percentage point upward revision to 6.4% this year. Russia is expected to grow by 1.7% in both 2017 and 2018, an increase of 0.4 and 0.3 points respectively, while Brazil’s emergence from recession was stronger than the Bank estimated, with growth upgraded by 0.7 points to 1% in 2107 and by 0.2 points to 2% in 2018. Although heartened by the near-term growth prospects, the World Bank said its forecasts were still subject to “substantial downside risks”. These included financial stress, rising protectionism and geopolitical tension. It expressed particular concern about the longer-term threats and challenges associated with weak productivity and slowing potential growth. “Focus should now turn to the structural policies needed to boost longer-term productivity and living standards,” the report said. • Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jan/08/recycling-incinerated-waste-china-ban-25p-coffee-cups","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-08T15:22:38Z","webTitle":"Is your recycling being incinerated?

It’s time to watch our waste","bodyText":"The ban on recycled waste going to China is inevitably leading to a UK pile-up. There is every chance that some of the plastics, cardboard and paper that people have taken care to separate will end up being burned with everything that was thrown in the waste bin. It’s shocking that the UK is on the verge of burning more waste than it recycles. There are numerous councils where it is already happening, and on current trends it will soon become a national problem – but the China ban could bring that moment forward. There is a logic to generating energy from the waste that we can not recycle or reuse, but it is meant to be the last resort. What we have created instead is a market-driven system of incinerators that constantly need to be fed. As restrictions have been placed on sending rubbish to landfill, our waste has been diverted into these newly built incinerators, rather than increasing levels of recycling. In the past few years recycling of domestic waste have almost flatlined, at just over 11m tonnes per year, while incineration has grown from 5.5m tonnes in 2012-13 to over 10m in 2016-17. None of this is due to people’s reluctance to recycle, or to do their bit for the environment. Over the past 30 years I have seen time and again that people will respond positively if the local authorities make recycling facilities easy and convenient to use. Design is the key. It’s easy to build modern flats with room for kitchen waste to be collected, or to have separate street bins for recyclables, but this has often been slow to happen. There is a huge gap between the best and the worst local authority. Well-heeled Westminster council recycles 16% of the waste it collects and burns 82%. By contrast, East Riding of Yorkshire manages 63% recycling and less than a third goes to incineration. This doesn’t mean that most people in Westminster or Lewisham or Birmingham or Portsmouth or any other area with poor recycling rates can’t be bothered; it means that their councils can’t. Burning waste is not good for climate change and there are fears over the health impacts of incinerators because of the weaknesses of their air pollution monitoring systems. However, it is the sheer waste of burning a valuable resource which annoys me most. Incinerators are the ash-producing products of our make, break and throw-away culture. I personally try my best to refuse and reuse, but when I do recycle, I want the reassurance that my efforts to do so will not be betrayed by someone shoving it all into a furnace. While most individuals are happy to act, the government has failed to take responsibility for our collective impact on the world by encouraging the UK recycling companies who will turn muck into brass. The China ban shows the folly of a strategy that relies on exporting our recycling and burning the rest. A charge on incineration would level the playing field and help those who want to set up the infrastructure to recycle plastics and other materials. We also need a minimum level of recyclables included in manufactured products so that there is a bigger market for the increase in recycled materials. We urgently need to ban plastics that can’t be recycled and for businesses to set up proper systems for those that local authorities find most difficult. The polluter should pay. If it is hard to recycle certain plastics, like those on the inside of coffee cups, then we have to think radically. The 25p charge on coffee shop cups suggested by a committee of MPs would encourage us to switch to reusable cups. The charge on plastic bags changed our habits, so would this. Likewise, deposit schemes for plastic bottles, and also glass bottles, would be popular. Our use of materials needs to be a closed loop, where everything gets reused. Nature doesn’t waste anything and neither should we. Companies and consumers need a steer and a nudge from the government, but I think there is now public recognition that we value our planet and the wealth of its wildlife more than we enjoy the convenience of a plastic lined, disposable coffee cup. • Jenny Jones is the former chair of the Green party and a former deputy mayor of London"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"books/2018/jan/12/unmapped-country-stories-and-frangments-ann-quin-review","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-12T11:59:28Z","webTitle":"The Unmapped Country: Stories & Fragments by Ann Quin – review","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jan/12/unmapped-country-stories-and-frangments-ann-quin-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/jan/12/unmapped-country-stories-and-frangments-ann-quin-review","fields":{"headline":"The Unmapped Country: Stories & Fragments by Ann Quin – review","bodyText":"Reduced to an anomalous footnote in British literary history – a female, working-class, avant-garde author – Ann Quin is all too often taken as read. Yet her work is as open-ended as those sentences she regularly produced that trail off into silence, casting a spell instead of spelling out; floating away on their reserve of potentiality. As open-ended, indeed, as her life, which she took at the age of 37, swimming out to sea off Brighton’s Palace Pier in 1973. She left behind four novels – including her celebrated debut, Berg (1964) – along with scores of short-form pieces, some which now appear in a thrilling new collection of miscellanea. Spanning the author’s entire career, The Unmapped Country, edited and introduced by Jennifer Hodgson, builds up a portrait of the artist as a restless spirit, forever adventuring into the unknown. In an autobiographical skit, Quin mocks her reputation as an experimental author, attributing the Arts Council’s rejection of her grant application to their having read her last book. The diversity on display is impressive, however, as she studiously avoids getting trapped in any one style or genre. “Every Cripple Has His Own Way of Walking”, with its enchanting evocation of childhood and unflinching depiction of the decrepitude of old age, is a technically accomplished but surprisingly conventional short story. “A Double Room” is kitchen sink drama set in Patrick Hamilton territory, while “Tripticks”, which developed into the novel of the same name, recalls Donald Barthelme at his quirkiest. “Living in the Present” (1968), a Burroughsian exercise in cut-ups conducted with the American poet Robert Sward (her then lover) seems to pave the way for JG Ballard’s media-saturated The Atrocity Exhibition. Some pieces are straightforward memoir; others are clearly fiction, but there is a great deal of overlapping between the two (from this perspective, the author could be considered as a pioneer of autofiction). Quin frequently displays an ambivalent attitude towards mothers in general, and her own in particular, mirrored by a love-hate relationship with a dreary postwar England, where vegetables were still served up “as though chewed already”. She resolved to become a writer after being “struck dumb” during her Rada audition, and her work always retained a strong theatrical quality. Several stories here are monologues. The two pieces written in the early 60s for pop artist Billy Apple (another lover) give voice to the ludic, transatlantic idiom of the emerging counterculture. Inevitably, considering her recurring bouts of depression and the electroconvulsive therapy she endured, mental illness looms large. The eponymous novella offers a devastating – albeit often hilarious – critique of psychiatry. Sudden shifts in perspective are common, as one character points out during a train journey: “Already I’m thinking in the third person. Seeing us as another passenger might.” And then there is the encroachment of the sea. A girl envisions her bedridden grandmother’s legs as sticks with “barnacles and millions of half-dead fish clinging”. In “Nude and Seascape”, which channels the affectlessness of Camus, a woman’s corpse becomes an object in a gruesome still life composition: “Against the landslide he found the body alone spoilt the effect, it was really only the head that was needed. He searched for his pocket-knife, it was a little rusty, which meant it would take some time”. This struggle between order and chaos runs through Quin’s work. The husband in “Never Trust a Man Who Bathes With His Fingernails” wants to impose a tight schedule on his handyman to curtail the “impression he gives of unlimited time”. Sandra’s descent into madness, in “The Unmapped Country” (1973), takes the form of a hermeneutic disease, whereby everything – even birdsong or “the placing of twigs and leaves” in a park – is construed as a cosmic message. This is, of course, an eminently literary malady: “It takes me a long time to read now, a paragraph holds so much significance, and everything links up.” After being sectioned, she attempts in vain to piece together her hallucinatory journey: “Last events came first, the beginning at the end, or suddenly reversed, or slid into panels mid-way.” The grand narrative eludes her, leaving only “vague notes for the basis of a shape”. A subtle parallel is drawn between the signals Sandra picks up – the broadcasts she tunes into – at the height of her delirium, and the analyst’s Freudian worldview. In her journal, she scoffs at his “stupidity in listening and believing in the radio he switches on” at the beginning of each session. Although the novella remains unfinished, an alternative to the absolutist, patriarchal vision of art depicted in “Nude and Seascape” seems to emerge when Sandra dismisses her boyfriend’s pursuit of posterity through painting: “How much better to create like the Navajo Indians, beginning at sunrise in the desert, a sand painting that would be rubbed out by sundown.” Having burned her latest contribution to the hospital’s weekly art session, she elects to make “paintings with her footprints in the snow”. The temptation to go beyond the confines of the canvas or page finds its natural expression in Quin’s penchant for juxtapositions and lists. This vagabond style is the perfect vehicle for the ecstatic urge to “go over” and “live beyond” oneself. To keep on walking through the snow, like Sandra, with unlimited time on your hands. • The Unmapped Coutry: Stories &amp; Fragments is published by And Other Stories.

The opposition group on the Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead (RBWM) has formally requested for a no confidence motion to be tabled after national attention on the historic borough, home to Windsor Castle, Eton College and Ascot racecourse. Simon Dudley, the council leader, wrote to Thames Valley police last week to demand they use legal powers under the Vagrancy Act 1824 and the the Antisocial Behaviour, Crime and Policing Act 2014 against people sleeping on the streets and begging. His letter followed a series of tweets posted while on a ski holiday in the US referring to “an epidemic of rough sleeping and vagrancy in Windsor” and saying “residents have had enough of this exploitation of residents and 6 million tourists pa [per annum]”. Dudley’s actions were criticised by Theresa May, who is the MP for Maidenhead, and national and local homeless charities. Lynne Jones, leader of the opposition on RBWM, said other councillors were not consulted or informed by Dudley about the contents of his letter, which was sent while he was on holiday. “We still haven’t got any evidence-base for his claim that a ‘large number of adults’ begging in Windsor are not homeless. This is only anecdotal,” she said. The claim was inflammatory, she added. “This is a very, very sensitive issue. Anything we say as a council on this must be measured and based on facts.” The council’s efforts to tackle homelessness had been obliterated by Dudley’s call for police action before the wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, she said. “It has brought the council into disrepute and will have consequences. There have already been calls to arms by activists on Twitter and Facebook.” The opposition group on the council numbers only six out of a total of 57 councillors, meaning the motion stands little chance of being passed. “But this debate needs to happen,” said Jones, who suggested Dudley’s leadership was autocratic and overly reliant on Twitter as a means of communication. She said she had spoken briefly to Dudley on Monday morning, but there had been no sign of contrition. “That’s not his style,” she said. A request for comment from Dudley has been made."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/jan/13/a-letter-to-my-sister-who-shut-me-out-for-no-reason","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-13T06:45:51Z","webTitle":"A letter to … my sister, who shut me out for no reason","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jan/13/a-letter-to-my-sister-who-shut-me-out-for-no-reason","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jan/13/a-letter-to-my-sister-who-shut-me-out-for-no-reason","fields":{"headline":"A letter to … my sister, who shut me out for no reason","bodyText":"Growing up, you were always the sister I looked up to. You taught me kindness and forgiveness, curiosity and the right to question everything. You were my closest big sister, a surrogate mother of sorts. We all escaped the trauma of our childhood as soon as we could and, even though we moved to different countries for a time, I relished our frequent phone calls that comfortably rambled on for hours. When you married and had your first child, I was the first one you showed the ultrasound to. I was the first of our family to hold my tiny niece, the one you trusted to mind this little person when you and your husband escaped for a few hours or, occasionally, overnight. I loved this little girl fiercely, and she loved me back. I taught her to dance uninhibited, to feed imaginary drinks to her toys, and helped her to overcome her shyness. When her little brother came along, I minded your first-born and brought her in to meet her new brother in hospital. My niece and nephew visibly delighted in my company, and I in theirs. I spoiled them, taught them about nature, read to them, made them pancakes on Sunday mornings, giggled uncontrollably with them, cuddled them, and loved them both. I was a good thing in their lives. So why did you shut me out? Why did you slowly cut off all contact in recent years, not tell me when you were bringing them to visit Dad, come up with excuses when I offered to have them over to stay? Why did you pretend not to hear me calling your name when we happened to pass each other while visiting Dad in hospital? If it weren’t for your children squealing my name in excitement, you would have kept walking. Whatever it is I have done, I wish you would tell me. But I fear that I have done nothing, and that you merely wish to cut me out of your life so you don’t have to deal with your past any more. Do you remember how hurt you would be when Mum sniffed when you walked into the room? Do you realise you do that to me now? You broke my heart and I have cried and cried and cried over your coldness and exclusion. It has taken me years of work to get over the sometimes physical pain of that loss. It was a difficult road that opened old wounds but I took it. And I am stronger for it. I don’t miss you any more; you have hurt me too much. But I still miss my wonderful nephew and niece and I know they miss me. I hope, in years to come, they seek me out and we can build a relationship. I hope I gave them very happy memories.

Travellers on the Thameslink, Southern and Great Northern (TSGN) franchise have suffered the worst disruption on the network since services began in September 2014, the National Audit Office (NAO) said. The Department for Transport (DfT) implemented decisions that “have negatively impacted on passengers”, it found, although industrial action has also contributed towards delays and cancellations. A report released on Wednesday noted that the “complex and ambitious” franchise run by Govia Thameslink has the highest passenger numbers in the country and includes four major train services operating on a very congested part of the railway. DfT officials failed to grasp the potential impact on passengers of combining an increase in capacity, targets to improve services and the expansion of driver-only operated trains, which led to strikes by trade union members. As well as a collapse in service, auditors have also uncovered additional costs to the public purse of potentially tens of millions of pounds a year. The report said the department expects to pay Govia Thameslink following alterations to train services and to reflect delays to the delivery of new trains. Responding to the report, rail unions said that the transport secretary at the time, Chris Grayling, and his predecessor, Patrick McLoughlin, should be held to account for mishandling the franchise. Mick Whelan, general secretary of Aslef, the train drivers’ union, said: “On their watch, as the secretaries of state for transport, they let the DfT get it wrong. Passengers have suffered, totally unnecessarily, and taxpayers have had to pick up the bill. The company got it totally wrong – with the connivance of the DfT – now we want heads to roll.” The head of the RMT, Mick Cash, whose union has been embroiled in a dispute with Southern over the role of guards for 20 months, said wasted money could have guaranteed a guard on the trains. “It was instead wasted propping up the private owners while they presided over the worst rail franchise in the country. This is a scandal of epic proportions,” he said. Since Govia began operating the full franchise in July 2015, around 146,000 trains, or 7.7% of services, have either been cancelled or delayed by over half an hour, compared with 2.8% on the rest of the network. Much of the disruption has been caused by a shortage of train crews, the report said. Between the start of the franchise and August 2017 the DfT made franchise payments of £2.8bn to Govia and received £3.6bn from train tickets. The head of the NAO, Sir Amyas Morse, said: “Some of the problems could have been avoided if the department had taken more care to consider passengers in its design of the franchise.” A DfT spokesperson said: “The NAO report confirms that the primary cause of delays and cancellations to passengers has been lack of available staff, which is a direct result of strike action. Clearly the disruption passengers have experienced is unacceptable but the NAO recognises that service has improved over the last 12 months.” Charles Horton, Govia’s chief executive, said problems on the franchise have “sometimes been greater than expected and we regret the disruption caused to our passengers”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"the-guardian-foundation/2018/jan/09/peter-preston-a-visionary-who-cared-deeply-for-journalists-everywhere","type":"article","sectionId":"guardian-foundation","sectionName":"Guardian Foundation","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-09T12:00:18Z","webTitle":"Peter Preston: a visionary who cared deeply for journalists everywhere","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/the-guardian-foundation/2018/jan/09/peter-preston-a-visionary-who-cared-deeply-for-journalists-everywhere","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/the-guardian-foundation/2018/jan/09/peter-preston-a-visionary-who-cared-deeply-for-journalists-everywhere","fields":{"headline":"Peter Preston: a visionary who cared deeply for journalists everywhere","bodyText":"Peter was the driving force behind the creation of the Guardian Foundation (formally the Scott Trust Foundation).

Wes Court was among a host of others to write in. “Other interesting tidbits I learned on this procrastinating experience,” he notes: “A majority of countries (53%) have never scored a Premier League goal. And of the 97* countries that have scored in the Premier League, 15 have only one goalscorer, and five of those 15 have only one goal (Poland have two tied with one goal each) [*includes three British Overseas Territories].” Unusual football rules “Watching this vintage penalties clip got me wondering: what are some rules in use or were once used in certain places that differ from what we are used to seeing in the ‘traditional’ game?” wonders Jithvan Ariyaratne. Graham Clayton reminds us of a maverick idea employed at Hampden Park over 40 years ago. “The 1973-74 Scottish League Cup final between Dundee United and Celtic featured an experimental offside line that went from the edge of the penalty area across to the touchlines.” Meanwhile, Sean DeLoughry remembers a time when corners actually deserved the roar of approval they get from fans when one is awarded: “Back in the day several cup competitions in Ireland used the corner count to settle drawn games, leading to the occasional bizarre late scramble to try and force or save a corner. The FAI Cup and the third-ranked Shield competition persevered with replays, but three ‘major’ cup finals were decided on corner count. Shamrock Rovers won the Dublin City Cup in both 1956-57 and 1959-60 on corners after 1-1 final draws with Drumcondra. They also won the 1942-43 Dublin-Belfast Intercity Cup by beating Bohemians on corner count after a 2-2 aggregate draw in the final.” “Then there is the glorious tale of the ‘double golden goal’ rule employed in the 1994 Caribbean Cup (it’s been mentioned hereabouts before).” And Sem Firulas tweets that “here in Brazil we once tried: two referees in a game; penalty shootouts for every match that ended in a draw; and corners taken from the edge of the box in U-18 tournaments. All of them lasted very briefly.” Double post-match managerial departures “Is the recent occasion with Garry Monk and Carlos Carvalhal the first time that both managers have been sacked shortly after the same game?” asks Darren Smith. “I point you to a Portuguese league match, the Lisbon derby between Benfica and Sporting on 3 December 2000,” writes Rui Pereira. “The managers were two of Bobby Robson’s former assistants at FC Porto: José Mourinho (in his first job as head coach) and Augusto Inácio, respectively. “Both teams were having a bad season. Benfica won 3-0, leading to Inácio’s dismissal, while at the winning side tensions between a newly-arrived club leadership and Mourinho, who had been appointed by the outgoing directors, led to Mourinho’s resignation after only three months in charge. According to press reports at the time, Sporting were on the verge of hiring Mourinho as Inácio’s replacement, but that additional twist didn’t happen. The final outcome was not good for any team: reigning champions Sporting finished third in the league, while Benfica finished at their all-time lowest place of sixth.” Knowledge archive “Given the rather precarious world economic climate, have any clubs been forced to take up a sideline business to stay afloat?” wondered Fergal McMahon, in the midst of 2009’s credit crunch. Life is all well and good in the world of football global branding, especially for the world’s leading clubs. But spare a thought for those a little further down the ladder, such as Croatian third division outfit NK Nedeljanec. In 2004, when officials publicly revealed Nedeljanec’s financial strife, a plan was hatched by dedicated fans to save their team’s skins: the sale of potatoes, six tonnes of which were collected and sold to raise club funds. “No one here has much money, but we have lots of potatoes to sell,” fans’ chief Ivan Fosnar told the Jutarnji List newspaper. “It is the least we can do seeing as we are so near to promotion to the second division. We’ll do everything we can to help our club. It is not a problem to donate these potatoes if that will be enough to save the club.” Grateful Nedeljanec officials had no, ahem, chip on their shoulder and accepted the donation, which they admitted would help the club survive until the end of the season.

Without governing body interference, of course.” “The beautiful city of Bristol has had two league clubs pretty much consistently since 1920, combining for a total of 212 years of league football, with only three Football League Trophies and one Welsh Cup to show for it,” mails Andy Field. “Does this make it the least successful multi-club city?” “Hemel Hempstead Town beat St Albans City 2-0 on New Year’s Day,” begins Andrew Levey. “This ended a run of five consecutive 2-2 draws between the two sides in the National League South.

The France Under-21 international will move to Turf Moor having found his opportunities limited under Mauricio Pochettino. Sean Dyche and Saint-Étienne had shown an interest in signing Nkoudou on a permanent basis but it is understood Pochettino was keen to retain a player who joined on the final day of the August 2016 transfer window for £9.4m. “That’s why I have come here, to find football,” Nkoudou said in a statement on Burnley’s website. “I knew Sean Dyche is a big manager who likes young players and players who go forward, so it suits my character to come here and I am happy to work with him. “I hope to help the club. If I can, I will. But the last word is with the manager. If he puts me on the pitch, I will do everything to help the team go forward. I am ready to play and waiting on the starting blocks. If the manager puts me on the pitch, I will do everything on the pitch.” The 22-year-old added that former Burnley player Kieran Trippier convinced him to make the move. “He told me good things about this club,” Nkoudou said. The 22-year-old has made only nine Premier League appearances for Spurs but is yet to start a league match despite scoring in the Champions League victory over APOEL in December. Pochettino was keen to create a space for the fit-again Érik Lamela in his Champions League squad and Nkoudou’s departure means the Argentina international will now be added before their last-16 tie against Juventus. The Nigeria coach, Gernot Rohr, has admitted Kelechi Iheanacho and Ahmed Musa are likely to leave Leicester this month as they search for game time before the World Cup. Both forwards have been sparsely utilised by Claude Puel since the Frenchman’s arrival at the King Power Stadium, with Musa yet to play in the Premier League this season. “I expect these players who are not playing regularly, especially Musa and Iheanacho, to get another club in the same league or elsewhere,” said Rohr. Crystal Palace and Watford are in contention to sign the goalkeeper Vicente Guaita from Getafe, with Roy Hodgson expected to add the 30-year-old to his squad. Hodgson has been on the lookout for a long-term replacement for Julián Speroni, with Everton’s Oumar Niasse also in talks to move to Selhurst Park. With Jeffrey Schlupp set for a spell on the sidelines after suffering suspected medial ligament damage to his knee against Brighton on Monday, Hodgson admitted he could bring in several players this month. “We have been talking about strengthening our squad for about two or three weeks into my time at the club, so literally nothing has changed in that area,” he said.“That’s become even more vitally important with the number of injuries we suffered. You could argue that if we said we wanted three or four then really we should be looking at six or seven, because we have lost at least two players for the rest of this season, and probably the start of next season.” The Austrian right-back Moritz Bauer has completed a transfer to managerless Stoke having been a target of the recently dismissed Mark Hughes. The Potters have signed Bauer, 25, for an undisclosed fee from Russian club Rubin Kazan. Swansea look set to complete the signing of Ryan Fredericks from Fulham. The 25-year-old is out of contract at the end of the season and is available for around £3m. Newcastle are in talks over extending Karl Darlow’s contract until 2023 despite the former Nottingham Forest goalkeeper starting only six Premier League games this season for Rafael Benítez’s side."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"politics/2018/jan/09/brexit-government-urged-to-stop-cost-of-vat-rule-change-hitting-uk-firms","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-09T13:07:39Z","webTitle":"Brexit: government urged to stop cost of VAT rule change hitting UK firms","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jan/09/brexit-government-urged-to-stop-cost-of-vat-rule-change-hitting-uk-firms","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/jan/09/brexit-government-urged-to-stop-cost-of-vat-rule-change-hitting-uk-firms","fields":{"headline":"Brexit: government urged to stop cost of VAT rule change hitting UK firms","bodyText":"The government has come under pressure to reveal the impact on more than 130,000 UK firms of rules due to take effect after Brexit that will force them to pay VAT upfront for the first time on all goods imported from the European Union. Nicky Morgan, the Tory chair of the influential Treasury select committee, has demanded to know what contingency plans were being made to avoid the extra cost of the rule change hitting UK firms. Morgan said in a letter to the head of HMRC, Jon Thompson, that he must respond to warnings by the British Retail Consortium that firms face paying VAT upfront when they import goods, causing them huge cashflow problems. The BRC also fears that “the processing time at ports and border entry points attached to the customs process could increase”. Morgan said: “As the reality of Brexit begins to bite, its implications on tax are yet to be fully explored. “Under the taxation (cross-border trade) bill, firms would have to pay VAT upfront on goods imported from the EU before they can be released into free circulation in the UK. “I have written to HMRC to seek clarification on the costs to businesses and consumers arising from this legislation, the options being considered to mitigate these costs, and the likelihood of the UK participating in the EU VAT area as part of its end-state relationship with the EU.” Morgan pulled back from earlier comments that she would launch an urgent investigation of the matter, saying that she preferred to wait for Thompson’s response to her letter. Many Labour and Tory MPs and peers believe the only way to avoid the VAT Brexit penalty would be to stay in the customs union or negotiate to remain in the EU-VAT area. The chancellor, Philip Hammond, admitted last year that firms faced delays and extra costs on imported goods, and in last year’s autumn budget he committed to “look at options to mitigate any cash-flow impacts”. HMRC has said that a new system allowing firms to delay VAT payments on imports could be designed, but it would need extra funding from the Treasury."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2018/jan/09/oxfam-posts-sharp-rise-in-christmas-online-sales","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-09T15:40:27Z","webTitle":"Burberry and Gucci help Oxfam to a winning online Christmas","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jan/09/oxfam-posts-sharp-rise-in-christmas-online-sales","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/jan/09/oxfam-posts-sharp-rise-in-christmas-online-sales","fields":{"headline":"Burberry and Gucci help Oxfam to a winning online Christmas","bodyText":"Oxfam proved a Christmas hit with UK shoppers as vintage designer party clothing and first-edition books helped drive a sharp rise in online sales over the festive season. The charity said Burberry, Barbour, Gucci, Whistles and Boden were among the most popular clothing brands searched for on its online shop, where sales jumped by a third in the eight weeks to 23 December. Cameras, blankets and throws were also sought-after items. Oxfam’s total sales over the period were £16.9m, up 1.2% on the same period in 2016. The charity said the extra money raised was enough to provide clean, safe water for almost 200,000 people in an emergency. “Sales in our high-street shops remained healthy, despite snow in the run-up to the festive period,” said Andrew Horton, Oxfam’s trading director. “These shops not only deliver the lion’s share of Oxfam’s retail income, they are community hubs, vibrant spaces where people work, volunteer, donate, shop and interact.” Online sales were boosted by initiatives including a Black Friday promotion, which led to the site’s most successful trading day since its launch in 2007. The charity more than doubled sales of its Sourced by Oxfam products after expanding the range of ethical and fair trade gifts. Sales in Oxfam’s high street shops, excluding new stores, were up 1.6% over Christmas as shoppers stocked up on Christmas cards and crackers, wrapping paper, fair trade gifts and chocolates. Horton said: “Now we need to strengthen Oxfam’s poverty-fighting work by doubling online sales over the next three years. Building on the Sourced by Oxfam range, such as with the introduction of our new women’s accessories later this month, positions us as a desirable destination for shoppers seeking beautiful ethical products with the power to make the world a fairer, kinder place.” He said Oxfam could spend the money generated from retail sales to improve water supplies in Niger and reduce malnutrition in 15,000 mothers and their children for a year. Oxfam has 620 high street shops across the UK with a workforce of more than 23,000 volunteers."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/blog/2018/jan/09/talking-horses-mark-johnston-concerned-about-arcs-southwell-plans","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-09T10:42:32Z","webTitle":"Talking Horses: Mark Johnston concerned about ARC's Southwell plans","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2018/jan/09/talking-horses-mark-johnston-concerned-about-arcs-southwell-plans","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/blog/2018/jan/09/talking-horses-mark-johnston-concerned-about-arcs-southwell-plans","fields":{"headline":"Talking Horses: Mark Johnston concerned about ARC's Southwell plans","bodyText":"Today’s best bets, by Chris Cook Mark Johnston has offered qualified support for a change of surface at Southwell, flagging up a significant concern he has with ARC’s plan for the track. “There’s a much bigger issue,” he told me yesterday. “The quotes from Arc have hinted they won’t be doing this without looking for more fixtures. Do we want more fixtures? Do we particularly want more all-weather fixtures? “We’ve got too many fixtures, [especially] at the bottom rung. The argument that these races fill easily is not, surely, a good argument for going down that route. It’s just going like greyhound racing, reducing and reducing the quality just to get runners. “If you’re going to have more fixtures, which we don’t need, why would you put them at Southwell or Newcastle or Lingfield or Kempton, when Chelmsford puts on better prize money? I don’t think it should be based on sharing fixtures around evenly or who’s got the best surface, or variety, it should be based on the track that’s going to put up the best money and, to date, ARC have not got a great record at that.” ARC owns the all-weather tracks at Lingfield, Wolverhampton and Newcastle as well as Southwell. Kempton is run by the Jockey Club, while Chelmsford is owned by the Betfred founder Fred Done. The latest league table of prize money published by Owner Breeder magazine shows Chelmsford well clear of its all-weather rivals with an average spend per fixture of £47,235 in the year to 30 November 2016. Newcastle comes next on £35,964. Johnston has done well with his runners on Southwell’s Fibresand but would still be happy to see a change to Polytrack or Tapeta. “It’s a bit like heavy ground; they all run better on good ground but some cope with heavy better than others. They’d all run better on Polytrack or Tapeta but some cope with Southwell better than others.” As Johnston noted, no executive at a turf track would ever reason that their track was known and valued as a heavy-ground track and therefore they should never do drainage work. For the same reason, he does not accept Southwell should keep its Fibresand just to maintain variety in British racing. “I think variety’s vital in the types of tracks we’ve got. It’s not variety in going we want. We want the best going so the horses can perform at their best as safely as possible.” Johnston is not tempted by the suggestion of his fellow trainer Mick Appleby that Southwell could switch to a US-style dirt surface. “The injury rates on dirt would be unacceptable in this country,” he said. On to today. Philip Hobbs may have turned the corner after a tough six weeks or so and his Rolling Dylan (2.10) is of interest at Taunton, even if Micheal Nolan takes the ride rather than Richard Johnson, who will watch from the weighing room. Nolan was aboard when this one won at Worcester in November on just his second start over fences and he’d have an obvious chance on that effort. Hobbs was just entering his slump as Rolling Dylan flopped at Haydock three weeks later. If the horse is now over what has held the yard back, odds of 13-2 are generous, even though he opened at 10s. As I See It (1.05) is a bit more obvious in the earlier maiden hurdle. He chased home Samuel Jackson here last month and that one has since won again. He’s 7-4. Doncaster has survived the frost and Ruby Yeats (2.35) is of interest at 11-2 for the in-form Harry Whittington. If you forgive her end-of-term flop, her form last season makes her looks handily treated and first-time cheekpieces suggest she is ready to go. Later, Cheque En Blanc (3.40) is napped at 5-2 for a handicap hurdle. Gary Moore has turned him around since acquiring him in the summer and a 6lb rise for his win last month still leaves him 9lb below the mark he had a year ago."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"film/2018/jan/09/baftas-me-too-diversity-joanna-lumley","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-09T17:53:51Z","webTitle":"'Change is definitely happening': Baftas to follow Golden Globes' #MeToo lead","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/jan/09/baftas-me-too-diversity-joanna-lumley","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/jan/09/baftas-me-too-diversity-joanna-lumley","fields":{"headline":"'Change is definitely happening': Baftas to follow Golden Globes' #MeToo lead","bodyText":"The Shape of Water, Guillermo del Toro’s strange and thrilling fantasy epic about a woman who falls in love with a sea monster, will lead the charge at this year’s Bafta film awards with 12 nominations. With multiple nominations in the craft categories the film easily topped the 2018 list, followed by Martin McDonagh’s black comedy Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri and the Gary Oldman-starring Churchill biopic Darkest Hour. Each received nine nominations. The nominations were announced at Bafta’s central London headquarters where Joanna Lumley was also revealed as the ceremony’s new host, replacing Stephen Fry. Lumley said she was thrilled but acknowledged that getting the tone of the ceremony right, as the sexual harassment scandal continues, could be tricky. “My job will be to let other people set the tone. If they want to wear black, they will wear black, if they want to speak about abuse within the film industry, they can. If they want to celebrate film or talk about a particular role … how thrilling, how marvellous. “We want people to feel proud to be there, happy to be there, thrilled to hear what is said.” Lumley, an actor for five decades, said she had no personal stories to tell, “but I can’t tell you the admiration I have for the people who have stood up and the heartbreak for people who felt there was nobody to turn to.” Bafta chief executive Amanda Berry said she was expecting the Bafta ceremony, in four weeks’ time, to follow the lines of last weekend’s Golden Globes, an evening of powerful speeches and attendees wearing black. They are also prepared for the unexpected. “Everything is moving so quickly,” said Berry. “Everyone wearing black [only] started as a rumour a couple of weeks ago. “What was particularly moving for me [at the Globes] was how thoughtful the statements were … this is about making change and all working together to ensure that change happens.” The list does have diversity issues. The five people nominated in the best director category – Del Toro, Luca Guadagnino, Denis Villeneuve, Christopher Nolan and Martin McDonagh – are all white men. All five contenders in the best film category are directed by men. Berry acknowledged that but pointed to five female directors nominated in other categories including Lucy Cohen (Kingdom of Us) and Rungano Nyoni (I Am Not a Witch) in the outstanding debut section. Bafta’s new talent schemes were also bringing on more diverse talent, she said, “the change is definitely happening.” It can also be said that many of the nominated films have strong female characters and performances, not least Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri with Frances McDormand dominant as a mother furious at the inability of local police to find her daughter’s murderer. “She takes no prisoners, she’s got a strength that I’m not sure any male character this year has had,” said McDonagh. “All I can do is take care of the artistic side of things and it is great to be putting out a film like this with such a strong female presence.” McDormand faces competition for best actress from Annette Bening, Margot Robbie, Saoirse Ronan and Sally Hawkins, for The Shape of Water. Hawkins said she was humbled by the nomination. “It feels like a gift from my homeland and I am very touched by it,” she said. “This film, the story, its characters and the great people that were involved in bringing it to the world are unique and very precious to me.” The film’s director Guillermo del Toro said he was moved by the 12 Bafta nominations. “They mean a lot.” The Mexican film-maker said he hoped his movie was one for our times. “This idea that we need to fear the ‘other’ … I wanted to articulate a fable of acceptance and love towards the other in its many forms and many shapes. Ideology divides us, so let art and storytelling unite us.” Berry said the nominations list contained a wealth of both established talent and newcomers, such as in the best actor category where Gary Oldman and Daniel Day-Lewis, for what he says is his last ever film, are nominated. They are up against Jamie Bell and two actors who also feature in the rising star category: Timothée Chalamet and Daniel Kaluuya. Oldman’s astonishing portrayal of Churchill has made him hot favourite to win what would be his first Bafta after losing out twice before for previous roles as Joe Orton and George Smiley. Eric Fellner, one of Darkest Hour’s producers, said he was “thrilled and relieved” at the film’s nine nominations. He said there was no Brexit or Trump when they decided to make the film but the new politics did give the film an extra layer. “It seems to resonate on both sides of the aisle. It isn’t being picked up by one side of the political divide – it is people in general yearning for leadership. That includes politicians who have seen it.” The 2018 list includes genres not known for success at film awards generally. Blade Runner 2049, for example, received eight nominations while Paddington 2 received three, including for best British film and best supporting actor for Hugh Grant, playing a bitter, narcissistic actor. That category also includes Christopher Plummer for perhaps the most newsworthy movie performance of the year after he replaced the disgraced Kevin Spacey as J Paul Getty in Ridley Scott’s All the Money in the World. Two films overlooked at the Golden Globes feature in the Bafta nominations with I, Tonya, the biopic of disgraced ice skater Tonya Harding, and Paul Thomas Anderson’s fashion drama Phantom Thread each receiving five nominations. To some surprise there will be no Steven Spielberg, Meryl Streep or Tom Hanks at the Baftas as their Pentagon Papers drama, The Post, failed to win a single nomination. This year’s ceremony will take place on Sunday 18 February at the Royal Albert Hall, London."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"football/2017/dec/13/brighton-at-forefront-fa-plans-revolutionise-english-womens-football-womens-super-league","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-13T17:17:04Z","webTitle":"Brighton at forefront of FA plan to revolutionise English women’s football","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/dec/13/brighton-at-forefront-fa-plans-revolutionise-english-womens-football-womens-super-league","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/dec/13/brighton-at-forefront-fa-plans-revolutionise-english-womens-football-womens-super-league","fields":{"headline":"Brighton at forefront of FA plan to revolutionise English women’s football","bodyText":"Brighton will be at the forefront of the Football Association’s bold plans to revolutionise women’s club football in England after their application to join next season’s fully professional Super League division one was accepted. They will become one of 10 all-professional sides in the top tier of the domestic female game, with up to four more places available for teams when the second round of licence applications open in March. Although currently in WSL 2, Brighton’s ambition was emphasised by their recruitment of Hope Powell, the former England manager, last summer. With promotion and relegation suspended for one season only at the end of the 2017-18 campaign, the FA’s restructure of the top two tiers in has now offered Powell’s side a fast-track route into the top flight. Paul Barber, Brighton’s chief executive, was delighted. “We have always wanted to achieve equal status for women’s and girls’ football at the club, and acquiring Tier One status will now enable us to make this a reality,” he said. Powell was equally thrilled. “I am overjoyed,” she said. “This will allow the club to realise its aim of playing at the very highest level.” The other nine sides to have been awarded top tier licences are Arsenal, Birmingham City, Bristol City, Chelsea Ladies, Everton Ladies, Liverpool Ladies, Manchester City, Reading Women and Yeovil Town. Current members of WSL 1, all saw their applications rubber-stamped but Sunderland, currently in the top flight, opted not to enter the bidding process. Teams hoping to operate in WSL 1 had to meet certain criteria including the establishment of youth academies. Those who did not want, or were unable to be run along fully professional lines, were invited to apply for places in the semi-professional WSL 2. Tottenham Hotspur are one of seven teams have been accepted into the second tier – the others are Aston Villa, Doncaster Rovers Belles, Durham, London Bees, Millwall Lionesses, and Sheffield FC Ladies – with up to five more places available in March. Sunderland will reconsider their position in March when they hope to join forces with another team and submit a collaborative bid for a WSL 1 slot. If not they are expected to apply for a WSL 2 place. Considering that a nucleus of the current England team – including Steph Houghton, Jill Scott, Lucy Bronze and Jordan Nobbs – all began their careers at Sunderland, the club’s decision has provoked disappointment in the north-east. The FA hopes that the next generation of England internationals will benefit from the new fully professional WSL, with the idea part of the blueprint of the FA’s head of women’s football Baroness Sue Campbell, to make the national side the best in the world. Uefa’s latest coefficients have shown that England’s progress under Mark Sampson – (sacked for non-football reasons in September) – over the past few years has elevated the Lionesses to No1 in the European rankings. The FA is scheduled to name Sampson’s successor by the weekend, with John Herdman, the Canada coach, believed to be a contender. Watford and Oxford United, both now in WSL 2, have also chosen, controversially, not to apply to play in either of the top two domestic divisions but Oxford may reconsider in March. Doncaster are top of WSL 2 and might have been expected to apply for a top-tier licence but decided against it after deeming the costs to be beyond their budget. In contrast Yeovil, presently bottom of WSL 1, are delighted after a nervous wait to see if the FA would accept their application in the wake of a struggle to raise the necessary funds. Trevor Jenkins, Yeovil’s general manager, said: “It’s huge news. We couldn’t be more happy. We have had a bit of adversity to get over and had to work really hard to pull this application together, so it’s terrific.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/dec/14/christmas-jumper-christmas-day-knitwear-environmental","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-14T09:00:27Z","webTitle":"Why a Christmas jumper isn’t just for Christmas Day | Daisy Buchanan","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/14/christmas-jumper-christmas-day-knitwear-environmental","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/14/christmas-jumper-christmas-day-knitwear-environmental","fields":{"headline":"Why a Christmas jumper isn’t just for Christmas Day","bodyText":"I will admit to owning three Christmas jumpers. There’s the chunky, cheery red one, featuring two penguins holding hands on an iceberg, as if they’re on a romantic festive avian break instead of trying to survive a potentially perilous situation. There’s the one I bought last year, which doesn’t feature any traditional motifs but is made of gold Lurex – undeniably festive but also acceptable in February and November. Then there’s the one I’m currently wearing, which I bought in a weak, impulsive moment last week, and features a sequinned dachshund wearing a Santa hat. So I can’t defend the practice, but I can understand the urge to buy multiple jumpers. After all, the secular celebration of Christmas revolves around finding and enjoying all things bright and cosy when the world feels especially dark, dank and dreary. If you have the impulse and the disposable income, why not buy one? Well, as always, our fun comes at a considerable environmental cost. The environmental charity Hubbub has found that last year, one in four of the Christmas jumpers purchased were worn once and then thrown away. One in three under-35s admitted to buying a new Christmas jumper every year, with 24% of consumers saying they didn’t want to be seen in the same jumper as last year, and 29% saying the jumpers are “so cheap” they might as well buy a new one. Admittedly, if you’ve just found a picture of yourself from 2016 clutching your fifth Cointreau while wearing a sweater emblazoned with the slogan “I touch my elf” you might be filled with an urge to find and burn the garment, and then burn the rest of your wardrobe for good luck before granting a relative with the power of attorney in order to save you from any future bad decisions. However, we have to take responsibility for our actions as consumers, even if we’re not ready to take responsibility for our terrible taste. (Unless you’re Hyde Park junior school, in Plymouth, and accidentally sent out a newsletter featuring a jumper that depicts four reindeer engaged in an intimate act. When that happens, you have to admit that your jumper selection skills need work.) One sensible, practical and affordable solution is to eschew the new – or rather, choose a jumper that’s new only to you. With 35% of people surveyed saying they wore their Christmas jumper only once, charity shops across the land should be absolutely packed with knitwear covered in galloping reindeer and pudding puns. If you’re craving a jumper fix, it should be easy to recycle someone else’s, and give some money to a good cause, which is much more Christmassy than giving it to a department store. If you’ve got a jumper you’ll never wear again but haven’t donated because it’s a bit embarrassing, simply sponge the sprout stains off and claim you’re handing it in on behalf of your horrible boss, childhood bully or Donald Trump. Alternatively, if you have jumper-loving, non-judgmental friends, you could host an amnesty jumper swap shop. Perhaps this could be an alternative to secret Santa – instead of spending £5 on a gift that your friend or colleague almost certainly does not want, you could all exchange old jumpers you don’t want with each other instead. The best part of this plan is that Christmas jumpers don’t really suit anyone, so it’s a democratic exercise. You can all look bobbly and shapeless together! I worry that needless consumerism has forced us all to forget the true meaning of Christmas jumpers. Until recently, our traditional festive knitwear came from kindly relatives, who had spent months knitting wonky Alpine patterns with scratchy wool. They were aesthetically distressing labours of love, and we had to wear them for at least 12 hours after we’d ripped off the wrapping paper. We wouldn’t dream of throwing them away, even though we wouldn’t dream of wearing them when we weren’t in our granny’s eyeline either. These remind us of a time when we had less, and perhaps what we owned meant more to us. Consumer choice is an exciting thing, and it’s made our lives better in many ways. But, as with advocaat, a little goes a long, long way. We live in an era of great privilege, when a Christmas jumper can be anything we want it to be – a fine-gauge knit with an instarsia Die Hard quote, an excuse for a big-ticket Bella Freud splurge, or something that has its own battery pack and a more intricate lighting system than the rest of your house. With great power, electrical or otherwise, comes great responsibility. A Christmas jumper doesn’t have to just be for Christmas jumper day. I estimate that there are 36 days in the calendar year on which festive knitwear is appropriate – from the first day of Advent to the 12th day of Christmas on 5 January. If you love Christmas and love your jumper, you could wear it every day. You could buy something with a stupid slogan from a charity shop, simply because it makes you laugh. You could start a tradition in which everyone you know does a football shirt swapping-style jumper exchange straight after the turkey is served on Christmas day. Still, if we want to wear the jumpers, we have to channel Scrooge, and “honour Christmas in [our] heart, and try to keep it all the year”. That means that we must constantly be kind, considerate and charitable. By that logic, binning your Christmas jumper is the least Christmassy thing you could do. • Daisy Buchanan is a freelance columnist and features writer covering arts, entertainment and women’s issues"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"politics/2018/jan/02/brexit-keir-starmer-to-force-vote-on-uks-adoption-of-eu-charter-of-rights","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-02T16:29:28Z","webTitle":"Brexit: Starmer to force vote on UK's adoption of EU charter of rights","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jan/02/brexit-keir-starmer-to-force-vote-on-uks-adoption-of-eu-charter-of-rights","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/jan/02/brexit-keir-starmer-to-force-vote-on-uks-adoption-of-eu-charter-of-rights","fields":{"headline":"Brexit: Starmer to force vote on UK's adoption of EU charter of rights","bodyText":"Keir Starmer has torn into the government’s “woefully inadequate” analysis of how the EU charter of fundamental rights will be covered by British law after Brexit, warning that essential protections will be lost. The shadow Brexit secretary said Labour would force a vote on the issue this month at the next stage of the EU withdrawal bill, as the government was still refusing to transpose the charter into UK law. The government managed to head off a rebellion on the issue by Conservative MPs, led by the former attorney general Dominic Grieve, by promising a “right-by-right analysis” of how UK law already covers the same ground as the charter on areas such as children, the environment, data and consumer rights. However, Labour and legal experts said the document showed only how UK law fell short in providing the same protections as the EU charter of fundamental rights. “The document they released fails to provide any assurance that essential rights will be protected once we leave the EU,” Starmer said. “On the contrary, it takes rights from the charter and scatters them to their original sources: the polar opposite of effective human rights protection. “We need a cast-iron guarantee in law that the rights contained in the charter will be given the same legal protection as those currently contained in the Human Rights Act. “This is not a party political issue. It is about the type of nation we want to be. Britain should be a proud advocate of human rights. That’s why I would urge all MPs to back Labour’s amendment to the withdrawal bill when it is debated in January.” It is not clear yet whether the Conservative rebels would be prepared to back such an amendment or table one of their own, after successfully defeating the government on the issue of a guaranteed parliamentary vote on the final deal before Brexit day. However, some lawyers are concerned the government’s refusal to incorporate the charter into UK law will weaken human rights protections. Schona Jolly QC, a human rights and equalities lawyer, said the government’s analysis “fails to tackle the legal reality that abandoning the charter indeed does remove rights that UK citizens currently enjoy and adds to the complexity, confusion and uncertainty surrounding the basis to protect and enforce substantive rights post-Brexit. “Take, for example, the freestanding right to equality contained within article 21 of the charter,” she said. “There is no equivalent in domestic law. The Equality Act does not have constitutional status. A constitutional right would underpin all statutory equality rights to provide a strongly focused standard against which state action can be judged, as well as providing a solid interpretative basis by which our domestic common law can be developed. “The government’s analysis doesn’t begin to deal with this acute loss of one of the most foundational rights in our democracy after we leave the EU. So too in respect of other rights. “If the government is truly committed to non-regression of rights, it must commit itself in statute. Its weak legal analysis, conducted as an act of self-justification after having already taken the decision to drop the charter, falls demonstrably and critically short in plugging the post-Brexit rights gap.” The vote forced by Labour will happen during the report stage of the EU withdrawal bill in the House of Commons, which is due to take place in the third week of January. After making its way through the Commons, the bill is likely to run into further trouble in the House of Lords, where the government has no majority and peers are likely to try to make further amendments. A Department for Exiting the EU spokesperson said: “The UK has a longstanding tradition of ensuring our rights are protected. As we leave the EU, we are taking action to ensure that that continues. “The EU charter of fundamental rights was never the source of rights in the UK – it was intended to catalogue the rights that already existed in EU law. Under the withdrawal bill this law is being converted into UK law on the point we exit the EU.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2017/dec/26/a-labour-government-wouldnt-be-as-bad-as-brexit-claims-heseltine","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-26T14:56:05Z","webTitle":"A Labour government might not be as bad as Brexit, claims Heseltine","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/dec/26/a-labour-government-wouldnt-be-as-bad-as-brexit-claims-heseltine","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/dec/26/a-labour-government-wouldnt-be-as-bad-as-brexit-claims-heseltine","fields":{"headline":"A Labour government might not be as bad as Brexit, claims Heseltine","bodyText":"Michael Heseltine, the Tory grandee and former deputy prime minister, has suggested a Labour government led by Jeremy Corbyn could be less damaging than Brexit. The peer made the claim, which is remarkable for a senior Conservative, in an interview for the Limehouse podcast about liberal and EU politics, as he was pressed on how catastrophic he believes Brexit will be for the UK. Heseltine, a longstanding pro-EU politician, signalled that he still views a Labour government as having a negative effect on the country, but said leaving the EU could be worse in the long term. He also suggested Labour would eventually turn against Brexit and the Conservatives would be “left holding the baby”, as leaving the EU grows more unpopular. Asked what could happen under five years of a Corbyn government, he said: “Well, we have survived Labour governments before. Their damage tends to be short-term and capable of rectification. Brexit is not short-term and is not easily capable of rectification. There will be those who question whether the short-term pain justifies the avoidance of the long-term disaster.” Heseltine argued public opinion was already beginning to move against Brexit and Labour would end up changing its current position to one in favour of the EU, which could put the Conservatives in trouble with their pro-remain voters. “If you look at the polls there is probably a bigger majority against Brexit than the referendum secured but that, I think, will continue to happen and it will become more and more unpopular as people realise what it’s all about,” he said in the podcast, named after the declaration that gave rise to the Socal Democratic party (SDP), and hosted by activist William Porteous. “When that happens, the Labour party will move, and the present government will be left holding the baby. But then you have got to realise the present government is supported by large numbers of people as opposed to Brexit as I am. How long will they remain within the tribe and loyal to the party?” The Conservative peer made clear that his views on the Labour leader had not changed, but argued the “most interesting thing about Jeremy Corbyn is that he is now considered to be a potential prime minister. “People of my generation could never have anticipated that... He was always someone to the extreme of his party arguing causes for which there was virtually no support within his party. But such is the dynamic of Brexit that he is now seen as a potential prime minister,” he said. Heseltine is one of a small band of pro-EU Conservatives, along with former chancellor Ken Clarke, who have argued that Brexit should not happen. On the Labour side, former prime minister Tony Blair is campaigning for an end to Brexit, while the Liberal Democrats are pushing for a second referendum. As for how to stop Brexit, Heseltine said: “I think [a second referendum] would be a vehicle for ending Brexit, but personally I would rather parliament to do it either if this present parliament became hostile or because in an election the issue was rethought and a subsequent parliament did it. My preoccupation is ending Brexit: the means, well anything to hand.” Clarke told another episode of the same podcast that he would “love to reverse the referendum if I thought we could, but I don’t think we can”. He said he thought referendums were “a daft way of running things” so it would be better for parliament to decide to back into the EU but this was unlikely to happen. “The political class are terrified of doing that. So the reality, which I’ve had to come to terms with, is that we obviously are leaving the EU and I’m trying to minimise the damage and retain as close a relationship as we possibly can,” he said. Clarke also said Corbyn had “risen to the job of being quite a credible leader” of the opposition, but he did not believe the public would vote for him as prime minister."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"media/2017/dec/14/murdoch-brothers-how-roles-will-change-james-murdoch-lachlan-murdoch","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-14T14:11:41Z","webTitle":"The Murdoch brothers: how their roles will change","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/dec/14/murdoch-brothers-how-roles-will-change-james-murdoch-lachlan-murdoch","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2017/dec/14/murdoch-brothers-how-roles-will-change-james-murdoch-lachlan-murdoch","fields":{"headline":"The Murdoch brothers: how their roles will change","bodyText":"James Murdoch For the past 20 years Rupert Murdoch’s youngest son has worked for the family business. If the Disney deal receives official approval, 45-year-old James is expected to depart the family firm – either to join the company behind Walt Disney Studios or to strike out on his own – marking a split in the dynasty. In the 1990s his father’s News Corporation conglomerate, which has since split in two, bought James’s start-up hip hop label Rawkus Records. But he first earned his spurs at the media group by successfully running the Asian TV business Star between 2000 and 2003. By the age of 30 he was head of Sky (then known as BSkyB) in the UK, where his star continued to rise. His career was dealt a serious blow in 2012 when he was forced to stand down as chairman of News International – then publisher of the Sun and the Times – and BSkyB in the wake of the phone-hacking scandal at the News of the World. The furore forced Rupert to abandon his first attempt to take full control of Sky, while the media regulator Ofcom published a scathing assessment of James Murdoch’s conduct at News International during the scandal, finding that it repeatedly fell short of the standards expected. A move to the US to work at 21st Century Fox pulled him out of the critical glare of the British media and provided a chance to rehabilitate his tarnished reputation. Two years later Rupert named James and his elder brother Lachlan to effectively take over running the media conglomerate in a power-sharing move. As chief executive of 21st Century Fox, James rekindled the unfinished business of the Sky takeover but the spectre of phone hacking has once again mired the deal in regulatory quicksand, with critics voicing concern over the power that the Murdochs have over UK news media. James now faces professional family separation, although it is viewed as an amicable one, if the Disney deal goes through. “It is a fundamental parting of ways between James and his father, the result over a period of time of the development of many differences between them that have become accentuated,” says Claire Enders, of Enders Analysis. “Fundamentally, Rupert believes that his son has not made a great fist of running the entertainment assets. The issues of the past look to have cost James’s ambitions in the present again.” Lachlan Murdoch Rupert Murdoch’s eldest son had long been seen as the potential heir apparent to his father. But in 2005, at the age of 33, he dramatically resigned from running News Corp’s television stations and moved to Australia to pursue his own business interests. The abrupt departure was reportedly down to tensions with the late Roger Ailes, the then Fox News head who was one of the most powerful executives in the Murdoch empire. Lachlan’s exit appeared to end his chances of one day succeeding his father, who had once said that of all his children it was Lachlan who was his most likely successor: “He was the one who was always most interested … when he was a 13-year-old kid, he worked as an apprentice with the printers in the pressroom, cleaning all the oil and the grease off the press.” His time outside the family fold included investing in Nova Entertainment, a radio group. Lachlan’s road back to his father’s side came in 2014 when he was named alongside Rupert as co-chairman of 21st Century Fox and News Corp, the separately listed and Murdoch-controlled news and publishing company which owns the Times, the Sun, the Wall Street Journal and the book publisher HarperCollins. His younger brother James was made chief executive of 21st Century Fox, in a power-sharing move. As Rupert moves to sell off most of the family’s entertainment jewels from beneath James, including the 20th Century Fox film studio, Sky and the Fox TV studio business, which produces shows including The Simpsons, Modern Family and Family Guy, it is Lachlan who is once again positioned as heir apparent. If the deal passes regulatory scrutiny he will be left running the remaining businesses – including Fox News, its biggest profit driver, Fox Sports channel and Fox Business. These could well be combined with News Corp, allowing Rupert Murdoch to return his family to his first love: news. “Lachlan is someone who wants to support his father’s ambitions in news,” says Enders, of Enders Analysis. “James feels uncomfortable with those ambitions and sees how they cut across his own goals. This deal simplifies the future and is an extraordinary change in [family] dynamic.” • Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2017/dec/14/failure-rehouse-grenfell-tower-survivors-could-worsen-mental-health","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-14T06:00:24Z","webTitle":"Failure to rehouse Grenfell survivors 'could worsen mental health'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/dec/14/failure-rehouse-grenfell-tower-survivors-could-worsen-mental-health","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2017/dec/14/failure-rehouse-grenfell-tower-survivors-could-worsen-mental-health","fields":{"headline":"Failure to rehouse Grenfell survivors 'could worsen mental health'","bodyText":"Survivors of the Grenfell Tower disaster are facing a new wave of post-traumatic stress with their chances of treatment hampered because so many victims remain homeless, experts and victims’ representatives have warned. Six months after the west London tower block burned down, NHS staff and representatives of the bereaved said that because only 45 of the 210 households made homeless have been permanently resettled, victims cannot begin proper psychological treatment to address symptoms. These include often horrific memories and flashbacks from the fire, which killed 71 people, including 18 children. Health officials at Central and North West London NHS foundation trust (CNWL) believe the number of people at risk of suffering mental health disorders could reach more than 10,000. The experts were speaking to the Guardian as part of a wide-ranging assessment of responses to the fire which also covers the future of the tower, the public inquiry and nationwide fire safety. CNWL officials said they had already had contact with 4,000 people, but there was concern that many, particularly men, were failing to seek help and could be in danger over Christmas. A drop-in facility was set up because people were coming forward with suicidal feelings at night. Extra staff have also been primed for the festive period. So far 426 adults and 110 children are in treatment for PTSD and other trauma-related issues, according to health chiefs. “Six months on, I am starting to see the trauma emerge with the bereaved,” said Ahmed Elgwahry, whose sister and mother were killed in the fire, and who is now involved with the Grenfell United survivors’ group. “There are a few that are young men who have lost their wife and their children and I have started to see them breaking down. I mean really breaking down.” He added: “I am not sure they are getting the monitoring they need. I know the ones I am referring to in particular are not getting it from the council.” He said too many people had not received consistent support, with key workers changing, in some cases several times since the blaze. Natasha Elcock, who escaped with her boyfriend and six-year-old daughter, said: “I don’t know what the lasting impact will be on her. Six months on, the trauma is starting. I know that and I can only imagine what the bereaved families are going through.” Fears of a growing mental health crisis come as victims, community activists and politicians including Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn prepare to attend a memorial service at St Paul’s Cathedral on Thursday. It will also be attended by Prince Charles, Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, Prince Harry and Prince William, with music from the Ebony Steelband, the Portobello Road Salvation Army band, the oud player Rihab Azar and an Islamic girls’ choir. Mental health workers will be on hand to help survivors who struggle during the service. “The people in Grenfell Tower were forgotten about and ignored before the fire and this is a chance for people across the country to unite and stand with us,” said Jacqui Haynes, the chair of the Lancaster West residents’ association, which includes Grenfell Tower. Jim O’Donnell, the deputy borough director of mental health at CNWL, said significant numbers of people were not ready for help. People are “showing signs of PTSD but aren’t psychologically ready to engage in services for treatment”, he said. “Many are just trying to cope with their daily lives living in a hotel six months after the event. If someone has a proper home they are able to get their lives back on track more easily than living in a hotel. People living in hotels can’t eat properly, they can’t cook or store fresh food and are eating takeaways. It just adds to the complexity of what they are struggling with.” O’Donnell said there was repeatedly a stigma around mental health, so they tried to call it “wellbeing” and “emotional support”. “There are hesitations about accessing the NHS around immigration status and what it means if [people] come forward,” he said. “We are also aware of men from certain backgrounds are very strong as men, but perhaps inside they are very brittle. We would love to encourage more men to come forward.” One psychologist working with survivors said the lack of permanent rehousing was a major obstacle to treatment. “Therapy focusing on trauma is often not helpful if a person is still experiencing instability or a current sense of threat,” they said. “Basic needs not being met, such as housing, is problematic and contributes to general stress, feelings of injustice and uncertainty. In some cases this can be retraumatising.” The Kensington MP, Emma Dent Coad, has calculated that more than 200 children from Grenfell and the other evacuated homes are likely to be in hotels over Christmas. “It is indefensible that after six months the council has still not rehoused these desperate and traumatised families,” she said. “It is heartless, immoral and illegal.” The leader of Kensington and Chelsea council, Elizabeth Campbell, has defended its rehousing programme, saying: “We are doing everything we can to rehouse families, leading the biggest house-purchasing programme by any local authority in recent history, and committing £235m to help secure 300 new properties so that people have maximum choice before Christmas.” LThe Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, has described the rehousing situation as “a disgrace”. • This article was amended on 14 December 2017 to correct some victim details."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/dec/29/life-in-sex-sixtysomething-transvestite","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-29T10:00:27Z","webTitle":"When femme, I wanted to be with a guy.

This morning, even he was moved to sink the boot into failed Alabama Senate candidate, Roy Moore. After leading his page of links with the phrase “BANNON BUSTED”, he opined on the president’s favorite platform, “Luther Strange would have won in a landslide... Just too much crazy in nerve racking times. There IS a limit!” He caught the mood that began to settle on conservative media late last night after it was announced that deep red Alabama had elected a Democrat for the first time in a quarter century. There were excuses, there were what-ifs, and above all there was scapegoating. In particular, Steve Bannon, who had promoted Moore, came under heavy fire, and not just from those conservatives who have always resented his influence. Fox News and the Daily Caller were among the outlets who seemed keen to throw Bannon under the bus. The president also suffered the blame – the New York Times’s Ross Douthat gloomily wrote that the repudiation in the Jones victory was “foreshadowing a larger repudiation soon to come”. On the populist side of conservative media, there was a desire to once again blame establishment conservatives for the right’s misfortunes. It doesn’t make much sense, but why stop now? Michael Moore, liberals use Alabama result to mock white people Publication: Infowars Author: Paul Joseph Watson, Alex Jones’s most loyal and long-suffering sidekick, is pushed out front to try to transform Moore’s defeat into something other than an utter humiliation for the site, and his boss. Why you should read it: Alex Jones is a Trump shill, which means, naturally, that he shilled for Roy Moore as well. Despite his obsession with political and celebrity pedophilia, he spent the last month making all manner of excuses for Moore’s behavior towards underage girls, even assimilating it to distinctive Southern manners. Remarkably, many white voters in Alabama seemed to take the same view. Thanks in large part to black voters, Moore lost anyway, so how to respond? Infowars resorted to a tried and true tactic: get PJW to trawl Twitter for liberal triumphalism, and beat it up as evidence of a hate movement. Extract: “Chris Menahan has compiled even more tweets in the same vein that demonstrate how the left is completely obsessed with disparaging white people to the extent that this is becoming more of a serious hate movement than just a handful of demented idiots on social media.” Establishment Republicans cheer Roy Moore’s loss in Alabama Publication: Breitbart Author: Sean Moran covers Capital Hill for Breitbart; we’ve considered his work before. Why you should read it: Using one of Breitbart’s standby techniques, this story stitches together a series of tweets from #NeverTrump conservatives to show their perfidious opposition to Moore. Better this than reflecting on Moore’s inadequacies as a candidate, or the poor judgement of Breitbart boss, Steve Bannon, in supporting him. Extract: “Several establishment Republicans cheered as the Alabama Senate Republican candidate Judge Roy Moore lost to his Democratic opponent Doug Jones.” Roy Moore does the impossible Publication: National Review Author: “The Editors” hammer home the same message carried elsewhere by NR writers David French, Jim Geraghty, and Theodore Kupfer: this is Trump’s and Bannon’s fault. Why you should read it: You get the impression that National Review writers had been honing their lines for a while. David French said that Alabama conservatives had “declared that partisanship isn’t worth grotesque moral compromise”. Ben Shapiro wrote that “Moore ran the worst campaign in recent memory”. Kevin Williamson asked “So what have Steve Bannon and the rest of the half-bright moneyed dilettantes – and their talk-radio and cable-news cheerleaders – accomplished?” Jim Geraghty said that Moore “may very well have been the worst Senate nominee for any major party in American history”. Last night, the moment finally arrived where the chief organ of movement conservatism could kick a President who had defied their wisdom and prognostications while he was well and truly down. Extract: “Trump and Bannon thought they were cleverly getting in front of the parade of an inevitable Moore victory, in ruby-red Alabama. Instead, they associated themselves with a man credibly accused of preying on young girls and got rebuked by Alabama voters whose standards weren’t as low as theirs.” Who really lost in Alabama Publication: Frontpage Author: Daniel Greenfield is a Shillman Journalism Fellow stationed at David Horowitz’s Front-page Magazine. The Forward ran an interesting report on Robert Shillman, who funds the fellowship and a range of other activities from anti-Islamic activists like Horowitz and Pamela Geller. Why you should read it: Greenfield’s piece is not just sour grapes. It’s a way of explaining away the successful mobilization of anti-Moore forces, and the local, grassroots effort that elected Doug Jones. By putting it all down to the machinations of national political consultants, he’s implicitly arguing that the only authentic result in a southern state is a Republican victory. Whatever you think of his case, it’s not an answer to the problem that Trump, and his poor political instincts, are now causing for Republicans throughout the country. Extract: “The game may appear to be played in Alabama or Georgia, but the players are actually in Washington DC. The strategy failed quite a few times before it finally worked in Alabama. But political consultants can lose a thousand times. They only have to win once. And the win in Alabama will mean big bucks. And it will mean that the Dems will try to crack conservative states by ‘Mooring’ Republicans. Alabama offers a new strategy for winning by depressing the Republican turnout while relying on Obama to boost the minority vote.” Roy Moore is a lesson on the folly of angry populism Publication: The Federalist Author: Robert Tracinski is one of the most seasoned writers at the Federalist, and unlike many of his colleagues has held down positions in mainstream media outlets. While others there have been engaging in the right wing blame game, Tracinski tries to look inward. Why you should read it: Tracinski is just one of those wondering this morning about the limitations of Trumpian populism and its omnidirectional resentments. Just because it worked spectacularly well that one time in 2016 does not mean it can be applied elsewhere. If the opposing candidate is unobjectionable, it’s pretty thin gruel. If Trump’s base stays home, and the people who they most fear turn out, anything can happen. Expect more worried reflections on this theme in coming days. Extract: “Angry populism and hating the media is not a philosophy, it is not a political ideology, it is not a platform for governing and it’s not an all-purpose excuse for the character flaws of poorly chosen candidates. That’s the message we can take from the strange, apocalyptic sign of a Democrat getting elected in 2017 in Alabama.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2017/dec/14/amazon-fire-tv-4k-hdr-review-compact-upgrade-smart-tv","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-14T10:57:34Z","webTitle":"Amazon Fire TV 4K HDR review: compact upgrade to make your TV smarter","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/dec/14/amazon-fire-tv-4k-hdr-review-compact-upgrade-smart-tv","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2017/dec/14/amazon-fire-tv-4k-hdr-review-compact-upgrade-smart-tv","fields":{"headline":"Amazon Fire TV 4K HDR review: compact upgrade to make your TV smarter","bodyText":"The Amazon Fire TV with 4K HDR is arguably the easiest and best way to play ultra HD content on your TV, condensing what was great about the previous generation into a smaller, cheaper package. The new Fire TV is no longer a set-top box – instead it’s more like the cheaper Fire TV Stick, hanging off a built-in flexible HDMI cable. It means the new Fire TV can be inserted straight into the back of a TV, hidden from view, and likely powered straight from the TV’s USB port. The downside is that by shrinking the Fire TV down to an 87.1g dongle, Amazon has cut the built-in ethernet and microSD card sockets. The former is available as an optional extra through an adapter, but this Fire TV is clearly more about streaming and less about Android games than the previous generation, so expandable storage is less important. Plug in, switch on, log in Setup took about five minutes. It comes with a remote (complete with batteries), a USB power adapter and microUSB cable for powering the Fire TV. Some will need the power adapter, others will be able to power it straight from a USB port on their TV – the USB ports on the Sony Bravia 55XE9005 were capable of powering it playing 4K HDR content. Once connected the remote pairs up with the Fire TV at the touch of a button and all you have to do is follow the instructions to connect to wifi and the necessary Amazon account – you don’t have to subscribe to Amazon’s Prime subscription service, but you can’t use the Fire TV without a basic account. You’re then shown an introductory video that guides you through the basics of using the Fire TV and Alexa via the voice remote. The interface of the Fire TV remains pretty much same as previous versions, despite running on a newer version of Amazon’s Fire OS. It’s focused around getting you to the content or content apps as fast as possible, and it works well. There are plenty of options beyond Amazon’s built-in video and music services. Netflix, all the UK terrestrial broadcaster streaming services, Spotify and others are free to download from the Amazon App Store. Subscriptions to Discovery, Eurosport Player, ITV Hub+ and Hayu are also in the subscription Amazon Prime account, with free trials to see what’s available. The only big one missing other than Apple’s iTunes is Google Play Movies, but movies bought via Google are available through YouTube, which is viewable through a built-in browser but not an app as Amazon and Google are squabbling at the moment. Services such as Netflix can suggest content directly within the home screen, making it easy to get straight back into what you were watching last night. Amazon’s voice assistant Alexa is also integrated into the Fire TV. Hold the mic button on the remote, make your request and Alexa will respond via voice and on-screen cards similar to that available on the Echo Show. Searching for content is as easy as asking for a show, movie, actor or genre. Alexa then shows the results with options to stream from a subscription you already have or buy it from Amazon’s video library if you don’t already own it. 4K HDR in all its glory The previous version of the Fire TV could manage 4K content, but not the new high dynamic range content (HDR), which like HDR photography, is richer, with a wider colour range. Paired with the right TV, such as the Sony Bravia 55XE9005 it looks absolutely stunning. The new Fire TV supports HDR content from Amazon’s Prime Video service as well as from Netflix’s catalogue, giving you access to two of the largest libraries of 4K HDR content available at the moment. The catalogue is growing too, with many new TV shows being available in 4K HDR, and almost all the Netflix and Amazon own-brand movies and TV shows available in the format. The Fire TV also supports Dolby Atmos, for improved surround sound with compatible systems, but the catalogue of content that supports Atmos is quite limited, as is device support. Observations You can control the Fire TV with some TV remotes, although not all the functions work Videos normally start at a higher quality sooner than the old Fire TV connected to the router via ethernet, but are more susceptible to quality dips mid stream Some apps could hang or crash early on, but updates appear to have fixed any issues The Amazon remote cannot do volume on your TV Price The 2017 Fire TV with 4K HDR costs £69.99 (buy here). For comparison, Google’s Chromecast Ultra costs £69 (buy here), the Roku Streaming Stick + costs £79.99 (buy here) and the Apple TV 4K costs £179 (buy here). Verdict The Fire TV with 4K and HDR is one of the best streaming devices around. It takes most of what was good from the last generation and squeezes it into a dongle that’s at least £10 cheaper and you can hide behind your TV. What was taken away in that shrinking process hasn’t hurt what most use it for: streaming content. But if you do not have an up to date router that supports the latest 802.11 ac wifi standard, the lack of ethernet might make streaming 4K more difficult. With a Prime and Netflix subscription, the Fire TV gives UK users access to one of the largest collections of 4K HDR content available in a neat and tidy box. The Fire TV’s 4K HDR content looks stunning when paired with the right TV, making even scenes featuring three old men driving around in Amazon’s The Grand Tour look beautiful. Given the mess that built-in smart TV software can be, the Fire TV is blessed relief. Pros: simple to set up and use, compact, good remote, slick interface, wide UK catchup service support, Alexa integration, 4K and HDR Cons: no support for iTunes or Sky content, requires Amazon account, wifi only, needs £79 Amazon Prime subscription to get most out of it, no expandable storage Other reviews Amazon Fire TV Stick review: cheap, great TV streaming device with new interface and Alexa Amazon Echo Show review: smart speaker with a screen has great potential Amazon Echo second-generation review: smaller, cheaper and better Amazon Echo Dot review: as good as the Echo for one-third of the price This article contains affiliate links to products.

In 2016, exports to Britain fell by 18%, a fact that, insist its advocates, says more about the failure of Spanish winemakers to market cava effectively than any inherent lack of quality. At Christmas, cava may be regarded as a cheap base for a buck’s fizz, but its supporters argue that this wine, which is bottled-fermented like champagne, is a serious drink in its own right. “Fifteen-quid cava is almost always better than £15 champagne and it offers much better value than prosecco,” says Ben Wright, the co-owner of the Porta tapas bars in Altrincham and Chester. “At the lower price points, cava is consciously different to champagne. It is fresher and appley, as opposed to champagne’s more buttery, biscuity character. Cava is a great Christmas aperitif.” Producers in cava’s Catalan heartland hope to address its reputation as a big-volume, low-expectation wine with a new classification, cava de paraje calificado, applied to a select band of single-estate cavas. These limited-production wines are made at the vineyard (larger producers have set aside designated growing areas) and aged for at least three years. Only 12 cavas have been granted that status so far, but the long-term aim is to clearly differentiate between different standards of cava, right up to these £100 bottles that, it is argued, can rival good champagne. If that makeover works, this may be the last Christmas to grab some bargains before prices rise. “The quality versus price sweet spot is £10 to £15,” says Wright, who recommends Parés Baltà’s cava brut (£13.27). But what of the supermarket own-brands and exclusive lines, many of which cost less than £10? Will they add sparkle to your Christmas – or leave a bad taste in your mouth? Sainsbury’s, Taste the Difference vintage cava, £9 This is made by a large producer, Codorníu, which has three paraje wines in its portfolio. This slightly scattergun wine is not one of them, but it capably demonstrates how mainstream cava usually has far more charisma than mainstream prosecco. This example includes some chardonnay and flickers with honeyed and buttered toast notes, but it is bracingly dry and full of cava’s distinctive citrus and apple flavours. It is reminiscent of farmhouse cider and funky, sour beers. 6/10 Waitrose, Castillo Perelada cava brut, £9.49 This brut cava (the second-driest category after brut nature) is made using a higher-than-normal proportion of parellada grapes, one of three varieties (the others are xarello and macabeo) classically used to make cava. To develop character, it is aged for 12 months on the lees [spent yeast], and tastes of honeydew melon, green apple and, most overtly, limes and lemon pith. Unexpected hints of Mediterranean herbs and wild flowers add intrigue to this crisp, spritzy drop. 7/10 Asda, Marques del Norte cava brut, £6 The best young cavas have a clean, zippy freshness to them, whereas this feels tired and flabby. Its short-lived aromas (pine cleaner, baked apples, something yeasty) are as confusing as its flavours. A rather aggressively fizzy mouthful, it tastes, albeit briefly, of sherbet lemons, boiled strawberry sweets and stewed apples. Its cidery acidity is jostled by fleeting, elusive and rather unpleasant ripe, dank notes. It is jarring and ham-fisted, a bull in a china shop of a wine. 3/10 WINNER! Ocado, Castellblanc cava brut, £7.49 If prosecco can be unbearably sweet and cheap champagne is often instant heartburn in a glass, cava is well-placed to plug that sparkling gap. But it can be limited in its green apple flavours. This vibrant cava goes way beyond that base competency. Lightly, tightly effervescent, it comes on like a classier, cleaner farmhouse cider, but quickly gives up a multitude of tropical flavours (white peach, overripe melon, limes) with a nice stony, mineral finish. It is engaging down to the last drop. 8/10 Marks &amp; Spencer, Cava prestige brut, £11 M&amp;S’s cava is charged with a pretty prickly, acidity-intensifying fizz, and is satisfyingly and drily fruity. Flavours of gooseberry, quince, peach, sun-drenched lemons and, of course, green apples waft past as you chug it down. A certain creaminess and something savoury going on beneath that fruit puts this at the aspiring-to-be-champagne end of the cava spectrum. It lacks pinpoint definition and cannot match the elegant intensity of Ocado’s cava, but it would effectively kickstart any Christmas celebration. 7/10 Tesco, Finest vintage cava, £9 This literally explodes out of the bottle and, for the first few frothy gulps, effervesces away to nothing. As it settles, like bad champagne it tastes very dry, acidic and narrow in its flavours of lime cordial, sharp, underripe lemons and shrivelled grapes. Later, you get brief flashes of peach, sticky strawberries and even bready champagne-like notes, but you have to concentrate hard to detect such nuances. Far more so than you will want to at a Christmas party. 4/10 Co-op, Irresistible cava brut, £6.99 This reserva – aged on the lees for at least 15 months – has a yeasty aroma and less confrontational demeanour than some of the drier, fizzier, more acidic cavas (Tesco, Morrison’s). It is softly bubbly and initially bright with apple, honeydew melon and lemon flavours that, unfortunately, fail to evolve interestingly. It falls into a rather monotonous apple-lemon groove which, if perfectly drinkable, lacks the complexity and verve that might get you going back for a second or third glass. 5/10 Morrisons, The Best vintage cava brut, £6.50 “A real party in a glass,” says Morrisons, which makes you worry about its copywriters and their idea of a good time. This smells limply unexciting (of hay and limes but also rotting gooseberries and wet cardboard), and tastes overwhelmingly dry and tart in that shrill way of cheap, overly fizzy champagnes. Its green apple and lemon flavours are stunted and unconvincing; wizened and harsh where you crave sunshine and gracefulness. We’ve all been to parties like this … and left early. 3/10 This article contains affiliate links to products.

The president has lashed out at a swath of countries during his 13 months in office, sometimes on issues relating to national security, but more often for seemingly no reason at all. Trump is, at least, consistent in his treatment of foreign powers – criticizing both enemies and supposed allies alike. Here are some of the countries that have upset the president. France Trump, in what would become a theme, used terrorist attacks to criticize France in February. Apparently referencing the Paris attacks that killed 130 people in November 2015 and the truck attack in Nice in July 2016, Trump lamented that a friend of his who used to like visiting Paris would no longer visit the city. “I have a friend, he’s a very, very substantial guy. He loves the City of Lights, he loves Paris. For years, every year during the summer, he would go to Paris, was automatic with his wife and his family. “Hadn’t seen him in a while. And I said, ‘Jim, let me ask you a question: how’s Paris doing?’ “[Jim said]: ‘Paris? I don’t go there any more. Paris is no longer Paris.’” In March the New Yorker launched an investigation into whether Jim actually exists. It seems unlikely that he does. Sweden “You look at what’s happening,” Trump told a crowd in Florida on 18 February. “You look at what’s happening last night in Sweden. Sweden, who would believe this?” The comment came during a section of his speech when Trump was warning of the threat of terrorism, and seemed to imply that there had been an attack or incident in Sweden the night before. The fact that there had been no incident in Sweden the night before made it particularly difficult to believe. Trump never fully explained what had happened last night in Sweden. United Kingdom In an interview with the Wall Street Journal, Trump was asked about a potential trade agreement with Britain – given the UK’s imminent departure from the European Union. Trump’s answer was not very in depth. “You don’t hear the word Britain any more. It’s very interesting. It’s like, nope,” the president said. Then he started talking about the British Open golf tournament. Australia Trump did not insult the country per se – just its prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull. In his first official phone call with Australia’s leader – a sort of get-to-know-you for world leaders – Trump told Turnbull he was dissatisfied with their conversation. “I have had it. I have been making these calls all day and this is the most unpleasant call all day,” Trump said, according to the transcript of the call. The US president ended the call abruptly. Canada “Canada, what they’ve done to our dairy farm workers, it’s a disgrace,” Trump said in April. “Farmers in Wisconsin and New York state are being put out of business.” The Canadian government has import tariffs in place to protect its dairy farmers, CNN explained, and had been accused of undercutting American farmers. Canada did not immediately respond. Mexico “One of the highest-crime nations in the world,” Trump thundered back in August. He also accused Mexico – and Canada – of being “very difficult” during the the Nafta renegotiation process. Of course, Trump has also talked regularly about the need for a wall, and repeatedly said Mexico will pay for it. “Our country will not pay, under any circumstances, for a wall or physical barrier built on US territory along the Mexican border,” Mexico’s ministry of foreign affairs has said. Germany “Germany owes vast sums of money to Nato and the United States must be paid more for the powerful, and very expensive, defense it provides to Germany,” Trump said in March. Numerous media outlets reported that this was untrue. Nato members do not pay money to the organization. He also didn’t shake Angela Merkel’s hand when they met at the Oval Office. The next day, he dismissed reports that the meeting had been awkward and then tweeted that Germany owes “vast sums of money to NATO &amp; the United States”, which is false. North Korea Where to start. Trump has taken to calling Kim Jong-un “Rocket Man” – surely one of the president’s least effective nicknames – and has also referred to the North Korean leader as “a mad man”. Trump also believes North Korea is “a country ruled by a cult”. North Korea, through state media, has called Trump “an old lunatic”, a “mean trickster”, a “mentally deranged dotard”, a “human reject” and a “hideous criminal”. So perhaps they’re about even."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/dec/13/handshake-evidence-against-you-dwp-disabled","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-13T18:26:33Z","webTitle":"Claiming disability benefit?

Don’t ever dare shake hands","bodyText":"Do you shake hands? I do – with people I’m meeting for the first time, and often meeting up with people I already know really well. But the classic handshake is now not the single accepted greeting, and even with strangers you must awkwardly negotiate the possibility of the kiss on one or both cheeks, or bro shake with optional shoulder bump. But I’ve been trained to think of the unhesitating handshake as simple good manners. The same, I suspect, is true of former pub landlady Bethen Thorpe from north London, who was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in October 2014. She had to apply for disability benefit, filled in a 35-page application form, and then travelled to Chelmsford, Essex, for an assessment meeting. She was turned down partly because she shook the DWP assessor’s hand, which was taken as evidence of her fitness for work. The handshake, that historic gesture of good faith, was turned against her. Since then, Thorpe has had the handshake-dismissal overturned on appeal. But what lessons are to be drawn? Only this. If you’re disabled and meeting your DWP assessor for the first time – or any time – just offer up your cheek for a delicate, feather-light kiss. Cat persona non grata I have now reread it so often I can just recite, word for word, Cat Person, the short story in the New Yorker from Kristen Roupenian, which went viral this week. In fact, there has been a bit of a hipster ownership rush, so I should make it clear to lesser fans that I am one of that revered elite whose tweets praising it were “liked” by the author’s mother. Cat Person tells the story of a catastrophic relationship from the woman’s viewpoint, and in the Guardian yesterday Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett analysed the sexual politics involved in how it has been received. A 20-year-old college student begins a relationship with a 34-year-old man based on hardly more than flirtatious texts, on which both base misleading ideas of what the other is like. There has been a backlash from shrill and insecure men who claim the story is unfair to our fragile gender. And now, incredibly, BBC Three has published on its website a shamingly unfunny “retelling” of the story from the man’s point of view. The problem with this isn’t anything to do with a debate about “balance” and whether that should be extended to fiction. It’s simply the fact that it is horribly embarrassing and misjudged. BBC Three, which could itself be promoting short fiction, has hit a deafening false note, and probably deserves a gold statuette of Rupert Murdoch for undermining the licence fee. Bragging rights Connoisseurs of the humblebrag will have noticed my attempts at the beginning of the previous item, and it is a genre that continues to flourish in various forms. I have already written about the social media thankbrag (“Thanks to everyone who came to my sellout event last night”). But with the hip-hop musical Hamilton previewing now and opening in Britain next week, we will probably see the end of the Hamiltonbrag. This is what happens when pundits in this country find a pretext for writing about the phenomenon that is Hamilton, and after a paragraph or so casually drop the fact that they have been to see it, and getting the ticket was such a bit of good luck, but nonetheless shyly allowing us to notice how jetsettingly transatlantic and well-connected they are. When the show opens here, this much-cherished form of artless self-congratulation will gradually die out. • This article was amended on 15 December 2017 to clarify the account of Bethen Thorpe’s DWP assessment."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"politics/2018/jan/17/green-party-activist-says-sexual-harassment-claim-was-dismissed","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-17T14:14:36Z","webTitle":"Green party activist says sexual harassment claim was dismissed","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jan/17/green-party-activist-says-sexual-harassment-claim-was-dismissed","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/jan/17/green-party-activist-says-sexual-harassment-claim-was-dismissed","fields":{"headline":"Green party activist says sexual harassment claim was dismissed","bodyText":"A Green party activist has alleged that she was sexually harassed and pestered in her own home by a senior official after she took part in a scheme to offer accommodation to members during a party conference. The activist, who does not want to be named, reported the alleged harassment in 2012 but was told the party’s procedures did “not include investigating unwitnessed incidents as this would be a criminal matter”. She made a formal complaint to the Green party that the senior official in question made repeated passes at her, offered to massage her and tried to kiss her in her kitchen before she had to shut herself in her bedroom for her own safety. The senior official sent her an apology through the party and said he would attend a course on sexual harassment issues. But after reviewing the case, the Green party found it did not consider the behaviour to be “sexual harassment nor bullying nor intimidation – either by your account of the incident or his”, adding that it could see “no reasonable ground for fear that he might commit an offence under any of these categories in the future”. In one email seen by the activist, an official said it was not the party’s place to “deal with her issues” because they had taken up too much time. The Green party, now led by Caroline Lucas and Jonathan Bartley, has opened an independent review into her case and it is understood the senior official in question is no longer in a position of authority in the party. However, the activist said she was telling her story to the Guardian after years of trying to get redress from the party, which she said subsequently suspended her without giving her a copy of the allegations against her. She says she was not given an official reason for the suspension. In her complaint about her house guest in 2012, she said: “[He] made increasing sexual advances on me, none of which I had in any way invited and all of which I rejected either by word or action. “The advances took the form of increased casual touches on arm and shoulder which he had been doing during conference. Later he tried to keep touching my knee until I moved further away. He then offered to massage my feet which I refused. Then he attempted to hold my hand which I withdrew. “[He] then offered to bring me tea in bed in the morning, which suggestion I turned down as I felt that this was a ruse to intrude on me in my bedroom. I went into the kitchen to get a cup of tea before bed and [he] followed me in and attempted to kiss me, which I reacted to by turning away and avoiding contact. “By this time I was feeling a little scared, especially as a few drinks had impaired my reactions and ability to cope with the situation. I went to bed and took the precaution of wedging my bedroom door to prevent it being opened as I feared that [he] might make some excuse to intrude into my room.” She had been alone with the man at the time, after offering to put him up for two nights under the party’s official member accommodation scheme. The activist told the party that she was “intimidated, offended and significantly frightened by this behaviour and felt that [he] had taken advantage of the random proximity occasioned by my wish to be helpful by offering a visiting member accommodation.” Shortly afterwards, she received an apology from the senior official in question, sent via the party, in which he said he was “very sorry that I was not more restrained and respectful to your position and feelings, and humbly ask that you forgive me for my serious failure”. He also promised not to contact her in future, not to attend meetings of her local party, to attend a course of instruction on sexual harassment issues, and to ensure others could not be put in the same position that she was in future. However, the complaint was investigated by the Green party and the senior official was exonerated. In a letter to the complainant, the party said: “We can see no reason why he should not carry out his duties ... without reservation or exception, nor why you should have any concern for your safety at any event where [he] is present.” The activist made subsequent efforts to get the complaint reviewed for faulty processes, as the member was not suspended, but was told nothing more could be done. She sent a further email saying that she was left “feeling traumatised and suicidal by the mishandling of the complaint by the Green party, which was worse than the original harassment incident”, but was then accidentally copied into an email suggesting her correspondence should be ignored. In the exchange, one party official wrote to another: “I really don’t think it is our place to deal with her issues any more. Enough time has been taken already. Would you like me to reply or just to ignore her mails? I am afraid that I may not come across as sympathetic as she might expect me to be.” A Green party spokesperson said the case was now being reviewed and that a new disciplinary system has been in force since 2016. “The Green party takes bullying, harassment and sexual harassment very seriously and is committed to challenging it,” she said. “The national Green party accommodation scheme ended in 2015. In 2016 a new body, the disciplinary committee, took over responsibility for disciplinary matters. “In November 2017 the Green party began a thorough review of procedures for dealing with bullying, harassment and sexual harassment claims. An external HR specialist has been commissioned to examine previous complaints and how they were handled and these findings, along with the latest training, will be incorporated into new procedures for dealing with bullying, harassment and sexual harassment claims. “The original complaint was handled before the current complaints process, overseen by the disciplinary committee, came into force. The case is now being independently reviewed, by people unconnected to the original complaint and complaint handling process. “We are not able to comment any further on the case while that review is ongoing.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"money/2017/dec/14/link-atm-network-retain-free-cash-machines-1km-apart","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-14T00:01:16Z","webTitle":"Link ATM network vows to retain free cash machines – 1km apart","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2017/dec/14/link-atm-network-retain-free-cash-machines-1km-apart","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2017/dec/14/link-atm-network-retain-free-cash-machines-1km-apart","fields":{"headline":"Link ATM network vows to retain free cash machines – 1km apart","bodyText":"The Link network is attempting to counter claims that changes it is making to the way it operates will create “ATM deserts” by pledging to protect free-to-use cash machines a kilometre apart. Link plans to cut the fee that card providers pay to machine operators every time a customer withdraws cash, which has led to warnings that 10,000 out of the 55,000 free machines are at risk. This sparked fears that some areas will be left without a free machine or without one at all as providers shut unprofitable machines in deprived areas. In an attempt to defuse the row, Link said machines which are 1km or more away from the nearest free-to-use ATM will not be subject to the reduced interchange fee of 20p, down from 25p. This is thought to amount to about 2,000 machines. But the idea met with scepticism from Ron Delnevo, the executive director for Europe at the industry lobby group, the ATM Industry Association, who said Link appeared to be suggesting that town centres could have only one ATM at a time when bank branches were closing. Link’s announcement followed the intervention of the Treasury select committee, which wrote to the network last month to ask how many free ATMs would be affected and how Link defined customer detriment. In its response to Nicky Morgan, the chair of the Treasury select committee, Link said “the removal of an ATM or switching from free to pay-to-use which creates a 1km area with no free ATM access will be assumed a detriment”. A final decision is due next month, and Link said: “The board would like to announce, in advance of the main decision, that regardless of any wider changes to interchange, it will protect all free-to-use ATMs which are a kilometre or more from the next nearest free-to-use ATM. “These ATMs will still be subject to normal contractual and business pressures but by protecting the interchange at these sites these ATMs should not need to be removed as a result of a more general reduction in interchange rates.” The promise is in addition to Link’s existing financial inclusion programme, which provides a subsidy to machines in disadvantaged areas."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"travel/2017/dec/13/mountain-documentary-movie-willem-dafoe-robert-macfarlane-book","type":"article","sectionId":"travel","sectionName":"Travel","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-13T17:14:57Z","webTitle":"Mountain: a movie that reaches new peaks of cinematography","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2017/dec/13/mountain-documentary-movie-willem-dafoe-robert-macfarlane-book","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/travel/2017/dec/13/mountain-documentary-movie-willem-dafoe-robert-macfarlane-book","fields":{"headline":"Mountain: a movie that reaches new peaks of cinematography","bodyText":"The world’s high places are having a moment. Not only is there a minor publishing boom in books about our fascination with mountains, there have been some dramatic films too, partly driven by advances in technology that allow us to get intimate with these rugged landscapes in ways we never have before. In the wake of Baltasar Kormákur’s Everest and the documentary Meru, both released in 2015, comes Mountain, an exploration of our modern fascination with the world’s orogenic zones. It is a dizzying experience. Mountain brings together some of the strongest adventure sport cinematography of recent years, ricocheting around the planet, from Nepal to New Zealand and Austria to Antarctica, in an exhilarating game of vertical pinball. Few of these locations are identified. It’s the physical beauty of mountains that are explored here – not their actual locations. The adventurers appearing in the film aren’t identified either, nor is what they do set in context. We are left to marvel at what the outliers of our species are capable of achieving. Mountain is Australian director Jennifer Peedom’s follow-up to the much grittier, Bafta-nominated Sherpa, which was all about disadvantaged mountain people taking excessive risks on Everest while working for wealthy foreign tourists. I worked as a consultant on that film and was struck by Peedom’s determination, working and living at over 5,000 metres, to cover every angle of a complex story and her sensitivity to the subject. I also admired her secret weapon on that project, the American film-maker and climber Renan Ozturk. Ozturk is also the visual lynchpin of Mountain. He shot most of the arresting sequences in the film, some drawn from his earlier work on landmark adventure documentaries such as Meru and the Last Honey Hunter. If you’ve been at one of the increasing number of mountain film festivals in recent years, you will recognise some of these scenes. If you haven’t, prepare to be amazed. The opening sequence is Ozturk’s work, showing his friend Alex Honnold, the most famous solo climber in history, perched on his toes hundreds of feet up El Potrero Chico, a limestone cliff in Mexico, with no rope to break his fall, casually shaking out both arms at the same time. It’s enough to make your palms sweat. Yet despite all the thrills, Ozturk’s most arresting footage is of the mountains themselves, unadorned by human intervention. There are some ravishing sequences in Mountain – the long, lingering gaze of someone enthralled and intimately aware of how light in the mountains can melt and shift in moments. If the film is part enquiry and part love letter, it is Ozturk who brings a lot of the visual rapture, underpinned with a soaring, deeply romantic score from the Australian Chamber Orchestra. The film’s philosophical perspective is developed from Robert Macfarlane’s book Mountains of the Mind, whose eloquent words on our fascination with mountains are heard throughout. Willem Dafoe, in a voice that seems to emanate from the throne room of the mountain gods, narrates. It is very much a western perspective. “The idea barely existed,” Dafoe tells us, “that wild landscapes might hold any kind of attraction.” Well, up to a point Willem. That might have been the case in the Christian west, where animist traditions were first suborned and then subverted. In that narrative, mountains certainly were on the cultural fringes. Yet in many parts of the world, mountains have remained a central part of the mystery of life and of its most pressing issues too: climate change, which isn’t mentioned in the film, and the fact that many of the world’s conflicts are fought in mountains, as marginalised people use the wild terrain as their only advantage. The European fascination for mountains, born from Romantic notions of the sublime and a growing scientific understanding of how they were formed, segued predictably into mass tourism. Mountain tracks the dispiriting consequences: the all-consuming ski resorts and road networks that nibble away at the wildernesses, “replacing mystery with mastery”. It also poses some awkward questions about the impact consumerism has on the daredevils in thrall to social media. Money from Red Bull might let you you live the dream but it’s a hustle; the mountains neither know nor care how many Instagram followers you have. I liked that Mountain watched such antics only from afar, humans playing their games against the kind of throat-catching beauty that only deep time can provide. The mountains, as Macfarlane writes, “watched us arrive. They will watch us leave.” • Mountain is released in the UK on 15 December; mountainmovie.co.uk Ed Douglas’s latest book is The Magician’s Glass: eight essays on climbing and the mountain life (Vertebrate Publishing, £14.95).

Martin McDonagh’s dark comedy-drama, which stars Frances McDormand as a mother who takes desperate measures to bring her daughter’s killer to justice, received a total of four nominations in total, with nods for McDormand (best female actor), Woody Harrelson and Sam Rockwell (supporting actor) and best ensemble. Also performing well was Greta Gerwig’s acclaimed coming-of-age story Lady Bird, which picked up three nominations, for Saoirse Ronan (best female actor), Laurie Metcalf (female supporting actor) and best ensemble. Other films to receive multiple nominations included I, Tonya, The Big Sick, Mudbound, The Shape of Water and Get Out. There were nods for several actors predicted to be Oscars favourites. Gary Oldman was nominated as best actor for his turn as Churchill in second world war drama Darkest Hour, as was Denzel Washington for his performance as a civil rights lawyer in Roman J Israel Esq., while The Shape of Water’s Sally Hawkins received a best actress nomination for her appearance as a mute cleaner in the fantasy drama. There were notable snubs for two films expected to feature heavily in the Oscars conversation. Neither Steven Spielberg’s The Post or Paul Thomas Anderson’s Phantom Thread picked up a single nomination, despite boasting high-profile leads: Daniel Day-Lewis for Phantom Thread, Meryl Streep and Tom Hanks for The Post. Also absent was All the Money in the World, Ridley Scott’s troubled John Paul Getty biopic, and Hugh Jackman’s The Greatest Showman, both of which received surprise nods at the Golden Globe nominations on 11 December. In the TV portion of the nominations, Big Little Lies picked up four nominations, including picks for Nicole Kidman, Laura Dern and Reese Witherspoon in the best female actor in a TV movie or miniseries. Stranger Things and wrestling comedy GLOW also received four nominations each. The winners of the Screen Actors Guild awards will be announced on 21 January.

These are dark times","bodyText":"The tradition of Christmas tales, made popular in the 19th century by Charles Dickens, is based on the theme of redemption. Misanthropy, isolation and self-pity must be replaced by self-knowledge, generosity, communion and compassion – usually as a result of some pivotal encounter in which innocence thaws bitterness and cynicism. It’s a theme that runs from A Christmas Carol through It’s a Wonderful Life, How the Grinch Stole Christmas and Miracle on 34th Street, all the way to Frozen. Even if the religious message isn’t overt, there’s often a strongly Christian-flavoured strand of magic at work: in The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, the Witch’s curse over Narnia decrees that it be “always winter, but never Christmas”. But as with the festival itself, in some of the greatest Christmas classics there’s a current of darker, older beliefs underlying the cosy festive traditions: a harking back to the winter solstice, the turning of the year, with all its implications of the darkest day and the return of the light. So it’s a joy for those of us who like a bit of pagan magic with our mince pies to see two examples enjoying a revival, on stage and through the power of social media. John Masefield’s 1935 novel The Box of Delights perfectly captures this tension between the civilised rituals of Christmas and the wilder, pagan forces beneath that threaten to overturn it, like the Green Knight bursting into King Arthur’s Christmas feast. The central plot revolves around the wizard Abner Brown attempting to prevent the thousandth Christmas service at Tatchester cathedral; clergymen and bishops are kidnapped, and representatives of the church shown as helpless against a more potent, ancient magic. Masefield, who wrote only two stories for children – The Box of Delights is a sequel to The Midnight Folk – was a direct influence on JRR Tolkien and CS Lewis, yet the books are far less familiar to children now. Like many people of my generation, I discovered The Box of Delights through the 1984 BBC adaptation; at the age of 10, I found a frisson in its references to pagan folklore, Arthurian legend and medieval philosophy that I had not encountered in more sanitised children’s stories. It nourished my lifelong fascination with Renaissance occultism. The author Piers Torday had been similarly obsessed with the story as a child. He wanted to stage an adaptation while at university with two friends who shared his passion for it, but the rights were not available, and the project was forgotten. Twenty-five years on, the stars aligned: the same friends were now a theatre executive and a producer, and Torday’s new adaptation of The Box of Delights has just opened at Wilton’s Music Hall in east London. The book’s appeal, he says, lies in the combination of “classic English Christmas fantasy” – carol singers, food markets with plum puddings, cathedral choirs – with “the long shadows of pagan tradition” that still haunt our midwinter feast. Susan Cooper’s 1973 novel The Dark is Rising is clearly influenced by Masefield. She too draws on Arthurian legend and English folklore (the character of Herne the Hunter appears in both), as it intrudes into the cosy domestic rituals of the young hero, Will Stanton, who goes to bed on midwinter eve, the night before his 11th birthday, and wakes to find himself a central figure in an ancient battle between light and dark. When the nature writer Robert Macfarlane, for whom it was a formative childhood book, tweeted about it recently he was amazed to receive thousands of responses from all over the world from impassioned readers who return to it every Christmas. The result is a Twitter reading group (#TheDarkisReading) set to begin, like the novel, on 20 December; over 1,300 people have said they want to take part. The Dark is Rising is a disturbing book, in a way that children’s stories rarely are now. At the beginning, Cooper describes Will’s fear of the dark in a way that makes the hairs stand up on your arms; she draws out echoes of the old powers of the English landscape – now hostile, now beguiling – in a way that recalls the Gawain poet. “It feels ever more relevant in a time when the dark really does seem to be rising,” Macfarlane says. For anyone weary of the cheap sentiment and tinselly glitz of so many Christmas offerings, and wanting a taste of deep midwinter mystery, these novels are the best place to start, and these new ways of sharing them are part of the magic. • Stephanie Merritt writes as SJ Parris.

Rupert Murdoch has been giving particular attention to who takes over control of his media interests since 2014, when Lachlan returned to the family business a decade after leaving (reportedly due to tensions with the late Fox News founder Roger Ailes). Since then there has been a power-sharing arrangement between younger son James, the 45-year-old chief executive of 21st Century Fox and chairman of Sky, and Lachlan, the 46-year-old co-chairman of 21st Century Fox and News Corp, home to publishing assets including the Sun, Times and Wall Street Journal. Between them, they straddle a Murdoch empire split into two separately listed entities: 21st Century Fox, and News Corp. The Disney deal leaves James without a portfolio once it completes, although Disney has said it is talking to Rupert’s youngest son about giving him an executive role. Either way, James is expected to leave his father’s business after 20 years. He is only a non-exec director at News Corp, and with 21st Century Fox’s planned Sky takeover bogged down in a regulatory inquiry some media observers believe he has taken the backseat to Lachlan in his father’s estimations. Lachlan will continue to run the remaining assets, including the powerful and profitable Fox News, and could be lined up to lead a News Corp that could be enlarged by adding the remaining assets of 21st Century Fox, as well as the newspaper business. 2) What happens to the rest of 21st Century Fox including Fox News? Following the deal to sell 21st Century Fox and most of its assets, Rupert Murdoch will retain ownership of Fox News, the division’s biggest profit driver, as well as Fox Sports, Fox Business and its broadcast TV network of 28 local television stations in the US. Analysts have suggested there would be a strategic rationale in the remaining news- and sport-focused businesses to be recombined with News Corp, home to assets including the Sun, Times, Wall Street Journal, Dow Jones and TalkSport. News Corp was spun-off as a separate company in 2013 in a bid to separate the Murdochs’ entertainment assets from the newspaper portfolio which had become toxic following the phone hacking revelations at the now defunct News of the World. 3) Could the deal be blocked? The deal would be scrutinised by the US and UK regulatory authorities. A Disney-Fox combination would mean it accounts for almost 40% of the $11bn (£8bn) US box office, the biggest movie market in the world, and a similar level in the UK. In the US, sports rights could also be an issue. Both sides will be hoping the deal does not become as endangered as AT&amp;T’s $85bn bid for Time Warner. The US justice department is threatening to scupper that deal unless news channel CNN is offloaded, which executives indicated may be in part due to President Donald Trump’s dislike of the news channel. 4) What does it mean for the Sky deal? The UK’s Competition and Markets Authority is due to publish its preliminary conclusions on whether to clear 21st Century Fox’s £11.7bn bid to buy the remaining 61% of Sky he does not already own in mid-January. The CMA is looking at the impact of the deal on media plurality and standards. Disney’s takeover of Fox, which could take months to gain clearance in the US, will not impact the CMA continuing its investigation. Until the Disney deal gets shareholder and regulator go-ahead, the CMA must still act as if Murdoch’s Fox is buying Sky. If the CMA gives approval, Fox’s offer would only require the backing of Sky’s shareholders. However, the looming Fox/Disney transaction creates a complication if the offer fails. Is Disney also obliged to make its own bid under the UK takeover rules that cover changes in the control of a company? Disney has told the Takeover Panel, the City watchdog on bids and mergers, that it thinks it is under no obligation to mount a full bid for Sky. However, the panel will form its own view after talking to Sky’s independent directors. The position is messy. If the panel were to decide Disney must bid for Sky, the next question will be: at what price? That would depend on the value being attributed to the 39% Sky stake within Disney’s overall bid for Fox. There may not be a simple answer – or, at least, there could be hot debate. 5) What does it mean for Sky subscribers in the UK? Disney is a big investor in film and TV content so expect Sky to remain well-funded in terms of original dramas along the lines of Fortitude and the Tunnel. In a competitive pay-TV environment, it would be a surprise if Disney raises subscription prices any higher, with Netflix and Amazon Prime eating away at the market share of every UK broadcaster. However, Disney’s enthusiasm for Premier League football might be tested given an unsuccessful attempt at broadcasting top-flight football in the UK with ESPN. Sky has more than 12m subscribers in the UK and Ireland. • Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"law/2017/dec/13/police-less-likely-find-drugs-black-people-during-stop-search","type":"article","sectionId":"law","sectionName":"Law","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-13T15:05:41Z","webTitle":"Police less likely to find drugs on black people during stop and search","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2017/dec/13/police-less-likely-find-drugs-black-people-during-stop-search","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/law/2017/dec/13/police-less-likely-find-drugs-black-people-during-stop-search","fields":{"headline":"Police less likely to find drugs on black people during stop and search","bodyText":"Black people are less likely to be found carrying drugs when stopped and searched in England and Wales than white people, according to a “troubling” finding by the police watchdog. An analysis by Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire and Rescue Services (HMICFRS) found that one in four black people searched for drugs were found to be carrying them, compared with one in three white people. The disproportionality persisted in cases where grounds for the search included the smell of cannabis. “The disparity in find rates is troubling,” said the watchdog. “It suggests that the use of stop and search on black people might be based on weaker grounds for suspicion than its use on white people, particularly in respect of drugs. “There may be a number of reasons for these findings but, taken alongside the fact that black people are more than eight times more likely than white people to be stopped and searched, they require an explanation that the service is currently unable to provide.” The HMICFRS analysis, contained within its annual report on policing legitimacy, assessed 8,574 stop and search records – about 200 from each force – for the reasonableness of the recorded ground for a stop and search, as well as the ethnicity of the person detained, and whether the item searched for was found. Disproportionality in the use of stop and search has increased despite an overall drop in the use of the tactic to about a quarter of that in 2011-12, when black people were five times more likely to be stopped. While the number of white people stopped and searched was down 78%, the number of black people stopped had fallen by just 66%. The report also noted that many officers were unaware of recent College of Policing guidance that the smell of cannabis would not normally justify a search, with 7% of stop and search records citing it as the sole grounds. It called on forces to train officers to consider “multiple strong grounds” when deciding whether to search. Deputy chief constable Adrian Hanstock, the National Police Chiefs’ Council’s lead for stop and search, said forces had made “good progress” in applying stop and search powers legitimately and fairly. He said the NPCC was looking at why young black men are disproportionately stopped. “We are working closely with the Home Office, College of Policing and a range of independent experts to critically analyses the data we collect, as well as commission further research to help us better understand why some groups, such as young black men, are disproportionately reflected not only in stop and search figures but also as victims of violent crime and across the criminal justice system as a whole,” Hanstock said. Carson Arthur, of the campaign group StopWatch, said the disproportionality in the use of stop and search reflected its history as a tactic employed in conjunction with drug laws to disrupt and control black and minority ethnic communities in Britain. “It’s not surprising to read that report, in particular that finding that white people are more likely to [be caught] carrying drugs yet black people are disproportionately stopped and searched,” he said. “It just vindicates what a lot of black people who have been stopped and searched have been saying for many years.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"global-development/2017/dec/14/almost-100-million-people-a-year-choose-food-healthcare-extreme-poverty","type":"article","sectionId":"global-development","sectionName":"Global development","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-14T06:30:24Z","webTitle":"Almost 100 million people a year ‘forced to choose between food and healthcare’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2017/dec/14/almost-100-million-people-a-year-choose-food-healthcare-extreme-poverty","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2017/dec/14/almost-100-million-people-a-year-choose-food-healthcare-extreme-poverty","fields":{"headline":"Almost 100 million people a year ‘forced to choose between food and healthcare’","bodyText":"Almost 100 million people are pushed into extreme poverty each year because of debts accrued through healthcare expenses. A report, published by the World Health Organization and the World Bank on Wednesday, found the poorest and most vulnerable people are routinely forced to choose between healthcare and other necessities for their household, including food and education, subsisting on $1.90 (£1.40) a day. Researchers found that more than 122 million people around the world are forced to live on $3.10 a day, the benchmark for “moderate poverty”, due to healthcare expenditure. Since 2000, this number has increased by 1.5% a year. A total of 800 million people spend more than 10% of their household budgets on “out-of-pocket” health expenses, defined as costs not covered by insurance. Almost 180 million people spend a quarter or more, a population increasing at a rate of almost 5% per year, with women among those worst affected. “Only 17% of women in the poorest fifth of households have adequate access to maternal and child health services compared to 74% of women in the richest fifth of households,” said Timothy Evans, senior director of health, nutrition and population at the World Bank Group. “This remains a problem for not only poor regions of the world, but for all countries at all income levels. At the World Bank, we think that this is both morally and economically bankrupt and unsustainable. “Universal healthcare coverage is not just about better health. The reality is that as long as millions of people are being impoverished by health expenses, we will not reach our collective sustainable development goal of ending extreme poverty by 2030.” The WHO and the World Bank want everyone, irrespective of their circumstances, to receive necessary health services without risking financial hardship. Though universal health coverage is a key target of the UN sustainable development goals, campaigners argue that without a solid commitment from governments this target is out of reach. “Every country has the resources available to them if they prioritise. This is why we want to see a much greater focus on primary healthcare because it is the poorest who are losing out,” said Oxfam’s health policy adviser, Anna Marriott. “Too much funding is going for tertiary hospitals in urban areas that tend to benefit the better off more than the poor, and yet rural areas are neglected, with people left to fend for themselves. “We absolutely need a commitment to address inequality in health. You are almost four times as likely to get the essential package of healthcare if you are rich.” According to the report, Asia has the highest rate globally of those pushed below the poverty line due to out-of-pocket health costs. An estimated 72% of those spending 25% of their household budgets on healthcare live in Asia. Africa has seen the fastest increase in the numbers of people who spent at least 10% of their budgets on healthcare. The problem of healthcare affordability is not limited to developing countries. In Europe, Latin America and parts of Asia, each of which have high levels of access to health services, increasing numbers of people are spending at least 10% of their household budgets on health expenses."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2017/dec/14/star-wars-the-last-jedi-in-depth-fan-review-i-finally-got-to-see-my-dreams-come-true","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-14T10:00:28Z","webTitle":"Star Wars: The Last Jedi in-depth fan review: 'I finally got to see my dreams come true'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/dec/14/star-wars-the-last-jedi-in-depth-fan-review-i-finally-got-to-see-my-dreams-come-true","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2017/dec/14/star-wars-the-last-jedi-in-depth-fan-review-i-finally-got-to-see-my-dreams-come-true","fields":{"headline":"Star Wars: The Last Jedi in-depth fan review: 'I finally got to see my dreams come true'","bodyText":"When I was a young nerdlinger playing with Star Wars toys in the backyard (OK, indoors, let’s be honest) I had a very specific fantasy. Not just having Chewbacca as a best friend ... in the movie in my mind, Jedi Knights would defeat their foes by taking their at-rest lightsabers, pressing the hilt against someone’s head and then activating its emitter. Man, wouldn’t that be a savage way to take out some Mos Eisley scum and villainy? But surely I’d never get a chance to see something that awesome in a Star Wars movie, right? Well, with The Last Jedi I finally got to see my dreams come true. More importantly, in ways far cooler (complete with tension and dramatic purpose and story advancement) than I ever could imagine. Rian Johnson, writer and director of this film, took my Star Wars reveries and served them back to me with vast improvements. While there are some solid nuggets of deep-cut easter eggs for hardcore fans, what is so extraordinary about The Last Jedi is that this is the first post-Lucas Star Wars film that feels free to dance to its own beat. It is thrilling that this franchise, which looked like it was lumbering after some behind-the-scenes woe , is evolving in its prime storyline. The callbacks, reappearances of old friends and in-jokes surely gave me what physicians of the day now diagnose as “the feels,” but they were not my favorite part of the movie. Instead I was more thrilled that this isn’t just a trace-over job; The Last Jedi, truly, is its own movie. WARNING: SPOILERS AHEAD But still, what were the best fan-service moments? Well, the biggie was R2-D2 trying to convince Luke Skywalker to get out of his gloomy place and help Rey (and Chewbacca) return to General Leia’s Rebel Base and help defeat the First Order. Luke has been living like the Man of Aran in Ahch-To, home to the first Jedi Temple, a pretty spartan place with a very limited library. When Luke rejects Rey’s plea, Artoo turns the Dejarik tables on him by replaying Princess Leia’s original hologram: “Help me, Obi Wan Kenobi. You’re my only hope.” It’s a broad beat meant to pull on everyone’s heartstrings. (Indeed, everything featuring Leia has some extra gravitas, knowing that Carrie Fisher died so soon after filming.) Moments earlier, however, seasoned fans had their minds scrambled by Luke’s glib comment about running into battle with a “laser sword.” A laser sword is, of course, something only a dunce would call a lightsaber, which is why it is particularly galling that George Lucas, the man who lives to aggravate Star Wars fans, says this in interviews from time to time. The term, originally written as “lazerswords,” originates from early drafts of Lucas’s first scripts, but it got a canonical mention from (hold your nose, everyone) young Jake Lloyd as Anakin Skywalker in The Phantom Menace. Now Rian Johnson has stolen it back! Ahch-To is home to the adorable puffin-like pups called the Porgs, and also some enormous sea-bird Nessie-like hybrid creatures that, if you squeeze their nipples offer up milk. (No, I’m not joking.) Part of Luke’s morning routine is fetching himself a bottle and, yes, I’m proud to report that the milk has a tinge of blue. Not quite as blue as bantha milk, but the color is definitely noticeable. Another important color in the film is red, and Supreme Leader Snoke’s lair is straight out of Akira Kurosawa’s Kagemusha. Kurosawa’s The Hidden Fortress is a known influence on Lucas’ original, so I suspect that these scenes (which eventually go full samurai) are, in a way, a homage to the homage. George Lucas was an executive producer on the 1980 Japanese film. While we’re talking about Rian Johnson the cinephile, there’s also a modified quote from Sam Peckinpah’s The Wild Bunch. Oscar Isaac’s Poe Dameron turns to his posse during a tense moment and says “if they move, stun ‘em,” which is definitely the more family friendly version of that uttered in the 1969 western. There’s an interesting motif in The Last Jedi that involves little totems. Two involve a new character, the engineer Rose Tico (Kelly Marie Tran) who has a crescent-shaped medallion and a ring that flashes the rebel symbol. The medallion (similar to one her sister carried) ends up having an unexpected and humorous in-story use, and the the ring becomes a leave-behind for a next generation of the Resistance. Then there are some gold, hanging dice taken from the Millennium Falcon that, I have to admit, I never noticed before. This is The Last Jedi at its peak. It finds something that already existed in the mythos, gives it new significance and, along the way, likely inspires a kid in the audience who 30 years from now (as there will never be star peace) to reintroduce it to awestruck audiences when we cheer for Episode XXIII."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/shortcuts/2017/dec/13/talking-turkey-the-best-culinary-hacks-for-christmas-dinner","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-13T15:20:38Z","webTitle":"Talking turkey: the best culinary hacks for Christmas dinner","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/shortcuts/2017/dec/13/talking-turkey-the-best-culinary-hacks-for-christmas-dinner","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/shortcuts/2017/dec/13/talking-turkey-the-best-culinary-hacks-for-christmas-dinner","fields":{"headline":"Talking turkey: the best culinary hacks for Christmas dinner","bodyText":"Poor old Prue Leith lurches from one “controversy” to another. Having inadvertently revealed the winner of the most recent series of Bake Off hours before the final show aired, the cookery writer now stands accused of raising “fears over food safety” by admitting she “cheats like anything” at Christmas; she has a boned, stuffed turkey stashed in the freezer ready for the big day. As the Daily Mail was quick to point out, a stuffed turkey “is harder to defrost properly and takes longer to cook through. If it is not thoroughly defrosted and cooked, there is a risk of food poisoning from bugs such as salmonella and campylobacter.” Well, duh: as if Prue – a former Michelin-starred restaurateur whose cookery school has taught generations of people their way around the kitchen – doesn’t know that. As no doubt she would confirm, a turkey should be taken out of the freezer at least a day in advance of cooking, two in the case of very large or ready-stuffed birds, to allow for thorough thawing. Ideally, this should be done in the fridge, but if that is stuffed fuller than the bird then a cool, dry place such as a garage or the boot of a car will do. Even if you freeze only the stuffing at this point, you will be giving yourself one fewer thing to do on the big day. While you are at it, preparing roast potatoes up to the point when you would usually put them in the oven, then freezing them on a baking tray, yields surprisingly good results – indeed, the team at Sainsbury’s magazine reckons it makes them extra crunchy. The same goes for parsnips: stick them next to those pigs in blankets you wrapped earlier. Cranberry sauce can be prepared a week in advance and kept in the fridge; bread sauce a couple of days ahead. Gravy can be chilled or frozen (although I would recommend getting in some really good chicken stock instead: it is a shame to waste all those lovely roasting juices). Sprouts can be parboiled or steamed until al dente on Christmas Eve, chilled and then reheated by being sautéed in a hot pan until they just begin to char. If you are a braised red cabbage person, you will know that it is even better a few days old. The Christmas pudding, of course, should have been made and steamed weeks ago – but if you are not Bake Off material you may well be planning to microwave a shop-bought one. Serve it with the brandy butter you made a few days ago, a good ready-made custard or (best of all) vanilla ice-cream – and be glad you don’t have Paul Hollywood breathing down your neck this Christmas. I am sure Prue is."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"sport/2017/dec/13/chris-froome-cycling-how-long-could-he-be-banned-what-happens-next","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-13T13:44:43Z","webTitle":"Chris Froome Q&A: how long could he be banned for and what happens next?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/dec/13/chris-froome-cycling-how-long-could-he-be-banned-what-happens-next","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/dec/13/chris-froome-cycling-how-long-could-he-be-banned-what-happens-next","fields":{"headline":"Chris Froome Q&A: how long could he be banned for and what happens next?","bodyText":"What is salbutamol? A drug used by asthma sufferers to open up their medium and large airways in the lungs, thus helping them to breathe easier. It is typically taken via an inhaler. In Froome’s case, a sample taken at the Vuelta a España race on 7 September, three days before the end of the race, showed an abnormally high level of the drug in his urine. Why does Froome take it? As an asthmatic, Froome takes salbutamol to manage his condition. However during the latter stages of the Vuelta a España in September, he was given extra doses by the Team Sky doctor because he says his asthma had worsened. However his team insist that these doses were still inside the legal limit set by the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada). Is it performance enhancing? There is disagreement among scientists over how much or, indeed, whether it helps. A study published last year showed that inhaled Beta2-Agonist drugs, such as salbutamol, increased power output in men cyclists and “may postpone fatigue” in skeletal muscles. However, experts such as the University of Kent’s Dr John Dickinson – who has tested numerous British Olympians for asthma – say research on the possible benefits from inhaled salbutamol clearly show it is performance-enabling for asthmatics but not performance enhancing. Why is he allowed to use it? Under Wada’s rules, athletes are allowed to take up to 16 puffs of salbutamol in a 24-hour period, or eight in a 12-hour span. However if they are found to have salbutamol in excess of 1000 nanograms per millilitre in their urine they are considered to have an adverse analytical finding – unless they can prove the abnormal result somehow came from taking a permitted amount of the drug. How many puffs did he take for this reading? Froome was found to have 2000ng/ml in his urine when it was taken after the 17th stage of the Vuelta, which theoretically means that he may have taken 32 puffs. However Froome and Team Sky insist that he only took the drug within legal limits. So has he actually failed a drug test? Yes. But it is considered an adverse analytical finding not an anti-doping rule violation. The distinction is important. It means that Froome has to explain why there was an excess of salbutamol in his system. What’s Froome and Sky’s defence? Team Sky have admitted that Froome did take extra salbutamol on the date of the failed test – but they insist they did not expect it to take him over the limit. In a statement, Team Sky insisted that “a wide range of factors can affect the concentrations [of salbutamol in a urine sample], including the interaction of salbutamol with food or other medications, dehydration and the timing of salbutamol usage before the test.” Is this another case of a Team Sky rider being given a ‘TUE’? No. Froome did not need a therapeutic use exemption, which lets athletes take substances that would otherwise be banned, as formal permission was not required to take up to 16 puffs of salbutamol in a 24-hour period. What happens next? For some substances an adverse analytical finding automatically triggers a provisional ban from cycling’s governing body, the UCI, but that is not the case with salbutamol. That means Froome is allowed to compete until his case, which has been ongoing since 20 September, is resolved. At some point in the coming weeks or months, Froome’s medical and legal team will present their explanation and whatever evidence they have to the UCI. If it accepts his explanation, Froome will be cleared. If not, he will almost certainly be stripped of his Vuelta title and probably issued with a ban. What’s happened to people who have had this adverse analytical finding before? It depends. The Italian rider Diego Ulissi got a nine-month ban for 1920ng/ml in 2014 – a similar level to Froome. Another Italian, Alessandro Petacchi, got a year for 1320ng/ml in 2007 and was stripped of his five Giro d’Italia stage victories. However, the Swiss cyclist Leonardo Piepoli got no ban for levels reportedly similar to Petacchi’s in 2007."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"music/2017/dec/14/fela-kuti-box-set-4-curated-by-erykah-badu-review-witty-informative-selection-of-music-from-a-master","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-14T23:30:01Z","webTitle":"Fela Kuti: Box Set 4, curated by Erykah Badu review – witty, informative selection of music from a master","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/dec/14/fela-kuti-box-set-4-curated-by-erykah-badu-review-witty-informative-selection-of-music-from-a-master","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2017/dec/14/fela-kuti-box-set-4-curated-by-erykah-badu-review-witty-informative-selection-of-music-from-a-master","fields":{"headline":"Fela Kuti: Box Set 4, curated by Erykah Badu review – witty, informative selection of music from a master","bodyText":"It wasn’t easy getting hold of Fela Kuti’s extraordinary music during much of his lifetime, but that changed dramatically after his death in 1997.

The 70-year-old remains the highest points-scorer in the history of the NBA and, having won six championships and been picked for a record 19 All-Star Games, he is often compared with Michael Jordan when the greatest basketball players of all time are listed. Yet no one in American sport today can match Kareem’s political and cultural impact over 50 years. In the 90 minutes since he knocked on my hotel room door in Los Angeles, Abdul-Jabbar has recounted a dizzying personal history which stretches from conducting his first-ever interview with Martin Luther King in Harlem, when he was just 17, to receiving a hand-written insult from Donald Trump in 2015. We move from Colin Kaepernick calling him last week to the moment when, aged 20, Kareem was the youngest man invited to the Cleveland Summit – as the leading black athletes in 1967 gathered to meet Muhammad Ali to decide whether they would support him after he had been stripped of his world title and banned from boxing for rejecting the draft during the Vietnam War. Kaepernick, the former San Francisco 49ers quarterback who has been shut out of the NFL for his refusal to stand for the US national anthem, is engaged in a different struggle. But, after being banished unofficially from football for going down on a bended knee in protest against racism and police brutality, Kaepernick has one of his staunchest allies in Abdul-Jabbar. At the Cleveland Summit Abdul-Jabbar was called Lew Alcindor, for he had not converted to Islam then, and he became one of Ali’s ardent supporters. When Ali convinced his fellow athletes he was right to stand against the US government, the young basketball star knew he needed to make his more reticent voice heard. He has stayed true to that conviction ever since. “We’re talking about 50 years since the Cleveland Summit, wow,” Abdul-Jabbar exclaims. “We were tense about what we were going to do and Ali was the opposite. He said: ‘We’ve got to fight this in court and I’m going to start a speaking tour.’ Ali had figured out what he had to do in order to make the dollars – while fighting the case was essential to his identity. Bill Russell [the great Boston Celtics player] said: ‘I’ve got no concerns about Ali. It’s the rest of us I’m worried about.’ Ali had such conviction but he was cracking jokes and asking us if we were going to be as dumb as Wilt Chamberlain [another basketball great who played for the Philadelphia 76ers]. Wilt wanted to box Ali. Oh my God.” Abdul-Jabbar’s face creases with laughter before he becomes more serious again. “Black Americans wanted to protect Ali because he spoke for us when we had no voice. When he said: ‘Ain’t no Viet Cong ever called me the N-word’, we figured that one out real quick. Ali was a winner and people supported him because of his class as a human being. But some of the things we fought against then are still happening. Each generation faces these same old problems.” The previous evening, when I had sat next to Abdul-Jabbar at the Los Angeles Press Club awards, the past echoed again. Abdul-Jabbar received two prizes – the Legend Award and Columnist of the Year for his work in the Hollywood Reporter. Other award winners included Tippi Hedren, who starred in Alfred Hitchcock’s thriller, The Birds, and the New York Times reporters Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey who broke the Harvey Weinstein story two months ago. As if to prove that the past can be played over and over again in a contemporary loop, we saw footage of Hedren saying how she would not accept the sexual bullying of Hitchcock in the 1960s just before Kantor and Twohey described how they earned the trust of women who had been abused by Weinstein. Abdul-Jabbar explained quietly to me how much of an ordeal he found such occasions. He was happiest talking about John Coltrane or Sherlock Holmes, James Baldwin or Bruce Lee, but people kept coming over to ask for a selfie or a book to be signed while, all evening, comic references were made to his height. Abdul-Jabbar is 7ft 2in and he looked two feet taller than Hedren on the red carpet. The following morning, as he stretches out his long legs, I tell Kareem how I winced each time another wise-crack was made about his height. “I can tell you I was six-foot-two, aged 12, when the questions started,” Abdul-Jabbar says. “‘How’s the weather up there?’ I should write down all the things people said when affected by my height. One of the funniest was at an airport and this little boy of five looked at my feet in amazement. I said: ‘Hey, how you’re doing?’ He just said: ‘You must be very old – because you’ve got very big shoes.’ For him the older you were, the bigger your shoes. That’s the best I’ve heard.” In his simple but often beautiful and profound new book, Becoming Kareem, Abdul-Jabbar writes poignantly: “My skin made me a symbol, my height made me a target.” Race has been the primary issue which Abdul-Jabbar has confronted every day. In another absorbing Abdul-Jabbar book published this year, Coach Wooden and Me, he celebrates his friendship with the man who helped him win an unprecedented three NCAA championship titles with UCLA. They lost only two games in his three years on campus as UCLA established themselves as the greatest team in the history of college basketball and Wooden, a white midwesterner, and Kareem, a black kid from New York, forged a bond that lasted a half-century. Yet, amid their shared morality and decency, race remained an unresolved issue between them. Wooden was mortified when a little old lady stared up at the teenage Kareem and said: “I’ve never seen a nigger that tall.” Even though he would later say that he learnt more about man’s inhumanity to man by witnessing all his protégé endured over the years, Wooden’s memory of that encounter softened the woman’s racial insult by saying that she had called Kareem “a big black freak.” Abdul-Jabbar nods. “He would never see a little grey-haired lady using such language. When it doesn’t affect your life it’s hard for you to see. Men don’t understand what attractive women go through. We don’t get on a bus and have somebody squeeze our breast. We have no idea how bad it can be. For people to understand your predicament you’ve got to figure out how to convey that reality. It takes time.” Abdul-Jabbar made his first high-profile statement against the predicament of all African Americans when, in 1968, he boycotted the Olympic Games in Mexico. After race riots in Newark and Detroit, and the assassination of King in April 1968, he knew he could not represent his country. “Dr Harry Edwards [the civil rights activist] helped me realise how much power I had. The Olympics are a great event but what happened overwhelmed any patriotism. I had to make a stand. I wanted the country to live up to the words of the founding fathers – and make sure they applied to people of colour and to women. I was trying to hold America to that standard.” The athletes Tommie Smith and John Carlos took another path of protest. They competed in the Olympic 200m in Mexico and, after they had won gold and bronze, raised their gloved fists in a black power salute on the podium. “I was glad somebody with some political consciousness had gone to Mexico,” Abdul-Jabbar says, “so I was very supportive of them.” Does Kaepernick’s situation mirror those same issues? “Yeah. The whole issue of equal treatment under the law is still being worked out here because for so long our political and legal culture has denied black Americans equal treatment. But I was surprised Kaepernick had that awareness. It made me think: ‘I wonder how many other NFL athletes are also aware?’ From there it has bloomed. This generation has a very good idea on how to confront racism. I talked to Colin a couple of days ago on the phone and I’m really proud of him. He’s filed an issue with the Players Association about the owners colluding to keep him from working. That’s the best legal approach to it. I hope he prevails.” Over dinner the night before, he intimated that Kaepernick knew he would never play in the NFL again. “We didn’t get that deep into it,” he says now, “but he has an idea that is what’s going down. But he’s moved on. He hadn’t prepared for this but he coped with different twists and turns. Some of the owners in the NFL are sympathetic, some aren’t. It’s gone back and forth. But he appreciates the fact that kids in high school have taken an interest. So he got something done and this generation’s athletes are now more aware of civil rights.” Kaepernick has been voted GQ’s Citizen of the Year, the runner-up in Time magazine’s Person of the Year and this week he received Sports Illustrated’s Muhammad Ali Legacy Award. Considering the way Kaepernick “has never wavered in his commitment”, Abdul-Jabbar writes in Sports Illustrated that: “I have never been prouder to be an American … On November 30, it was reported that 40 NFL players and league officials had reached an agreement for the league to provide approximately $90m between now and 2023 for activism endeavors important to African American communities. Clearly, this is the result of Colin’s one-knee revolution and of the many players and coaches he inspired to join him. That is some serious impact … Were my old friend [Ali] still alive, I know he would be proud that Colin is continuing this tradition of being a selfless warrior for social justice.” In my hotel room, Abdul-Jabbar is more specific in linking tragedy and a deepening social conscience. “I don’t know how anybody could not be moved by some of the things we’ve seen. Remember the footage of [12-year-old] Tamir Rice getting killed [in Cleveland [in 2014]. The car stops and the cop stands up and executes Tamir Rice. It took two seconds. It’s so unbelievably brutal you have to do something about it. “LeBron James and other guys in the NBA all had something to say about such crimes [James and leading players wore I Can’t Breathe T-shirts in December 2014 to protest against the police killing of Eric Garner, another black man]. They weren’t talking as athletes. They were talking as parents because that could have been their kid.” If the NFL appears to have actively ended Kaepernick’s career, what does Abdul-Jabbar feel about the NBA’s politics? “The NBA has been wonderful. I came into the NBA and went to Milwaukee [where he won his first championship before winning five more with the LA Lakers]. Milwaukee had the first black general manager in professional sports [Wayne Embry in 1972]. And the NBA’s outreach for coaches, general managers and women has been exemplary. The NBA has been on the edge of change. I was hoping the NFL might do the same because some of the owners were taking the knee. But they’re making an example of Colin. It’s not right. Let him go out there and succeed or fail on the field like any other great athlete.” Abdul-Jabbar smiles shyly when I ask him about his first interview – with Martin Luther King 53 years ago. “As a journalist I started out interviewing Dr King. Whoa! By that point [1964], Dr King was a serious icon and I was thrilled he gave me a really good earnest answer. Moments like that affect your life. But my first real experience of being drawn into the civil rights movement came when I read James Baldwin’s The Fire Next Time.” Has he seen I Am Not Your Negro – Raoul Peck’s 2016 documentary of Baldwin? “It’s wonderful. I saw it two weeks after the Trump election. It was medicine for my soul. It made me think of how bad things were for James Baldwin. But remember him speaking at Cambridge [University] and the reception he got? Oh man, amazing! I kept telling people: ‘Trump is an asshole but go and see this film. Trump doesn’t matter because we’ve got work to do.’” In 2015, after Abdul-Jabbar wrote an opinion piece in the Washington Post, condemning Trump’s attempts to bully the press, the future president sent him a scrawled note: “Kareem – now I know why the press always treated you so badly. They couldn’t stand you. The fact is you don’t have a clue about life and what has to be done to make America great again.” Abdul-Jabbar smiles when I say that schoolyard taunt is a long way from the oratory of King or Malcolm X. “If you judge yourself by your enemies I’m doing great. Trump’s not going to change. He knows he is where he is because of his appeal to racism and xenophobia. The people that want to divide the country are in his camp. They want to go back to the 18th century. “Trump wants to move us back to 1952 but he’s not Eisenhower – who was the type of Republican that cared about the whole nation. Even George Bush Sr and George W Bush’s idea of fellow citizens did not exclude people of colour. George W’s cabinet looked like America. It had Condoleezza Rice and the Mexican American gentleman who was the attorney general [Alberto Gonzales] and Colin Powell. Women had important positions in his administration. Even though I did not like his policies, he wasn’t exclusionary. “Look what’s going on with Trump in Alabama [where the president supports Roy Moore in the state senate election despite his favoured candidate being accused of multiple sexual assaults of under-age girls]. You have a guy like him but he’s going to vote the way you want politically. That’s more important than what he’s accused of? People with that frightening viewpoint are still fighting a civil war. They have to be contained.” Does he fear that Trump might win a second term? “I don’t think he can, but the rest of us had better organise and vote in 2020. I hope people stop him ruining our nation.” Abdul-Jabbar also worries that college sport remains as exploitative as ever. “It’s a business and the coaches, the NCAA and universities make a lot of money and the athletes get exploited. They make billions of dollars for the whole system and don’t get any. I’m not saying they have to be wealthy but I think they should get a share of the incredible amount they generate.” In Coach Wooden and Me, he writes of how, in the 1960s, he was famous at UCLA but dead broke. “Yeah. No cash. It’s ridiculous. Basketball and football fund everything. College sports do not function on the revenue from water polo or track and field or gymnastics. It’s all down to basketball and football. The athletes at Northwestern tried to organise a union and that’s how college athletes have to think. They need to unionise. If they can organise they can get a piece of the pie because they are the show.” The legendary Michael Jordan never showed the social conscience of Abdul-Jabbar and other rare NBA activists like Craig Hodges. But Abdul-Jabbar is conciliatory towards Jordan and his commercially-driven contemporaries. “I was glad they became interested in being successful businessmen because their financial power makes a difference. I just felt they should leave a little room to help the causes they knew needed their help. But Jordan has come around. He gave some money to the NAACP for legal funds, thank goodness.” Abdul-Jabbar defines himself as a writer now. As he reflects on his LA Press Club awards he says: “To be honoured by other writers is incredible. I’m a neophyte. I’m a rookie.” He grins when I say he’s not doing not too badly for a rookie who has written 13 books, including novels about Mycoft Holmes – brother of Sherlock. “Yeah, but I still feel new to it and to get that recognition was wonderful. I was very flattered that the BBC came to interview me about Mycroft because the British are very protective of their culture. Arthur Conan Doyle is beyond an icon. So I was like, ‘Wow, maybe I am doing OK.’ When I was [an NBA] rookie somebody gave me a complete compilation of Doyle’s stories. I went from there. “People were amazed because I always used to be reading before a game – whether it was Sherlock Holmes or Malcolm X, John Le Carré or James Baldwin. But that was one of the luxuries of being a professional athlete. You get lots of time to read. My team-mates did not read to the same extent but I’m a historian and some of the guys had big holes in their knowledge of black history. So I was the librarian for the team.” I tell Abdul-Jabbar about my upcoming interview with Jaylen Brown of the Boston Celtics – and how the 21-year-old has the same thirst for reading and knowledge. While enthusiastic about the possibility of meeting Brown when the Celtics next visit LA, Abdul-Jabbar makes a wistful observation of a young sportsman’s intellectual curiosity. “He’s going to be lonely. Most of the guys are like: ‘Where are we going to party in this town? Where are the babes?’ So the fact that he has such broader interests is remarkable and wonderful.” Abdul-Jabbar acknowledges that his own bookish nature and self-consciousness about his height, combined with a fierce sense of injustice, made him appear surly and aloof as a player. It also meant he was never offered the head-coach job he desired. “They didn’t think I could communicate and they didn’t take the time to get to know me. But I didn’t make it easy for them so some of that falls in my lap – absolutely. But it’s different now. People stop me in the street and want to talk about my articles. It’s amazing.” Most of all, in his eighth decade, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar “loves to lose myself in my imagination. It’s a wonderful place to go when you’re old and creaky like me. I see myself working at this pace [writing at least a book a year] but it’s not like I have the hounds at my heels. Since my career ended I’ve been able to have friends and family. My new granddaughter will be three this month. She’s my very first [grandchild]. So my life has expanded in wonderful ways. But, still, we all have so much work to do. The work is a long way from being done.” Main photograph by Austin Hargrave/AUGUST"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2017/dec/08/toronto-fc-mls-cup-final-seattle-sounders","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-08T15:31:52Z","webTitle":"Toronto FC, once the favourite punchline of MLS, aiming to have last laugh","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/dec/08/toronto-fc-mls-cup-final-seattle-sounders","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/dec/08/toronto-fc-mls-cup-final-seattle-sounders","fields":{"headline":"Toronto FC, once the favourite punchline of MLS, aiming to have last laugh","bodyText":"Toronto FC were not so long ago Major League Soccer’s favourite punchline. Both on and off the field, they were the epitome of how not to run a franchise. The owners and numerous head coaches were as bad as the players, but perhaps most tragically they were a club characterised by their fragility. Whatever the opposite of clutch is, that’s what Toronto were, taking eight years to make the MLS play-offs for the first time. Their floundering became amusing to some, tedious to many. But something changed at BMO Field. Toronto will play their second successive MLS Cup final on Saturday, having stormed to the Supporters’ Shield as, by far and away, the best side in the league. Their points tally was the highest ever recorded over the course of a regular season, but most impressively, they have managed to maintain that momentum into the play-offs, conceding just once on their run to the final. Most will highlight the watershed signing of Sebastian Giovinco, and with good reason. The former Juventus playmaker has been nothing short of a revelation since joining Toronto FC in January 2015, setting a new benchmark for big money, big name Designated Players. The addition of Jozy Altidore, Michael Bradley and Victor Vazquez have also proved significant, with the hiring of Greg Vanney as head coach in August 2014 a pivotal moment, too. But Toronto’s rise is down to more than just the team they have put together on paper. There has been a fundamental shift in mentality at BMO Field. The fragile, vulnerable Toronto of years gone by is now a thing of the past. The punchline once uttered by so many no longer rings so funny. Under Vanney, TFC have become the team, and the club, they always had the potential to be. This is illustrated by the way Vanney and his side have shouldered the expectation placed on them this season. Toronto were many people’s MLS Cup favourites before the 2017 season had even kicked off, yet they have thrived under such pressure. That is the sign of a team comfortable in their own superiority. Comfortable with the predictions being made of their, as many see it, inevitable success. Vanney must take credit for instilling this ethos, but 43-year-old has also made tactical changes to harness the quality of his team. Much has been made of Toronto’s switch to a 3-5-2 formation made towards the end of last season, with Vanney admitting Antonio Conte, the Chelsea manager, to be a source of inspiration in his implementation of the shape. Toronto are not the only ones in MLS to have flexed their tactical muscle this season, with the Columbus Crew also adopting 3-5-2 at times and the New York Red Bulls even playing in a 3-3-3-1 formation, but the Canadians look the most comfortable in their shape. It ekes the best from their undeniably talented group. “One of the reasons we went to 3-5-2 is because it enabled us to get our wing-backs higher up the field faster which then would pull the full-backs who were sitting on top of our two forwards and the centre-backs … it would force them to have to respect the width of the field because our wing-backs would take higher positions,” Vanney explained earlier in the week. “The goal of that was to bring pressure off Seba and Jozy to get numbers off of them so that they could have a little more space to work.” It’s a tactical shift that has ultimately seen Toronto win the Supporters’ Shield and two Canadian Championships, also making it to MLS Cup finals in back-to-back seasons, over the past 18 months. Now, Vanney is charged with delivering the club’s first championship triumph. They have been here before and that experience should serve them well, although the team they will face on Saturday shared the same experience 12 months ago, the only difference being that the Seattle Sounders won (5-4 on penalties after a dire goalless draw in regular time). But Toronto FC are better than they were last time. They have improved over the course of 2017, showing a willingness to progress and develop almost as soon as they’d suffered defeat in last year’s MLS Cup game. “To be completely honest, I think we can use a little bit of a more creative player,” Altidore reasoned after the 2016 loss to Seattle. “I think we’re a very good team. But if we have another piece that is creative, whether it be a winger or a creative player that can kind of, on his own, help us decide games as well, [that] would be great.” And so Vazquez was signed to be that creative figure, giving Toronto FC the extra dimension in the final third that Altidore spoke about. There is a clear-headedness to everything TFC have done in recent years, which is in stark contrast to the scattergun, scatterbrain approach of the past. That is illustrated by the strength of their 2017 campaign to date. Of course, it must culminate in victory against the Sounders this weekend for that strength to be ratified, but this is a club, and a team, that have made a serene art form of performing to expectations. On Saturday, they are expected to win, just as they have done all year. That’ll sit just fine with them."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2017/dec/08/ireland-leaders-deal-britain-edging-towards-soft-brexit","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-08T15:41:33Z","webTitle":"Ireland's leaders say deal shows Britain is edging towards soft Brexit","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/dec/08/ireland-leaders-deal-britain-edging-towards-soft-brexit","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/dec/08/ireland-leaders-deal-britain-edging-towards-soft-brexit","fields":{"headline":"Ireland's leaders say deal shows Britain is edging towards soft Brexit","bodyText":"The Irish border deal hammered out after objections from the Democratic Unionist party has inadvertently edged Britain towards a soft Brexit deal, political leaders in Ireland have said. Ireland’s prime minister, Leo Varadkar, said he was delighted with the deal because not only had it delivered an invisible border with Northern Ireland but the DUP clause had unexpectedly delivered a new promise of barrier-free trade between the whole of Ireland and the UK in the event of no deal. Varadkar pledged that May would have “no closer friend” in the next stage of negotiations on the back of the agreement on the Irish border. He said it was in Ireland’s interest to help Britain get a deep and ambitious deal because Ireland wanted to preserve the £50bn-a-year trade it does with the UK, its biggest export partner. He admitted Anglo-Irish relations had been damaged by the fractious negotiations over Brexit, but said that could quickly be repaired. “I’ll be very frank. Brexit, by its nature, has strained relations between Ireland and the UK. Of course it has. How could it not?” he said. “Our role now is to get through that. I actually think because of this agreement that we have today, because we have the guarantees and the assurances that we sought, Britain will have no closer friend than Ireland.” He confirmed that under the deal there would be no cameras, customs checks or patrols on the border, something he said everyone north and south of the border should appreciate as a major achievement in the Brexit negotiations. The 15-paragraph Irish deal also guarantees the Good Friday agreement will continue in all its parts, allows border communities to continue to access EU funding, and means anyone in Northern Ireland opting for Irish citizenship will continue to have rights as EU citizens. The leader of Ireland’s opposition, who is in a confidence-and-supply agreement with Varadkar’s Fine Gael government, went further. “From the British perspective, it seems to me we are edging towards a soft Brexit, something the Brexiteers may not want to hear, but there are certain realities dawning,” said Micheál Martin, leader of the Fianna Fáil party. The view in Dublin is that the DUP deal has inadvertently landed Britain on soft Brexit territory and closed off the cliff-edge scenario with WTO tariffs and barriers. Sources point to the addition of paragraph 50, which pledges “no new regulatory barriers develop between Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom” in the event of no deal. It has been added since Monday at the request of the British, not the Irish, to address the fears of the DUP leader, Arlene Foster, that Ireland was trying to separate Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK and force the region into a united Ireland. It is understood that not one word, full stop or comma was changed in paragraph 49, which the DUP had objected to on Monday. One informed Westminster source said Ireland had played a clever game and both May and Varadkar had played the DUP to their advantage. “The Irish government never wanted any east-west sea border, which would have been disastrous for its own economy, but has cleverly used the issue and the DUP to completely outmanoeuvre the UK government to get full alignment with the single market and customs union on the island of Ireland.” Foster welcomed the deal, saying it met her demand that there would be “no red line down the Irish Sea”. The Dublin view is that paragraph 50, combined with paragraph 49, delivers a better deal than the one it agreed to on Monday because it will force the UK to align its trading and standards rules with both Northern Ireland and Ireland, a member of the EU. Informed sources say the Dublin view is that the two paragraphs combined limit the possibility of the UK operating under WTO rules and instead apply a regime very close to the existing rules. They confirmed that Friday’s deal was a political commitment and not a guarantee, and could be reversed. However, once it is signed off by EU leaders next week, it will become the official framework for the guidelines for phase two talks. One source said EU27 support for Ireland’s position had been “rock solid” and the British had underestimated that unity. Ireland’s deputy prime minister, Simon Coveney, said the deal was a relief for everyone in the country”, while Fianna Fáil’s Martin said Northern Ireland now had an opportunity to lift itself from decades of economic poverty. “There is a sense now that Northern Ireland might get the best of both worlds … Northern Ireland hasn’t done that well historically. It could do with a break,” he said. Sammy Wilson, a DUP MP, claimed the Irish government’s desire for Northern Ireland to remain in the single market was “gone”. Sinn Féin’s leader in Northern Ireland, Michelle O’Neill, said she and her party would be talking later on Friday to Varadkar as well as Theresa May. O’Neill said Sinn Féin wanted to see “the protection of Ireland’s interests” in Brexit negotiations. The rival nationalist party in Northern Ireland, the SDLP, said the deal signalled there was a “soft Brexit” on the way."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"media/2017/dec/10/disney-20th-century-fox-sky-news-survive-rupert-james-murdoch-news-corp","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-10T07:00:29Z","webTitle":"If Disney buys Fox, could Sky News survive for long?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/dec/10/disney-20th-century-fox-sky-news-survive-rupert-james-murdoch-news-corp","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2017/dec/10/disney-20th-century-fox-sky-news-survive-rupert-james-murdoch-news-corp","fields":{"headline":"If Disney buys Fox, could Sky News survive for long?","bodyText":"The prospect of Disney swallowing 21st Century Fox (AKA Mickey Mouse swallowing Rupert Bear) is real.

Sky TV, including Sky News, would be Disney-controlled. No competition and mergers policy there (which may be why the Competition and Markets Authority has asked for yet more time to make up its mind). Perhaps no one will need to ponder further because the shadow of Murdoch is lifted. But perhaps, too, Disney won’t want to keep Sky News – and its losses – going anyway. A zero-sum game of some sadness. And watch News Corp, the separate and much less profitable part of the Murdoch empire.

It defines who we are and where separate nations fit into the story of one wider, shared world. Take away that narrative, as happens so often in repressive regimes, and a nation and its people start to lose their identity. Any regime that stifles a functioning press is not only depriving its citizens of the fresh air of news, it is denying the world the opportunity to understand that nation and risks natural curiosity being replaced with wariness and suspicion, which, in turn, can lead to hatred, even conflict. If a nation wants to be understood and accepted, to trade freely in knowledge and goods, to allow its people to prosper and learn, it has to accept a free flow of information. The truth is that so many nations plainly do not want the world to understand them, preferring, instead, to suppress news and jail journalists who tell uncomfortable truths. The explosion in access to global information is a modern marvel, but it can come at a terrible price for those who write and edit. According to the Committee to Protect Journalists, 34 have been killed so far this year, with 259 imprisoned last year and 55 missing. Last year, the CPJ reported that Turkey had at least 81 journalists behind bars. It said China, which was the world’s worst jailer of journalists in 2014 and 2015, dropped to second spot with 38 journalists in jail. Third place was allotted to Egypt, with 25 journalists imprisoned (although the Egyptian Press Syndicate recorded 29). Since I last visited Cairo nearly three years ago to write about the press, the increase in human rights abuses has been stark. There are an estimated 60,000 political prisoners in the country’s jails; dissenters are labelled as militants and tried in military courts; extrajudicial killings are on the rise; Human Rights Watch (whose website is banned in Egypt) claims torture has become routine in the country’s jails and probably amounts to a crime against humanity. Reliable sources say that journalists who dare to question the official regime narrative are harassed, arrested and, in some cases, tortured. Egyptians who do manage to articulate any opposition to the current government are labelled terrorists, as are any reporters who attempt to tell their stories. Against this backdrop, why then would I return to Egypt to talk about that most fragile of subjects – press freedom? As a readers’ editor, I am often asked to talk about media ethics, accountability and journalism. I have travelled to Russia, Bosnia, Kosovo, Turkey, Northern Cyprus, Hungary, Macedonia and Colombia – all nations with questionable records on press freedom – to take part in discussions and panels. I believe it is better to engage in dialogue and to attempt to offer ideas and support to journalists than to stay away, but it can also lay one open to accusations of collusion, as I discovered recently at what was billed as the World Youth Forum in Sharm el-Sheikh. Thousands of young people from all over the globe were to gather under a banner proclaiming “We Need To Talk”, but my single day at the conference revealed that this was more an exercise in presenting Egypt to the world than a truly global discussion. Despite arriving with some carefully chosen words about press freedom and the need for young people to defend it in their own countries, I found myself placed in a vapid general discussion on the Egyptian press. In an attempt to put things in a global context I presented a map of the world with press freedom rankings, produced by Reporters Sans Frontières. In a league of 180 nations, Egypt lies near the bottom at 161, but Egyptians won’t know this as the RSF website is banned there. I made the point that multiple pieces of legislation inhibit the media in most nations (notably the UK). Of course, none of this compares to the dangers facing journalists in countries such as Egypt, but because I did not make this abundantly clear (coupled with a clumsy attempt to talk about cultural difference in reporting, remarks I later withdrew), I have been attacked as a tool of the regime, coupled with demands to know how much I was paid to be there (answer: nothing). How quickly one’s good intentions can turn sour. At least here I can lay out the facts about Egypt and unequivocally condemn the treatment of journalists in that troubled land. Robert Mahoney, the deputy executive director of the CPJ, says a barrage of anti-press rhetoric from Donald Trump undermines the role of the press and potentially endangers journalists. Citing the terrible attack on the al-Rawdah mosque in Sinai, he said: “Labelling reporting you don’t like as ‘fake news’ sends a signal to authoritarian leaders globally that it’s OK to crack down on the press. It did not take the Egyptian foreign ministry long to seize on Trump’s attack on CNN International to try to draw attention away from the message to the messenger.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/dec/29/ole-fashioned-cocktail-recipe-palo-cortado-sherry-rye-whiskey-sack-bar-london","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-29T16:00:01Z","webTitle":"Cocktail of the week: the Olé Fashioned – recipe","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/dec/29/ole-fashioned-cocktail-recipe-palo-cortado-sherry-rye-whiskey-sack-bar-london","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/dec/29/ole-fashioned-cocktail-recipe-palo-cortado-sherry-rye-whiskey-sack-bar-london","fields":{"headline":"Cocktail of the week: the Olé Fashioned – recipe","bodyText":"In this remake of an old favourite, palo cortado sherry combines with rye to glorious effect.

I’ve watched her since her come-up, when she would always use crazy words in her bars – I remember having to search on Google for what they meant.” The 23-year-old Banks – who doesn’t use her first name Tyra for obvious reasons – is now having her own come-up three years after starting her music career. Born to a teenage Ugandan mother on Camberwell’s Brandon estate, Banks says growing up in such relatively poor surroundings “builds strong people. You learn how to make do; you learn how to be optimistic.” Her flow is now buttressed and vulcanised into an assertion of unshakeable womanhood. “When you live your best life, and you love yourself, it inspires people that you’re even trying,” she says. “Going as hard as the guys, or being forward with my sexuality, some people won’t get it. But for years ladies were taught to be proper, and to not speak on certain things, and I’m like: pssh! Even if I was to walk down the street naked, no one should trouble me. It’s my body, and I should be able to do what I want with it. I may like the way this dress hugs my body.” British female MCs like Lady Leshurr and Little Simz have struggled for wide success, but with Stefflon Don recently hitting the Top 10, maybe the deadlock is breaking. “Female MCs were seen as a novelty, deffo,” Banks says. “There are still people who’ll make comments: ‘Get back in the kitchen!’. But it is getting a bit easier – people want to hear what we have to say. Leshurr, Simz, their hard work has made it easier for us now.” And while she admires American MCs for “entwining melody into their raps”, she doesn’t feel like she has to sing choruses to succeed. “I feel like I could come through the game just rapping. That could be me just being optimistic!” In that respect she’s like another recent breakthrough female rapper, Cardi B, who Banks supported on a UK tour. “I learned a lot from her about being myself – she’s so transparent, and unapologetic.” Banks may be known for party-starting verses, but her forthcoming mixtape The Coldest Winter Ever turns far more reflective: “People struggling with mental health issues, seeing what’s happening in Libya, that’s what’s in my heart now.” As is the pain of a breakup earlier this year. “A lot of people see me for songs that hype up the crowd, that show I’m a boss,” she says. “This is me in a more vulnerable space. Because rap is such a bravado act, you can constantly get caught up in ego – it looks like stuff is always good for you, you’re always strong, you’re popping. But how about when you don’t feel like that? When you put your all into someone and they treat you like crap – how do you feel then?” So what has she learned about herself? “I’ve found I can endure more than I thought, and that a woman’s intuition is never wrong. And my worth – I know what I’m not going to accept.” The depth and breadth to her nimble bars means 2018 should be her most successful year yet. “My mum was also talented – she could sing and dance, and she sacrificed that for me,” she says. “I just pray I can be half the woman she is, and give back to her. That will happen.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"culture/2017/dec/08/late-night-hosts-on-republicans-sexual-harassment-should-be-non-partisan","type":"article","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-08T16:40:10Z","webTitle":"Late-night hosts on Republicans: 'Sexual harassment should be non-partisan'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2017/dec/08/late-night-hosts-on-republicans-sexual-harassment-should-be-non-partisan","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/2017/dec/08/late-night-hosts-on-republicans-sexual-harassment-should-be-non-partisan","fields":{"headline":"Late-night hosts on Republicans: 'Sexual harassment should be non-partisan'","bodyText":"Late-night hosts discussed the Republican hypocrisy around sexual harassment allegations and the investigation into Donald Trump Jr’s meetings with Russian officials. On The Late Show, Stephen Colbert focused on a report that the president’s son had to discuss what happened for eight hours – “the first time a Trump has put in a full day of work”. The report also listed other members of the Trump campaign who attended the same Russian meeting in question. “It was a real who’s who of who wants an orange jumpsuit,” he joked. He then dissected some of the emails that act as damning evidence of impropriety, relating back to issues that were discussed in the meeting, such as the DNC hack. “Ya dummies,” he said. “That’s like forwarding an article about arson saying: ‘This is eerily weird, given that warehouse we torched five days ago.’” After Trump Jr finished his testimony, he shared an Instagram post with a picture of a Trump helicopter and the caption: Time to roll. “Coincidentally ‘time to roll’ is also what Michael Flynn said right before he cut that deal with Robert Mueller,” Colbert joked. He also added: “It is literally one of the few vehicles that doesn’t roll.” On The Daily Show, Trevor Noah covered a variety of subjects, including a push to make concealed-carry permits valid across state lines. “Republicans in Washington are working on very important new ways to help people get shot,” he said. The decision could mean that New Yorkers would be able to carry guns. “This is not the wild west,” he said. Noah also joked that it “would severely hamper our ability to be assholes”. He then moved on to the wildfires in California and the much-shared footage of a man leaving his car and risking his life to save a rabbit in danger. “If that guy’s not using that as his Tinder profile, he’s not serious about life because I don’t know about you but I would swipe right on his bunny-loving ass so hard,” he said. Finally, he discussed Atlanta news anchor Sharon Reed whose response to a racist email went viral. “Black people are officially done playing,” Noah said. “The revolution will be televised!” He added: “I love this woman, she’s my hero. This was the greatest clap back I have ever seen. I hope she does all the news like this now.” On Late Night with Seth Meyers, the host spoke about Al Franken, who resigned this week after allegations of sexual harassment. After the first accusation emerged, Franken was asked if he thought more would follow and simply said: “I certainly hope not.” “That’s not an answer that inspires much confidence,” Meyers added. While Republicans have come out hard against Franken, they are still refusing to condemn other suspected predators in their own party, from Roy Moore to Trump himself. “Sexual harassment should be a non-partisan issue,” Meyers said. Kellyanne Conway in particular has been vocal about her feelings on Franken. “You work for a guy who’s been accused by more than 12 women of sexual harassment and assault,” Meyers said. “Kellyanne Conway has such little self-awareness that when she walks past a mirror, she thinks there’s a stranger in her house.” Finally, he also discussed Donald Trump Jr and his eight-hour testimony. “That means for eight hours, Eric was unsupervised!” he joked. Meyers added: “The Trump campaign got more emails about Russia than I get from Pottery Barn.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"books/2017/dec/08/oh-my-god-what-a-complete-aisling-irish-bridget-jones-series-lands-six-figure-deal","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-08T16:30:05Z","webTitle":"Six-figure deal for 'Irish Bridget Jones' series","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/dec/08/oh-my-god-what-a-complete-aisling-irish-bridget-jones-series-lands-six-figure-deal","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2017/dec/08/oh-my-god-what-a-complete-aisling-irish-bridget-jones-series-lands-six-figure-deal","fields":{"headline":"Six-figure deal for 'Irish Bridget Jones' series","bodyText":"Two friends whose novel about a “complete Aisling” is being hailed as the Irish answer to Bridget Jones have landed a six-figure two-book deal. Emer McLysaght and Sarah Breen started sharing “Aisling-isms” with their friends in 2008, while they were sharing a flat in Dublin. But when the two journalists set up a Facebook page to swap stories of a country girl who has never dyed her hair or lost her phone, who walks to work as fast as she can to get her steps in, they gradually found an audience beyond their immediate circle. Today, the Oh My God, What a Complete Aisling Facebook group has almost 50,000 members. This substantial following was enough for the Irish publisher Gill Books to see if the pair might turn it into a book. That novel, which was published in September and sees Aisling move to Dublin when her boyfriend, John, fails to propose yet again, has sold more than 30,000 copies in Ireland. A six-figure deal with Gill for Irish rights to two additional books continuing Aisling’s story was announced on 7 December. A film deal is also under negotiation. According to the publisher, Aisling “lives at home in Ballygobbard (or Ballygobackwards, as some gas tickets call it) with her parents and commutes to her good job at PensionsPlus in Dublin”. She and her best friend “love hoofing into the Coors Lights if they’re ‘Out’, or the vodka and Diet Cokes if they’re ‘Out Out’”, and she’s desperate for a ring on her finger. “She wants the hen with the willy straws. She wants out of her parents’ house, although she’d miss Mammy turning on the electric blanket like clockwork and Daddy taking her car ‘out for a spin’ and bringing it back full of petrol.” Oh My God, What a Complete Aisling has drawn praise from Marian Keyes: “There aren’t enough words for how much I love it. It’s feckin’ HILAIRE and very touching.” Irish book chain Eason called it “an Irish Bridget Jones” and “the hottest debut of 2017 … It’s incredible to see a break-out Irish hit like this doing battle for the No 1 spot week after week with perennial favourites like Lee Child, Marian Keyes and Ross O’Carroll Kelly.” This unexpected bestseller has taken the authors by surprise, with McLysaght admitting that when they started writing the novel they “Googled things like how to write a successful book”. “We didn’t even cash our advance cheque until we handed in the manuscript,” said Breen. “We thought they’d find out that we were imposters. Then we didn’t fill out the bank form as we didn’t think we’d ever get any royalties.” According to the book’s editor, Conor Nagle, the novel’s success “lies in the fact that there’s a bit of Aisling in all of us, as well as in the authors’ skilful ability to capture a certain slice of Irish life with humour and a light touch”. Aisling, said Breen, is based on a particular kind of Irish woman. “I’m probably about 55% Aisling. We definitely have a lot of Aisling in us or we wouldn’t be able to write her.” McLysaght added: “As we get older we get more like her – she’s the type of girl people say is turning into her mother. I’d say I’m about 60% Aisling.” According to the Curtis Brown literary agent Sheila Crowley, who negotiated the Gill deal: “There’s incredible energy in their writing. It’s that feelgood Irish thing, which travels well around Europe.” The authors are hoping that readers outside the Emerald Isle will relish character names such as Sadhbh that are “wall-to-wall consonants” and the novel’s Irish brogue. “We’re hoping people will get it,” said Breen. “The book is very Irish,” agreed McLysaght, “that’s what people like about it. But the themes are universal.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/dec/09/four-takeaways-republican-tax-bill","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-09T15:09:55Z","webTitle":"The Republican tax bill: four takeaways | Corey Robin","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/09/four-takeaways-republican-tax-bill","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/09/four-takeaways-republican-tax-bill","fields":{"headline":"The Republican tax bill: four takeaways","bodyText":"Taxes are the “thunder of world history,” wrote Joseph Schumpeter. “The spirit of a people … is written in its fiscal history.” Last Saturday, Republicans in the US Senate joined their comrades in the House to write a new chapter in America’s fiscal history. Or did they? 1. This bill is a Republican dream come true Critics of the tax cuts – on the left and the right – see it as a break with the conservative past, a sign that today’s Republican party has been captured by mad dogs and rubes. But look at these names all signing a group letter in favor of the Republican tax cuts: Robert Barro, Michael Boskin, Douglas Holtz-Eakin, Glenn Hubbard, Lawrence Lindsey, George Schultz, and others. It’s a who’s who of the Nixon, Reagan, Bush and Bush administrations – larded and laced with Harvard, Princeton, Columbia, and Stanford. One of the Republicans’ most notorious cuts – reducing or eliminating inheritance taxes on the rich – elicited this defense from Republican senator Charles Grassley of Iowa: I think not having the estate tax recognizes the people that are investing, as opposed to those that are just spending every darn penny they have, whether it’s on booze or women or movies. It sounds crude, just the sort of impolitic thing today’s rabid Republican – as opposed to yesterday’s genteel conservative – would say. Till you remember that it was libertarian guru Ludwig von Mises (that “von” was there for a reason) who told Ayn Rand, inspiration to Paul Ryan and other conservatives: You have the courage to tell the masses what no politician told them: you are inferior and all the improvements in your conditions which you simply take for granted you owe to the effort of men who are better than you. 2. Powerful lobbies weren’t able to stop it If there’s a silver lining in the Republican victory on taxes, it’s this: this is a bill that passed over and against the opposition of some powerful lobbies. As Matt Yglesias writes, the working assumption of the healthcare bill Barack Obama and the Democrats passed in 2010 was that you couldn’t get legislation through Congress without the buy-in of major lobbies. Maybe that’s no longer the case? 3. It puts deficit hawks in a tough spot For the last 40 years, Republicans – and their Democratic enablers – have managed to stop government spending by screaming debt, deficit, and debt. But as David Dayen points out, the tax bill may have taken that weapon away from them. The bill combines $6tn in tax cuts, mostly to the rich, and $4.5tn in tax increases. Hence, the overall cut of $1.5tn. The cuts are deeply unpopular. When the left starts pushing for good things like single-payer or free college, it’ll have a great argument for how to pay for them: undo most of the Republican tax cuts. Conversely, some of the Republican tax increases – reducing deductions on home mortgages, for example – are good. Most of those deductions go to the upper middle class. For a long time, they were considered politically untouchable. But the Republicans have shown they’re not. And there’s no reason to undo them. That’s more revenue for social spending. 4. It poses a risk – and an opportunity – for Democrats As incoherent as the Republican party is, when it comes to taxes, they’re a party, willing to use their smaller grip on power (relative to Obama and the Democrats in 2010) to pursue their maximalist plans. I’m not convinced it’s not going to blow up in their face. Even so, there may be a lesson here for how a party can get things done. A big risk for the left is if it responds to these cuts by screaming about the debt. If Democrats do that, we’re finished. If the left says, instead, reverse the cuts, keep some of the increases, and use that money for health care, free college, public transportation, and jobs, we’ve got a new politics, one that breaks with the austerity that Democrats from Carter to Obama have peddled. The Republicans are already pivoting from tax cuts to the debt, claiming that the next task is to rein in spending. The task of the left is to say: not so fast. The Republicans have shown us the money is there. It should be spent, not on the debt but on pressing social needs.

The interjection by British Chambers of Commerce comes before a meeting of Bank of England’s rate-setting committee this week. The BCC have told ministers they now need to finalise a transitional deal to smooth the Brexit process before firms will increase spending on staff and production capacity, despite the breakthrough last week that moved talks with the rest of the EU on to trade. The lobby group said tepid investment levels, weak wage growth and high inflation would lead Threadneedle Street to keep interest rates on hold until the final months of 2019, far later than most expectations. The BCC downgraded its growth outlook for this year from 1.6% to 1.5%, while forecasting a slowdown to 1.1% from 1.2% in 2018. The Bank’s monetary policy committee is meeting for the first time since raising the cost of borrowing in November – the first rise in interest rates in a decade. The MPC is expected to keep rates on hold at 0.5% on Thursday, although economists will be looking for any clues for when the next rise will come at a time of slowing economic growth. Adam Marshall, BCC director general, said: “Despite last week’s deal, Brexit uncertainty still lingers over business communities, and is undermining many firms’ investment decisions and confidence. “Despite pockets of resilience and success, and strong results for some UK firms, the bigger picture is one of slow economic growth amid uncertain trading conditions.” Business investment in technology and in training for employees is key for driving up economic output as well as productivity, which has been sluggish since the financial crisis – a major cause of low rates of wage growth for UK workers. The government has launched an industrial strategy as well as more funding for skills and research at the budget last month in response. The MPC decision, due at midday on Thursday, will follow fresh inflation, jobs and wages figures on Tuesday and Wednesday, which are expected to confirm that the squeeze on British households’ spending power is yet to dissipate. The weak pound since the Brexit vote last year is still pushing up the cost of imported goods, while wages are failing to grow above the rate of inflation, despite the lowest levels of unemployment since the mid-1970s. The consumer price index measure of inflation stood at 3% in October, confounding an expectation for prices to rise further. City economists reckon the CPI will hold steady in November when the figures are released on Tuesday, helping the Bank’s governor, Mark Carney, to avoid writing a letter to the chancellor – which he must do when CPI is more than a percentage point above or below Threadneedle Street’s 2% target. Analysts at Goldman Sachs say progress in the Brexit talks last week is unlikely to encourage the Bank to move any faster towards higher interest rates, given that the MPC’s economic outlook assumes a transitional period. The investment bank reckons there will be three rate rises by mid-2020, with the next one towards the end of next year. Some economists expect the MPC will next vote for a rate increase as early as May, while others see the next rise coming later in the year. The Bank has a balancing act to strike between keeping inflation in check to protect consumers from the rising cost of living, and also providing enough stimulus to encourage economic growth. The central bank’s actions will come in a week when the European Central Bank is also expected to keep interest rates on hold for the eurozone and the Federal Reserve is expected to raise the cost of borrowing as the economy of the US powers ahead at twice the pace of the UK’s. The Fed rate is expected to raise from 1.25% to 1.5%, while the ECB is expected to keep its main rate at 0%. The Fed meeting will be a landmark one – it is the final appearance for Janet Yellen as chair before she hands over to Jerome Powell, who was picked by Donald Trump to replace her."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"media/2017/dec/10/i-all-credit-far-seeing-owners-johnston-press","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-10T07:00:29Z","webTitle":"All credit to the owners of the far-seeing i","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/dec/10/i-all-credit-far-seeing-owners-johnston-press","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2017/dec/10/i-all-credit-far-seeing-owners-johnston-press","fields":{"headline":"All credit to the owners of the far-seeing i","bodyText":"Contrition corner: when the i newspaper shoved its weekday cover price up to 60p (and to 80p on Saturdays) in August, I wondered how long Johnston Press could go on milking a product founded on being cheap, cheap, cheap (and independent).

There were so many questions. Would Lionel Messi win the award for a sixth time, pulling two ahead of Him? Would Him win it a fifth time, drawing level with Messi? Would any well known German journalist and BT Sport pundit currently hawking a book about Jürgen Klopp be foolish enough to venture his thoughts on the outcome on social media disgrace Twitter, in the process prompting the kind of mouth-foaming-fan-boy outrage that makes the kind of reaction with which Donald Trump’s pig-ignorant-late-night musings seem like tumbleweed blowing through an abandoned Western frontier town?

It also helped that Him was part of the Real Madrid side who beat Barcelona to La Liga title. Currently rumoured in Spanish media to be the main topic of conversation on a Real Madrid WhatsApp group that Him isn’t part of, Him was happy to thank those team-mates who reportedly think he is too selfish and obsessed with individual awards for their contribution to his latest individual award. “Last year we had an amazing season in [Big Cup] and La Liga,” Him purred. “I have to thank my team-mates, Real Madrid and the rest of the people who helped me to be in great shape throughout the season.” And yet: “I don’t see anyone better than me,” Him said modestly in an interview with France Football, who presented him with the bauble. “No player does things that I cannot do myself, but I see things others can’t do. There’s no more complete player than me. I’m the best player in history – in the good and the bad moments.” Neymar, for anyone who is interested, came third.

He had been persuaded to attend by his then-wife, Sara, and his friend and fellow musician David Crosby, but the ceremony so rattled him that he referred to it subsequently in a scathing song called Day of the Locusts. It included the line, “sure was glad to get out of there alive”. What annoyed Dylan most was the introductory speech in which he was referred to as “the disturbed and concerned conscience of young America”. Over three decades later, as the following passage from his 2004 memoir, Chronicles Volume One, illustrates, that description still rankled. “Oh sweet Jesus! It was like a jolt. I shuddered and trembled but remained expressionless. The disturbed conscience of young America. There it was again. I couldn’t believe it! The speaker could have said many things, he could have emphasised a few things about my music.” Early on in Why Dylan Matters, Richard F Thomas, a classics professor at Harvard, recalls the Princeton incident before setting out to emphasise a few new things about Dylan’s music, as if to make amends for the careless words that so offended his subject. Academics have picked over Dylan’s songs in the past, most notably the Cambridge don Christopher Ricks, who made heavy work of the myriad allusions therein in his grandly titled Dylan’s Visions of Sin. In the wake of the Nobel prize in literature controversy, Thomas’s timely book goes further by attempting, though not always convincingly, to recast Dylan as an heir to Virgil and Homer. “He is part of that classical stream,” asserts Thomas, “whose spring starts out in Greece and Rome and flows on down though the years...” This may be so, but in affixing Dylan’s songwriting to that Graeco-Roman tradition, Thomas is forced to constantly negotiate a line between the scholarly and the tenuous. We learn, for instance, that the young Robert Zimmerman liked Hollywood-produced cod-Roman epics as a boy and was briefly a member of his school’s Latin club. How much this proves a deep and abiding affinity with the classics is debatable. Likewise, the number of times that Dylan has included Rome on his touring schedule is hardly evidence of the same given that Dylan tours the world’s capitals constantly. Thomas also cites the relatively minor Dylan song When I Paint My Masterpiece as further evidence of Dylan’s love for, and identification with, Rome. One can only wonder what the singer’s poetic predecessors would have made of lines as throwaway as the opening verse: “Oh, the streets of Rome are filled with rubble/ Ancient footprints are everywhere/ You can almost think that you’re seein’ double/ On a cold, dark night on the Spanish Stairs...” Ovid it ain’t. Thomas is more persuasive when he looks at Dylan’s work in light of the other many influences the singer draws on, which range from 19th-century symbolist poetry to early American folk and blues by way of Woody Guthrie, Hank Williams, Chuck Berry, the Beat poets and the Bible. Dylan is nothing if not wide-ranging in his inspirations. The book is oddly structured, the autobiographical fandom of the first chapter and a recollection of an academic symposium he attended in Dylan’s home town of Hibbing, Minnesota, soon giving way to a series of intermittently illuminating reflections on various subjects: selected albums, the memoir, the Nobel prize literary canonisation, as well as the accusations of plagiarism that have periodically dogged Dylan. One of the most revealing sections concerns Dylan’s creative “stealing” from Ovid for his Modern Times album. “It eventually emerged,” writes Thomas, “that more than 30 lines of Ovid’s exile poems had been reappropriated and become an essential part of the fabric of the songs...” Thomas is surprisingly forgiving of such widespread borrowing, describing it as transformative and praising Dylan for bringing these “long-dead souls” back to life and “in effect bringing them into the modern times”. For all that, there is a definite suggestion of intellectual snobbery in Thomas’s choice of title: Why Dylan Matters. It is echoed, too, in his fellow classical scholar, Mary Beard’s assertion on the book cover: “At last an expert classicist gets to grips with Bob Dylan.” Both suggest, unconsciously or otherwise, that Dylan’s songwriting only really matters if he can be shoehorned into the Homeric tradition and that academic canonisation is the ultimate vindication of Dylan’s worth. It isn’t. Nor, even, is the award of the Nobel prize in literature. What is worth remembering here is that Dylan is a singer-songwriter who uses classical poetry in much the same way that he uses old blues and folk songs: as raw material for songs that only occasionally stand up to the kind of scholarly scrutiny that complex poems can withstand. Revealingly, there is little here about how Dylan delivers his songs, the emotional thrust of that imperfect, now faltering, voice and his often wilfully perverse delivery. One could argue that the majority of Dylan’s songs evade academic interpretation, that they come to life when performed rather than as texts on the page. In this context, Why Dylan Matters misses the point, but there are nevertheless enough glimpses of illumination to make this a must for the converted. The rest of us can enjoy the songs without carrying the burden of how to measure or fully explain them, buoyed by Dylan’s own admission in his Nobel prize acceptance speech: “Not once have I ever had the time to ask myself: ‘Are my songs literature?’” • Why Dylan Matters by Richard F Thomas is published by William Collins (£12.99).

The plea by Inquest for victims’ families and their lawyers to be able participate more fully comes before a two-day hearing of the inquiry, which starts in central London on Monday. Adopting procedures from the long-running Hillsborough inquiry – in particular, helping prepare and listening to emotional “pen portraits” of all of those who died – would broaden public confidence in the investigation, it is claimed. Inquest – which supports relatives at coroners’ court and inquiries – and many of the families are also asking for more advisory panel members to be appointed, reflecting the diverse, cultural and religious make-up of the surrounding west London community. An online petition calling on the prime minister to appoint more panel members and allow lawyers for the bereaved to “see all evidence from the start [and be] allowed to question witnesses at the hearings” is aiming to collect 100,000 signatures. Adel Chaoui, who lost family members in the fire on 14 June, said: “Bereaved families are desperate that the deaths of our loved ones are learnt from, and a tragedy like this, that should have been avoided after the Lakanal House fire [in south London in 2009], never happens again. “Previously the Stephen Lawrence inquiry benefited from a diverse and representative panel, and the full involvement of legal representatives. It’s not enough after the 71 deaths that we cannot have either. “Our representatives need to be able to phrase how our questions are delivered. They need to be able to react to the answers. They need to be able to prod and press for the truth. “We fear the prime minister’s current position does not go far enough to assure us that we’ll have access to a balanced and unbiased inquiry. Or indeed that we will have a fair, impartial and honest chance of justice. We urge her to reconsider and put our minds to rest over the matter.” Many of the families have warned Theresa May that they may not participate in the public inquiry into the blaze unless the judge leading it makes the process more inclusive and allows them more direct involvement. Earlier this month, 50 bereaved families and a large number of survivors issued a joint statement for the first time since the tragedy, calling on the prime minister to “take urgent action to restore our faith” in the inquiry. They asked for the inquiry not to be led by the retired judge Sir Martin Moore-Bick alone but that he be assisted by an expanded panel made up of people with a “real understanding of the issues facing those affected”. Inquest is also calling for a “safe and private space” to support relatives at the hearing as well as providing mental health support. It has called on the inquiry to uphold the human rights of those affected by recognising its obligation under article 2 of the European convention on human rights, which guarantees the right to life. Deborah Coles, the director of Inquest, said: “Grenfell is a shocking injustice and the need for the inquiry to get to the truth is of value to us all. It can only do this if the individual voices of the bereaved and survivors are not lost and silenced. Recognising the bereaved as victims, placing them at the heart of the inquiry, is essential to help humanise the legal process. “To assuage the profound anger and mistrust requires meaningful engagement of those affected, along with prompt, full and proper disclosure and a panel representative of the community. This can help instil confidence and encourage participation. Without this the inquiry will be flawed and will fail those seeking the truth and justice they deserve.” On Monday and Tuesday those granted core participant status, survivors, bereaved families and their lawyers, will be allowed to sit in the main hearing room in Holborn, central London. Those unable to travel will be able to watch a live-stream of the event at the Notting Hill Methodist church near Grenfell Tower. A spokesperson for the inquiry said it was “committed to ensuring that those most directly affected by the fire are able to participate in its work and that their voices are heard. “One of the main purposes of the procedural hearing next week is to discuss with those acting for the bereaved, the survivors and other local residents how those aims can best be achieved and the effectiveness of the inquiry ensured. “A large number of individuals and organisations have been granted core participant status and the inquiry also continues to run weekly drop-in sessions in north Kensington for anyone wanting to raise any questions directly with the inquiry team.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/dec/15/my-life-has-become-a-battle-with-my-husband-my-mother-and-my-daughter","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-15T14:59:36Z","webTitle":"My life has become a battle with my husband, my mother and my daughter","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/dec/15/my-life-has-become-a-battle-with-my-husband-my-mother-and-my-daughter","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/dec/15/my-life-has-become-a-battle-with-my-husband-my-mother-and-my-daughter","fields":{"headline":"My life has become a battle with my husband, my mother and my daughter","bodyText":"I am in my 50s and married with two teenage daughters. On the surface, I am seen as looking good for my age, being gregarious, “nice”. But I am fighting an increasingly horrible battle on three fronts. First: my husband, whom I should have left years ago. He is (was?) good-looking and charming, but hides a binge-drinking problem, coupled with occasional drug use. He had an affair until I found out; he tries to improve but I don’t believe he feels happily married and I have enabled his behaviour by forgiving him. I can’t face being intimate with him and we rarely go out. His increasingly rightwing views are another major sticking point. Second: my mother. We lived at opposite ends of the country. After my dad died two years ago, my mother fell apart and was reliant on me for the emotional and practical – I was dealing with up to 20 phone calls a day and went to see her every couple of weeks. I thought I would have a breakdown and had to give up my job. She finally agreed to a care home near me, but now maligns me to anyone who will listen and threatens to kill herself. I have a brother, but he isn’t interested. My mother has always been manipulative. We constantly moved between continents as children, which was disruptive and involved many schools and house moves. I was bullied, depressed and anorexic. My parents argued constantly and always had money worries – they left Africa (and us) owing money, and my brother and I had to sort ourselves out in our late teens/early 20s. Third: my daughter. She is more interested in partying and going out and her final year of school isn’t going that well. Despite my insistence on boundaries regarding coming home and keeping in touch, she doesn’t bother and often comes in late and I worry myself sick. She seems to lack empathy and I worry that she has her father’s traits of a lack of responsibility and respect. She lives like a pig – her room is disgusting, but I now refuse to help and let her get on with it. Any advice on how to start chipping away at this monster? I pondered on your longer letter for several weeks: I can see how tough things are, and you were very brave to write in. The common denominator in this – in your adult life – is you. I am not blaming you, but I think it is important to recognise that you play a part, as that gives you the power and control to change some things. I talked to Carol Leader, who is a psychoanalytical psychotherapist (bpc.org.uk). She wonders if this feeling of “being overwhelmed, is new or whether you have felt like this for most of your life”. She also says your parents “sound like children. They weren’t thinking of you and your brother [growing up], they don’t sound like mature parents.” And she feels this is the key to a lot of your issues. You had a tough upbringing, your parents left you in your late teens to deal with a mess of their making, and perhaps this anger has never been allowed to come out and the child in you is still angry and now raging against everything else in front of you. This doesn’t mean your husband, daughter and mother are not responsible for their behaviour – they are, and some of it is pretty shitty. But given that you have written to me, we can only look at you and what you can change. Leader feels that your PS to me (omitted here) is “really telling. It was much more empathetic in the way you spoke about your daughter when you’d had time to reflect”, and she wonders “would what you said in the second email be something you’d tell your daughter? Do you express that love enough to her?” Leader also feels that if you, your husband and daughter all sat down, “it would be interesting to hear everyone’s stories”. We bet they would have very different takes on things. When people are wounded in childhood, if it is not resolved, they can become stuck in old patterns and spend the rest of their lives trying to be listened to and sympathised with. Leader feels you are still “that young person doing too much and struggling. It is clear you’re overwhelmed.” How to move forward? You need someone to talk to, so try your GP or the bpc (link above) to get counselling. Family therapy for all four of you would be fantastic, but if that is not possible, then get support for yourself. I think this is one of those situations where you need to be listened to, heard, and your position understood. Until then, it is very hard to approach the idea that others in your family may be experiencing the situation from their own, very different points of view that also need to be understood. Only then can you decide if your philandering, drunken, drug-abusing, bigoted husband is someone you want to stick with. Your mother failed you substantially and I think the least you can have to do with her at this point the better. My biggest concern is your children – especially your elder child, who seems to have become a repository for many of your negative feelings. Having an angry mother, whatever the reasons behind it, is difficult for children. You owe it to them to get help so you can be the sort of mother you were in that second email to me – reflective and loving.

Last Friday a deal was struck that may well allow talks between the British government and the EU to progress to a second stage. But still there are widely diverging views about what should happen in the future. Today I publish the terms of withdrawal from the EU (referendum) bill, which aims to provide a referendum on the negotiated EU exit package to give voters the final say on Brexit. I, and the majority of my constituents in Swansea West, voted remain in the 2016 referendum. My view immediately after the result was that Brexit was a horrific mistake, that what Brexit promised would not be delivered, and that remains my view today. In the week following the referendum, I tabled a bill calling for a referendum to give people the final say on the exit package, with an option to continue our EU membership if voters believed their reasonable expectations for Brexit hadn’t been realised. But it’s only recently that this idea has gained traction. Last week a poll by Survation – which correctly predicted the 2017 election results – found that more than half of voters support a referendum on the EU exit package, and recently the Labour front bench also appeared not to rule out a referendum. Meanwhile, the author of article 50 has confirmed that it is not too late to reverse the process, if the government is willing. A referendum on the exit package could pull us out of the fire. John Maynard Keynes said: “When the facts change, I change my mind. What do you do?” British voters are reasonable and pragmatic, and I believe they can be trusted to look at the facts and make a reasonable assessment. It’s time to look again at the facts. This week the Brexit secretary, David Davis, admitted to parliament’s Brexit select committee that the government has not produced a single economic impact report on Brexit – despite demands from businesses across the country who are desperate to know their fate. Voters I speak to on the doorstep are increasingly realising they have been conned. “This isn’t what I voted for,” many tell me. The promises of Brexiteers such as Nigel Farage and Boris Johnson have turned out to be nothing but barefaced lies. The £350m per week promised to the NHS, and the pledge of single market access are only the tip of the iceberg. We now know that the divorce package alone is likely to cost the UK government up to £50bn. This is before the other economic costs are taken into account, including rising inflation due to a weak pound, tariffs on trade, and job losses resulting from investment moving elsewhere. In the past month firms ranging from technology manufacturers to investment banks have signalled their intention to move out of the UK; the European Banking Authority is off to Paris, the European Medicines Agency to Amsterdam – and Brexit has not even happened yet. On the political side, Theresa May’s party is in complete disarray, disagreeing on more or less every single issue related to Brexit. Both the PM’s party and my own cannot agree on what they want Brexit to look like – and many MPs (if not most) don’t want to leave at all. The only way to resolve this, for the sake of all our futures – including those of Jeremy Corbyn and Theresa May – is to put the decision back into the hands of the people. They should have the last word on whether the deal on the table resembles the promises they voted for, and whether the emerging costs and uncertainties make it better to maintain the status quo of staying in the EU. This week’s debacle – and eventual concession – over a hard border in Ireland highlighted how fragile May’s position is: she is subject to the last-minute whims of the DUP, and unable to command a majority in parliament. Mercifully, we have scraped through to the second phase of negotiations on trade, but the worst is yet to come, and the clock is ticking: the package has to be agreed not only by London and Brussels, but also 27 EU member states. “The show is now in London,” said the European commission last week – Brussels has made its stance clear, but the government can’t seem to decide what it wants. Undeniably, the facts have changed since June 2016: only a fool would say otherwise. My bill offers a blueprint for a way out of this mess: by giving people the final say, the government would allow the British people to choose between its negotiated arrangement and the option of reversing article 50 and remaining in the EU. This honours the will of the people. But it also honours the economic and political reality that is increasingly catching up with our leaders in Westminster. • Geraint Davies is the Labour MP for Swansea West"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"music/2017/dec/08/nicholas-milner-gulland-obituary","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-08T14:40:11Z","webTitle":"Nicholas Milner-Gulland obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/dec/08/nicholas-milner-gulland-obituary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2017/dec/08/nicholas-milner-gulland-obituary","fields":{"headline":"Nicholas Milner-Gulland obituary","bodyText":"My brother Nicholas Milner-Gulland, who has died aged 77, made a considerable mark in educational, and particularly musical, life in Sussex. Son of Hal Milner-Gulland, headmaster of the prep school Cumnor House, and his wife, Nancy (nee Bavin), Nick was born in Surrey. He was academically promising, winning a scholarship to Westminster school and a place at Cambridge University. But he also took to music: I can still remember the first bars of a thumping piano sonata he was composing before he was eight. From being a pianist, he became skilled at the harpsichord, French horn and organ. He published his orchestration of selections from Michael Praetorius. Advised (perhaps oddly) at Cambridge to stick with classics rather than music, he went into teaching, doing a diploma at Bristol and short stints at Marlborough college and in the US before returning to Cumnor House, near Danehill, East Sussex, to assist, and subsequently take over from, his father; the school built up a fine reputation, particularly in the production of Shakespeare’s plays, and of course music. He met and married his wife, Anna, there; they had three children, Kate, Jamie and Toby. But in the week of his 60th birthday Nick was diagnosed with myeloma (blood cancer). This condition was successfully treated at the Royal Marsden hospital; but despite the wish of the trust that owned the school that he should return, he took retirement, settling in Lewes. There began a new and very active stage in his life. From teaching in a private school he plunged into educational activity at Lewes prison. More recently he spent much time sorting the vast handwritten archive of his distinguished neighbour, the historian Asa Briggs. But musical activity at all levels consumed him more and more: playing, conducting orchestras and choirs, arranging concerts in south-west France (where, a convivial host, he always took summer holidays). He was particularly involved with the Fletching Singers and New Sussex Opera, for which his experience of producing plays was helpful. Less than a week before the sudden onset of his final illness, he excitedly emailed me listing his many coming musical commitments, from village carol services to what was to be a great culminating performance of Bach’s St Matthew Passion in March. He will be hugely missed not just by family, ex-pupils and many friends, but by a great circle of music-makers. He is survived by Anna, and their children and grandchildren."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"society/2017/dec/31/youth-workers-warn-of-rise-in-drugs-purchases-through-social-media","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-31T16:17:23Z","webTitle":"Youth workers warn of rise in drugs purchases through social media","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/dec/31/youth-workers-warn-of-rise-in-drugs-purchases-through-social-media","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2017/dec/31/youth-workers-warn-of-rise-in-drugs-purchases-through-social-media","fields":{"headline":"Youth workers warn of rise in drugs purchases through social media","bodyText":"Growing numbers of teenagers are buying illegal drugs on social media sites such as Instagram and Snapchat, experts have said. Youth workers have raised concern about the trend, which they say has accelerated in the last year and a half. One said he had spoken to children as young as 13 who had bought drugs through such sites. “In the last 18 months we have gone from this way of getting drugs not being mentioned at all among the young people we work with to now nearly every young person talking about it. It is disturbing,” said Nick Hickmott, the early intervention lead for Young Addaction, the youth arm of the largest drug and alcohol charity. Social media sellers use hashtags and emojis to indicate what they stock, and share images of the substances. They provide alternative contact details, and most deals then take place on other platforms such as the encrypted messenger application Wickr. Hickmott said: “We work with 10- to 24-year-olds but most of the work we do is with 13- to 17-year-olds. They are the ones talking about this and the reason we are seeing this rise is because of the growth of social media. Young people are just becoming more dependent on these platforms now as they are heavily integrated into all aspects of their life and so they are being used for more risk-taking behaviour.” He said Instagram and Snapchat tended to be the platforms most used. One of his biggest concerns was teenagers buying drugs from strangers on these platforms. “Essentially, if a dealer knows you, they are far less likely to want to see you ripped off or end up in hospital … If you are buying drugs on Instagram, for example, you are getting them from a stranger and the deals might involve meeting up in person.” The youth worker said knowledge of dealers spread by word of mouth. “The majority of drugs on sale at the moment are cannabis but you can get any street substance through these sites. Particularly prevalent currently are party drugs like MDMA and ecstasy but we’re also seeing benzodiazepines such as Xanax being sold. What we’re concerned about is that there are clearly no age restrictions for dealers and a lot of young people use these sites,” he said. Fiona Spargo-Mabbs, who founded the Daniel Spargo-Mabbs Foundation, a drugs education charity, after her son died from taking a lethal dose of MDMA, said the phenomenon would continue to grow “because it is such an easy way to reach lots of young people”. She said: “It is a great gift for the supply chain and it is adult suppliers using the resources of young people and exploiting their savvy-ness in social media. It is particularly worrying because drugs are around young people in a way now that they were not maybe 10 years ago. Having them on social media like that makes them so much more available, and delivery to the door means you don’t need to be in a dark street corner or hang around with a drug dealer to buy them.” Harry Sumnall, a professor in substance use at the Public Health Institute, said more research into the trend was needed. “The fact it is a growing trend doesn’t surprise me at all because e-commerce generally has developed substantially over the years and the first e-commerce transaction was actually a bag of marijuana,” he said. “It would be easy to say that social media platforms need to do more policing here to get these profiles shut down but I think there are so many sellers that it is impossible to do this. A better solution is making sure young people are educated about the risks of taking drugs and buying them online. The general advice about staying safe while on the web is relevant here,” he said. Hickmott agreed there should be more discussions about online sellers in schools but emphasised the duty of social media sites to close down as many sellers as possible. Ian Hamilton, a lecturer in mental health at York University, said: “I would be in favour of social media networks taking the problem more seriously. They recently announced that they were putting a lot of resource cracking down on child exploitation online, which is good, but we need to make sure that there are also efforts to eliminate drug sales.” Instagram said it encouraged people to report any content that could violate its guidelines. A spokesperson said: “The Instagram community must follow the law and the sale of illegal or prescription drugs, even if legal in a specific region, is not allowed. We encourage anyone who comes across content like this to report it via our in-built reporting tools. Our global review team checks these reports 24/7, and as soon as we are made aware of violating content we work quickly to remove it.” Snapchat said it took its responsibility to create a safe and secure experience seriously. It said it had an active trust and safety team that responded to reports and concerns within 24 hours. “There is no place for selling drugs on Snapchat. We encourage anyone who sees something like this anywhere to always report it,” a spokesperson said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/the-running-blog/2017/dec/15/jogging-in-jordan-the-650km-trail-thats-a-journey-through-time","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-15T15:08:30Z","webTitle":"Jogging in Jordan: the 650km trail that's a journey through time","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/the-running-blog/2017/dec/15/jogging-in-jordan-the-650km-trail-thats-a-journey-through-time","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/the-running-blog/2017/dec/15/jogging-in-jordan-the-650km-trail-thats-a-journey-through-time","fields":{"headline":"Jogging in Jordan: the 650km trail that's a journey through time","bodyText":"Running and travelling can be the perfect partners – whether that’s an early morning exploratory jog on a business trip or a dedicated holiday built around a multi-stage race. New routes, scenery and challenges can help enliven one’s love of running, while seeing the world on foot offers an enhanced perspective. For me, the steps up to the Mtatsminda plateau outside Tbilisi and the colonial racecourse in Mumbai at sunset stand out as all-time favourites; the chaotic streets of Lagos were equally memorable, but for different reasons. To avoid disappointment, I now fly everywhere with a pair of trainers in my hand luggage. But at the start of November I, alongside Jordanian runner Mohammad Al-Sweity, took the combination of running or travelling a step (well, a few actually) further by jogging the Jordan Trail, a new 650km (400-mile) route stretching the entire length of the country. Here are five reasons why the experience might appeal to everyone from weekend walkers to elite ultra-runners… 1 It’s one long sightseeing tour To say that the Jordan Trail passes some interesting places would be an absurd understatement. The trail is steeped in history, traversing some of the oldest continually used paths in the world; this is, after all, part of the fertile crescent where civilisation first developed. Starting amid the spectacular Roman ruins of Gadara at Um Qais, with the Golan Heights and the Sea of Galilee in the background, the trail weaves it way south. Along the way it passes the crusader castles of Ajloun and Karak, the biblical site of Mount Nebo, the stunning city of Petra and the protected deserts of Wadi Rum. As well as these headline attractions are countless more understated sites of interest. At Beit Edis, I tripped over some stones in a field and discovered I had stumbled upon the site of a Byzantine church, complete with exposed mosaic floors. In terms of historical routes, the Jordan Trail would be hard to beat. 2 You can eat your body weight in delicious food According to Strava, I was burning 6,000-8,000 calories each day. That’s a lot of hummus. Fortunately, I had the privilege of being supported by the Jordan Trail Association. Several times a day, a pickup truck would intercept me (where feasible) to provide sustenance and encouragement (along with repeated offers of cigarettes). In the evenings, I would enjoy what can only be described as high-end glamping – a far cry from the self-supported attempt that I had originally envisaged. Jordanian food is ideal running fuel. Any cuisine that includes fudge for breakfast (halaweh) will always win my affection. Along with fresh bread, eggs, hummus, cheese, olives and honey, it provided the ideal start to the day. On the trail, I subsisted on occasional Tribe bars and frequent cups of sweet black tea. In the evenings, I munched my way through mountains of rice, chicken and salads, followed by gooey honey and nuts. 3 Not racing can be an absolute pleasure Perhaps it reflects my narrow-minded competitiveness but the novelty of running without racing was a revelation. Much of my running in exotic places has been in races and, no matter how much I tell myself otherwise, I always end up striving. On the Jordan Trail it was quite different. We had a target destination each day, but whether it took six hours or eight hours was irrelevant. This left plenty of time to marvel at the scenery, stop for tea with passing Bedouin shepherds or simply misread my GPS and end up on an inadvertent detour. At times I chose to increase the tempo – on the shaded trail of Zubia forest or on the hard sands of Wadi Rum – and occasionally a guard dog tasked with protecting the livestock from wolves and hyenas would show too much interest, so I would switch to an impromptu fartlek session. But, in general, I simply listened to my body and ran or walked or rested accordingly. Whereas at the end of stage races participants often look like they have just been released from a gulag, I felt far better at the end of the Jordan Trail than at the beginning – the effect no doubt of fresh air, exercise, plenty of sleep and good food (and perhaps the absence of alcohol). 4 You will be rediscovering a timeless tradition Until the 20th century, long journeys on foot would have been a necessity for many (and still are for some today). Whether walking to Mecca or Rome on a pilgrimage, undertaking voluntary or involuntary migration, or simply conducting trade, our ancestors regularly embarked on weeks or months of walking. Today, most of our lives consist of sedentary stagnation interspersed with occasional, almost instantaneous relocations. While this might be very convenient, it discontents us from the real meaning of distances and the gradual transitions of scenery, people and culture. It also deprives us of an opportune time for reflection. Our historic relationship with journeys by foot perhaps help to explain the increasing popularity of through-hiking; alongside, of course, the emergence of the middle-aged gap year. From the Appalachian Trail to Offa’s Dyke to el Camino de Santiago de Compostela, increasing numbers of people are choosing to go for long walks. And for the time-poor, energy-rich, through-running offers a convenient alternative. 5 It finishes with a swim in the Red Sea I arrived in the town of Aqaba, torn between satisfaction that I had survived intact (the same could not be said for my shoes) and disappointment that I had run out of trail. However, plunging into the clear water of the Red Sea provided the ideal end to the expedition. The Jordan Trail Association provides detailed information and guidelines on the route, including GPS files. Anyone accustomed to regular exercise would probably be able to complete the trail in 25-30 days and, for those inclined to run, 10-20 days is feasible. Popular sections for shorter walks include Um Qais to Ajloun and Petra to Wadi Rum.

Postmodernism bounces back Just as the general public has (almost) learned to love brutalism, the next aesthetic challenge raises its pink-plastered, marbleised MDF head. That’s right, those tacky stage-set monuments of postmodernism, with their bolted-on classical references, are under threat of demolition, so they’re now being listed by Historic England. There’s much more to the movement than surface-level jokes and cartoonish facades, as two brilliant books on the period of architectural power-dressing attest: Postmodern Buildings in Britain by Elain Harwood and Geraint Franklin and Revisiting Postmodernism by Terry Farrell and Adam Nathaniel Furman. 9. Plywood at the V&amp;A, London It might not sound like the most thrilling subject for an exhibition, but this show revealed just what an interesting history the humble laminated timber sheet has had, from being used to make pharaohs’ coffins to forming the fuselages of one of the fastest, highest-flying planes of the second world war. One surprising invention was an 1867 plan for a pneumatic railway, to be hung off the sides of buildings in a great big plywood tube, which bore a startling resemblance to Elon Musk’s Hyperloop. 8. Tate St Ives by Jamie Fobert Twelve years and £20m after the Tate first launched its plans to expand its Cornish seaside outpost, Jamie Fobert’s exquisite new gallery space opened in September, scaled back from original plans and mostly hidden below ground. Deftly chiselled into the bedrock, the huge 600 sq m space captures the magic of St Ives’ famous light – although, from the outside, the project bears awkward scars of its battles with the neighbours. 7. Pablo Bronstein at the RIBA, London Continuing the RIBA’s impressive run of exhibitions under curator Marie Bak Mortensen, mischievous artist Pablo Bronstein tested the taste tolerance of gallery-goers with a provocative show on the most ubiquitous of British styles. The “pseudo-Georgian” is used to tart up everything from Waitrose stores to cheap semis with stick-on pediments and fake sash windows, as he revealed in his charmingly naff pen and ink drawings, hung on “Christine Hamilton style” yellow striped wallpaper. 6. The return of council housing Forty years after Margaret Thatcher took away their powers to do so, many local authorities are finally building their own housing again – and commissioning good architects to do it. Years in the making, some of the first council-led housing schemes were completed this year, from Peter Barber’s Worland Gardens in Stratford, with its playful arched openings, to Karakusevic Carson and Maccreanor Lavington’s pitch-roofed terraces at Dujardin Mews in Enfield. Thousands more homes are on the way as council building programmes pick up momentum. 5. Imagine Moscow at the Design Museum, London One of the standout highlights of the many events this year marking the 100th anniversary of the Russian revolution, this exhibition provided an eye-opening snapshot of the heady visions of the Soviet era’s most radical architects – which never actually saw the light of day. From El Lissitzky’s cantilevered “cloud iron” skyscrapers, to Nikolai Sokolov’s “health factory” workers’ holiday retreat, these revolutionary fantasies were brought to life with vast wall-size drawings and scale models. 4. The Leaway riverside path If you look at a map, it might seem obvious that it should be possible to walk all the way along the Lea River that snakes through east London to meet the Thames, but it hasn’t been – until now. After years of negotiations, 5th Studio’s Leaway riverside path finally opened in spring, stitching together crucial missing links with ramps, bridges and new sections of towpath with a rugged, as-found quality that makes them feel like they’ve always been there. A model of useful green infrastructure – unlike the Garden Bridge, which was finally cancelled this year. 3. Big Capital by Anna Minton Taking a sledgehammer to London’s iniquitous property development machine and cracking it open for all to see in lurid and detestable detail, Anna Minton’s timely slim volume is a must-read primer for anyone interested in understanding why Britain’s capital is a place of such rampant inequality. She speaks to the victims of estate regeneration, unpicks the planning loopholes that allow developers to dodge their obligations, and offers some pointers as to how we might start to fix the mess. 2. The Japanese House at the Barbican, London From charred timber cabins to diaphanous light-filled lanterns that feel lighter than air, this beautiful exhibition revealed the modern Japanese house to be a site of unparalleled architectural invention. Brimming with models and full-size recreations to clamber inside, it showed how the private house in Japan is a thing of personal expression, with the country’s high turnover of experimental new-build homes being due to a combination of hefty inheritance tax and frequent earthquakes. 1. St Clement’s, East London Community Land Trust A decade in the making, London’s first community land trust (CLT) housing project opened this year, as part of a redevelopment of a former Victorian workhouse in Mile End. The simple brick apartment blocks might not be architecturally groundbreaking, but the model of tenure certainly is: the house prices will be linked to local income in perpetuity, taking the homes out of the speculative property market and making them affordable to local people forever. It’s a radical model that is fast gaining steam: there are now 225 CLT groups across the country with 4,500 homes in the pipeline."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/dec/17/palatino-better-than-most-of-the-places-in-rome-restaurant-review","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-17T06:00:23Z","webTitle":"Palatino: ‘Better than in Rome’ – restaurant review","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/dec/17/palatino-better-than-most-of-the-places-in-rome-restaurant-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/dec/17/palatino-better-than-most-of-the-places-in-rome-restaurant-review","fields":{"headline":"Palatino: ‘Better than in Rome’ – restaurant review","bodyText":"Palatino, 71 Central Street, London EC1V 8AB (020 3481 5300). Meal for two, including drinks and service: £60 to £90 The late AA Gill was once so infuriated by the quality of the food he was served at a London Italian that he left the restaurant, hailed a cab to Heathrow, jumped on a plane and a few hours later was eating the real thing in Rome. It was a beautiful journalistic stunt, and a tribute to many things, including Gill’s shamelessness, but mostly to the financial resources he enjoyed at his newspaper. If I tried something like that at Palatino, chef Stevie Parle’s Roman-themed venture near London’s Old Street, expenses would get me no more than a Boris bike to an Italian caff in Highbury. Except I don’t want to leave. Ever. I am very happy here in my lunchtime booth, as deep winter daylight falls, the lovely things keep arriving at my table and a fug of contentment settles. If I wanted to infuriate the partially travelled, I could now wonder aloud whether London’s restaurants do a better job of the regional food of Europe than the regions do themselves. I could, for example, suggest that Palatino is a far better Roman restaurant than most of the restaurants in Rome. That would drive people really nuts, wouldn’t it? So let’s give it a go: I enjoyed my trip to Rome a couple of years back. I found a fabulous place near where the abattoirs once stood, specialising in offal. They had an uncompromising way with the darker, danker organs. As for the rest, they had identikit menus, executed with a lethargic hand, and served by bored-looking chaps in white jackets who glanced at their watches come 9pm. They seemed to know that, when it came to food in Rome, choice was limited to same menu, different place. So you might as well stay here. Palatino is an altogether perkier affair, as is London. Restaurateurs here know you always have a real choice; that they have to work damn hard to bring you in and keep you there. It occupies the front area of one of those shared working spaces with which this part of London is infested. There’s a café area with an events “arena” where, from time to time, I’m sure people are tortured with dreadful PowerPoints even the presenters don’t understand. The ceiling is all exposed ducting. And yet, for all that, Palatino, with its tall windows, open kitchen and banquettes upholstered in leather the colour of English mustard, retains its own identity. Parle started as an exceedingly young man cooking a restless menu at the Dock Kitchen over in Ladbroke Grove. The success of the food there depends upon how deep into the culture he has gone. It’s clear he knows and loves the Roman repertoire, and wants to give it the love it deserves. From the list of antipasti, we have sage leaves and pieces of brilliant orange squash sliced gossamer-thin, then deep-fried in a frilly overcoat of the lightest batter, alongside a dipping bowl of honey-sweetened vinegar. It’s £4.50 of focus and sigh and, “Well this is a good start isn’t it?” As is their cacio e pepe, that excruciatingly simple dish of tonnarelli (square-cut spaghetti) with a creamy sauce of black pepper and pecorino, whipped up using just a little of the starchy pasta water. It is one of those dishes that seemed to appear out of nowhere 18 months ago in London and was suddenly everywhere, but with good reason. It is soothing, but with a grown-up mule-like kick from the cracked black pepper and salty sour cheese. The version here is a defence against winter days and despondency. Rigatoni with veal pajata – the intestines tied off and long braised; remember, if you kill it, you eat all of it – comes in an insistent tomato and chilli sauce. The offal is deep and soft without being overly funky. The sauce stops it all becoming cloying. It is an intense expression of that Roman interest in the bits of animals others overlook. Another starter of clams with chickpeas comes in a broth butched up with ’nduja, the fiery Calabrian salami. It’s a great vehicle for chickpeas and an even better one for clams. We could have moved straight from there to dessert, but we are doing things properly, as are they. The great Roman dish of saltimbocca – literally “leap into the mouth” – is precisely as it should be, the veal beaten out then laid with sage leaves and wrapped in prosciutto, before being sautéed off in a sweet marsala-based sauce. If you haven’t tried it before, try it here. A fillet of bream, its skin burnished to bronze, is seasoned with salted anchovies, rosemary and lemon, and comes with bitter salad leaves and roasted fennel. On the side we have their new potatoes, first boiled, then crushed a little until bursting out of their skins, then fried to golden crisp with garlic. Two days later I will make these at home. I know I will keep making them. Dessert involves both a cheat and a piece of cleverness. The cheat is their rum baba. Making individual babas is tricky and time-consuming. Usually some have to be discarded. So they make a sizeable loaf of brioche and serve a thick, rum syrup-sodden slice of it, with cooling mascarpone and roasted quince. It looks nothing like a rum baba should. Texturally it eats exactly right, the dry-looking slice releasing its ballast of sweet syrup as you bite in. The beautiful green pistachio and saffron cake, £1 from which goes to the charity CookforSyria, is the clever bit. It’s a two-stage affair. Half the moderately dry mix, loosened with egg yolks, goes into the tin, followed by the rest, with the whipped egg whites folded in. The result is a soft, moist, almost souffléd cake on top, with its own crisper base. Starters are £7 or £8 with mains in the mid-teens, but there’s also an early-evening set menu offering three courses for £19. Plus, there’s the all-Italian wine list on which everything from the £22 a bottle Catarratto, to the £500 a magnum of 1996 Sassicaia, Tenuta San Guido, is available by the glass. Admittedly the latter is £50, but it makes trying these things much more possible. So now old Rome hands will tell me about brilliant places I missed. They’ll tell me that they are half the price. And I’ll tell them they’re also an air fare away. I think I’ll stick with Palatino. Jay’s news bites Palatino feels like a companion piece to Radici, Francesco Mazzei’s relaunch of the old Almeida site in London’s Islington. It’s an airy, casual trattoria with a cheerfully priced menu of pastas and wood-fired pizzas, alongside various small plates.

The Women’s Social and Political Union, an organisation that campaigned for woman’s suffrage in the UK, was founded in the parlour of Emmeline Pankhurst’s home in Chorlton-on-Medlock, south Manchester, in 1903. The building currently houses a three-room museum – including the parlour – along with the charity Manchester Women’s Aid, which supports victims of domestic abuse. The museum is staffed by volunteers and receives no public funding, instead relying on donations. It opens to visitors between 10am and 4pm on Thursdays and for three hours every other Sunday. The Representation of the People Act, which gave the vote to all men over 21 and women over 30 who met certain property qualifications, was passed into law in February 1918. As the centenary approaches, calls have been made to fund the Pankhurst Centre to make it a “major and significant museum” that tells the story of women’s suffrage and the subsequent women’s rights movement. The writer and activist Helen Pankhurst, great-granddaughter of Emmeline Pankhurst, said the building held symbolic significance. “This is the real building where a historical event happened that defined this pivotal change in our ideas of citizenship,” she said. “Yet there is no other public funding for it. Is this again the perpetuation of women’s interests not being valued, not being given real power and visibility? I think the answer to that is a resounding yes.” Gail Heath, the director of the Pankhurst Trust, said that while the Museum of London and the People’s History Museum both had displays dedicated to the suffragettes, the country should have a properly funded museum dedicated to the subject. “The more the suffragette story is talked about the better, because it is inspirational,” she said. “A little group of women got together in that parlour downstairs. Emmeline was a single parent at the time, she had a part-time job, and they started a revolutionary movement. It’s a story that needs to be told.” The organisation had a bid for funding from the Heritage Lottery Fund rejected last year, but is in the process of submitting another. Heath said it would take about £3.5m to transform the centre into an “enhanced museum attraction” with space for school groups to learn about the suffragettes. The building is owned by Central Manchester University Hospitals NHS foundation trust, which in 1979 applied for permission to demolish it. Following a campaign by the Victorian Society and other local groups, the authority agreed to lease the house to the Pankhurst Trust indefinitely in return for a symbolic payment of one suffragette sash every year. It was finally opened to the public by Barbara Castle and Helen Pankhurst in 1987. The Pankhurst Centre merged with Manchester Women’s Aid in 2014, providing a mutually beneficial arrangement in which the museum was given more financial security and the charity had a space to run from. The building functions as a women’s centre, and has a food bank in its basement. “One of the defining things about the Pankhurst Centre is that we are not just a museum,” said Heath. “We are still active in the struggle.” Last year the museum – with its photographs and assorted suffragette memorabilia – welcomed 2,700 visitors from across the world. “People come here because it is almost an act of pilgrimage, and even though our exhibit is a little bit tired and old and needs investment, they all feel the power of being in that room,” said Heath. The Pankhurst Centre has been unable to accept donations of key artefacts in the suffragette story because they cannot afford the insurance to look after them. Though it is a Grade II listed building, the Pankhurst Centre is hemmed in on all sides by new wings of the St Mary’s hospital, making expansion more complicated. “We use every available space,” said Heath. “We will be digging out part of the cellar, because it’s full of rubble. We’re going to extend out there with a subterranean room to expand it. We are going to put corridors along the back, so you don’t have to cross space.” Pankhurst and Heath agree that there have been signs that the centenary might bring the change of fortunes that the museum needs. Earlier this month the Pankhurst Trust received £144,594 from the government’s Centenary Cities fund to run two separate educational projects inspired by the Representation of the People Act. A few days later it was announced that the government would help to fund a statue of Emmeline Pankhurst in the city of her birth, the first of a woman to be erected in Manchester since a Queen Victoria statue was unveiled in 1901. “This is 100 years late, but still a very important and appreciated recognition by the establishment,” said Pankhurst. “I think that in terms of the attitude of society in general, there’s a realisation now that you can’t assume that things are going to continue to get better in terms of women’s rights,” she said. “The last couple of years in particular have taught us that we have got to fight to hold on to the gains that we have made.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"politics/2017/dec/11/british-citizens-in-the-eu-tell-us-how-the-brexit-process-is-affecting-you","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-11T11:50:08Z","webTitle":"British citizens in the EU: tell us how the Brexit process is affecting you","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/dec/11/british-citizens-in-the-eu-tell-us-how-the-brexit-process-is-affecting-you","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/dec/11/british-citizens-in-the-eu-tell-us-how-the-brexit-process-is-affecting-you","fields":{"headline":"British citizens in the EU: tell us how the Brexit process is affecting you","bodyText":"The focus of much of the Brexit debate in recent days has shifted between impact assessments, plans for the Irish border and the future of EU citizens rights.

Taking in two loops of the grounds, it was flat but on trail (and grass in places). And lord it was freezing - I couldn’t feel my feet during my attempt to warm up and taking off the layers before the start was a painful process. But of course once underway, conditions were fine - lovely bright blue skies and soft trail underfoot and I was pleased to finish second and win a rather lovely trophy. Then Sunday. Ugh, Sunday. Yes, snow in London is all very unusual and exciting but I could have done without it coming at me horizontally on my long run. Melting slushy snow and sleet soon soaked my feet, and my gloves got wetter and wetter until by the last couple of miles I could feel neither feet nor hands. It took hours, hot baths and gallons of tea to warm up afterwards. So my conclusion from the weekend is cold = fine. But cold + wet = not fun at all. So, over to you.

The Brexit secretary said his use of words on Sunday was meant to convey that the deal was stronger than merely being legally enforceable. But in trying to calm down the issue on Monday, Davis risked fresh disagreement with the chancellor by saying Philip Hammond “mis-spoke” when he said the UK would have to pay a financial settlement to the EU even without a formal deal. Davis prompted concern in Dublin and Brussels on Sunday when he appeared to suggest the initial deal was not legally binding. His comments followed those of Michael Gove, another leading Brexiter in the cabinet, who said voters could amend an EU withdrawal bill at the next election if they chose. Joe McHugh, the Irish government’s chief whip, told the country’s RTÉ broadcaster on Sunday that Davis’s suggestion sounded bizarre. “This, as far as we’re concerned, is a binding agreement, an agreement in principle.” Davis told LBC radio on Monday that his comments had been misunderstood. He said he had meant that the UK would avoid a hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland even if a final deal did not happen. “I said this was a statement of intent, which was much more than just legally enforceable,” he said. “Of course it’s legally enforceable under the withdrawal agreement, but even if that didn’t happen for some reason, if something went wrong, we would still be seeking to provide a frictionless, invisible border with Ireland.“I was making the point it was much more than what’s just in the treaty, it’s what we want to do anyway.” On the financial settlement, now estimated at up to £39bn – Davis said an initial suggestion had been nearer £100bn – he disputed Hammond’s suggestion that this was payable even without a deal. Hammond told the Treasury select committee he found it “inconceivable that we as a nation would be walking away from an obligation that we recognised as an obligation”. “That is not a credible scenario. That is not the kind of country we are. Frankly, it would not make us a credible partner for future international agreements.” Asked if he agreed with the chancellor’s comments, Davis said: “I’m afraid the chancellor slightly mis-spoke.“It says at the beginning of the thing, nothing is agreed until everything is agreed. It’s a classic European Union thing – they put it in every treaty. They put it there, not us.” Asked how Hammond could get something so fundamental wrong, Davis said: “You’ll have to ask him. I don’t know what the context of the question was, I really don’t.” Earlier on Monday, the Northern Ireland secretary, James Brokenshire, said Friday’s border deal was not legally binding but was a “solid commitment” by the UK to resolve the conundrum caused by Brexit. He told RTÉ’s Morning Ireland that the same paragraph also stated that the “joint commitments set out below in this joint report shall be reflected in the withdrawal agreement in full detail” and this was a “firm commitment that we want to pursue”. “I think this has given us a really solid way in which we can now approach the second phase of negotiations, with confidence,” he said. “I am sure that is a positive message that the PM will be giving in parliament today as she provides her update.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/shortcuts/2017/dec/11/missed-bitcoin-boom-five-more-baffling-cryptocurrencies-to-blow-your-savings-on","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-11T15:25:33Z","webTitle":"Missed the bitcoin boom?

Five more baffling cryptocurrencies to blow your savings on","bodyText":"If you are worried you’ve missed out on making millions by betting on bitcoin, don’t worry: there will be plenty more bizarre, borderline-incomprehensible digital bubbles in the future, and their value is only going to go up (until it all comes crashing down, that is). Here are five assets each competing to be the next bitcoin. Ethereum If there is a reason beyond market exuberance for the latest boom in bitcoin’s price – $16,900 (£12,600) as I write this, though who knows what it will be when you read it – then it is Ethereum. It is hard to buy Ethereum directly, so most investors trade currency for bitcoin, then bitcoin for Ethereum, meaning a spike in interest in the latter helped revive the former. Ethereum, which was launched in 2015, allows users to build “decentralised applications”, spending tokens called “ether” to buy processing power on computers run by other members of the network. Those applications can offer anything from file storage to financial services or simple games, all in a way that is impossible for any centralised authority to shut them down. CryptoKitties One of the oddest Ethereum projects in operation, CryptoKitties is a three-way cross between Tamagotchis, Beanie Babies and animal husbandry. Users can buy, sell and breed the eponymous cats, with traits inherited down the generations. The CryptoKitties network is responsible for 11% of all traffic on Ethereum, according to one report. A new “gen0” cat is born every 15 minutes, which the company auctions off, and it also takes a cut of all other CryptoKittie sales. The typical cat sells for about $4 these days, but a few of the rarer cats – particularly those descended from some of the oldest bloodlines – are worth many times that. The most expensive CryptoKitty sold to date, Founder Cat #18, went for more than $110,000 on Thursday. Monero If lovable algorithmic cats are too cutesy for you, Monero harks back to the dark origins of the cryptocurrency craze. This alternative to bitcoin lets users make the same sort of digital transactions as its older sibling, but with vastly greater privacy protections. While bitcoin transactions are permanently recorded, and visible to everyone (if hard to connect to a real person), Monero goes to great lengths to obscure what is actually going on: you can’t ever prove the sender, recipient and value of a transaction at the same time. The currency is also altered to make it easier to generate new coins using the sorts of processors in computers and phones, rather than requiring specialised “mining rigs”. This makes it very popular for services ranging from drug dealing online to monetising malware by taking over the processors of victims. LydianCoin Perhaps you want to plough your money into something backed by an authority you trust. In that case, let me introduce you to LydianCoin, the “first AI big data marketing cloud for blockchain”. If the buzzword bingo doesn’t get you pulling out your e-wallet, maybe the celebrity backer will: in September, Paris Hilton said she is backing the currency. Want someone else? Boxer Floyd Mayweather posted his support of Stox.com’s ICO (a “Bancor-based open-source prediction market platform that is built on Ethereum”, to quote industry news site Coin Telegraph), as well as Hubii Network (a content marketplace). He even dubbed himself “Floyd Crypto Mayweather”. Or you could follow Jamie Foxx (Cobinhood, a “zero trading fee cryptocurrency exchange”) or Wu-Tang Clan member Ghostface Killah (Cream Capital, a blockchain-based ATM network). PlexCoin PlexCoin, an innovative attempt to build “the next decentralised worldwide cryptocurrency”, has already raised $15m from backers, so you’d better move fast to – ah, hang on. No. The founder has just been sent to jail for two months for, among other things, falsehoods on the company’s fundraising documents, as well as taking investor money and using it to fund home improvements. A statement by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) said the company “hits all of the characteristics of a full-fledged cyber scam”. Oh well. At least PlexCoin is now a steal on the open market: just 2¢ a coin, down from 12¢ before the SEC filed charges.

The through-the-night talks, the pre-dawn dash to Brussels, the packed press conference, and those long-awaited words: “Sufficient progress.” Britain last week won EU approval to move to the next phase of Brexit talks. After the ignominious collapse of discussions earlier in the week when the DUP was not shown a draft of the text and raised fears of Northern Ireland being “decoupled” from the rest of the UK, the relief was palpable as negotiations on transition and future trade were cleared to get under way, probably in February. But no sooner was the 15-page agreement released – it should be rubberstamped at a summit later this week – than the fudges it contained were pounced upon. Theresa May won the effusive praise of even her most pro-Brexit ministers, but the EU was more circumspect. One official said: The UK has not been particularly specific. It has been setting out a number of red lines, but what it has been saying so far still entails a number of internal contradictions and does not seem entirely realistic. Chief among those is the Irish border. As the EU has noted, it is hard to see how Britain can keep its regulations in alignment with the EU’s so as to avoid a hard border across Ireland, while simultaneously leaving the single market and customs union and preserving the integrity of the UK. The question crystallises EU concerns about the next stage of the talks. London’s hopes for future deregulation to gain competitive advantages while still enjoying frictionless trade with Europe are seen as evidence that Britain still intends to have its cake and eat it after Brexit. The chancellor, Philip Hammond, confirmed those suspicions last week when he said the cabinet had not yet had a specific discussion about the final Brexit outcome it wanted. The EU will want more clarity from May on the government’s vision of a free trade agreement before it will engage in substantive talks. With several other finer points of the agreement – on citizens’ rights and the size of the financial settlement – also glossed over and kicked into the next round of talks, the European council president, Donald Tusk, was not alone in warning that the second phase would be harder than the first. Reporting back to MPs on the deal, May said it was “good news” for both remain and leave voters, adding that there was a “new sense of optimism” in the talks. She did add, however – in what appears to have become the new Brexit catchphrase – that “nothing is agreed until everything is agreed”. The view from Europe The EU’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, said the next phase would be significantly more difficult, mainly because “not everyone has yet well understood that there are points that are non-negotiable for the EU”. European governments and business leaders generally welcomed the breakthrough but warned that the most difficult negotiations lay ahead. There was “still much work for negotiators to do”, a German government spokesman said. German businesses said they must know soon “what model Britain proposes”. France’s foreign minister, Jean-Yves Le Drian, said the divorce talks had “progressively reached a positive outcome”, but the conditions of Britain’s departure were still not “clearly defined”. Negotiators have until October 2018 to strike an outline agreement on trade and transition, which will pave the way for a fully fledged trade deal and foreign policy and security treaties to be negotiated after the UK leaves the EU in March 2019. Meanwhile, back in Westminster With the dust still settling from Friday’s last-minute Brexit deal, it’s perhaps still a bit early for May’s more fervently pro-Brexit MPs to be flexing their muscles. Just don’t take their relative silence so far for acquiescence – it’s more of lull before the fighting starts again. After the humiliation of the sudden collapse of the deal on Monday, there was every incentive for all Conservatives to talk up the eventual compromise. But amid speculation the language of the deal points towards a softer form of Brexit, harmony will surely not reign for ever. While May will be wary of the views of her band of backbench Brexit ultras, it will be the ones in her cabinet that will be of more concern, notably Boris Johnson and Michael Gove. So far, Gove’s intervention has been the more notable: the environment secretary said that if UK voters don’t like the deal as made, the government would be able to amend it. This might be news to Brussels. Labour, meanwhile, have been sticking to their tactic of what might be called managed ambiguity on Brexit. Speaking on Monday, John McDonnell insisted his view that the UK could not stay in the single market after departure was consistent with the views of the shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer. “What I said was, remaining in the single market would not respect the referendum result. But we’ve been using the phraseology ‘a single market’, not ‘the single market’ and ‘a customs union’ and not ‘the customs union’.” Everyone clear on that? You should also know: Sector-by-sector Brexit impact forecasts do not exist, says David Davis. Ireland’s leaders say deal shows Britain is edging towards soft Brexit. Labour MPs hope EU deal is signal for soft Brexit approach. Talks through the night, a pre-dawn flight: how the deal was done. Michael Gove: voters can change EU deal if they don’t like it. Theresa May faces first Brexit bill defeat, say Commons rebels. Labour backs “easy movement” of EU workers after Brexit, says Keir Starmer. Global powers lobby to stop special Brexit free trade deal for UK. Chances of no-deal Brexit have “dropped dramatically”, says David Davis.

City of London will lose 10,500 jobs on day one of Brexit, says EY. Theresa May forced to accept new Brexit scrutiny committee. Read these In the Guardian, Matthew d’Ancona argues that talks in Brussels are inching forward on ambiguities and vague promises, but those hoping that Theresa May is carving out real change may be sorely disappointed: Now, more than ever, I think last year’s referendum outcome was an emotional event rather than a forensic verdict. Only 28% of leave voters now think the UK will secure a good deal, yet there is no comparable switch towards remain, no surge of buyer’s remorse. It is as if the voters are saying: good or bad, we want out. Brexit has become (and perhaps always was) an identity-marker, not a progress-determinant. It is not primarily perceived as a means of increasing GDP per head, empowering trade deals or liberating the legal system. It is a banner that you brandish as a means of expressing embattled identity and cultural grievance. It enshrines visceral allegiance – the currency of populism. The true shame of the leavers is that they inflamed the worst impulses of the electorate while maintaining a smile of respectable innocence. They raised expectations that cannot be met. Which raises the real problem: what happens when those expectations are not matched and the New Jerusalem of the 2016 campaign is revealed as the con it always was? In Prospect magazine, Jonathan Lis argues that the EU27’s verdict of “sufficient progress” on the Irish border question marked the day hard Brexit died: Thanks to this agreement, the UK has committed for the first time to deliver a set of absolute outcomes, from which policies necessarily follow. Until now, the government had made its key objective the fulfilment of arbitrary policies, for purely ideological purposes and without any regard for the consequences whatsoever. Thus, the UK resolved to leave the single market to satisfy false anti-immigration dogma, and to depart the customs union to dust off our commercial gunboats and re-enact long-suppressed fantasies of global trade dominance. Neither policy had anything to do with the real British economy or real people’s lives, and everything to do with our profound national memory and anxiety. But today that changed. The government can stuff the consequences no more. From today, the consequences instead stuff the government. If it wants to leave the single market to end free movement of people, or the customs union for the privilege of signing UK-only trade deals, that produces a hard border –and defies today’s agreement. After eighteen long months, the government will for the first time have to privilege pragmatism over ideology ... From today, Britain is heading for soft Brexit or no Brexit.

During an interview in Beijing, from where Rodman had hoped to fly to Pyongyang for his sixth trip there, the former NBA star said US officials had discouraged him from doing so amid continuing tensions between the countries. “Basically they said it’s not a good time right now,” he said. A state department ban on US passport holders visiting North Korea came into force on 1 September after the death of Otto Warmbier, an American student who was detained in Pyongyang for more than a year. On 29 November, North Korea celebrated its latest intercontinental ballistic missile test, claiming it could now strike anywhere on the US mainland. However, Rodman, who first visited North Korea in 2013 and calls Kim his friend, claimed that now was the perfect time – and he was the perfect man – to press for peace. “If I can go back over there … you’ll see me talking to him, and sitting down and having dinner, a glass of wine, laughing and doing my thing. I guess things will settle down a bit and everybody can rest at ease.” Rodman, 56, added: “I think a lot of people around the world … want me to go just to see if I can do something.” The 6ft 7in former sportsman, who calls the North Korean dictator “the Marshal”, said it was far-fetched to imagine Kim and Trump one day sitting down for a beer, but “a 30-second conversation” was feasible. Rodman said he had been seeking Trump’s ear on North Korea for months. “I’ve been trying to tell Donald since day one: ‘Come talk to me, man … I’ll tell you what the Marshal wants more than anything … It’s not even that much.’” However, when the Guardian inquired as to what the Marshal wanted, Rodman was tight-lipped: “I ain’t telling you … I will tell him [Trump] when I see him.” Despite claiming that Kim is a “friend for life”, there is little evidence Rodman has the North Korean leader’s ear when it comes to affairs of state. Kim appears to view the retired athlete as a benign outsider, someone to whom he can present a gentler image of himself as a lover of basketball and horses, safe in the knowledge that this is the image that will circulate around the world as soon as Rodman returns home. On Monday, Rodman painted Kim as a Frank Sinatra fan and said Kim had asked him to write a book about Kim’s life. Rodman said he was considering calling it The Middleman (“That’s me”). The pair appear to have formed an unlikely bond during skiing trips and karaoke sessions, but on some of Rodman’s five previous visits the pair have not met, including on his most recent, in June this year. Rodman admits that he has shied away from sensitive political subjects, to the anger of rights groups that accuse him of lending credibility to one of the world’s cruellest dictatorships. “I don’t even try to think about [the bad things],” he said. Trump has not commented on Rodman’s North Korean travels but in 2013 hailed his visit that year as “smart”. “The world is blowing up around us. Maybe Dennis is a lot better than what we have,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"science/2017/dec/11/risk-of-fatal-motorcycle-crash-higher-under-a-full-moon-researchers-find","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-11T23:30:18Z","webTitle":"Risk of fatal motorcycle crash higher under a full moon, researchers find","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/dec/11/risk-of-fatal-motorcycle-crash-higher-under-a-full-moon-researchers-find","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2017/dec/11/risk-of-fatal-motorcycle-crash-higher-under-a-full-moon-researchers-find","fields":{"headline":"Risk of fatal motorcycle crash higher under a full moon, researchers find","bodyText":"Motorcyclists venturing forth under a full moon, beware – the risk of having a fatal crash is higher, researchers have found. While the reason for the link is not clear the researchers say there could be several possibilities, including that the full moon could distract riders, or make it harder to gauge speed. “Our study suggests that extra care is needed when riding a motorcycle under a full moon,” said Dr Donald Redelmeier, co-author of the research from the University of Toronto. The average ride for a motorcyclist “is more dangerous than [for] a drunk driver with no seatbelt who travels the same distance,” he added. “Risk is one of those things that people just can’t sense until it is too late – that’s why we need science about this.” While motorcyclists face many distractions on the roads, from wildlife to beautiful sunsets, the team say they chose to focus on the full moon because it is large, bright and can suddenly pop into the field of view. Moreover, lunar events can be easily tracked. Writing in the British Medical Journal, Redelmeier – together with Eldar Shafir from Princeton University – describe how they analysed 40 years of data on motorcycle deaths across the US to explore whether there was a link with full moons. In total, there were 494 full moons between the start of 1975 and the end of 2014, with 4,494 fatal crashes between the late afternoon and the next morning on those days. To analyse whether crashes were more common on such nights, the team looked at the number of nighttime crashes exactly one week before and one week after each full moon, when a half moon would be present. That, they note, made sure that the comparisons took into account a host of factors, including the weather, year, day of the week and even changes to road layouts and traffic levels. Taken together, the results reveal that on average 9.1 crashes took place on nights with a full moon, compared to just over 8.6 when the moon was not full, meaning that there was a 5% greater risk of crashing. The result held regardless of factors including the time of year and decade as well as the motorcyclist’s age, engine size, and whether or not they used a helmet. “5% is a great big deal when it comes to road safety,” said Redelmeier. When the duo looked at the 65 nights when the moon was in fact a supermoon – a phenomenon where it appears bigger and brighter than a regular full moon – the impact appeared even greater, with a 32% higher risk of a fatal crash compared with similar nights with a half moon and 22% higher risk compared with a regular full moon. Redelmeier believes are there at least three potential explanations for the link between motorcycle deaths and full moons, including lighting effects produced by the moon that may cause riders to misjudge their speed, or that a full moon means more riders – or other traffic – might take to the roads. “A different possibility is this idea of distraction – that glancing up at a full moon takes the rider’s gaze off the road and creates a moment of inattention that can lead to a loss of control,” he said. But, the authors note, the study had limitations, not least that it only looked at motorcyclists and did not examine deaths on new moon nights. David Spiegelhalter, Winton professor for the public understanding of risk at the University of Cambridge, said the study was interesting. “The typical fatality is a middle-aged man having a head-on collision on a big bike in the country while not wearing a helmet,” he said. “5% more bikers get killed on full-moon nights, and the authors suggest this may be because of distraction. But maybe it’s simply because 5% more of these idiotic ageing juveniles go for a spin on a nice bright night?”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2017/dec/11/the-fiver-manchester-derby-united-city-jose-mourinho-milk","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-11T16:11:02Z","webTitle":"The Fiver | 'Noisy neighbours' live up to their name","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/dec/11/the-fiver-manchester-derby-united-city-jose-mourinho-milk","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/dec/11/the-fiver-manchester-derby-united-city-jose-mourinho-milk","fields":{"headline":"'Noisy neighbours' live up to their name","bodyText":"MILK WAS A BAD CHOICE Whether it’s gouging opposition coaches in the eye from behind, publicly humiliating a doctor for refusing to illegally encroach on the pitch to treat a player he’s ordered to feign knack or disparaging referees for doing their job correctly, José Mourinho has always been the personification of fair play. As gracious in defeat as he invariably is magnanimous in victory, the Manchester United manager was understandably irritated when his club’s famously “noisy neighbours” lived up to their name by celebrating their victory at Old Trafford with actual celebrations: playing loud music, busting moves in their dressing room and creating the kind of din that can distract a manager who is busy dreaming up outlandish excuses to explain the manner in which his team have just been outplayed by their city rivals ahead of his media duties. Sadly for José, his pleas for City to turn down that racket not only fell on deaf ears, but led to a 20-man tunnel stramash involving players and coaching staff from both teams that left Pep Guardiola’s assistant Mikel Arteta with a cut eyebrow and José dripping with semi-skimmed and looking like the money-shot from one of those “special interest” DVDs Weird Uncle Fiver sells in his XXX Bongo Shack. We’re told. Of course there’s no point in crying over spilt milk, so José chose to cry over other things – the referee, the ugliness of Manchester City’s goals – once police and stewards had broken up the fracas. According to reports from Spain, Romelu Lukaku is alleged to have thrown a bottle that opened Arteta’s eyebrow, but not even The Fiver is going to make the obvious joke that he must have been aiming for somebody else. It is, however, worth noting that Arteta may not have been the first person in City colours who Lukaku hit in the face with a poorly aimed projectile on Sunday. Now the Football Association has got itself involved and asked both clubs for their “observations”. Despite so many people being involved, The Fiver’s going to go out on a limb and predict that nobody will have seen or heard nuffink and in fact there was no tunnel bust-up. The police, for their part, have said they will only intervene if they receive a formal complaint, which is highly unlikely to materialise, while Arteta himself had the good grace to cover his eye as he drove past photographers eager to get a snap of his head wound on his way into training on Monday morning. Snitches, as they say, get stitches … although the Good Ship Suture is reported to have sailed for the City assistant coach already. As entertaining as this post-match mini-riot in the bowels of Old Trafford seems to have been, The Fiver can’t help but wistfully muse on how much better it would have been if the game had been played at the Etihad Stadium. Manchester City’s glass-walled Tunnel Club was the subject of much derision when it was opened earlier this season, but with that kind of entertainment on offer to well-heeled match-goers, one can’t help but feel £15,000 for a snazzy season ticket is an absolute steal.

A recent Finnish study found that couples with similar political views reported higher levels of relationship satisfaction (though, of course, there are always exceptions). But what if you’re very different on personality traits such as (c) neuroticism, (d) conscientiousness and (e) extroversion? Don’t worry – it doesn’t seem to matter.

Bleak!” Nine dates of her All I Want for Christmas is You: A Night of Joy and Festivity tour, a seasonal fandango that has pitted Mariah against Santa for the last four years, were cancelled. Happily, her two UK shows survived, giving the British branch of the Lambily (as the Lambs are collectively known) something to cheer about – this is only her second set of British shows since 2003. The concept, which evolved from a residency at New York’s Beacon theatre, recognises the fact that, while Carey may not be the album-seller she once was, she has Christmas sewn up. The 1994 single All I Want for Christmas Is You is her festive passport, charting every year – it’s currently No 5 in the UK, and showing its annual spike in Google’s trending chart, along with a “related enquiry” about how much it has earned in royalties ($60m, reportedly). What the Night of Joy and Festivity offers is the top-selling female singer of all time focusing on the time of year that most accords with her core qualities. Splashiness, sentimentality, sparkle with all the trimmings – Carey is in her element here. The production includes, just for starters, elves, a sugar-plum fairy, carolers, Nutcracker drummer boys, a full-sized Christmas tree and dancers dressed as reindeer. If she could have swung it, live reindeer might have featured – she has them at her family celebration, naturally. “I don’t know why that would be a surprise,” she says, undermining the perception that a woman known for her “divatude” couldn’t possibly have a sense of humour. Humour? The show is steeped in it, from the high camp of her being lifted aloft by two hunky male dancers to the segment that would usually feature a cameo appearance from her young twins, known as “dem babies”. They would be on stage with her, singing along to new power ballad The Star – one of the set’s only non-Christmas features – but, as they’re six years old, they’re asleep. “I try to be a responsible person, so let them sleep, right?” It’s safe to say that Carey also sees the funny side of this candy-cane fantasia, with its four costume changes and onstage team of perhaps 35. Nobody could witness this 75 minutes without concluding that Carey is a good egg. There’s a single digression, when she explains why she chose Manchester as the only UK date other than London. “I’m glad we got to bring our love to you here, especially this year, especially in this building.” Reconstruction work is still ongoing, seven months after the terror attack at Ariana Grande’s show, and Carey asks for a moment “to honour all affected by the tragedy”. A moving Joy to the World follows, seguing from the old English carol to the 1970 Hoyt Axton pop song of the same name. Having released two Christmas albums, Carey is not short of appropriate songs, and often plumps for less obvious choices. Though she starts with the solidly traditional Hark! The Herald Angels Sing, accompanied by white-clad musicians and falling snow, the next song is the jazzy theme from A Charlie Brown Christmas, complete with excerpts from the 1965 TV special on the back screen. She vigorously visits Darlene Love’s Christmas (Baby, Please Come Home), bending to pick up a toy lamb thrown from the crowd. “So sweet,” she says. “I’ve got all my Lambies with me.” Several self-penned songs, such as Oh Santa! and When Christmas Comes, are thoroughly gone over, the latter de-sugared by monochrome video footage of her beloved New York. As Carey-composed baubles go, they’re fine, but essentially filler in a set that can only end one way. When All I Want for Christmas is You is unleashed as the finale – and “unleashed” is scant exaggeration – Carey’s talent merges definitively with her showiness. The uplift created is so powerful that when she leaves the stage, a backing vocalist keeps singing, unwilling to let the night end. Before we reach the encore, there’s still a fair amount of Christmas to tackle. With every song a set piece employing scenery, costumes and, at one point, a five-minute confetti shower, the show must cost a fortune to stage. Then there’s the toll exacted on Carey, who never seems entirely comfortable balancing on her high heels. Her voice, though, remains remarkable. Her C-5 high note, which has a YouTube compilation of its own, is unimpaired; she makes eye-opening use of it on Silent Night. Her whistle note is greeted with cheers whenever she stands still at the mic and conjures it up, which she does with an air of purpose. Stung by previous criticism that her backing singers do much of the heavy lifting, she demonstrates that she still has it. And, I would contend, never lost it."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"music/2017/dec/11/samantha-fox-accuses-david-cassidy-of-sexual-assault","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-11T11:32:57Z","webTitle":"Samantha Fox accuses David Cassidy of sexual assault","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/dec/11/samantha-fox-accuses-david-cassidy-of-sexual-assault","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2017/dec/11/samantha-fox-accuses-david-cassidy-of-sexual-assault","fields":{"headline":"Samantha Fox accuses David Cassidy of sexual assault","bodyText":"Samantha Fox has accused the late David Cassidy of sexual assault, during and after a 1985 video shoot for his single Romance. She told the Daily Star that during a dinner with him at a Chelsea restaurant, she was washing her hands in the women’s toilets when “the door flew open and David Cassidy came storming in. Before I really had time to process what was happening, he had pushed me up against the wall and his hands were all over me. I shouted: ‘Get off me, David!’ in an attempt to stop him. But instead, he just stuck his tongue into my mouth and shoved a hand under my skirt, while the other kept a firm grip on one of my breasts. “I reacted quickly and instinctively by bringing my knee upwards, striking him right in the balls ... then I elbowed him in the face.” The glamour model had been cast in the music video, along with a photoshoot in which she was undressed from the waist up. “David seemed to be deliberately drawing out the photoshoot, which took an eternity, and he had an erection the entire time – something he did absolutely nothing to hide,” she said. “Whenever he pressed himself against me, I could clearly feel his dick.” Cassidy died earlier this month, aged 67, following kidney and liver failure. He became famous as a teen pin-up in the 1970s, thanks to his role in hit TV series The Partridge Family, which also led to a string of hit albums, both solo and with his TV family. The Romance single was taken from an album of the same name, as Cassidy was trying to reinvigorate his career in the wake of his teen stardom.

The lasting image of a week that should be all about playoff runs is instead Houston Texans quarterback Tom Savage lying on the turf, his head having been smashed to the ground, staring blankly in the air with his fingers twitching uncontrollably. This should have been a sign that something neurologically was wrong with Savage, that he should have been whisked far from the field. And yet the Texans medical staff apparently let him back on following a cursory exam that took less than three minutes. It took two incomplete passes for someone on the Houston sideline to realize something wasn’t right and Savage was pulled from the game and taken under the stands for a more extensive evaluation. He did not come back. What’s clear is the NFL’s procedure for handling concussions is not working. Asking team doctors to diagnose concussions in quick exams held in tents behind the bench is probably not the best way to decide if a player is healthy enough to remain in a game. It pits the eternal dilemma of a team’s lust for winning against a player’s safety and is the same kind of shoddy medicine that has gotten the NFL into a head trauma mess to begin with. This is the third time this season that a quarterback has been taken into the tent with what seems an obvious had injury only to be sent back to the field after exams that seemed barely longer than an eye blink. Last month, Seattle quarterback Russell Wilson dashed through a tent exam before quickly returned following a brutal hit to his chin and Indianapolis’s Jacoby Brissett returned to a game against Pittsburgh after wobbling to the sideline following a hit. Savage’s return brought a swift reaction from Chris Nowinski, the founder of the Concussion Legacy Foundation. While most fans may not know of Nowinski he is one of the most important voices on football concussions around. A former football player at Harvard and a professional wrestler whose career was cut short because of concussions, he worked closely with Dr Bennet Omalu, the Pittsburgh pathologist who identified the link between head trauma in football and the degenerative brain condition, CTE. In fact, it was Nowinski who helped Omalu procure the brains of recently-deceased former players, speeding the movement to get the NFL to recognize CTE as a significant problem. The final line of Nowinski’s text – “I would not let my worst enemy go through the 2017 NFL concussion protocol” – must sting. But his words have merit. Despite the glaring attention paid to repeated blows to the head in football games and long-term brain disease, the league is still not showing a desire to get things right. It may be unfair to blame the team doctors who are nonetheless conflicted because of their arrangements with the teams. Since the doctors are on the sideline at games they don’t see the same replays we do on TV. They might not see Brissett go limp for a moment after being hit or see Savage’s twitching hands. But there needs to be better communication between them and those who do see these things. There needs to be more emphasis placed on keeping players from going back in games when it is clear those players should be heading to the locker room. Football is a violent game. Those who make it their life’s pursuit know this. Anyone who signs an NFL contract today knows the risks. The information is out there. And yet at some point the bravado becomes foolish. Something has to be done to make sure the next Tom Savage does not go back into a game. By the way, the Texans lost 26-17 to San Francisco on Sunday. Niners quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo threw for 334 yards and a touchdown in San Francisco’s victory. It’s probably the last thing most people will remember from the day. Fantasy player of the week Carson Wentz. It seems especially cruel to reward the Eagles’ star quarterback on the day his season ended. But before Wentz presumably tore his ACL trying to dive into the end zone late in Philadelphia’s 43-35 win over the Rams, he was having yet another magnificent day. In what’s almost positively his final 2017 game, he threw for 291 yards and four touchdowns against just one early interception. This should have been another game that helped him to the league’s MVP award ... until he was hit awkwardly as he tried to dive into the end zone for a third-quarter score. The play was called back for holding as he limped to the huddle. He did throw a touchdown four plays later but the damage had been done. He came out after that score and never returned. The Eagles did continue behind his replacement, Nick Foles, scoring on two field goals and a late touchdown to win the game and the NFC East. Stat of the week Fourteen straight, one of last 15, two of last 17, three of last 24. These are the marks of Cleveland Browns’ futility going back to early in the 2015 season. It’s as wretched a run as the NFL has seen in some time. Sunday seemed especially painful for Cleveland fans. For much of the day, the Browns were beating the hated Green Bay Packers and while the Packers were playing one last week without injured quarterback Aaron Rodgers, they were still the Green Bay Packers and these were still the Cleveland Browns. They led by two touchdowns heading into the fourth quarter. But then disaster struck as it always strikes Cleveland. Green Bay scored two touchdowns to tie the game and another in overtime to give the Packers a 27-21 victory and prolong the agony of the Browns, who are 0-13 this year and have lost 14 straight going back to last season. Thus ended a long week in which general manager Sashi Brown was replaced by former Kanas City general manager John Dorsey, presumably ending the team’s experiment with advanced metrics as a primary player-evaluation tool. Though given the way the Browns have played in recent years, none of their many approaches seem to have worked. Video of the week Who doesn’t love a football game in the snow? Early Sunday afternoon the matchup between the Buffalo Bills and Indianapolis Colts was not much to be excited about. But then the wind blew, the snow fell and everything was magnificent. The snow came down so hard before the game that fans in the stands could barely see the field let alone the scoreboard, which was just a distant glow in the fog. Once the game began, players trudged through drifts that went high over their ankles. Dives to the turf were really plunges into snow. Groundskeepers had little hope of cleaning the snow off the field and simply tried to shovel lines every five yards to give some semblance of a field. And since everyone was having so much fun the Bills and Colts went to overtime – to almost the end of overtime, in fact – before the Bills pulled of a 13-7 victory on a 21-yard touchdown run by LeSean McCoy with 1:33 left in the extra frame. Surprisingly, the teams actually combined for more than 500 yards of offense and Buffalo’s late victory also proved significant. Though the game seemed like something of a toss-up given the conditions, the Bills victory makes them 7-6 and keeps them in the running for a wild-card spot. Quote of the week “We really should have blown them out if we are being real about it.” – Jacksonville corner back Jalen Ramsey on the Jaguars’ 30-24 victory over Seattle Jacksonville are definitely for real, if no one had understood that before this weekend. The Jags are now 9-4 and in first place by themselves in the AFC South after beating up the Seahawks. For most of the afternoon it was a fierce beating of a Seattle team that seemed to be coming together for a big playoff run. The Jaguars’ aggressive defense intercepted Wilson three times and built up a 27-10 lead heading into the fourth quarter. Two Wilson touchdown throws made the score closer, but the Seahawks couldn’t come up with one last scoring drive. And they didn’t seem happy about it. At game’s end, as the Jags went into victory formation, Seattle’s defensive star Michael Bennett plunged at the knees of Jacksonville center Brandon Linder, which set off a huge fight that led to the ejection of two Seahawks. It was an ugly moment for Seattle but it was an ugly game overall for the Seahawks, who fell to 8-5. Ramsey was right: it should have been a blowout. Elsewhere around the league • Eli Manning regained his starting quarterback job with the Giants but he didn’t make New York much better in a 30-10 defeat to Dallas, who relied on three touchdown passes from Dak Prescott to improve to 7-6. • Matt Stafford threw for 381 yards and led Detroit to a late touchdown to keep the Lions’ playoff hopes alive with a 24-21 victory over Tampa Bay. • The Carolina Panthers are quietly 9-4 with a huge 31-24 victory over the NFC’s top team, Minnesota. Jonathan Stewart ran for 103 yards and three touchdowns while Newton broke of a 62-yard run late in the game to set up the winning score. • Philip Rivers threw two touchdown passes as the Chargers beat a fading Washington team, 30-13."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"books/2017/dec/12/send-us-your-questions-for-zadie-smith","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-12T12:21:45Z","webTitle":"Send us your questions for Zadie Smith","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/dec/12/send-us-your-questions-for-zadie-smith","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2017/dec/12/send-us-your-questions-for-zadie-smith","fields":{"headline":"Send us your questions for Zadie Smith","bodyText":"In February next year, Zadie Smith will publish Feel Free (Hamish Hamilton), a book of essays on topics ranging from Brexit to Beyoncé, JG Ballard to Justin Bieber.

The interview will appear in the Observer New Review in January 2018. Here are some quotes to get you started. On Jay-Z: “Asking why rappers always talk about their stuff is like asking why Milton is forever listing the attributes of heavenly armies. Because boasting is a formal condition of the epic form. And those taught that they deserve nothing rightly enjoy it when they succeed in terms the culture understands.” On spending more than 15 minutes on hair and makeup every day: “You are wasting time, your brother is not going to waste any time doing this. Every day of his life he will put a shirt on, he’s out the door and he doesn’t give a shit if you waste an hour and a half doing your makeup.” On Fred Astaire: “He is transcendent. When he dances a question proposes itself: what if a body moved like this through the world? But it is only a rhetorical, fantastical question, for no bodies move like Astaire, no, we only move like him in our dreams.” On New York: “New York just expects so much from a girl – acts like it can’t stand even the idea of a wasted talent or opportunity… Rome says: enjoy me. London: survive me. New York: gimme all you got. What a thrilling proposition! The chance to be “all that you might be”. Such a thrill – until it becomes a burden.” On immigration: “It makes an immigrant laugh to hear the fears of the nationalist, scared of infection, penetration, miscegenation, when this is small fry, peanuts, compared to what the immigrant fears – dissolution, disappearance.” On libraries: “I owe my whole life to books from libraries… It ended up being a way to become educated and finally a way to get to university and to get out.” On love: “We are so convinced of the goodness of ourselves, and the goodness of our love, we cannot bear to believe that there might be something more worthy of love than us, more worthy of worship. Greeting cards routinely tell us everybody deserves love. No. Everybody deserves clean water. Not everybody deserves love all the time.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"global-development/2017/dec/27/magnets-light-beams-end-blood-tests-malaria-uganda-sub-saharan-africa","type":"article","sectionId":"global-development","sectionName":"Global development","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-27T11:00:15Z","webTitle":"The magnets and light beams that signal an end to blood tests for malaria | Kate Hodal","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2017/dec/27/magnets-light-beams-end-blood-tests-malaria-uganda-sub-saharan-africa","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2017/dec/27/magnets-light-beams-end-blood-tests-malaria-uganda-sub-saharan-africa","fields":{"headline":"The magnets and light beams that signal an end to blood tests for malaria","bodyText":"Malaria is the leading cause of death in Uganda. Children and pregnant women are most vulnerable, but the blood tests that help diagnose it are invasive, expensive and time consuming. It means that half of all malaria deaths continue to be in children aged under five. Software engineer Brian Gitta, 25, became determined to turn this statistic on its head after malaria forced him to miss lectures at university. Along with six student friends – all of whom have been infected several times with malaria – he developed a low-cost, reusable device that can test for the disease quickly and accurately, without drawing blood. Matibabu – “medical centre” in Swahili – clips on to the patient’s finger and shines a red beam of light on to the skin, detecting changes in the shape, colour and concentration of red blood cells, all of which are affected by malaria. “When a person is infected with malaria, they have parasites in their blood that breathe, feed and produce waste – one of which is magnetic,” explains Shafik Sekitto, 24, Matibabu’s business analyst. “The magnet in the device picks up on the magnet in this person’s blood and beams the results back to a computer or smartphone.” The device is aimed at better detecting malaria not just in Uganda, but across sub-Saharan Africa, where 90% of the 400,000 global deaths caused by malaria each year occur. Matibabu has an 80% success rate, although Gitta and his team have found that patients are wary of a test that claims to detect malaria but doesn’t draw blood, and isn’t carried out by a doctor. “Because Matibabu can be used by individuals, or health centres, a doctor does not need to be there to run the test,” says Gitta, “so this is asking a behaviour change of the patient. A doctor’s presence is really vital for market penetration, so now we are working with doctors to roll out the device.” Gitta and the team aim to offer Matibabu as an initial screening at surgeries in Uganda, so that malaria can be ruled out as a potential infection in patients. Matibabu needs only two minutes to diagnose malaria, compared with 30 minutes or more for a blood test, which then has to be sent to a lab. The innovation has been met with great interest, both at home and abroad. In 2013, the team won the UN Women’s Empowerment award after competing in Microsoft’s Imagine Cup, which injected $12,000 (£8,970) into research and development. It has also been shortlisted for the Royal Academy of Engineering’s Africa prize for engineering innovation, which has a prize of £25,000. If the team wins, Gitta says, the money will help Matibabu run clinical trials and improve the accuracy of its sensors. The publicity has helped them run crowdfunding campaigns, and they have come to realise just how essential the device could be. “All of us have had malaria at least a couple of times,” says Gitta. “It’s a common disease and it happens when there’s a shift in the weather. In the beginning with Matibabu, we were just thinking, how can we address this threat and offer a quick diagnosis? “It went from being a very abstract idea to a device that the UN said could really help children under five and pregnant women. That’s when we realised the project had a lot of potential.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2017/dec/12/man-dies-in-explosion-at-birmingham-metal-factory","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-12T11:39:10Z","webTitle":"Man dies in explosion at Birmingham metal factory","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/dec/12/man-dies-in-explosion-at-birmingham-metal-factory","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2017/dec/12/man-dies-in-explosion-at-birmingham-metal-factory","fields":{"headline":"Man dies in explosion at Birmingham metal factory","bodyText":"An inquiry has been launched after a man was killed in an explosion at a metal factory in Birmingham.

West Midlands Fire Service operations commander Steve Harris confirmed that the victim was a 39-year-old man and his family had been informed. “Our thoughts are with the victim’s family, his friends and colleagues following this tragic incident,” he said. “It would appear that the incident involved the fracture of coolant pipes.

Following revivals of Widowers’ Houses and The Philanderer, Paul Miller now brings us another relative rarity: a play Shaw wrote in 1909 that moves from disquisitory drama to anarchic comedy and that offers as much intellectual stimulus as anything you’re likely to see this Christmas. Two things hold the play together: Shaw’s capacity to strip off social masks and his explicit feminism. The action takes place in the country garden in Hindhead, Surrey, of a self-made linen draper, Tarleton. But, just as the money-making Tarleton turns out to be a bookish man of ideas, a colonial aristocrat emerges as a gullible romantic and his weakling son as a manipulative monster. The women, however, are the pivotal figures. Tarleton’s daughter, Hypatia, who yearns to be “an active verb”, becomes an ardent sexual pursuer on the lines of Ann Whitefield in Man and Superman. Even more astonishing is Lina, a Polish acrobat who drops out of the skies halfway through and proceeds to juggle with the helplessly smitten men. There are times in the first half when what one character calls the “talky-talk” becomes a touch oppressive. But the action takes wing with the descent of a pair of aviators and reveals Shaw’s irrepressible comic gift that, in many ways, anticipates Ionesco, the Goons and Monty Python. When Lina imperiously demands a Bible and six oranges, the implacably middle-class Mrs Tarleton wonders why she should want the former on a weekday. A portable Turkish bath also yields a gun-toting revolutionary who defiantly announces: “Rome fell, Babylon fell, Hindhead’s turn will come.” Under all the fun, Shaw suggests – as he later does in Heartbreak House – that we are watching a doomed class on the brink of disruptive change. Miller’s production steers us skilfully through the talk and produces a number of highly accomplished performances. Lara Rossi brings to Lina a laser-beam intensity and palpable disdain for the preoccupation with love-making. Marli Siu vividly demonstrates Hypatia’s hunger for joy and suffering, and there is excellent work from Pip Donaghy as the bombastic Tarleton, Gabrielle Lloyd as his severely practical wife and Tom Hanson as their smugly philistine son. An evening as good as this, however, poses an obvious question: why doesn’t the British theatre do more Shaw? • At the Orange Tree, Richmond, until 20 January.

EU leaders have warned the British government against backtracking on promises made in Brussels after Davis suggested a Brexit breakthrough reached last week had no legal status. Senior EU figures voiced irritation on Tuesday with Davis’s claim over the weekend that the UK’s concessions in an agreement struck last week to move talks on were merely a statement of intent without legal backing. Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief negotiator, warned that the UK’s divorce deal with the EU depended on the British government sticking to an interim deal made last week on Ireland, citizens’ rights and the financial settlement. “We will have a final agreement only if the final commitments taken by Theresa May and the British government on Friday are respected,” he told journalists. “And we will be vigilant; we will not accept any backtracking from the UK.” A senior ally of the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, said the British government risked losing the EU’s good faith. “The first phase of #Brexit negotiations was meant to build trust,” tweeted Manfred Weber, the head of the centre-right bloc in the European parliament. “By downgrading this agreement to a statement of intent, the UK government is putting our trust at risk. The EU27 &amp; UK must make it clear on Thursday that the agreement is binding for both sides.” Barnier also rejected Davis’s claim that a future trade treaty could be signed on 30 March 2019 – the day after the UK’s EU exit. Barnier said he expected the EU and UK to sign “a political declaration” on the future relationship. “But it cannot be anything else. In technical, legal terms it simply is not possible to do anything else. And David Davis knows that full well.” The Brexit secretary had told the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show on Sunday that a trade deal could be signed “maybe one minute after we leave, or one second after”. Davis was engaged in urgent telephone diplomacy on Tuesday in an attempt to persuade Guy Verhofstadt, the European parliament’s Brexit coordinator, that the UK government’s word could be depended upon. In an unusual move, the European parliament’s main parties announced on Tuesday morning that they had drawn up an amendment to their Brexit resolution, on which MEPs will vote on Wednesday, condemning the Brexit secretary personally for damaging trust. Verhofstadt, a former Belgian prime minister, claimed that the Brexit secretary’s comments were “unacceptable” and would provoke a wider hardening of the EU’s positions, including in the member states’ guidelines for the future relationship to be signed off by leaders on Friday. Michael Roth, Germany’s minister for Europe, told German media he was “taken aback” that the language May had used in Brussels “differed somewhat” to what the prime minister had said in London since her return, referring in particular to the suggestion that Britain would only pay the final bill to the EU once a trade agreement had been reached. “She needs to be taking the same line in Brussels as in London,” he said. An EU official said the guidelines for talks on future relations that had been drafted were already “Davis-proofed”, and it was clear what the consequences were if commitments were not respected. The circulated draft includes the demand that “negotiations in the second phase can only progress as long as all commitments undertaken during the first phase are respected in full and translated faithfully in legal terms as quickly as possible”. The latest draft also makes clear that talks about a future relationship will only start after an EU leaders’ summit in March, and that the leaders will make a “last call” on Friday to the British cabinet to offer a clear vision of the future. Verhofstadt told reporters the government had made “an own goal. It is clear that the European council will be more strict now … I have seen a hardening of the position of the council and there will be a hardening of the position of the parliament”. Under the proposed amendments to the parliament’s resolution, MEPs will claim that in calling the outcome of phase one of the negotiations a mere statement of intent, Davis’s intervention threatened “to undermine the good faith that has been built during the negotiations”. Davis revealed details of a conversation on Tuesday afternoon with Verhofstadt, who is leading the steering group of the European parliament, which will have a veto on any future withdrawal agreement. Davis tweeted: “Pleasure, as ever, to speak to my friend [Guy Verhofstadt] we both agreed on the importance of the joint report. Let’s work together to get it converted into legal text as soon as possible.” Davis made his inflammatory comments on Sunday in response to reports that the British government had told some hardline Brexiters that assurances that Northern Ireland would maintain full alignment with EU law in future were meaningless. The Brexit secretary said the joint agreement struck with the European commission on the Irish border, citizens’ rights and the financial settlement was “more a statement of intent than it was a legally enforceable thing”. While the comments were technically correct they caused consternation in Dublin and prompted the European commission to remind the prime minister in a statement that she had “shaken hands” on a “gentlemen’s agreement” last Friday. Davis subsequently told LBC radio on Monday that his comments had been misinterpreted and twisted. EU leaders will meet on Friday without May to discuss the UK’s Brexit transition and future agreement. The next phase of Brexit talks “will be a furious race against time”, said the head of the European council, Donald Tusk, highlighting that only 10 months remain to strike a divorce deal to allow time for it to be ratified before Brexit day."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2017/dec/12/bitcoin-buyer-beware-us-sec-warns-extreme-caution-over-cryptocurrency-investments","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-12T11:25:23Z","webTitle":"Bitcoin buyer beware: US SEC warns 'extreme caution' over cryptocurrency investments","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/dec/12/bitcoin-buyer-beware-us-sec-warns-extreme-caution-over-cryptocurrency-investments","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2017/dec/12/bitcoin-buyer-beware-us-sec-warns-extreme-caution-over-cryptocurrency-investments","fields":{"headline":"Bitcoin buyer beware: US SEC warns 'extreme caution' over cryptocurrency investments","bodyText":"The head of the US Securities and Exchange Commission has warned bitcoin and other cryptocurrency investors to beware of scams and criminal activity in the sector. In the financial regulator’s strongest statement yet, SEC chair Jay Clayton said: “If a promoter guarantees returns, if an opportunity sounds too good to be true, or if you are pressured to act quickly, please exercise extreme caution and be aware of the risk that your investment may be lost.” Clayton warned investors to ask several questions before investing in cryptocurrencies or “initial coin offerings” (ICOs), including “are there substantial risks of theft or loss, including from hacking?” and “is the offering legal?” “A number of concerns have been raised regarding the cryptocurrency and ICO markets, including that, as they are currently operating, there is substantially less investor protection than in our traditional securities markets, with correspondingly greater opportunities for fraud and manipulation,” Clayton added. His statements were not entirely negative. “I believe that initial coin offerings – whether they represent offerings of securities or not – can be effective ways for entrepreneurs and others to raise funding, including for innovative projects,” Clayton said. “However, any such activity that involves an offering of securities must be accompanied by the important disclosures, processes and other investor protections that our securities laws require.” The focus of Clayton’s concern is that cryptocurrencies change the manner of financial trading, but not the legal basis for regulation. “Said another way, replacing a traditional corporate interest recorded in a central ledger with an enterprise interest recorded through a blockchain entry on a distributed ledger may change the form of the transaction, but it does not change the substance.” While the statement makes clear that the SEC views the cryptocurrency market as falling under its purview, it remains much more laissez-faire about enforcement than other regulators have been. South Korea has simply banned ICOs, noting in September that “stern penalties” would be levied on anyone issuing one. Under Clayton, who joined the SEC in January following a nomination from President Trump, the Commission has been cautiously expanding its enforcement of cryptocurrency regulation. On the same day as his statement, the organisation announced that it had successfully dissuaded a company from launching an ICO to raise funds for its “blockchain-based food review service”. “Munchee was seeking $15m in capital to improve an existing iPhone app centered on restaurant meal reviews and create an ‘ecosystem’ in which Munchee and others would buy and sell goods and services using the tokens,” the SEC said. “In the course of the offering, the company and other promoters emphasised that investors could expect that efforts by the company and others would lead to an increase in value of the tokens. The company also emphasised it would take steps to create and support a secondary market for the tokens.” Those actions, the SEC said, meant it was fair to conclude that Munchee was offering a security that fell under the regulator’s purview. “A token can be a security based on the long-standing facts and circumstances test that includes assessing whether investors’ profits are to be derived from the managerial and entrepreneurial efforts of others,” it said. Munchee agreed to withdraw the offering, avoiding a penalty from the Commission. Stephanie Avakian, co-director of the SEC’s enforcement division, said: “We will continue to scrutinise the market vigilantly for improper offerings that seek to sell securities to the general public without the required registration or exemption. In deciding not to impose a penalty, the Commission recognised that the company stopped the ICO quickly, immediately returned the proceeds before issuing tokens, and cooperated with the investigation.” Bitcoin: $64m in cryptocurrency stolen in ‘sophisticated’ hack, exchange says"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2017/dec/12/children-britain-problem-gamblers-report","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-12T22:32:53Z","webTitle":"25,000 children in Britain are problem gamblers, report finds","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/dec/12/children-britain-problem-gamblers-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2017/dec/12/children-britain-problem-gamblers-report","fields":{"headline":"25,000 children in Britain are problem gamblers, report finds","bodyText":"About 25,000 children aged between 11 and 16 are problem gamblers, with many learning to bet via computer games and social media, according to a report that has prompted warnings that Britain is “sleepwalking into a future public health storm”. In its annual survey of youth gambling (pdf), industry regulator the Gambling Commission voiced fears that children were gambling in a “consequence-free environment”, including through so-called “skins” betting on video games. Its concerns prompted Labour, which deregulated the gambling industry in 2005 but has changed its stance, to brand existing legislation “woefully out of date”. About 370,000 (12%) children in England, Scotland and Wales have gambled in the past week, the commission found. More than quarter of a million children gambled with a licensed operator, such as a bookmaker or online casino. They spent an average of £10 on gambling a week, more than a third of their £28 income from work or pocket money, with 8% claiming to have spent more than £40. Almost 1% of children aged between 11 and 16, or about 25,000, are defined as problem gamblers, with a further 36,000 at risk of developing a problem. Fruit machines remain the most common introduction to gambling for young people at 24%, followed by the National Lottery at 21%. But the commission said children were increasingly being exposed to gambling in less traditional ways, such as through eSports (computer games competitions) and via social media. The report found that 11% of children took part in skins betting, whereby online gamers can bet using in-game items, such as weapons or outfits, which can have real monetary value if traded. Skins betting, an industry worth up to $5.1bn (£3.8bn) last year according to one US report, is a common feature of games such as Counter Strike: Global Offensive. And earlier this year, two men were convicted for running a website that allowed children to bet on the Fifa series of online football games. More than one in 10 children reported having played casino-style games, which simulate roulette or fruit machines, on Facebook or smartphone apps. The commission’s statistics indicate that children who play such games, many of which have a PEGI (Pan European Game Information) 12 age rating, are more likely to gamble in real life. Of those who had ever played online gambling-style games, a quarter had spent their own money on gambling activity in the past week, significantly higher than the average of 12% among all 11-16 year olds. Concern about children’s exposure to gambling-style games on Facebook surfaced a day after a former executive at the social media company admitted feeling “tremendous guilt” over his work on “tools that are ripping apart the social fabric of how society works”. Labour’s deputy leader, Tom Watson, said the party would redraw gambling laws to tighten up regulation and address emerging risks, particularly online. “The rise of skins gambling and other forms of gambling online, or in games which encourage children to trade in cosmetic online items for cash, only serves to demonstrate that our gambling laws are woefully out of date,” he said. “The next Labour government will bring in a new gambling act that ensures our gambling laws are fit for the digital age and finally tackle Britain’s hidden gambling epidemic.” The commission’s chief executive, Sarah Harrison, has previously labelled unlicensed websites that allow children to gamble on video games as “parasites”. The report offers some insight into the extent to which children are exposed to gambling, with 80% saying they have seen advertisements on TV and 70% through social media. “It is worrying that children continue to be bombarded with adverts promoting gambling through TV, online and via social media,” said Watson. Marc Etches, the chief executive of the leading problem gambling charity, GambleAware, said Britain was “in great danger of sleepwalking into a future public health storm over gambling-related harm”. He added: “Computer gaming with gambling presents real future challenges to the current regulatory framework. We’ve been saying for some time we have concern about the normalisation of gambling for young people and this report absolutely bears that out.” Etches questioned why the government’s green paper on internet safety, published last month, did not allude to gambling as an online danger, calling on policymakers and regulators to “wake up”. He voiced concerns about a lack of education available to young people about the risks involved. “That 40% of young people who gamble said they did so ‘to make money’ shows exactly why teenage misconceptions of chance and risk leave them so vulnerable,” Etches said. The report found that four in 10 children said their parents had discussed the dangers of gambling with them, while fewer than one in five had been warned of the dangers by teachers. “We need better education and prevention measures in place to give children the resilience to avoid gambling-related harm,” said Etches. Gambling has come under increased scrutiny following a government review of the industry, including an ongoing consultation on the maximum allowable stake on controversial fixed-odds betting terminals (FOBTs). The Department for Culture, Media and Sport review promised to look at children’s exposure to gambling via social media but concluded there was little evidence to suggest the rising number of betting ads was having an impact on problem gambling. The minister for gambling, Tracey Crouch, said on Tuesday: “Protecting children is of the upmost importance, which is why there are strict controls in place to stop them accessing gambling or being encouraged to gamble through targeted advertising. “Internet gambling has grown rapidly and the Gambling Commission needs to take the strongest possible action to make sure the rules are enforced.” Labour has proposed policies including a compulsory levy on gambling firms to fund addiction treatment and a ban on betting companies advertising on football shirts."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2017/dec/12/mps-urged-to-back-brexit-bill-clause-to-protect-child-refugees","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-12T08:12:45Z","webTitle":"MPs urged to back Brexit bill clause to protect child refugees","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/dec/12/mps-urged-to-back-brexit-bill-clause-to-protect-child-refugees","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2017/dec/12/mps-urged-to-back-brexit-bill-clause-to-protect-child-refugees","fields":{"headline":"MPs urged to back Brexit bill clause to protect child refugees","bodyText":"Post-Brexit immigration law could mean refugee children are permanently separated from their families, the head of Unicef UK has warned, urging MPs to support a Conservative-backed amendment on refugee rights to the EU withdrawal bill. The global charity’s UK boss, Mike Penrose, urged the government to include wider family reunification rights in new immigration laws for when the UK leaves the EU. Nicky Morgan, the former education secretary and a prominent remain supporter, and the former children’s minister Tim Loughton, who backed leave, submitted a proposal to ensure child refugees have the same rights to be reunited with family members in the UK as they have under EU law. Their amendment to the EU withdrawal bill – new clause 53 – will be debated on Tuesday. So far, 42 MPs including the former shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper have backed the amendment. Refugees have the right to be reunited with extended family members in the UK under the EU’s Dublin III regulation, but domestic law covers only children and their parents. Charities have warned the tight definition risks excluding children who have been orphaned, and Morgan and Loughton’s amendment would widen domestic law to allow refugee children to be reunited with siblings, grandparents, aunts and uncles. “This amendment is a critical moment for our government to commit to a simple, commonsense move that could save children’s lives,” Penrose told the Guardian. “We have a renowned reputation for protecting the world’s most vulnerable children. Yet at the moment our law fails to align with the realities they face, ones that leave them orphaned or separated from their parents.” Penrose said anyone could see that adult siblings, grandparents and uncles and aunts counted as close family when children were fleeing wars. “Failing to reflect this in our rules leaves children with little choice but to embark on dangerous journeys to try and reach them, at risk of being intercepted by smugglers and traffickers along the way,” he said. Penrose said the change would be “a blow to the criminals who wish to exploit” a lack of rights for refugee children. “The government can and must do the right thing for the countless children stranded in danger. Brexit is an opportunity to do more for them, not less,” he said. Other MPs who have signed the bill include the Liberal Democrat leader, Sir Vince Cable, and his deputy, Jo Swinson, Tory MP Geoffrey Cox, Labour MPs Stella Creasy, Harriet Harman and Chris Bryant, the SNP’s Joanna Cherry and the Green party leader, Caroline Lucas. Theresa May is heading for a showdown at the bill’s debate in the House of Commons on Tuesday over how MPs get to vote on the final Brexit deal and whether the date for leaving should be fixed in law. Facing a possible defeat at the hands of Tory rebels, the prime minister made a concession on Monday by agreeing to set up a new committee of MPs to monitor any proposed legal changes to EU law as it is transferred on to the British statute book. However, the government has not backed down on its intention to fix the day of Brexit as 29 March 2019."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/dec/12/china-refugee-camps-border-north-korea","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-12T06:05:04Z","webTitle":"China building network of refugee camps along border with North Korea","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/dec/12/china-refugee-camps-border-north-korea","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/dec/12/china-refugee-camps-border-north-korea","fields":{"headline":"China building network of refugee camps along border with North Korea","bodyText":"China is quietly building a network of refugee camps along its 880-mile (1,416km) border with North Korea as it braces for the human exodus that a conflict or the potentially messy collapse of Kim Jong-un’s regime might unleash. The existence of plans for the camps, first reported in English by the Financial Times last week, emerged in an apparently leaked internal document from a state-run telecoms giant that appears to have been tasked with providing them with internet services. The China Mobile document, which has circulated on social media and overseas Chinese websites since last week, reveals plans for at least five refugee camps in Jilin province. The document, which the Guardian could not independently verify, says: “Due to cross-border tensions … the [Communist] party committee and government of Changbai county has proposed setting up five refugee camps in the county.” It gives the names and locations of three such facilities: Changbai riverside, Changbai Shibalidaogou and Changbai Jiguanlizi. The New York Times reported that centres for refugees were also planned in the cities of Tumen and Hunchun. A spokesman for China’s foreign ministry declined to confirm the camps’ existence at a regular press briefing on Monday but did not deny they were being built. “I haven’t seen such reports,” Lu Kang told reporters. The question was purged from the foreign ministry’s official transcript of the briefing, as regularly happens with topics raised by foreign journalists that are considered politically sensitive or inconvenient. The leaked document contains the name and telephone number of a China Mobile employee who drafted it but calls to that number went unanswered on Tuesday. The construction of the camps appears to reflect growing concern in Beijing about the potential for political instability – or even regime collapse – in North Korea. Cheng Xiaohe, a North Korea specialist from Renmin University in Beijing, said while he could not confirm whether the document was genuine, it would be irresponsible for China not to make such preparations. “Tensions are high on the Korean peninsula … it is on the brink of war. As a major power and a neighbouring country, China should make plans for all eventualities.” Jiro Ishimaru, a Japanese documentary maker who runs a network of citizen journalists inside North Korea and on the Chinese side of the border, said a contact in Changbai county had recently told him that while they had not seen signs of camps being built there, they “had heard there are plans to build a facility”. Tensions on the Korean peninsula have soared this year as the US president, Donald Trump, has stepped up pressure on his North Korean counterpart and Pyongyang has accelerated its nuclear and ballistic missile programmes. Trump has baited Kim with the nickname “Little Rocket Man” and threats of military action, while Kim has responded with insults of his own, and a succession of nuclear and missile tests that have brought two new rounds of UN sanctions. Following its latest intercontinental ballistic missile test on 29 November, Pyongyang claimed the ability to strike anywhere on US soil. In an interview with the Guardian in Beijing on Monday, Dennis Rodman, the NBA star turned would-be peacemaker, played down fears of a catastrophic nuclear conflict and denied Kim, whom he calls his friend, was “going to try and bomb or kill anyone in America”. “We ain’t gonna die, man, come on, no … It’s not like that,” Rodman insisted, urging Trump to use him as an intermediary to engage with Kim. He described the verbal war between Trump and Kim as “a chess game” that should not be taken too seriously. Beijing seems less certain. Last week one official newspaper in Jilin, the Chinese province closest to North Korea’s nuclear test site, hinted at that nervousness with a full-page article offering tips on how to react to a nuclear incident. Iodine tablets, masks and soap were useful allies in the event of such a catastrophe, readers of the Jilin Daily learned.

The two usually adept communicators danced around the issue of who would replace Dastyari in the Senate next year following his resignation, and what role Keneally would play if she failed to win this weekend’s byelection. “I am here running as a candidate for Bennelong,” she said. “The only thing I’ve been offered by Bill Shorten is to be Labor’s candidate for Bennelong. This is where I live. This is the community I’m fighting for and what I will do every single moment until polls close. Let me be clear – I’ve been offered Senate seats before by Labor, and I’ve turned them down.” The government seized on Dastyari’s departure, which capped off a damaging two weeks for Shorten and Labor, with foreign minister Julie Bishop suggesting it was a choreographed exit to create a vacancy in the Senate for Keneally. “This is all stage-managed by Labor as a back-stop for Kristina Keneally should she not succeed here,” Bishop said from Bennelong. “The people of Bennelong deserve a local champion, John Alexander cares about the people. Kristina Keneally is shopping around for a seat in parliament.” The head-to-head in Bennelong has already been fierce, but will only intensify over the coming days given the stakes. Tuesday’s Newspoll, published by News Corp, showed Keneally had narrowed Labor’s gap in the formerly safe Liberal seat, with the two parties level at 50-50 on the two-party preferred measure. A Labor win in the seat would help upset the balance in parliament, removing Malcolm Turnbull’s one-seat majority in the House of Representatives. Alexander holds the seat on a margin of just under 10%. Keneally, whose record as New South Wales premier was the subject of government dixers in the last week of parliament, said she expected the last days of the campaign to get personal. “It is only going to get nastier,” she said. “Malcolm Turnbull has accused me of everything short of ‘it wasn’t the dingo, it was Keneally’. “I expect that is where he’ll go in the next few days.” The Dastyari controversy had proved a growing distraction for Labor’s campaign in Bennelong, which has one of the highest Chinese-Australian populations in the state. Shorten made a point of repeating that Dastyari had made his own decision to leave politics. He said Dastyari was “no traitor” but it was clear his “career was going nowhere” in the wake of revelations he had contradicted bipartisan policy on the South China Sea and warned a donor he might be under counter-intelligence surveillance. “I think he’s done the right thing,” Shorten said. “I want to say that he is a decent person and loyal Australian. I don’t for one minute accept the government’s characterisation of him being a traitor to Australia. I think the government needs to use this opportunity to drop their China-phobic attacks and get on with the issues affecting everyday Australians.” In the last days of the 2017 parliamentary sitting, the government introduced new legislation in response to the Dastyari controversy, to tighten foreign interference laws and ban foreign donations. Labor vowed to stop accepting foreign donations following the first controversy in relation to Dastyari’s links with Chinese donors in August 2016. The finance minister, Mathias Cormann, was forced to defend the WA Liberal party accepting a $20,000 donation for his campaign in the lead-up to the last federal election. “Firstly, there is a world of difference between personal donations as the one secured by Sam Dastyari, and campaign donations for political parties,” he said. “Both the Labor and Liberal parties receive donations in the context of elections. All of those donations are lawful and declared, consistent with our disclosure rules.” Shorten said Labor would move to lower the declaration threshold for disclosure, which is indexed at $13,500, with another increase to come in July. “I want to lower that, I want to lower that,” he said. “Then we’ve got the issue about foreign donations. I want to get rid of that.” The Greens have also seized on the issue, with leader Richard Di Natale pointing out the issue was “bigger than just one person” and using the controversy to renew calls for a federal independent corruption commission. Both Turnbull and Shorten have suggested in recent weeks they could be open to creating one, but neither party has made a firm commitment."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/dec/12/western-australia-children-stealing-food-because-they-are-not-being-fed-at-home","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-12T05:59:16Z","webTitle":"Western Australia: children stealing food because they are not being fed at home","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/dec/12/western-australia-children-stealing-food-because-they-are-not-being-fed-at-home","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/dec/12/western-australia-children-stealing-food-because-they-are-not-being-fed-at-home","fields":{"headline":"Western Australia: children stealing food because they are not being fed at home","bodyText":"Children are breaking into houses to steal food because they are not being fed at home and many have fallen through the gaps of child protective services, according to a new study. Researchers from Edith Cowan University interviewed 87 children aged between 11 and 17 who had been brought before the Western Australian children’s court in the first half of 2017. More than half of the interviewees were facing a charge of burglary. Of those, 20% said they broke into houses in search of food. “I got stuff from the freezer,” one respondent said. “I go for the food but I didn’t take anything else.” Criminologist Natalie Gately said the majority of burglaries conducted by children were crimes of opportunity and took place in groups in the middle of the day. Most targeted money or jewellery, but those who looked for food appeared motivated only by hunger. “The kids who stole food were only going in for food and the implication was that no, they are not getting it at home,” Gately said. “There’s no parents at home saying to them: get up, have some breakfast, brush your teeth, go to school. That daily supervision and monitoring is missing.” Gately said the research was initially conducted as a crime prevention tool, to learn how young people were targeting houses. But the findings indicated high levels of exposure to domestic violence, parental incarceration, homelessness and disconnection from any form of schooling or supervision, which she said could not be addressed through the criminal justice system. Of the 87 children interviewed, only nine said they attend school “regularly” and 47 said they had either been expelled or suspended. One 11-year-old said they had not to their knowledge been enrolled in school. “I don’t know where it is,” they said. Researchers were not permitted to ask direct questions about exposure to family violence, but Gately said from the answers they gave only seven of the children appeared not to have been exposed. Two-thirds of the children reported drinking alcohol, with one reporting having tried their first drink at age eight, and a significant number also reported drug use, mainly cannabis. “I have had 12-year-olds replying that they are taking cannabis every day to take a break from life,” she said. “For 12-year-olds to be saying that they need a break from life, that’s a bad sign.” Most children had memories of interacting with a police officer when they were as young as six-years-old, an encounter most described as police coming to their house in response to family violence or another incident. More than a third reported having at least one family member incarcerated during their lifetime, and three-quarters said a member of their family had previous contact with the justice system. Those whose fathers had been incarcerated were able to cope better than those whose mother had been jailed, Gately said. “The ones who seemed to be the most angry and the most distressed were the ones whose mum was jailed,” she said, adding that jailing a mother would “punish the whole family”. She said those with an active child protection caseworker appeared to be doing slightly better than those who shuffled between the houses of multiple family members and friends. “These kids lives are really chaotic and really transient,” Gately said. “They keep getting moved around and given to different caregivers.” Two-thirds of the children had already been remanded or detained in Perth’s Banksia Hill youth detention centre before being brought before the court on their current charges. Conditions at Banksia Hill were compared to Darwin’s Don Dale youth detention facility in a damning report this year. “Clearly the fact that the majority of them had already been in detention once is showing that it’s not acting as a deterrent,” she said. “We would like to see detention abolished and find alternative ways of handling these offenders.” Among the alternative options are intensive neonatal support for new parents to help them support and care for their children; drug and alcohol programs for parents; and alternative schooling options for those who have fallen behind or do not fit in to a mainstream schooling environment. Gately said punitive approaches did not work. “It has to be framed as saving children,” she said. “At 11 years old you are not a young adult, you are a child still.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/dec/13/environment-funding-slashed-by-third-since-coalition-took-office","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-12T17:00:03Z","webTitle":"Environment funding slashed by third since Coalition took office","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/dec/13/environment-funding-slashed-by-third-since-coalition-took-office","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/dec/13/environment-funding-slashed-by-third-since-coalition-took-office","fields":{"headline":"Environment funding slashed by third since Coalition took office","bodyText":"Spending on environment department programs, monitoring and staff has been slashed by nearly a third since the Coalition won the election in 2013, with deeper cuts promised into next decade. While the federal budget has expanded by $36bn since Tony Abbott took office, funding for the environment has been cut by nearly half a billion dollars so far, an analysis by two conservation groups found. While the government allocated $1.4bn to environmental funding in the 2013-14 budget, there was a 30.2% drop in the 2016/17 budget down to $980m. It fell again in the 2017/18 budget to $945m. By 2020-21, the final year of the forward estimates period in May’s budget papers, the Turnbull government plans to have reduced environment spending to less than 60% of 2013-14 figure. The estimated amount to be spent in the 2020-21 budget will be $825m. Among the programs hardest hit are those designed to maintain biodiversity by protecting shrinking animal and plant populations and ecosystems. Their funding is to be cut in half across the eight years. The cuts are planned to continue despite the government’s five-yearly State of the Environment report finding in March there was insufficient public support for environmental management and restoration programs. The report found climate change was altering the structure and function of natural ecosystems, and parts of Australia’s natural estate were in poor or deteriorating condition. Areas under pressure include the heavily populated coast, some urban growth corridors and land-use zones where grazing and invasive species are threatening biodiversity. The budget analysis was set out in a submission to government by the Australian Conservation Foundation (ACF) and WWF Australia. ACF economist Matt Rose said it suggested the Coalition placed little value on environmental protection. “The government has no idea how important the environment is to the wellbeing of Australia, the Australian people, the economy and our sense of who we are,” he said. Rose said while government ministers in some portfolios built influence by arguing for greater resources for their department, allowing them to deliver positive outcomes, the opposite had been true for environment minister Josh Frydenberg and his immediate predecessor, Greg Hunt. “We should judge any environment minister, from any political party, on whether the health of the environment is better when they left the portfolio than when they were appointed,” he said. “We’re seeing rising carbon emissions, we’re seeing unprecedented land-clearing, we’re seeing threatened species declining with many on track to go extinct, and we’re seeing less funding for people to get out there and build fences, do weeding and re-vegetate landscapes.” Frydenberg responded that, on a per capita basis, Australia’s emissions were at their lowest level in 27 years due to a “strong suite of policies”. This included reducing potent hydrofluorocarbons, the Emissions Reduction Fund that pays businesses and farmers to make carbon dioxide cuts, a renewable energy target and a national energy efficiency plan. He listed several environmental programs the government had funded: a $2bn Great Barrier Reef 2050 plan; the introduction of a national threatened species strategy overseen by a dedicated commissioner; an Antarctic program with a secure future that included new facilities on Macquarie Island and a replacement icebreaker. ‘We have … maintained environmental standards while reducing red tape with a one-stop shop for environmental assessments,” the minister said. According to the analysis, environment department spending will be 0.16% of the total budget by 2020-21. The biggest cut in recent years was to a $946m biodiversity fund – a grant program funded by carbon price revenue introduced by Labor in 2011 to “maintain ecosystem function and increase ecosystem resilience to climate change”. Then prime minister Kevin Rudd slashed it by $213m in July 2013 and the Coalition shut it later that year. Only about a third of the initial promised sum was spent. In 2014-15, the Coalition also cut $471m over four years from the long-running Landcare program, which funds work on local projects tackling land degradation. Most of that money was to be redirected to environmental works by Abbott’s $525m green army, made up of young volunteers and the unemployed, until it was announced last year that program would also be shut down. About $225m of green army funding was reclaimed as a budget saving, and $100m went back to Landcare under a deal with the Greens in return for their support for a backpacker tax. Landcare has taken a 33% annual funding cut. It once received $1bn over four years. From 2019, it will get the same sum over six years. The environment group analysis does not include funding for climate change and energy programs because they were in a different department under the Abbott government but have subsequently been brought under Frydenberg’s environment and energy umbrella. And it does not include work by the states or federal government agencies, including Parks Australia and the Murray-Darling Basin Authority. The two environmental groups called for a significant boost in environmental investment in the 2018-19 budget. They called for a new $1.1bn environment fund to boost threatened species recovery, support the expansion and management of protected areas and improve Great Barrier Reef water quality. Other suggestions included an independent statutory authority to enforce national environmental laws and expanded scientific research into long-term bushfire mitigation strategies."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2017/dec/12/new-york-attack-police-in-bangladesh-quiz-akayed-ullahs-relatives","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-12T14:15:42Z","webTitle":"New York attack: police in Bangladesh question Akayed Ullah's relatives","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/dec/12/new-york-attack-police-in-bangladesh-quiz-akayed-ullahs-relatives","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/dec/12/new-york-attack-police-in-bangladesh-quiz-akayed-ullahs-relatives","fields":{"headline":"New York attack: police in Bangladesh question Akayed Ullah's relatives","bodyText":"Police in Bangladesh are interrogating relatives of the man who allegedly detonated a pipe bomb in a crowded New York subway corridor on Monday, including his wife. Officers picked up Akayed Ullah’s wife, Jannatul Ferdous Jui, along with her parents from a neighbourhood in the Bangladeshi capital, Dhaka, on Tuesday afternoon. They were released after being questioned for around four hours. Other relatives, including Ullah’s uncle, were also being questioned on the small island off the south-east coast of Bangladesh where the alleged bomber was born and spent his childhood before moving to Dhaka and then to the US seven years ago. In all about a dozen of his relatives were interrogated on Tuesday. Ullah was born in Musapur village on Sandwip, an island near the city of Chittagong, but moved away at a young age and no longer had any immediate relatives in the area, said Abul Khair Nadim, chairman of the local union. “Akayed’s father, Sanaullah Mia, moved to the US along with his son in 2011,” Abul Khair Nadim told the Guardian in a phone interview. “Around a year later he died in the US. “We don’t think that he was involved in any nefarious activity in the island. He has some distant relatives in the island. But they do not know much about Akayed,” he said. Before he was detained for questioning by police on Tuesday, Zulfiquar Haider, Ullah’s father-in-law, said the suspect had married his daughter on a visit to Bangladesh in January 2016. They gave birth to a child in June this year and Ullah had visited in September to see the baby, returning to the US on 22 October. Haider, his wife and his daughter were picked up by counter-terrorism authorities in Dhaka while his uncle, Joynal Abedin, was being questioned on Sandwip island, the Daily Star of Bangladesh reported. New York police alleged Ullah, 27, set off a homemade bomb strapped to his body in an underground pedestrian corridor between Times Square and the Port Authority Bus Terminal at rush hour. Four people were injured in the blast, including Ullah himself, in an attack said to have been “inspired” by Islamic State. Ullah lived with his mother, sister and two brothers in Brooklyn and was a green card holder, according to Shameem Ahsan, the consul general of Bangladesh in New York. A cousin of the alleged bomber in Chittagong told reporters he was surprised his relative was being accused of committing the attack. “My uncle [Ullah’s father] was a freedom fighter. He fought for the liberation of the country,” he said. “He ran a grocery story in Dhaka before moving to the US. It’s shocking to know his son launched the terror attack.” He said the families had only maintained intermittent contact since Ullah moved to the US. A law enforcement official familiar with the investigation told Reuters that investigators had found evidence that Ullah watched Isis propaganda on the internet. Bangladesh has strongly condemned the attack, saying in a statement: “A terrorist is a terrorist irrespective of his or her ethnicity or religion, and must be brought to justice.” Islamists have claimed responsibility for a spate of machete killings targeting atheist bloggers, LBGTI activists and intellectuals in Bangladesh in recent years. Nearly 30 people were killed in July 2016 when militants stormed a Dhaka cafe and took hostages in an attack claimed by Isis, the worst terrorist attack in the country’s history. Top government officials including the prime minister, Sheikh Hasina, have denied that the militants had any direct connection to Isis and claim neither it nor al-Qaida has a significant presence in Bangladesh. Analysts say the Muslim-majority country of 160 million people has seen an upsurge in jihadist activity in the past five years, blaming factors including the expansion of conservative Islamic institutions funded by Gulf donors and a bulging population of young men without fruitful employment or education prospects. Policymakers have also been accused of indulging hardline Muslim sentiment for political gain, including by suggesting some victims of machete attacks had been “insulting Islam”. Police have been conducting regular raids against alleged autonomous Islamist cells and militants in the 18 months since the Dhaka cafe attack. The head of the country’s counter-terrorism unit, Monirul Islam, claimed recently the country’s terrorist network had been largely eliminated.

In a statement that delighted campaigners opposed to fossil fuels, the Bank used a conference in Paris to announce that it “will no longer finance upstream oil and gas” after 2019. The Bank ceased lending for coal-fired power stations in 2010 but has been under pressure from lobby groups also to halt the $1bn (£750m) a year it has been lending for oil and gas in developing countries. The Bank said it saw the need to change the way it was operating in a “rapidly changing world”, adding that it was on course to have 28% of its lending going to climate action by 2020. At present, 1-2% of the Bank’s $280bn portfolio is accounted for by oil and gas projects. In exceptional circumstances, the Bank said it would consider lending for oil and gas projects in the very poorest countries but only where it helped the poor get access to energy and the project did not conflict with commitments to reduce greenhouse gases made in the 2015 Paris climate change accord. The announcement was made at the One Planet Summit, convened by the French president, Emmanuel Macron, the World Bank president, Yim Yong Kim, and the UN secretary general, António Guterres, to mark the two-year anniversary of the agreement. The Greenpeace International climate campaigner Gyorgy Dallos said: “The end is clearly coming for the oil and gas industry as the pace of change accelerates.” Dallos said the Bank had sent a damning vote of no confidence in the future of the fossil fuel industry. “The world’s financial institutions now need to take note and decide whether their financing is going to be part of the problem or the solution,” he said. Stephen Kretzmann, an executive director of the Washington-based advocacy group Oil Change International, said: “It is hard to overstate the significance of this historic announcement by the World Bank. “Environmental, human rights, and development campaigners have been amplifying the voices of frontline communities for decades in calling for an end to World Bank financing of upstream oil and gas projects. [Now] the World Bank has raised the bar for climate leadership by recognising the simple yet inconvenient truth that achieving the Paris agreement’s climate goals requires an end to the expansion of the fossil fuel industry. It is time for all of the institutions, countries, investors and individuals who are still in the Paris agreement to stop funding fossils – once and for all.” The World Bank announcement came as the Bank of England’s governor revealed that there was growing global support for a new initiative designed to help pave the way for a low-carbon economy by persuading companies to come clean about their exposure to climate change risks. Speaking at the Paris summit, Carney said 237 companies with a combined market capitalisation of $6.3tn (£4.7tn) were now backing the scheme. Britain’s six leading banks – Lloyds, Barclays, HSBC, Royal Bank of Scotland, Santander and Standard Chartered – have all supported the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures, set up by Carney in his role as chairman of the Financial Stability Board, an international body charged with preventing a repeat of the 2008 banking crisis. Under the plan, companies pledge to use their financial reports to disclose their direct and indirect exposure to global warming under a range of different scenarios. Banks are obliged to say how much they have lent to companies with climate-related risks. Carney said 20 of the 30 globally systemically important banks and eight out of 10 of the largest asset managers and leading insurance companies were committed to informing investors. Leading construction, consumer goods, transport, mining and energy companies have also signed up. “Markets need the right information to seize the opportunities and mitigate the risks that are being created by the transition to a low-carbon economy,” Carney said. “This solution, of the market and for the market, is truly entering the mainstream.” UK sources said that London was becoming a hub for climate change-related finance, with green bonds issued in more than 40 different currencies, including the Indian rupee and the Chinese yuan. Michael Bloomberg, the chair of the taskforce, said: “Climate change poses both economic risks and opportunities. But right now, companies don’t have the data they need to accurately measure the risks and evaluate the opportunities.” •The article was amended on Thursday 14 December to better reflect the World’s Bank’s decision to end financial support for both exploration and extraction. • Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/blog/2017/dec/12/talking-horses-hoping-that-fiery-tearaway-yorkhill-follows-gold-trail","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-12T09:32:12Z","webTitle":"Talking Horses: Hoping that fiery tearaway Yorkhill follows Gold trail","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2017/dec/12/talking-horses-hoping-that-fiery-tearaway-yorkhill-follows-gold-trail","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/blog/2017/dec/12/talking-horses-hoping-that-fiery-tearaway-yorkhill-follows-gold-trail","fields":{"headline":"Talking Horses: Hoping that fiery tearaway Yorkhill follows Gold trail","bodyText":"Today’s best bets, by Chris Cook Those of us who want to see Yorkhill in a Gold Cup got some encouragement from an Irish Times piece yesterday, predicting he may make his return to action at Leopardstown over Christmas in the race formerly known as the Lexus (or the Ericsson if you go back a bit further). “Leopardstown at Christmas looks a good possibility,” Willie Mullins was quoted as saying. Now, there is no excuse for getting carried away with what Mullins has to say about long-term targets. He doesn’t make decisions until he has to and reserves the right to change his mind at the last minute, as we are all aware. I’m certainly not going to place any actual bets on the strength of this latest scrap of news. But I’ll take it as encouraging news that the trainer is facing in the right direction and is not seriously thinking about returning his hot-headed chestnut to hurdles. This wimpish course of action was being touted as a live possibility after Yorkhill got himself beat at Fairyhouse in April but that right-handed track was all against him. Just keep him turning left and he can still be a world-beater over fences. Even on a left-handed track, he’s still a bit of a loon, of course. He’s a tearaway whose talent is hard to contain. Can you imagine if him and Might Bite both ended up in the Gold Cup? We’d need an equine psychiatrist on the panel at every Festival preview night. I’m worrying again, looking at his form and noticing how Mullins hasn’t once tried him at three miles. It’s only a couple of years since I was wishing this same trainer would tilt at the Gold Cup with another of his JLT winners but that didn’t end particularly well. On the other hand, Yorkhill’s pedigree is rather more suggestive of stamina than was Vautour’s. Yorkhill is by Presenting (sire of Denman, War Of Attrition and On His Own) and out of a half-sister to The Listener. Really, it’s amazing he’s done what he has at distances short of three miles. To business. The betting market for the last at Lingfield is all about Entertaining Ben and Don’t Blame Me, having seemingly failed to notice that both are front-runners who might detonate each others’ chances with a pace battle. Let’s add Shackled N Drawn into that mix, since he can take a fierce hold and now wears blinkers for the first time. All is set fair for a proper burn-up, so what we want is something that can cruise along behind and then pick up the pieces when those three have done each other in. I’m looking at you, Red Invader (3.15), not least because you’ve won on your last two trips to Lingfield and have now dropped back to the same mark you had for the most recent of those. The 12-1 looks pretty good. I also like the 3-1 about Kyllachy Gala (1.35), a Marco Botti production who has yet to win since joining him from Italy last winter. His best effort was his only previous attempt over this course and distance, back in January, when he was beaten a head off a mark 9lb higher than the one he has today. I saw renewed promise in his Wolverhampton effort last time, when he stayed on into fourth after trouble in running on only his second start after being gelded. This might be where we see the best of him. The meeting Wolverhampton was cancelled just before 10.30am. The track is raceable, but other areas of the course were too icy to allow racing to go ahead.

The warning came as an explosion at a key European gas hub in Austria and disruption to supplies in Norway pushed gas prices to multi-year highs. The price of unleaded could climb to 123.76p a litre and diesel to 126.21p a litre, the highest since November 2014, the RAC said. “An increase of up to 3p a litre is very bad news for motorists,” said a spokesman for the RAC. “This closure will inevitably lead to an unwelcome increase in the price with the knock-on effect of raising the wholesale cost of both fuels.” The closure of the Forties pipeline, after a crack was found in a section of pipe in Aberdeenshire, was followed by an explosion on Tuesday morning at Austria’s Baumgarten gas hub, which killed one person and led Italy to declare a state of emergency over energy supply fears. Meanwhile, Norway’s Statoil said it was reducing gas flows from Troll, Europe’s biggest offshore gas field, adding upward pressure to gas prices. They had already climbed after the UK firm Ineos on Monday announced a weeks-long closure of the North Sea’s Forties pipeline. The UK government warned the oil industry against using the Forties pipeline closure to justify putting up fuel prices. A Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy spokesperson said: “This incident should not have a significant impact on global oil supplies. It is important the oil industry does not use this short-term challenge as an excuse to put up the prices of fuel at the pump.” The spokesperson added that “short-term spikes in the cost of gas will have a negligible effect on [energy] bills in the future”. The market intelligence firm ICIS said the incidents, combined with high demand because of cold temperatures, had created a “perfect storm” for rising prices. The price of a barrel of Brent crude has risen to $65.56, a level not seen since the summer of 2015. In the past fortnight, it has been in the $62-$64 range after Opec and Russia agreed to extend production curbs. UK wholesale gas prices for the day ahead leapt to 90p a therm, a height last reached during a cold snap in 2013. The UK government said there were no concerns over security of supply, but industry watchers said the supply disruptions would filter down to consumers. Jonathan Leitch, a research director at the oil analysts Wood Mackenzie, said: “The knock-on effect, because we’ve taken some supply out of the market, that means outright prices go up, which should mean the consumer pays more at the pump for petrol and diesel.” Ineos said it should know within days if repairs to a crack in the pipeline, which carries 40% of UK oil and gas, would take a fortnight or up to three weeks. “If it is more than three weeks, obviously the impact becomes deeper,” said Leitch. The incidents across Europe will not immediately lead to higher gas bills for households, experts said, but could filter through to worse tariffs in the new year as energy suppliers seek to recoup their costs. “You shouldn’t see a short-term impact [on consumer gas bills],” said Mike Mahoney, associate director at the analysts Cornwall Insight. However, he said the Austrian gas hub outage could see central Europe competing for Norway’s gas supplies in the new year, pushing up UK gas prices in turn. Norway is the biggest supplier of the 60% of gas that Britain imports. Mahoney said that security of supply was not an issue but the pipeline shutdown had highlighted the UK’s exposure to price swings after the country’s biggest gas storage site, Rough, closed earlier this year. “While it’s positive we’ve been able to cover our gas demand on a cold, very high demand day, it shows there’s not a lot of room to manoeuvre when you have a supply disruption. Prices are going to jump significantly,” he said. A government spokesperson said: “There is no security of supply issue for fuel or gas supplies as a result of the repairs needed to the Forties pipeline.” Richard Harrington, the energy minister, spoke to Ineos on Tuesday morning. In Italy, gas prices doubled after the fire at Baumgarten, which is a key hub for Russian gas imports to Europe. Gas from Algeria and shipped liquified natural gas were expected to make up Italy’s shortfalls, but Italy’s industry minister, Carlo Calenda, said the incident showed Italy had “a serious supply problem”. Calenda said his country would not have had to declare a state of emergency if a new gas pipeline bringing supplies from the Caspian sea had been ready. The European Investment Bank’s board was poised on Tuesday to approve a €1.5bn loan to help the Trans Adriatric Pipeline through its final, capital-intensive construction phase.

The remarks by Woody Johnson to the BBC’s Today programme represent the first official confirmation that the president is expected to visit in early 2018, when Trump may formally open the new American embassy. A formal state visit – which would include a meeting with the Queen – is not envisaged. The Queen is likely to be preoccupied with preparations for a Commonwealth summit next year. Johnson told the BBC the disagreement over Trump’s sharing of videos posted by the far-right group Britain First was “probably misinterpreted”. The ambassador was being interviewed about the US embassy’s move from its current UK headquarters in Grosvenor Square in central London to a new £800m complex in Battersea, south of the river Thames. Johnson said the new embassy would need to be dedicated by an American president. May said Trump had been “wrong” to share videos posted by Britain First, prompting the president to tell the prime minister to focus on her job. Johnson, a close friend of the president, said Trump’s relationship with the UK was “very, very good”. The president had not yet set a date for the possible visit, he added. Johnson said of Trump: “He understands the special relationship and while there may be disagreements about the way he says something or how he does something you can rest assured security and prosperity are very important.” Asked about the Britain First tweet, he said: “The way I would look at [it] and the way he would look at it is that security is the number one oath protecting Americans here and in the US. ... If you look at it in that context that is what [he is] trying to do.” Claiming Trump had not really changed in the 35 years of their relationship, he said it was not widely known that Trump “will canvass opinions from 50 people, and he will look at you, listen to you, will give you feedback on your opinion, and actually if he agrees with you, he will use your opinion. He listens to advice and to people around him, but he is going to make his own decisions”. The UK government has found itself in a series of disagreements with Trump over climate change, the Iranian nuclear deal and the imposition of tariffs on the plane and train manufacturer Bombardier. Harold Wilson’s falling out with President Lyndon Johnson over Vietnam was probably the last time there has been as big a wedge between the two countries. In June, Trump criticised the London mayor, Sadiq Khan, for his response to the London Bridge terror attack, misquoting Khan’s message to Londoners not to be alarmed by the increased presence of armed police. “There may be disagreements of how [Mr Trump] says something, or how he does something,” Johnson said. “He wants to protect Americans. He is not going to be namby-pamby about it. I mean, he is going to come out. He is probably going to take some chances and maybe he will ruffle feathers.” The ambassador insisted the security alignment between the two countries remained intact. Speaking of May’s visit to the Oval Office in January, Johnson said: “The prime minister was his first visitor, the first official foreign leader to visit.” In a sign of the determination of the US and UK security establishments to continue to work closely together, the US national security adviser HR McMaster told an audience in Washington on Tuesday: “We work with the UK as if they are an extension of our team,” adding, “I am confident that our relationship remains as strong as ever.” He was speaking at an event organised by the thinktank Policy Exchange, alongside his UK counterpart Mark Seawall, who also brushed aside the disruptions caused by Trump. Seawall said: “We aim to remain your indispensable ally … We have a had a global order that has been underwritten by the US – that will continue to be the case, I’m sure, in the 21st century.” Trump has previously told May that he did not want to come on a state visit if there were large-scale protests, but the chances of such protests not going ahead during any visit are minimal. The House of Commons Speaker, John Bercow, has said the president would not be welcome to speak to both houses of parliament, an honour typically given to prestigious overseas politicians. Huge security preparations would be needed to ensure the visit is not disrupted. UK diplomats privately acknowledge that a state visit offered by May seven days after his inauguration was premature, believing the UK government was yet to understand the extent to which the current occupant of the White House marks a break from all previous Republican presidents. The former UK ambassador to Washington, Sir Christopher Meyer, said many Americans, including those had not voted for Trump, would be offended if the invitation was withdrawn. He said: “The government is right to say the invitation is on the table,” but he added the visit would be highly circumscribed due to the security risk, posed by “enormous demonstrations and public disorder”. He said: “It may be so scaled down the public will hardly see him and it will barely justify being called a state visit.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/dec/15/adani-group-fraud-allegations-india-delhi-high-court-lawsuit","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-15T00:51:43Z","webTitle":"Delhi high court takes up lawsuit into Adani Group fraud allegations","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/dec/15/adani-group-fraud-allegations-india-delhi-high-court-lawsuit","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/dec/15/adani-group-fraud-allegations-india-delhi-high-court-lawsuit","fields":{"headline":"Delhi high court takes up lawsuit into Adani Group fraud allegations","bodyText":"Delhi’s high court has taken up a lawsuit calling for an investigation into allegations that Adani Group and other energy companies engaged in fraud that raised power prices for Indian consumers. The court has ordered the Indian government and Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) to respond before 7 February to the lawsuit, which claims that several mining groups inflated coal and equipment prices to siphon money from India. Among them is Adani, an Indian conglomerate preparing to build one of the world’s largest coal mines in Australia. Pranav Sachdeva, a lawyer involved in proceedings, said the court’s orders indicated it had examined the public-interest lawsuit and found it “worthy of admission” and further examination. India has a robust system of public-interest litigation that allows citizens or the court to raise issues and seek judicial intervention. The lawsuit was filed in September. In August, a Guardian investigation revealed details of fraud allegations against Adani totalling nearly 15bn rupees (£174m/AU$305m). According to Indian customs intelligence documents from 2014, the company was accused of inflating the cost of electricity equipment for two power projects in Maharashtra state using fraudulent invoices. Adani has denied wrongdoing and was reportedly cleared of the allegations in October. It was cleared of another set of fraud claims totalling 39bn rupees in August. Senior customs officials have ordered an appeal against the latter and will review the October decision. The public-interest lawsuit is asking the high court to order a “thorough” investigation into over-invoicing allegations. The writ alleges that Adani, the Indian conglomerate Essar, and several other companies inflated the price of power equipment and coal “in order to cheat the people and to siphon off funds from public companies”. Subsidiaries of Essar and Adani are among 40 companies that have been accused of using front organisations to increase the price of coal they mined from Indonesia. The total value of the alleged scam has been estimated at 290bn rupees. If the allegations are true, the price inflation would have allowed the companies to move money from their Indian balance sheets into overseas accounts, where the funds would be harder to tax or account for. It would also have led to higher power prices for Indians. Congress, India’s largest opposition party, has called for the supreme court to investigate allegations of invoice inflation against Adani. There have been calls in Australia for Adani to be denied a $700m loan to build a railway link between the proposed coalmine and a port on the Queensland coast. The loan has been blocked by the Queensland government, but Adani said on Tuesday that the project was still viable and it would “adjust to the constraints”. The proposed mine has caused years of lawsuits and protests over its possible environmental impact. Expanding the coal port to accommodate the mine would require dredging an estimated 1.1m cubic metres of spoil near the Great Barrier Reef marine park. Coal from the mine would also produce annual emissions roughly equivalent to those of Malaysia or Austria, according to a study. Adani did not respond to requests for comment, but has previously said it observes the highest forms of corporate governance and the lawsuit was part of a “mindless, unsubstantiated witch-hunt”. A spokesman for Essar has previously said it strongly and categorically denies the allegation."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2017/dec/12/swinging-safari-review-kylie-minogue-and-guy-pearce-in-outrageous-ode-to-70s-australia","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-12T17:00:03Z","webTitle":"Swinging Safari review – Kylie Minogue and Guy Pearce in outrageous ode to 70s Australia","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/dec/12/swinging-safari-review-kylie-minogue-and-guy-pearce-in-outrageous-ode-to-70s-australia","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2017/dec/12/swinging-safari-review-kylie-minogue-and-guy-pearce-in-outrageous-ode-to-70s-australia","fields":{"headline":"Swinging Safari review – Kylie Minogue and Guy Pearce in outrageous ode to 70s Australia","bodyText":"If you watched the gloriously ‘Strayan trailer for the writer/director Stephan Elliott’s Swinging Safari, you might have assumed all the kooky bits were plucked out to make an outrageously cockeyed, slaphappy promo. I can assure you the actual film is 10 times as batshit crazy as the marketing materials suggest. It is also a fabulously sly, cynical and cheeky coming-of-age story, comparable to the film-maker’s two rolled gold and beer-battered comedy classics: the immortal The Adventures of Priscilla: Queen of the Desert and underrated Welcome to Woop Woop. Swinging Safari is set in a satirical, whitebread Australian yesteryear, circa Sydney in the 1970s. Or as narrator Richard Roxburgh puts it: “A decade with too much time, too much money and too much cask wine.” The audience are whisked into a suburban cul-de-sac, which would be quiet and peaceful were it not for the many graceless dingbats who inhabit it. The introductory, densely narrated tour-of-location reminded me of the excellent Andrew Denton-narrated 1990 short film Union Street, directed by Wendy Chandler – except smothered in meat grease, drenched in vodka and set on fire. Fourteen-year-old protagonist Jeff (a fine film debut from Atticus Robb) is an aspiring film-maker armed with an 8mm camera; clearly a semi-autobiographical version of Elliott. The story unfolds from his perspective but screen time is spread more or less evenly between three families. Top billing, star-wise, belongs to the Hall family: Guy Pearce as Keith, sells encyclopaedias for a crust and his mother, Kaye (Kylie Minogue), is an alcoholic agoraphobic. A good old fashioned neighbourhood key party takes place – with the kids upstairs, after rissoles for dinner – between the Halls, Jo and Rick Jones (Radha Mitchell and Julian McMahon) and Gale and Bob Marsh (Asher Keddie and Jeremy Sims). The various shenanigans that consume the three sets of parents and their kids take place after a 200-tonne blue whale washes up on the local beach. This perhaps symbolises a lost and purposeless generation: at the very least, a lost and purposeless local community. Like the short films of stop-motion animator Adam Elliot, and his terrific 2009 feature Mary and Max, Elliott weaves a network of characters whose raucous and/or idiosyncratic behaviour is comedic scaffolding, covering up desperately sad lives. “We were the first generation to wear full synthetic fabrics. We were also the last,” the narrator reflects, name-dropping Swinging Safari’s original title: Flammable Children. That title better reflects Elliott’s delirious, decorum-destroying approach to comedy, where nothing is sacred – least of all our national identity. Presumably the producers had an issue with a title that summons images of minors set on fire. The writer/director, gawd love him, clearly did not. In Elliott’s hands the image of a beach umbrella does not merely evoke sun, sand, surf and the weekends of yesteryear; it is a weapon for sight gags, to wave around like a maniac. When Sims chases an umbrella down the beach as it is carried away by the wind, vision of it reflected in sunglasses of beach bums watching; the journey of the renegade brolly ends when it pierces a teenager, the pointy end delving deep into the poor kid’s gut. In this moment much of Elliott’s sensibility exists. More than any other director of film comedies, he is able to celebrate Aussie culture while driving a stake (or umbrella) right into the heart of it. Visions of nostalgic Australia, most pronounced in the beach scenes, present the past as it is remembered rather than in realistic recreation, but with the opposite of rose-tinted glasses: blood red goggles, perhaps, to penetrate the mist of our memories. The Swinging Safari cast is bonza, to use the sort of parlance preferred by the characters, though Kylie Minogue has little to say or do: a timid, mousy, largely intangible performance – perhaps in part a result of the large number of primary roles. The crew reunites much of the team from Priscilla, including producer Al Clark, costume designer Lizzy Gardiner, production designer Colin Gibson (who recently won an Oscar for Mad Max: Fury Road) composer Guy Gross and editor Sue Blainey. Blainey, along with two co-editors – Laurie Hughes and Annette Davey – bring a hell-for-leather rhythm, chopping the film up as if they were attacking a watermelon with a cleaver, bits of pulp flying everywhere. The lickety-split energy might have been overkill if Elliott wasn’t constantly making connections – many of them satirical, and most about human shortcoming in one form or another. Australians will appreciate Swinging Safari’s ability to simultaneously celebrate and denigrate, encouraged to laugh at themselves: the cinema of They’re a Weird Mob, without the antipodean perspective, or any semblance of civility.

The peak film and TV body announced the development of the code as industry professionals convened in Sydney to address systemic sexual harassment and abuse in the Australian screen industry. The forum was also positioned as a local response to the #metoo movement that has swept across the world after allegations of systemic sexual harassment and assault were levelled against film producer Harvey Weinstein. Participants in the forum, spearheaded by Women in Film and Television NSW, told story after story of coming up against social and structural roadblocks in addressing sexual harassment, and expressed concerns about the difficulty of widespread, long-term cultural change. Audience members recounted losing work, education opportunities and their livelihoods after making complaints of sexual harassment, particularly against people in a position of power. Announcing the code in her opening address, the chief operating officer of Screen Australia, Fiona Cameron, reflected on the “devastating” past two months of revelations. The code would set out the rights and responsibilities of employees and employers, and would be widely available in a format that could be easily read, understood and put into practice, Cameron said. She said she hoped government funding for screen projects would eventually be available only to those workplaces that “proactively” dealt with discrimination, harassment and abuse. “Power, influence and bad behaviour unchecked all result in the culture we now stare down,” she said. “The culture of the alpha male, the protected alpha male, who is revered on the big and small screen and behind the screen and whose actions are beyond reproach, beyond repudiation and beyond badly behaved – for people in the know, this is how it has been forever ... We have a once-in-a-generation opportunity to make a difference.” The director of the For Film’s Sake festival, Sophie Mathisen, said she felt there was frustration about the panellists’ focus on the need for “change from the top”. “I think this is crucial, but incredibly difficult to enact in the screen industries as it’s industrially segregated with many different ‘tops’,” Mathisen told Guardian Australia. “We need to understand how these behaviours have been perpetrated over many decades.” She said the discussion in the forum of the National Rugby League as an example of an industry that had facilitated positive change towards women in response to sexual harassment cases was problematic because in that case there had been a lack of female input. “Such an example highlights the industrial root to the cultural problem of sexual harassment. As with the NRL, the problem is with teams of men setting the cultural parameters for their own behaviour without female input. What we know is that the film industry does in fact exist much like football – teams of men working almost exclusively with other men, and therein lies the issue. How do you encourage gender equity?” Panellists devoted much time to clarifying the rights of victims of sexual harassment under the law, both at work and in work-adjacent contexts, such as auditions and industry pitch sessions. The sex discrimination commissioner, Kate Jenkins, addressed the forum via videolink, acknowledging the negative career impacts that victims of sexual harassment face if they speak up about their experiences. This pressure often came from internal hierarchies, she said. “You don’t need to be Harvey Weinstein to slow someone’s career, you just need to be a manager,” Jenkins said. The Human Rights Commission would be collecting data on sexual harassment in workplaces, the forum heard. Discussions also took in the broader context of bullying in the workplace. Zoe Angus from the Media, Entertainment and Arts Alliance said 62% of actors and technicians working in Australian performing arts had experienced bullying, and comparable numbers had witnessed it. More robust structures were needed around harassment and consent that did not focus only on performing artists in particular circumstances, Angus said. “Consent and boundaries needs to be part of the conversation at the beginning, not just related to sex scenes and nudity but rather the full gamut of physical behaviour.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/dec/12/feeling-powerless-to-stop-a-sexual-encounter-cat-person-is-familiar-to-many-women","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-12T03:56:35Z","webTitle":"Cat Person is familiar to women who feel powerless to stop a sexual encounter | Matilda Dixon-Smith","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/12/feeling-powerless-to-stop-a-sexual-encounter-cat-person-is-familiar-to-many-women","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/12/feeling-powerless-to-stop-a-sexual-encounter-cat-person-is-familiar-to-many-women","fields":{"headline":"Cat Person is familiar to women who feel powerless to stop a sexual encounter","bodyText":"Something rare and fascinating happened: a short story published in The New Yorker on Monday, Cat Person by Kristen Roupenian, became a top trending topic on Twitter. The story about a sour romantic encounter between a 20-year-old woman and a 34-year-old man has gone viral – capturing the minds of a flood of (mostly female) readers who find the piece “remarkable” and “relatable”. I can’t think of the last time a short story in a lit mag went anywhere near viral online – let alone one by a female writer. And although the response has been overwhelmingly positive, the inevitable backlash – about the quality of the writing, the likeability of the characters, and what some have perceived as Roupenian’s fat-phobia due to frequent scathing mentions of a character’s weight – have begun as well. Whether you loved Cat Person or loathed it, there’s no denying that there’s something there worth investigating. While I wouldn’t call Roupenian’s writing exactly striking, what she’s hit on is an experience that many straight women consider to be hidden but universal: bad and regrettable sex with a male partner. The women connecting with Cat Person consider the piece revelatory for illuminating an encounter that many of us have had, but which few of us actually discuss. Or so people online are lamenting as they share the piece to encourage the discussion. For me, the most fascinating thing about the rabid response to Cat Person is how much it reminds me of a very similar discussion we had online five years ago, when Lena Dunham’s Girls premiered its season two episode “On All Fours”. In “On All Fours”, Girls – already famous for bad and discomfiting sex scenes after just two short seasons – depicts a rather unpleasant sexual encounter between Adam (Adam Driver) and his girlfriend Natalia (UnREAL’s Shiri Appleby). After a respectful encounter earlier in the episode, where Natalia clearly sets her boundaries, when she and Adam have sex again he asks her to crawl toward him on all fours, tells her he wants to “fuck you from behind, hit the walls with you”, then ejaculates on her body despite her protesting, “No no, no, no, not on my dress!”. Once it’s done, Natalia says to Adam, “I don’t think I like that. I, like, really didn’t like that”. The episode, like many chapters of Girls in its seven-year run, drew a great deal of controversy from viewers and critics who wondered, “Was that a rape scene in Girls?”. “Did Girls just visually assault us?” asked The Hollywood Reporter, and soon other outlets were weighing in on an interesting but short-lived discussion about the line between “bad sex” and assault, and the limited capacity of verbal consent. Bad sex is not something that’s discussed very often at all. I’m not talking about sex that is just unpleasant or unsatisfying, but sex that is … awkward, upsetting or discomfiting. The kind of sex that, once it’s done, you wish you hadn’t done it, because now you can’t stop feeling, well, bad about it. This is the kind of sex Dunham was exploring in “On All Fours”, the kind Roupenian has described in Cat Person; no one has broken the law, no one has violated your consent, but still, you feel bad. And this kind of sex is worth exploring, worth discussing at trending volumes on Twitter, worth reading about and thinking about in a New Yorker short story your old high school classmate shared on Facebook – especially now. And maybe that’s what makes Cat Person so intriguing to so many readers: the context. We’re deep in our post-Weinstein moment, and we’ve pulled back the curtain on some of the insidious power discrepancies that were once hidden in the so-called privacy of a sexual encounters. So much of sex is about power, and in Cat Person Roupenian sketches a scenario familiar to many women: one where they feel powerless to stop a sexual encounter. Those who have connected to Roupenian’s story have done so because they relate to an encounter when allowing sex to continue feels less complicated than stopping it. If sex is a negotiation of power – and in many ways it is, especially when it’s with a new partner – women are often disadvantaged by the limits of verbal consent, and by the notion that they must accommodate and appreciate all male expressions of desire. It’s interesting but not entirely surprising that so few champions of Roupenian’s story are men. What women are reading as relatable in the story – a scenario where sex happens although it is not entirely desired – men have seldom experienced. In fact, the intense response to Roupenian’s story seems to mimic the overwhelming #MeToo movement, though on a much smaller scale. Here we have women joining a chorus of voices relaying similar (but hidden) experiences, while men stand on the outside, confounded, looking in at what they have wrought. After Weinstein, after #MeToo, it’s imperative we examine the minutiae of sexual encounters, because it’s the only way we’ll redefine positive and participatory sex, where consent is enthusiastic and fluid between partners, and no one feels bad afterwards. As a literary critic I can’t speak to the power of Roupenian’s prose, which flattens out a potentially lively experience and renders it almost wilfully dull. But as a cultural critic, I can understand the furore. It’s the right time for Cat Person, a story that has tapped the vein of a palpable cultural moment. • Matilda Dixon-Smith is a writer and editor in Melbourne"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/dec/12/indigenous-voice-malcolm-turnbull-remarks-anger","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-12T02:53:48Z","webTitle":"'Elaborately dishonest': Turnbull remarks on Indigenous voice to parliament cause anger","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/dec/12/indigenous-voice-malcolm-turnbull-remarks-anger","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/dec/12/indigenous-voice-malcolm-turnbull-remarks-anger","fields":{"headline":"'Elaborately dishonest': Turnbull remarks on Indigenous voice to parliament cause anger","bodyText":"Malcolm Turnbull was disrespectful, dismissive, and “elaborately dishonest” about Indigenous recognition during Monday’s Q&amp;A appearance, a range of critics have said. Turnbull was combative during his solo appearance on the ABC’s penultimate Q&amp;A episode for the year, particularly when questioned about why he rejected the voice to parliament proposal put forward by the Referendum Council and the Uluru conference. Audience member Teela Reid, a Wiradjuri &amp; Wailwan woman and lawyer who was part of the constitutional dialogue process, said the government gave Indigenous people the opportunity to tell it what they thought meaningful recognition was. “We rejected symbolism and reached a national consensus for a representative First Nations voice to advise parliament on the issues that affect our lives,” Reid said. “Not a third chamber and not an advisory council handpicked by you, and not even those MPs that are in parliament currently.” In response Turnbull said: “I can tell you it would effectively be a third chamber, let me explain why.” He described a hypothetical assembly elected by Indigenous people which advised the parliament on laws affecting Indigenous people. “That would mean that that assembly would have the right, if it so chose, to examine every piece of legislation, it would be in effect a third chamber.” Reid said Turnbull was undermining democracy and Australia needed a leader “with courage”. “In his dismissal of the Uluru statement, [the prime minister] clearly showed no respect to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people who participated in those significant dialogues.” Former members of the Referendum Council have repeatedly rejected the claim that it recommended a third chamber and maintained it deliberately left the detail of its operation up to parliament to determine. The response to Turnbull’s comments on social media was blistering. On Tuesday morning Bill Shorten said he was shocked by Turnbull’s responses to Reid. “The total disrespect and dismissal of the legitimate aspirations of our First Australians. Turnbull would do well to lecture a lot less, and listen a lot more,” the opposition leader said. Professor Megan Davis, a constitutional law expert and member of the disbanded Referendum Council, accused Turnbull of “bluster” and being “elaborately dishonest” in suggesting the voice would have veto power and would examine every piece of legislation. Under the council’s recommendations, the voice would consider only those laws under the two constitutional powers regarding race and territories. The functions of the voice to parliament would be determined by parliament, Davis said. “It’s a major feature of the reform; the decision to defer detail to the parliamentarians. The contours of the voice rests with them.” Thomas Mayor, co-chair of the Uluru working group and secretary of the NT Maritime Union of Australia, accused Turnbull of being arrogant and a “whitesplainer”. “He doesn’t want a voice because he doesn’t like collectives of grassroots people,” Mayor tweeted. Shireen Morris, a senior adviser and constitutional reform research fellow at Cape York Institute, accused Turnbull of being divisive. She tweeted: “Turnbull trying to divide &amp; conquer unsuccessfully – suggesting words like “token” which [Reid] didn’t say – he did. Trying to create a wedge, but can’t: Uluru is a consensus First Nations position.” Nigel Browne, the chief executive of the Larrakia development corporation and recently appointed member of the federal government’s Indigenous reference group on northern development, said the proposal “never was a third chamber”. Former senator Nova Peris said Turnbull was “painfully condescending”. On Q&amp;A Turnbull accused Reid of placing “little store” by Indigenous members of parliament such as Ken Wyatt and Linda Burney, suggesting she was dismissing them as “tokens”, which Reid denied. “They’ve both got political positions to make in parliament,” Reid said. Tweeting after the show, Reid said she had the utmost respect for Indigenous MPs, “but the PM knows they do not represent the interests of First Nations Australians. He should also know it is his task to ‘lead’ on formulating a model of the [First Nations] voice to parliament! The proposal is not a veto on all laws.” Turnbull dismissed polling, cited by Reid, which showed majority public support for the proposed voice. “If it were put up in a referendum it would go down in flames. That’s my view,” he said. The council’s final report called for a “representative body” to give First Australians “a voice to parliament”. “No one has suggested there be an attempt to enshrine in the constitution provisions of the kind more appropriately left to parliament,” it said. “Legislation of the parliament would deal with how the body is to be given an appropriately representative character and how it can properly and most usefully discharge its advisory functions. It is not suggested that the body should have any kind of veto power.” The proposal was recently endorsed by a United Nations committee on the elimination of racial discrimination. The council’s report contradicted claims the proposal came out of nowhere, saying it had notified the prime minister and opposition leader in April 2016 of its inclusion as an extra option to consider. Last month Noel Pearson accused Turnbull of “lying” about his rejection of the proposal because he had previously supported it."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/dec/12/tuesday-briefing-pressure-on-corbyn-to-declare-for-single-market","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-12T06:30:14Z","webTitle":"Tuesday briefing: Pressure on Corbyn to declare for single market","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/dec/12/tuesday-briefing-pressure-on-corbyn-to-declare-for-single-market","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/dec/12/tuesday-briefing-pressure-on-corbyn-to-declare-for-single-market","fields":{"headline":"Tuesday briefing: Pressure on Corbyn to declare for single market","bodyText":"Top story: Is Labour keeping Brexit powder too dry? Hello, I’m Warren Murray, here is the news on a need-to-know basis. Jeremy Corbyn is under pressure from some quarters within Labour to more strongly advocate the softest possible Brexit, as talks move ahead and public debate turns to the nature of the final deal. Corbyn has held back on what kind of settlement the party would ultimately support – aiming to keep both remainers and leavers in the party’s constituencies on side. But Alison McGovern, the MP for Wirral South and a founder of the Labour Campaign for the Single Market, said: “Protecting jobs, rights and fighting austerity is Labour’s mission and it’s best achieved by staying in the single market and the customs union. I think we get a lot of support for saying so.” The party’s Brexit spokesman, Keir Starmer, has said Labour could accept “easy movement” of EU citizens in exchange for free trade, while the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, has said the UK could remain part of a “reformed single market”. Meanwhile a wide-ranging study by the US-based Rand Corporation estimates a no-deal Brexit would cost Britons £1,585 each. Even the softest option of remaining in the customs union would be damaging to the economy; and any gains from leaving the EU would take at least 12 years to kick in. * * * New York bombing – The suspect in a failed suicide bombing on the subway in Manhattan has been named as Akayed Ullah, 27. The Bangladeshi immigrant was one of four people who sustained injuries that were not life-threatening when “an improvised low-tech explosive device” went off in a passageway near Times Square at 7.20am local time on Monday. “This was an attempted terrorist attack,” said the New York City mayor, Bill de Blasio. Ullah was arrested and treated in hospital for burns from a device that was described as a crude pipe bomb. Armed police raided properties in Brooklyn connected to Ullah or relatives. The incident interrupted nearly every subway line and some trains were evacuated, though within hours almost completely normal service was resumed, with trains bypassing the Port Authority station where the explosion occurred. * * * ‘Hear the voices of Grenfell’ – There are calls to put victims at the centre of the Grenfell Tower fire inquiry as it gets under way in central London. Survivors and bereaved family members will deliver a petition to Downing Street today with more than 16,000 signatures demanding that Theresa May take action to increase their representation at the inquiry. At hearings to finalise the inquiry’s ground rules, Michael Mansfield QC, speaking on behalf of many bereaved families, used the words “a national atrocity” to describe the fire, which claimed 71 lives. The inquiry’s chair, retired judge Sir Martin Moore-Bick, originally aimed to produce an interim report by Easter but as things stand it appears the inquiry will not start taking evidence soon enough. * * * May adapts to political climate – Theresa May today begins an effort to burnish the Conservative party’s environmental credentials, describing tackling climate change as a global “moral imperative” and branding coal-fired power as “dirty and destructive”. May writes ahead of this week’s Paris summit on climate change that mitigating its effects for the world’s poorest is “amongst the most critical challenges the world faces”. We have seen this before – David Cameron had his wind turbine on the roof and his “hug a husky” Arctic jaunt, and he changed the Tory logo to a tree. But later, pressured by rightwingers, he banned expansion of onshore windfarms and reportedly told officials to “cut the green crap” from legislation. As May makes her Earth-friendly pitch, auditors have found the government might have wasted tens of millions of pounds by selling the Green Investment bank too cheaply and too soon. * * * Deadly fact of man-flu – Your writer has described himself at times as the “human petri dish” when it comes to sneezes and sniffles, and is feeling vindicated today to learn that man-flu might be an actual thing. Dr Kyle Sue, family medicine expert from the Memorial University of Newfoundland, writes in the British Medical Journal that men may have a greater risk of being hospitalised or dying from influenza. Testosterone might dampen the male immune response, while female hormones might boost it. And contrary to portrayals, women are more likely than men to be slowed down by minor respiratory illnesses. Sue suggests that dismissing the male half of the species as malingerers who exaggerate their symptoms, without evidence to support the accusation, is unscientific and “could have important implications for men, including insufficient provision of care”. So there. * * * Slipped paper crown of comedy – The “dad joke” would seem unfairly maligned if this year’s groansome “best” Christmas cracker gags are a comparable standard.

No wonder, then, that the global success and popularity of the dazzling Shen Yun dance show, spawned by the Falun Gong movement, is so infuriating for the leadership in Beijing. “Wherever Shen Yun goes, the Chinese government follows,” writes Nicholas Hune-Brown. From Ecuador to Berlin, Chinese embassies have written to theatres and councils, or sent envoys, to try to have performances shut down. There are claims of slashed tyres, tapped phones and break-ins against the troupe. Hune-Brown traces it all back to the 1990s, when a tai chi-style exercise fad grew into a quasi-spiritual phenomenon that the party continues to see as a threat to its grip on power and the story of China itself.

But for Bangladeshi Americans in the city, the attempted attack could have longer-term consequences than the injuries Ullah, 27, managed to inflict on himself and three other people in a Times Square subway station. Many people of Bangladeshi origin are already beset by poverty – the median wage is over $22,000 less than the city-wide average – and are struggling to take advantage of the American dream. Given Ullah was born in Bangladesh, some said the attack could heap more pain on the community, with many fearful of an increased police presence – and potentially deportations. Moinul Alam, the president of the Bangladeshi American Center of North America, a nonprofit organization based in Kensington, Brooklyn, said Ullah’s attempt was “a big concern – because I know for sure by my heart we don’t stand behind any of this stupidity”. He said he was already receiving calls from worried Bangladeshi Americans, both in Kensington and in communities in Queens. “One person did something terrible and the whole community has to suffer,” Alam said. “People are asking: ‘Are we going to have Ice [Immigration and Customs Enforcement] looking for somebody all the time?’” A spokesman for the Department of Homeland Security confirmed on Monday evening that Ullah had been admitted to the US in 2011 on an F43 family immigrant visa. “The suspect is a lawful permanent resident who benefited from extended family chain migration,” the spokesman said. Police said Ullah lived in Brooklyn, and public records showed that an A Ullah had been registered at an address in Kensington. On Monday afternoon police were investigating a different Kensington address reportedly linked to Ullah’s family. Witnesses said a Swat team had entered a six-storey building on the busy Ocean Parkway, and there was a heavy police presence – including a bomb squad vehicle – outside. The Kensington neighborhood is known as Little Bangladesh. The neighborhood has Bangladeshi restaurants, grocery stores and pharmacies. Alam’s organization is based in the neighborhood, and provides after school classes for children from pre-K to 12th grade, he said. It also helps women, in particular, to improve their English and navigate access to social services and advice on immigration matters. “It makes you worried because believe me the kids are working very hard and because very good things are happening in our community,” Alam said. “Most of the people are nice, believe me. It’s just we have to have more supervision, and good community work so our kids don’t get into the wrong impression.” The 2010 census showed there were 50,000 people of Bangladeshi origin living in New York City, an increase of more than 22,000 from 10 years earlier. The median household income for Bangladeshi Americans was $36,000 in 2010, compared to a figure of $50,711 across the city. More than 70% Bangladeshi Americans are foreign-born, according to the census, with the majority living in the borough of Queens, but significant populations in Brooklyn and the Bronx. On Monday afternoon Ullah’s attempted bombing was the only topic of discussion among Kensington’s Bangladeshi Americans. “This is not good for the image of the community. For the image of the country,” said Mohammed Islam, who was shopping at the Bangla Nagar supermarket. “We worry. Because of one guy we are all worried,” he said. “Maybe now the police arrest us for nothing. It is a problem.” Islam, 59, moved to New York City in 1985 and works in construction. He said he was proud to live in the US. “We are living peacefully, we can find a job. Maybe it’s not a good job, but it’s a job,” Islam said. “We enjoy living here. It is a thousand times better than our country.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"voluntary-sector-network/2017/dec/14/tampon-tax-fight-domestic-violence-money-grant-funding","type":"article","sectionId":"voluntary-sector-network","sectionName":"Voluntary Sector Network","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-14T07:06:25Z","webTitle":"Ending domestic violence is seen as a luxury.

Just like tampons","bodyText":"When George Osborne announced in 2015 that the £15m raised annually from the sale of menstrual products would be spent directly on charities that help women and girls, many expressed outrage. Fighting gender-based violence should be an issue for society as a whole, led by what victims and survivors need, and supported by the government. It’s not a cause for women to champion (and pay for) alone. But as a manager of a small charity focusing on gender-based violence, any funding stream with this mission is right up my street. Especially at a time when the austerity agenda has devastated us as a sector. The criteria seemed simple enough – to apply for this fund you must be delivering work in the violence against women and girls field, be innovative, fill gaps and support mental health and wellbeing. The Empower Project is a Scottish-based membership organisation established to drive community responses to gender-based violence in digital spaces. We grew out of a need to create spaces for young people to participate in these discussions. We wanted to hear what young people make of sex and relationships in the digital age, and learn how we could support positive sexuality, counteracting abuse and violence. We also wanted to move away from a purely judiciary response to issues around violence, and explore what community justice and prevention looks like. Nine of us work and volunteer on the project; we host discussion groups and deliver training on issues like revenge porn, sex and relationships in the digital age, and online forms of violence. So. We are innovative. We tackle violence against women and girls. We are doing work not found anywhere else in the country. We also support positive mental health. We should be perfect for the tampon tax fund. Apart from one problem. We need at least £2m turnover to apply. You read that right. In the 2017/18 guidance for applicants (pdf), the government has specified that applications should be for £1m or more, and that the value of the grant requested should not represent more than 50% of the organisation’s annual income. This is in stark contrast to the awards granted to 70 organisations in 2016/17, which ranged from £16,500 to Scottish charity Forth Valley Disability Sport, to £1m to Standing Together Against Domestic Violence. That year, £250,000 was also given to the anti-abortion Life Charity. The idea that expert organisations doing this work have anywhere near a £2m turnover is laughable. Women’s refuges have closed. Staff have been made redundant. Most funding streams barely cover project costs, let alone staff overheads. Our reserves are stretched. Pay has been cut in real terms. We do things for free, all of the time. We volunteer our skills, ideas and labour to keep services going because we know what will happen if we don’t. We suspect this move might be to encourage collaborative working. But there’s no one organisation in Scotland with a big enough turnover to act as the lead organisation. It’s much the same all over the sector – with a few UK-wide exceptions. Why then, would the government decide to exclude so many charities? This is not a fund for women and girls groups, despite what the guidance says. This is wilful ignorance of what the sector looks like and what it does. Violence against women and girls’ services have always worked at the grassroots level. We listen, learn and support. We are not a sector filled with large charities. We are a sector of small, community-focused groups, with a few umbrella bodies thrown in to support that work. We do not have anywhere close to £2m. This was not a fund developed with women and girls in mind. The tampon tax fund is nothing more than a further diversion of scarce resources away from the vital work that we do. Ludicrously, just like menstrual products, ending gender-based violence would appear to be a luxury. Ellie Hutchinson is director of the Empower Project.

Apatow directed Schumer’s movie Trainwreck, and found himself envious when, after a day’s shoot, Schumer kept stealing off to perform live comedy. Twenty-five years previously, his younger self quit standup, convinced of his inferiority to his peers, such as Jim Carrey and Adam Sandler. “Looking back,” he said in a recent interview, “I’m surprised how bad I was.” Fellow comic – and co-producer of Apatow’s new Netflix special The Return – Wayne Federman is more upbeat about his friend’s standup skills. But only slightly. “Judd,” he says, “was not that bad at all.” Which just about covers this much-heralded new Netflix release, filmed at Just for Laughs in Montreal in July. Apatow, now 50, has been gigging regularly for the last 18 months; he’s rediscovered his love of live standup and – as The Return proves – he can definitely do it. It’s just not particularly exciting to watch him do so. Part of the problem is, it’s all so gilded. Of course, Apatow isn’t alone in being a very rich and successful man doing standup. But his moneyed celebrity is an awfully conspicuous part of this hour-long set. Yes, he starts the show by being self-deprecating (about his middling level of fame), and tries to sustain throughout the show the idea that – megabucks and adulation aside – he’s the same hapless schlemiel he’s ever been. But it’s hard to take his self-deprecation seriously when you’re watching what becomes, in effect, a slideshow of Apatow schmoozing with the president, hobnobbing with Paul McCartney, and throwing the first pitch in front of 40,000 people at the New York Mets. It’s about tone – and Apatow doesn’t find the right one to dispel the ivory-tower aura that arises from this material. It’s also about the quality of the jokes, and here, that’s seldom above so-so. There’s some decent material about being father to two Gen-Z daughters: slaves to Instagram, forever being “triggered, Dad!” The generation gap yawns. There’s a cheap gag about Trump’s Access Hollywood tape, and odd bits when Apatow shows us a photo of him vomiting, or recites a poem he wrote as a teenager about his parents’ divorce. The latter conspicuously lacks a punchline – but there is a revealing moment, when someone in the crowd “aaaws” in sympathy, and Apatow retorts: “Don’t be sad – I’m rich. I’m very rich!” That he should snub sympathy, and do so by confusing emotional and financial wellbeing, is symptomatic of what doesn’t quite work about Apatow’s standup return. In the words of Muppets man Jim Henson, who once turned down the young comic for work: he lacks warmth. It’s a hard thing to fake, and – judging by that Henson anecdote – it may be something he’s always struggled against as a comic. He just doesn’t connect emotionally. “I’m very bad at sex,” he says at one point – but it doesn’t register as a confession, just a set-up for a routine. He worries whether the Mets crowd will like him, he tells us – but he’s never able to make us worry on his behalf. That’s not fatal. He can obviously do comedy: it’s proficient. Some of the jokes are neat (one about men having sex; one about there being no caricaturists at bar mitzvahs). Others work well on paper; he’s a writer, after all. But not a gifted performer, and in his hands, this all feels a bit mechanical – a problem confounded because this is a very American set, flitting magpie-like between subjects, with no arguments developed, no narrative, and nothing terrifically compelling to say.

A draft statement due to be signed off by EU leaders on Friday, along with comments from senior officials and diplomats in Brussels, suggest substantive talks can only start in spring, once the EU has published its own plan for the future. The Brexit secretary, David Davis, has insisted he expects the “substantive” outlines of a trade deal to be settled within a year, and the British government is keen to avoid the perception that negotiations are again being delayed by Brussels. It has been engaging in a last-minute round of telephone diplomacy to persuade the EU to make clear at a summit this week that at least some preliminary talks on trade can start immediately in the new year. The success of the British push was in doubt on Wednesday afternoon, however, as EU diplomats lined up to insist that anything substantive would require clarification of the UK government’s vision of the future. “The onus is on them, not on us,” said one EU diplomat. The commission remains concerned that it does not yet have sufficient understanding of what kind of deal the UK actually wants. Theresa May’s cabinet will hold a substantive discussion next Tuesday about the government’s preferred “end state” for negotiations. EU member states expect further discussions on the transition period, and other outstanding issues from the first phase of divorce talks, to take up most of their time in the first months of 2018. A “political declaration” about the broad outlines of a future trade deal could then be agreed before Brexit day in March 2019 – but the details would have to be hammered out during the transition period. Some EU member states are more open to preliminary talks before March, when the leaders agree new guidelines on the future trade relationship, but do not expect formal negotiations. “It all depends on what you mean by ‘trade talks beginning’,” said one diplomat. “The European council is going to need until March to have its guidelines in place for Michel Barnier [the EU’s chief negotiator] to negotiate phase two, and member states will be extremely reluctant to negotiate before those guidelines are in place. Whether that means before [March] there cannot be any kind of conversations, or comparing notes, that is a view that is yet to be defined.” The development exposes the nervousness in the UK at losing the momentum gained by May’s successful agreement with the European commission to move talks on at this week’s December summit to discuss a potential transition period and future relationship. Paris and Berlin drove the decision to add a contentious sentence early in the drafting of the leaders’ guidelines due to be agreed at Friday’s meeting, which appeared to limit how far the EU was willing to go before the summit in March. The paragraph reads: “The union will be ready to engage in preliminary and preparatory discussions with the aim of identifying an overall understanding of the framework for the future relationship once additional guidelines have been adopted to this effect.” On Friday, EU leaders are expected to announce that sufficient progress has been made on the opening issues of citizens’ rights, the financial settlement and the Irish border to allow a widening of Brexit talks, with the details of a transition period being the priority. In a motion on Wednesday backed by 556 votes to 62 against, the European parliament – which will have a veto on any withdrawal agreement – urged them to take that step. Before the vote, a key ally of Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, claimed, however, that a growing awareness of the damaging terms of a future Brexit deal had led to a rise in support in the UK for a second referendum on EU membership. Manfred Weber, the leader of the largest party in the European parliament, said a row over the ineligibility of Britain’s cities in the European capital of culture competition was just the latest example of the UK’s losses hitting home. “An opinion poll showed 50% of the British people are in favour of a new referendum,” said Weber, who leads the centre-right European People’s party. “The British people realise that Brexit means losing many things, but not gaining anything.” On Tuesday, Davis, called the European parliament’s Brexit coordinator, Guy Verhofstadt, to reassure him that British promises could be depended upon. His earlier suggestion that the concessions made by the UK in a joint agreement struck last week with the European commission were merely a “statement of intent” caused uproar in Brussels and Dublin. Verhofstadt told the European parliament: “Yesterday, I spoke to [Davis] on the phone and he assured me that it is absolutely not his intention nor that of the British government to backtrack on their commitments. “I take note of this and I think that the best way to assure this is that today, as we mention in our resolution, we immediately transpose all the commitments of the report into the legal text of the withdrawal agreement.” The Italian leader of the socialists, Gianni Pittella, said the British prime minister’s biggest task now was “to preserve her fragile majority and control the extreme fringes of her party”. Separately, a German government official said of Davis’s comments: “From our perspective, the agreements we reached last week are binding agreements … It was the prime minister who conducted the negotiations, and that is what counts for us.”Barnier told MEPs he was confident the UK would “rapidly” turn the agreement into a legal document. Barnier added that May was “courageous” and deserved respect.

She doesn’t dress like a politician’s wife at all. Melania Trump’s look is that of the wife of a wealthy businessman – it is about money not people. But then her husband, the US president for the best part of a year, does not identify with being a politician. “I’m a businessman” remains one of his catchphrases, a year after his inauguration. On inauguration day, when Melania made her debut appearance as first lady, there were signs that she intended to adopt the aesthetic of a traditional White House chatelaine. The raised collar of her skirt suit was a nod to Jackie Kennedy’s iconic tailoring, and duly remarked on as such by every fashion commentator, as was surely the point. The Tiffany-blue colour and the matt glow cashmere suggested the kind of patrician east-coast elegance with which the Kennedys are closely associated and which the Trumps are not. That Melania had been dressed by an iconic American designer – Ralph Lauren – was a retort to Tom Ford, Marc Jacobs and the other New York fashion names who had publicly snubbed her business. But the delicate visual diplomacy of her inauguration look, a pleasant surprise to many Melania-sceptics, did not last. (Her soulmate, after all, has a famously short attention span.) During most of 2017, Melania Trump’s wardrobe has made headlines for flaunting wealth and privilege in the most jarring of contexts. In May, she wore an ostentatiously embroidered Dolce &amp; Gabbana jacket costing $51,500 (£38,300) during a trip to Sicily. (The Washington Post noted icily that the figure was a contrast with the 23 million people being stripped of their medical insurance by her husband.) Undeterred, the first lady went on to choose a fuschia Delpozo dress with a pricetag of $3,000 for a speech to the UN at which she implored that “no child should ever feel hungry”. But the image that seared itself on to the public consciousness came in August, when Melania Trump wore precipitous black stilettos as she boarded Air Force One to disaster-ravaged Texas. “Who wears stilettos to a hurricane?” asked Vanity Fair. First ladies are allowed to accept clothing gifts from designers, on the basis that the pieces become goverment property and are sent to the national archives, but Melania Trump is thought to pay for a large proportion of her clothing herself. Her unofficial stylist, Hervé Pierre, told the New York Times that he buys off the rack in Manhattan at Bergdorf Goodman, Saks, Michael Kors and Christian Dior. He does not always disclose who he is shopping for, but, “I always ask: ‘Was it on the red carpet? Did somebody already wear it?’ Because I don’t want her to be on the Who Wore It Better list.” The first lady wardrobe has been a political issue since Jackie Kennedy was criticised for favouring Paris designers over American. Michelle Obama used her style as a platform to champion the creativity and economic drive of young American designers from diverse backgrounds. Melania Trump, who delayed moving from Manhattan to the White House for five months after the inauguration, has shown as much reluctance to toe a Washington line in her style as she did in her domestic arrangements. Her wardrobe for the Trumps’ recent tour of Asia made no attempt at diplomacy. Coats and gowns by European luxury names Fendi, Dolce &amp; Gabbana, Valentino and Alexander McQueen did not bother to flatter the egos of her hosts in Tokyo and Beijing, as convention dictates. Neither did they suggest a first lady holding dear Trump’s “America first” policy. Her penchant for Dolce &amp; Gabbana is to Trump’s economic policy what her campaign against cyberbulling is to @realDonaldTrump. The cost of Melania Trump’s Asian tour wardrobe alone has been estimated at £32,000. The first lady has eschewed the unwritten first rule of modern diplomatic dressing, embraced by women in the public eye across the geographical and political map from the Duchess of Cambridge to Michelle Obama, which is that Zara skirts or J Crew cardigans are an essential tool in connecting with ordinary voters. An eye for a high-street bargain is the 21st century equivalent of the cookie recipe, signalling that this high-profile woman is, really, just like us. Trump’s daughter Ivanka has taken note of this – to speak about tax reform for the middle class at a Pennsylvania town hall, she wore a Zara skirt – but the labels in her stepmother’s wardrobe reflect life lived in a bubble of affluence. More significantly, they make not even the vaguest pretence of fellowship with the world beyond. Without saying a word, Melania Trump speaks volumes about her White House."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"us-news/2017/dec/13/five-things-we-learned-from-doug-joness-win-in-alabama","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-13T07:49:38Z","webTitle":"Five things we learned from Doug Jones's victory in Alabama","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/dec/13/five-things-we-learned-from-doug-joness-win-in-alabama","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/dec/13/five-things-we-learned-from-doug-joness-win-in-alabama","fields":{"headline":"Five things we learned from Doug Jones's victory in Alabama","bodyText":"1. Like Darth Vader, Steve Bannon is beatable The former White House chief strategist has compared himself to the Star Wars villain, but this was the moment he dropped his lightsaber. In 2016, Bannon helped pull off one of the greatest election upsets in American history. But in 2017, he backed one of the worst Senate candidates in American history, making light of allegations of sexual misconduct with teenage girls, and went down in flames. The old playbook, such as blaming the media, did not work even in a Republican stronghold. Among those questioning Bannon’s judgment is likely to be Donald Trump, who was persuaded to throw in his lot with Moore – and who notoriously hates losing. 2. The Republican civil war is about to get even uglier The Alabama special election had turned into a lose-lose situation and, unsurprisingly, Republicans lost. A Moore win would have been bad, saddling them with demands for an ethics investigation or expulsion and tarnishing the brand for years. But a Republican Senate defeat in Alabama for the first time since 1992 is hardly cause for celebration, reducing the party’s majority to 51-49 in the chamber. Divisions were painfully exposed by the failure to pass healthcare legislation. Now there will be soul searching and recriminations over this self-inflicted wound. Questions will be asked about Bannon’s undue influence on the party. Is he driving them over a cliff? 3. A pattern is emerging Historically, the party that occupies the White House struggles in special and mid-term elections. In 2010, Democrats received what President Barack Obama called a “shellacking”. There is a now-growing body of evidence that, despite Trump’s ability to change the rules, this pattern is not only holding but becoming turbocharged. Republicans performed badly in Virginia and elsewhere last month. Now they have lost Alabama, which in sporting terms would be the equivalent of New Zealand losing to Jamaica at rugby. With Trump’s approval rating at a record low, a potential meltdown in the 2018 mid-terms awaits. 4. The anti-Trump coalition has been emboldened Last month’s elections were dubbed “the revenge of the suburbs”, as women, minorities and university-educated voters joined to deliver a rebuke to Trump by voting in a new slate of female, African American and transgender Democrats. What happened in Alabama appears to confirm this trend. African Americans turned out in big numbers in one of America’s most racially divided states. Many women were appalled by the accusations against Moore. Suburbia, including establishment Republicans, again appears to have dealt a decisive blow. 5. Trump did indeed scramble the electoral map Trump defied all conventional wisdom to win the presidency, turning some traditionally blue states red. But it cuts both ways. Democrats, who lost the white south in the 1960s, suddenly find that even a state such as Alabama is in play, albeit thanks to Moore’s uniquely negative characteristics. This will give fresh hope to progressives in cities such as Austin, Texas, Nashville, Tennessee, and other islands of blue surrounded by red. Paradoxically, at a moment when America is at its most divided since the Vietnam war, the battle lines are being redrawn."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/dec/14/bennelongs-heart-vibrant-diverse-and-key-to-winning-byelection","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-14T02:19:44Z","webTitle":"Bennelong's heart: the diverse district that's key to winning byelection","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/dec/14/bennelongs-heart-vibrant-diverse-and-key-to-winning-byelection","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/dec/14/bennelongs-heart-vibrant-diverse-and-key-to-winning-byelection","fields":{"headline":"Bennelong's heart: the diverse district that's key to winning byelection","bodyText":"In Rowe Street, Eastwood, elderly women sized up the bok choy at the outdoor markets and chatted outside shops displaying glossy roast ducks. Eastwood, in the north-west of Sydney and once home to Granny Smith apples, is at the heart of the federal seat of Bennelong. It has transformed from a lower-middle-class white commuter suburb to a vibrant middle-class multicultural area that prides itself on its harmoniousness. The seat is considered one of the most diverse in Australia, with the 2016 census recording that 21% of the electorate identified some Chinese heritage, 4.7% Korean and 34% Australian, English or Irish. But now it holds the key to Malcolm Turnbull’s political future and possibly Bill Shorten’s as well. When the voters go to the polls for a byelection on Saturday, they will be deciding whether the Turnbull government clings on to its one-seat majority, or is forced to rely on independents to govern. When the Guardian visited this week, a few themes emerged. Both candidates were well known to voters, showing that the Liberals’ John Alexander has put in the hard work over the past seven years and that Labor’s decision to run the former NSW premier Kristina Keneally is also working. On the streets of Eastwood, when asked what would drive their vote, most people nominated the sort of things any other Sydneysider would nominate: congestion, transport issues, health and education services. Voters downplayed the role played by cultural voting blocs, Turnbull’s China rhetoric and Sam Dastyari’s resignation. In fact, most didn’t realise what had happened at all. Seated in the basement of the Eastwood Centre – which is owned by the Chinese billionaire at the centre of the Dastyari scandal, Huang Xiangmo – Peter Wong said it wasn’t something the Chinese community cared about. As an older Australian, he said, he was “interested in the issue of Medicare”. “John Alexander, in the past, he might be not quite looking after the elderly, in my mind,” he said. James, who declined to provide a last name, said he had not heard of Dastyari’s Chinese links, Turnbull’s attack or the fallout. “I don’t think the Chinese community are going to follow it that much,” he said. “I know there are major Chinese newspapers, so if that’s a headline on it, then maybe it will make an impact. I wouldn’t care myself.” Some of the Chinese language newspapers, which routinely reproduce stories from the Beijing newspapers, have carried articles putting the Chinese government perspective that Turnbull has overreacted on the question of Chinese interference, is leaning towards racism in his rhetoric and putting the relationship at risk. But whether these are influential remains to be seen. “[Turnbull’s] talking about bad Chinese people, a Chinese guy who supported one of the politicians,” said Danny Pang. “But Chinese people and the Chinese community here are two different things.” Anita, who migrated from China 20 years ago, said she didn’t think her community voted as a bloc anyway. It was wrong to assume that one issue would sway the community, she said. “I think they vote differently, because they have their own ideas,” she said. “Maybe they are Christian and they support the Christian candidate. Maybe they support the one who has really done something for the past year. It’s different.” A Newspoll conducted last weekend put Liberals and Labor neck and neck, at 50% each on the two-party preferred vote. It used phone interviews of 527 voters and has a margin of error of 4.3%. The Fairfax ReachTel poll taken on Tuesday – the day Dastyari resigned – put Alexander comfortably ahead of Keneally on 53-47, two-party preferred. It used robocalls and was based on 864 responses, giving an error rate of 3.5%. It’s an open question whether either method is accurate when a substantial number of voters speak English as a second language. What is known about Bennelong is that it is more conservative than other parts of Sydney. In the same-sex marriage survey, Bennelong voted no 50.2% to 49.8%. For Keneally, a win in Bennelong would be both a blessing and a curse. A win will commit her to a constant round of barbecues, school fetes and probably a move to the electorate. She currently lives on the boundary in Boronia Park, but the family has recently bought a house on Scotland Island in Pittwater in Sydney’s north, and Keneally had planned to spend more time in Canberra for Sky TV. But the bigger problem will be the nature of the seat itself. Demographics and redistributions westward made Bennelong – once safely Liberal – increasingly marginal during the 1990s and 2000s. When the seat’s longtime MP and then prime minister John Howard was defeated by the high-profile Maxine McKew in 2004, it was Labor’s first win there. But McKew was unable to hold it more than one term, despite a mighty effort. Changing demographics are probably again making Bennelong more safely conservative. This election, a Chinese Christian, Cao Gui Dong, is running for the Christian Democrats for the first time. A boost to the party’s primary vote – which hit 6% last year – could point to a growing Chinese and Korean population with more conservative, religious ties. If Keneally loses, she may well end up taking the Senate spot vacated by Dastyari. Or she may return to Sky, with the Labor party forever in her debt, while she awaits another opportunity. The top Senate spot for Labor in NSW would certainly be an easier gig, as would a mooted tilt at the new seat in Canberra. The government has attempted to make much of Keneally’s plan B. But in Rowe Street, Eastwood, it didn’t rate a mention."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2017/dec/13/joe-root-denies-rift-jimmy-anderson-england-coaches-ashes","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-13T10:18:10Z","webTitle":"Joe Root denies rift between Jimmy Anderson and England’s Ashes coaches","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/dec/13/joe-root-denies-rift-jimmy-anderson-england-coaches-ashes","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/dec/13/joe-root-denies-rift-jimmy-anderson-england-coaches-ashes","fields":{"headline":"Joe Root denies rift between Jimmy Anderson and England’s Ashes coaches","bodyText":"Joe Root moved to quell suggestions of a rift between Jimmy Anderson and the coaching staff on the eve of England’s third Test with Australia after the paceman appeared to question their input during the defeat in Adelaide. Speaking before the final Ashes Test at the Waca – and before later naming an unchanged side that sees Jonny Bairstow promoted to No6 ahead of Moeen Ali – Root fielded questions about a recent newspaper column from his vice-captain and senior bowler. England’s seamers had been criticised for failing to locate the right length on the opening day of the pink ball match in Adelaide after Root had won the toss, with just four wickets taken and Australia then ploughing for a hefty first innings total that set up their 120-run victory. Anderson responded in his Telegraph column by writing: “I bowled too short in the first innings at Adelaide. We should have bowled a touch fuller. That was an oversight from the players on the field but also from the coaches who could have had an input too, which was frustrating.” The inclusion of the coaches appeared somewhat pointed from a bowler with 131 caps and 514 Test wickets. Root countered by stating that such decisions ultimately fall back on the players and himself as the on-field leader. Root said: “I think the relationship [between players and coaches] has been really good. I think we got it wrong on the field. It’s easy to look back and say: ‘Go and try to bowl that little bit fuller’. We all knew that was the case and it’s probably slightly harsh to put the blame on to the coaches. “That might not be exactly how he wanted that to come across in the way it did but I think ultimately us guys on the field, we’re the ones responsible for what we are doing out there. We have to be smarter, react quicker. I take responsibility for that as well, as captain.” Anderson and Stuart Broad built up a strong rapport with the former bowling coach, Ottis Gibson, and often tapped into his advice during matches. His departure at the end of the summer to become the coach of South Africa left a hole. England hired the former New Zealand quick Shane Bond as a consultant for the first two Tests but he has since left the group, with the full-time appointment, Chris Silverwood, not starting until the new year after seeing out his notice period at champions Essex. Paul Collingwood, on tour as an assistant coach, has now taken over the bowlers in a mentoring capacity but ultimately the hope was that England’s two leading wicket-takers, who played their 100th Test together this week, would lead the group in terms of tactics. Anderson and Broad care one wicket away from equalling the 762 victims that Curtly Ambrose and Courtney Walsh shared from their 95 Tests played together, with the great West Indies pair the all-time seam-bowling partnership in this regard. Only the prolific seam-spin pairings of Australia’s Glenn McGrath and Shane Warne (1,001 wickets shared from 104 Tests) and Chaminda Vaas and Muttiah Muralitharan of Sri Lanka (895 from 95 Tests) sit above them."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"business/grogonomics/2017/dec/14/will-the-end-of-the-housing-boom-come-with-a-bang-or-a-wimper","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-13T17:00:08Z","webTitle":"Will the end of the housing boom come with a bang or a whimper? | Greg Jericho","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2017/dec/14/will-the-end-of-the-housing-boom-come-with-a-bang-or-a-wimper","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/grogonomics/2017/dec/14/will-the-end-of-the-housing-boom-come-with-a-bang-or-a-wimper","fields":{"headline":"Will the end of the housing boom come with a bang or a whimper?","bodyText":"The Australian economy for the past four years has been dominated by two booms – the end of the mining investment and the housing price one. The latest GDP figures suggest that the transition from the end of the mining boom has now occurred, and the latest housing price figures released this week suggest we have also reached the end of the housing boom. Since the RBA began cutting interest rates, the housing boom has mostly been about Sydney and to a lesser extent, Melbourne. So it is significant that the latest residential housing price data released on Tuesday showed that the housing prices in Sydney fell 1.4% – the biggest fall since December 2015. Elsewhere, Melbourne residential prices slowed dramatically – up just 1.1% compared to 3% in the June quarter, and prices in Perth continued to fall – they are down nearly 10% on 2014 levels – while in Hobart prices were up a very solid 3.4%. It meant overall residential prices across the country were down 0.2% – the biggest fall since March last year: The quarterly growth figures can be a bit noisy, but the annual growth figures confirm that a sowing has occurred – even if in Sydney residential prices remain 9.4% above where they were a year ago – at least that is down on the 14.4% annual growth that was occurring in March: The slowing was not altogether surprising given what has been happening with housing finance. The latest data out last week showed the lowest annual growth of housing finance since September last year, as investors departed the market in droves: As I have previously noted, there is a good correlation between the growth of housing finance and house prices six months later. The continuing slowing of housing finance suggests that there will be little chance of a recovery in the growth of housing prices anytime soon, and if anything, housing prices seem to be slowing quicker than would be expected: And so the question turns to whether or not the end of the housing boom will come with a bang or a whimper. One interesting aspect is the difference between the growth of the prices of apartments and other “attached” dwellings, and that of stand-alone “established” houses. Generally the prices of the two move in sync, and that is what we are seeing in Sydney. In the September quarter the average price of apartments fell by 1.4% - the biggest quarterly fall for six years – while established house prices fell 1.3%. It means that both elements of the Sydney housing market are mostly moving together – with the annual growth of both being down on where it was six months ago: But this is not the case in Melbourne and Brisbane – the two cities which have caused the most concern for the Reserve Banks about the over-supply of apartments. Since 2015, while the price growth of established houses in Melbourne has generally increased from 5.8% to the current 15.5%, that of attached dwellings has mostly stayed around the 3.5%-4.5% range: In Brisbane, where the price of established houses has been growing steadily at a touch over 4% for the past two years, the price of attached dwellings has actually been falling for 12 months: One would suspect that would make those markets more susceptible to a harder fall – especially when you consider that since the Reserve Bank began cutting interest rates in November 2011, the price growth of established houses in Melbourne has far outstripped that of apartments – 60% compared to 22%: One of the beneficiaries of the lower growth of apartment prices has been first-home buyers. Research by the Reserve Bank released last week found that measuring housing affordability for first-home buyers was complex as most first-home buyers “buy homes that are cheaper than the average” and you need to consider the ability to repay a mortgage, the quality of the homes available, and the distance from the CBD. The Reserve Bank found that “the average number of bedrooms in affordable housing has declined over the past 20 years, most notably in Sydney” – due mostly to apartments now being smaller. But it also found that while the average distance from the CBD of affordable houses has increased over the past 20 years – in Sydney from slightly over 40km to a touch less than 60km – the distance from the CBD of affordable apartments has remained relatively stable. The research also found that there has been a surge in the share of potentially affordable apartments for first-home buyers in Brisbane and Melbourne, but not so for established houses. It found that “houses have become less affordable than apartments in all cities and regions recently.” The RBA suggests this is “likely to be due to an increase in the relative scarcity of houses given the large increase in the supply of apartments over the past few years.” This increase and the boost in the first-home buyers grant in NSW and Victoria has seen the level of first-home buyers improve significantly in the past six months: Whether the slowing of the price growth of apartments will lead to a similar slowing of established houses so that their affordability improves, remains to be seen. But all signs at the moment suggest that the boom is over, and it is now all about how sudden will be its end, rather than how much higher can house prices go."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2017/dec/13/scottish-fisherman-warn-of-hardline-eu-stance-over-quotas","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-13T11:36:12Z","webTitle":"Scottish fishermen say EU is taking 'hardline' quotas stance pre-Brexit","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/dec/13/scottish-fisherman-warn-of-hardline-eu-stance-over-quotas","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/dec/13/scottish-fisherman-warn-of-hardline-eu-stance-over-quotas","fields":{"headline":"Scottish fishermen say EU is taking 'hardline' quotas stance pre-Brexit","bodyText":"Scottish fishermen have raised concerns that the EU is adopting a hardline stance over quotas as a prelude to Brexit negotiations. Annual negotiations over fishing quotas – expected to be the penultimate talks the UK participates in before leaving the EU – were concluded in Brussels early on Wednesday. The UK government welcomed the deal, while Scotland’s rural economy secretary, Fergus Ewing, described it as “broadly fair”. Two-thirds of fish in North Sea and Atlantic fisheries will be subject to sustainable catch limits next year, with increases for North Sea cod, haddock and monkfish, while catches for mackerel will see a significant restriction. But Bertie Armstrong, chief executive of the Scottish Fishermen’s Federation, which has been consistently pro-Brexit, said EU countries were “adopting entrenched views” that could adversely affect future negotiations. “Looking to the future, international law is abundantly clear that upon exit, control over the UK exclusive economic zone will revert to the UK governments. That will allow the UK to decide for our own waters who gets to catch what, where and when. But it doesn’t mean we won’t be willing to negotiate access. The difference is that it will be on our terms. “Taking a hardline stance will not help as we move to the situation where international negotiations with the UK as a coastal state determine outcomes.” Ewing acknowledged that most fishermen were strongly in favour of leaving the EU, and said talks had been “challenging”. He added that anxieties remained about the length of the transition period and whether the UK would remain within the common fisheries policy during that time, as well as about access to the single market and imposition of tariffs. He told BBC Radio Scotland on Wednesday morning: “The attitude of member states was pretty hardline, and the phrase doing the rounds was ‘not a kilogram more’. That betokens the simmering resentment about Brexit on the part of many member states and the shadow of Brexit overhung the talks in Brussels.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/filmblog/2017/dec/13/yay-porgs-critics-verdicts-on-star-wars-the-last-jedi-reviews-roundup","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-13T10:43:54Z","webTitle":"'Yay, porgs!' – critics' verdicts on Star Wars: The Last Jedi","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2017/dec/13/yay-porgs-critics-verdicts-on-star-wars-the-last-jedi-reviews-roundup","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/filmblog/2017/dec/13/yay-porgs-critics-verdicts-on-star-wars-the-last-jedi-reviews-roundup","fields":{"headline":"'Yay, porgs!' – critics' verdicts on Star Wars: The Last Jedi","bodyText":"The first reviews for Star Wars: The Last Jedi are in and, with the exception of a few naysayers, the reaction has been mostly positive. Currently, Rian Johnson’s sequel has a 93% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, matching the rating of 2015’s The Force Awakens. On rival reviews aggregation site Metacritic, The Last Jedi has bested its predecessor with a rating of 85 to the Force Awakens’ 81. The Hollywood Reporter’s Todd McCarthy gave the film a broadly positive review, with minor caveats: This latest, and longest, franchise entry has the decided feel of a passing of the torch from one set of characters, and actors, to the next. Loaded with action and satisfying in the ways its loyal audience wants it to be, writer-director Rian Johnson’s plunge into George Lucas’s universe is generally pleasing even as it sometimes strains to find useful and/or interesting things for some of its characters to do. Variety’s Peter Debruge struck a more negative note, praising Johnson for “not messing things up” but declaring the film a disappointment: Although The Last Jedi meets a relatively high standard for franchise film-making, Johnson’s effort is ultimately a disappointment. If anything, it demonstrates just how effective supervising producer Kathleen Kennedy and the forces that oversee this now Disney-owned property are at moulding their individual directors’ visions into supporting a unified corporate aesthetic … But Johnson was either strong enough or weak enough to adapt to such pressures, and the result is the longest and least essential chapter in the series. Reviews from the UK have been more effusive. The Telegraph’s Robbie Collin gave the film a maximum five-star rating, describing it as “exemplary blockbuster film-making”: Rian Johnson’s film certainly feels like Star Wars: it even has a supporting cast made up of British character actors and gorgeously CG-augmented rubber creatures, including porgs, a kind of hyper-marketable cross between a puffin and a young Justin Bieber. But it’s not a Star Wars you’re entirely sure Lucas would or could have ever made himself. Rather than playing the hits, as JJ Abrams’s franchise-reviving The Force Awakens did two Christmases ago, it flexes its fingers before riffing over old chord progressions in ways that will leave fans beaming with surprise. Another five-star review came from the Times’ Kevin Maher (paywall), who saluted the film’s “devastating emotional power”: If it’s better, and more satisfying, than the original instalments, this is often because it talks to them so freely (and not entirely without criticism). Scenes echo scenes. Shots deliberately rhyme (look for a reference to the lift sequence with Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader in Return of the Jedi). Musical cues nod and wink, until the film becomes dense and layered and bubbling with ideas and feelings, a whip-smart Star Wars smorgasbord that will also make you cry. The Guardian’s Peter Bradshaw wasn’t quite as fulsome in his praise, but was broadly positive, impressed in particular by Adam Driver’s performance as the conflicted villain Kylo Ren: Superbly played by Adam Driver … [Ren] is now a wounded, damaged figure, and he insinuates himself like a sensually predatory Satan into our consciousness in a series of dreamlike cross-cutting dialogue sequences that are the most successful part of the film. What does Kylo Ren want? As ever, the closeups on Driver’s face are gorgeous. He is never the Easter Island statue of hardness that it is possible to misremember. He is tremulous, unsure of himself, like an unhappy teenager, and his mouth seems almost on the point of trembling with tears. That breathy, resonant voice is unmistakable even from behind a neo-Vader mask. Across the Atlantic, the New York Times’ Manohla Dargis thought the film was “a satisfying, at times transporting entertainment”: Mr Johnson has picked up the baton that was handed to Mr Abrams when he signed on to revive the series with The Force Awakens. Mr Johnson doesn’t have to make the important introductions; for the most part, the principals were in place, as was an overarching mythology that during some arid periods has seemed more sustained by fan faith than anything else. Even so, he has to convince you that these searching, burgeoning heroes and villains fit together emotionally, not simply on a Lucasfilm whiteboard, and that they have the requisite lightness and heaviness, the ineffable spirit and grandeur to reinvigorate a pop-cultural juggernaut. That he’s made a good movie in doing so isn’t icing; it’s the whole cake. CNN.com’s Brian Lowry declared the film “a significant letdown”: Running more than 2½ hours, the eighth Star Wars movie built around the Skywalker clan is the longest under that banner and showcases an abundance of action. But despite the enormous scope and visual spectacle, too many key components of the film – including those that have kept die-hard fans guessing and debating – prove unsatisfying. In a B+ rating, Entertainment Weekly’s Chris Nashawaty thought the film was “(mostly) a triumph”, and praised the film’s final act: Despite the flabby mid-section of the film and its menagerie of new alien creatures that are a mixed bag (yay, Porgs with their squat, guinea pig bodies and sad anime saucer eyes; boo to the others that look like exiles from The NeverEnding Story), Johnson really delivers [in] the third and final act. The climactic last 45 minutes of the film is as thrilling and spectacular as anything Star Wars has given us. There are cool, mythic hand-to-hand battles, breathtaking aerial sequences, and one mano a mano showdown that’s as epic as anything Sergio Leone dreamed up. And again, the film ends on a note that feels … just … right. Meanwhile, the Village Voice, who had been cautious in its praise for The Force Awakens, were more impressed by its follow-up: The Last Jedi is a better film than The Force Awakens – it’s faster, funnier, and has both more sweep and more originality – but I still didn’t find any moments here as hauntingly moving as that earlier film’s first flight of the Millennium Falcon, or the death of Han Solo. The good news is that Johnson doesn’t really need them. The Last Jedi is the most entertaining Star Wars movie in many a moon. In one of the most positive reviews of the film, Slate’s Sam Adams argued that it felt genuinely new: Johnson brings to The Last Jedi a cinephile’s erudition as well as a geek’s devotion, and he’s made a film that connects to Star Wars at the root – not just the first movie, but the ones that inspired it. There’s Kurosawa in it, both the rowdy fabulism of The Hidden Fortress and the impressionist choreography of Ran, a sword fight in a scarlet throne room that draws on Powell and Pressburger’s Tales of Hoffman, even an overt nod to Sam Peckinpah’s The Wild Bunch. Abrams’ The Force Awakens was a canny feat of fan service, introducing a new slate of characters while sticking close enough to the original film’s elements that you could practically see its skeleton under the skin. But The Last Jedi isn’t content to revive past glories … There are moments in it that feel genuinely new, not just for the world of Star Wars but the universe of movies as a whole. Finally, the most outright negative review of the film was by the New Yorker’s Richard Brody, who called it “appallingly purified”: Despite a few stunning decorative touches … and that brief central sequence of multiple Reys, the movie comes off as a work that’s ironed out, flattened down, appallingly purified. Above all, it delivers a terrifyingly calculated consensus storytelling, an artificial universality that is achieved, in part, through express religious references. I desperately miss the pseudo-Shakespearean dialectical wrangles and the exhilarating sense of CGI discoveries that mark George Lucas’s last forays into the franchise.

Zac Bolland, 23, and Courtney Brierley, 20, are charged with three counts of murder, four counts of attempted murder and one of arson with intent to endanger life. The pair were due to appear at Manchester and Salford magistrates court on Wednesday, Greater Manchester police said. 14-year-old Demi Pearson, eight-year-old Brandon Pearson and seven-year-old Lacie Pearson – died in the attack in the Walkden area of the city on Monday morning. Their three-year-old sister, Lia, and mother, Michelle Pearson, 35, remain in hospital following the “targeted” attack, police have said. Relatives have said the family were living in fear of an attack for two weeks and had reportedly tightened security at their home, including having a device fitted by firefighters to their letterbox to prevent flammable materials being poured through. Detectives are investigating whether the suspects scaled scaffolding outside the home to pour an accelerant down the chimney of the family home on Jackson Street. Ch Supt Wayne Miller said the police were treating the incident as a targeted attack after recovering CCTV from the area. He thanked the members of the public who had come forward with information, saying the force now had a “much deeper understanding of the devastating events”. “The loss of a child in any circumstance is unthinkable, to lose three in such deplorable circumstances words cannot describe,” said Miller. “My heart breaks for them, it really does. We’re doing all that we can to get them the answers they quite rightly deserve.” The police confirmed there had been earlier incidents at the address and it is understood police were called to a separate incident at the property at about 2am, three hours before the fire. The force has referred itself to the Independent Police Complaints Commission, which is standard practice when someone dies after contact with the police. A relative of Pearson said the mother-of-six “begged and begged to be moved” before the fatal blaze. Writing on social media, the relative said Pearson “stayed at family member’s houses because she was that afraid” and said she should have been better protected. She added: “How one single person can take your whole family from you. Broken is not the word.” The Pearson family home is run by City West Housing Trust. A spokesman said that the trust had not received an application for the family to move."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/dec/14/it-was-us-against-everyone-how-abuse-survivors-will-keep-pushing-for-change","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-13T17:00:08Z","webTitle":"‘It was us against everyone’: how abuse survivors will keep pushing for change","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/dec/14/it-was-us-against-everyone-how-abuse-survivors-will-keep-pushing-for-change","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/dec/14/it-was-us-against-everyone-how-abuse-survivors-will-keep-pushing-for-change","fields":{"headline":"‘It was us against everyone’: how abuse survivors will keep pushing for change","bodyText":"Manny Waks, a survivor of sexual abuse who exposed crimes against children that occurred within the secretive Jewish Yeshivah community, describes the work of the child abuse royal commission as “life-saving” and “life-changing”. On Thursday morning the six royal commissioners led by Justice Peter McClellan will sit for a final time in front of abuse survivors and advocates, many of whom followed the commission’s work around the country. Guardian Australia spoke to Waks and other advocates and experts about the commission’s work over the past five years and what they hope will change once its work is done. Waks was the first abuse survivor within the Yeshivah community in Australia to publicly call out his abusers and those who concealed their crimes. His whistleblowing saw him shunned by many in his community. His former peers ostracised him, verbally abused him and attempted to discredit his abuse. Speaking to Guardian Australia from where he now lives in Israel, Waks says it was the royal commission’s interrogation of Yeshivah authorities that helped to validate his story, along with the stories of of dozens of others abused within Jewish institutions. “I struggle to think that I would be alive now [without the commission],” he says. “To see the leading rabbis of Australia being hauled before the commission, many who had never faced a court or been cross-examined before … they had nowhere to hide. They couldn’t cover things up. It was all there for everyone to see. “It was us against everyone and then the royal commission came along. Suddenly people said, ‘Hang on, what you have been saying has been true all along’. And even more people came forward. And it was such a vindication and validation that we didn’t do anything wrong.” The final public hearing in Sydney is being held as a mark of respect to the commission’s hundreds of staff and to people like Waks who shared their stories during the 444 days of public hearings, or in one of 8,000 private sessions. McClellan, who has chaired the commission since its inception and cross-examined hundreds of witnesses, will give a short speech before dozens of abuse survivors and advocates in attendance, before presenting the National Library of Australia with a book containing around 1,000 messages handwritten by survivors of institutional child sexual abuse. Experts, advocates, victims and survivors have praised McClellan and his team for the meticulous and compassionate way in which they have conducted their inquiry. When the commissioners identified gaps in knowledge, they tasked universities and leading researchers to undertake research into abuse and its causes. More than 50 pieces of original research have already been published by the royal commission. Commissioners ordered hundreds of institutions to hand over documents. More than 1.2m documents have been analysed by the commission to inform its work. All of this work will culminate in a final report to be delivered to the governor general in Canberra on Friday. But the commission’s recommendations will only be as effective as the state, territory and federal governments tasked with implementing them, says Prof Leah Bromfield, the co-director of the Australian Centre for Child Protection at the University of South Australia. For change to occur, Bromfield says, governments and institutions including churches, sporting clubs and schools will have to take the commission’s findings seriously and commit to its recommendations. “I am fearful that some of the intent of the reforms of the royal commission will get lost in the intergovernmental committee work and that we’ll see a tick-the-box approach where something is done – but it doesn’t speak to the intent of the recommendation and it doesn’t change the lives of children,” Bromfield says. “And that should be the measure of the implementation of any recommendations or reforms that come out of the royal commission. Has it changed the lives of children? Has it changed the lives of survivors? Are we making the world a better place? “I think the other risk is this royal commission was so big. With most inquiries you can pinpoint the one government department or one minister who is accountable. An inquiry this big runs the risk that there’s not one person that you can turn to and say: ‘This is your baby and you’re accountable.’” Already, some of the commission’s recommendations for how a national redress scheme should work have been ignored by governments. The federal government’s redress legislation has attracted criticism for excluding abuse survivors who have been convicted of serious crimes, and for capping redress at $150,000. The royal commission recommended a cap of $200,000. The legislation has been referred to a Senate inquiry by the shadow social services minister, Jenny Macklin. State and territory governments have also been slow to commit to the legislation. Prof Daryl Higgins, the director of the Institute of Child Protection studies within the Australian Catholic University, agrees with Bromfield that the response from governments, institutions and the community will be key to lasting and meaningful reform. “I have the utmost respect for the commissioners themselves and for all of the research and the staff involved in the investigations and the preparation of the final report,” he said. “But the final report is the first real chapter in what I think is going to be an ongoing piece of work.” He believes changing the attitudes of the leaders of organisations will be most important to keeping children safe in future. Reports already published by the royal commission found that failures of leadership led to “catastrophic” abuses of children occurring. Higgins believes every adult tasked with the care of children should reflect on their role in keeping them safe, especially those responsible for children in residential care or the youth justice system. “It’s really the attitudes [towards children] that I think are the most important thing and my call is for all leaders of all organisations to be thinking through ‘what is it that I can do to support conditions of safety?’,” Higgins says. “And that’s really a call to arms no matter whether [they] are a faith-based or a non-faith based organisation.” Peter Fox, the former New South Wales detective whose open letter about abuse being covered up by police and religious institutions helped prompt the then prime minister, Julia Gillard, to announce the royal commission in 2012, will be at the final hearing on Thursday. He said he would join abuse survivors and their advocates to watch McClellan’s final address and that he was feeling anxious. “I suppose the greatest amount of anxiety not just for myself but for so many is to actually see the recommendations implemented,” he said. “In the past we’ve seen royal commissions that governments have cherrypicked what they like out of them but have also left a lot behind.” He believes the Catholic church in particular needs to be scrutinised on an ongoing basis. A significant proportion of the people who contacted the royal commission made allegations of child sexual abuse occurring in Catholic church institutions, with 37% of those who spoke to commissioners in a private session reporting abuse within institutions managed by the Catholic church. “We shouldn’t take our eyes off any of them for a moment,” Fox said. For her part, Bromfield hopes that the official marking of the end of the commission’s work on Thursday won’t mean that its findings to date and the stories of survivors fall from the public consciousness. “I really worry about what that would say to survivors,” she said. “We’ve had five years where we’ve been trying to say. ‘You matter. This matters. Your story matters.’ “And if we drop it like a hot potato, I can’t imagine how devastating the impact of that would be.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/dec/13/sam-dastyari-should-be-out-of-the-senate-now-turnbull-says","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-13T05:18:32Z","webTitle":"Sam Dastyari should be 'out of the Senate now', Turnbull says","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/dec/13/sam-dastyari-should-be-out-of-the-senate-now-turnbull-says","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/dec/13/sam-dastyari-should-be-out-of-the-senate-now-turnbull-says","fields":{"headline":"Sam Dastyari should be 'out of the Senate now', Turnbull says","bodyText":"The resignation of the Labor senator Sam Dastyari has triggered a fresh offensive between the major parties, with Malcolm Turnbull insisting he needs to get out of the Senate immediately, and Bill Shorten saying the departure will happen after Dastyari has cleared his decks. With both leaders now engaged in a ferocious battle on the ground for Saturday’s Bennelong byelection, given the result will determine whether or not the Turnbull government can govern in majority, Turnbull blasted Dastyari for not resigning with immediate effect. “He’s still taking money from the taxpayers of the country that he put second. He did not put Australia first,” the prime minister said Wednesday. “He should be out of the Senate now”. Shorten rebuffed the attack by saying Turnbull was trying to extend the shelf-life of the Dastyari controversy for political purposes. The Labor leader said the New South Wales senator would “sooner rather than later ... wrap up his matters”. Shorten said Dastyari had staff to deal with, and electorate work to complete, and “he can’t just leave punters in the lurch”. The Labor leader also referenced the amount of time other parliamentarians had taken to exit the scene after indicating the would resign, including the Liberal senator Michael Ronaldson, who departed in 73 days, and Chris Back, who departed in 46 days. Shorten also counselled the prime minister to tone down his rhetoric on China. “It’s one thing for Turnbull to pursue a politician’s agenda against another politician, and I wish that Senator Dastyari hadn’t given him the ammunition to do some of those attacks.” He said Turnbull needed to chose his words carefully because he spoke for Australia. “I know you’re worried by Kristina Keneally in Bennelong,” he said. “Remember, when you speak, you represent Australia on the world stage.” Shorten said the prime minister was “more interested in his own day-to-day survival than Australia’s future relationships in Asia but I think they’ve gone overboard now”. The Labor frontbencher Anthony Albanese noted that Dastyari had paid “a heavy price” for the rolling controversy about his linkages with Chinese political donors and he said Liberal MPs had cases to answer. “There are still people sitting in the House of Reps and the Senate who received donations from Huang Xiangmo,” he said. “Some hundreds of thousands of dollars have gone to the WA Liberal party for example that this week. We found out that a notice had gone out asking people to attend a fundraiser for the Liberal party where the guest speakers weren’t Liberal party ministers or shadow ministers, they were representatives of the Chinese government – so I think there are real questions to be asked there”. Albanese said the issue had been settled by Dastyari’s decision to quit politics but he lamented his departure. “Sam was a colourful figure,” he said. “I think we need more colourful figures in politics.” “I think one of the things about Sam was that he took things on. There was no first, second or third gear, it was always fourth or overdrive and that obviously created some issues with Sam’s judgment and he has paid a price for that.” It is not yet clear who will replace Dastyari in the Senate but it is possible he could be replaced by Kristina Keneally if she loses in Bennelong this Saturday. With the government zeroing in on that prospect, suggesting the former NSW premier is seat-shopping, Keneally has downplayed the prospect of moving into the vacated Senate seat. “Let me be clear – I’ve been offered Senate seats before by Labor and I’ve turned them down,” she said Tuesday."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/dec/13/japanese-kanji-of-the-year-is-north-thanks-to-kim-jong-un","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-13T04:36:56Z","webTitle":"Japanese kanji of the year is 'north' – thanks to Kim Jong-un","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/dec/13/japanese-kanji-of-the-year-is-north-thanks-to-kim-jong-un","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/dec/13/japanese-kanji-of-the-year-is-north-thanks-to-kim-jong-un","fields":{"headline":"Japanese kanji of the year is 'north' – thanks to Kim Jong-un","bodyText":"Every December the people of Japan select a kanji character that best sums up the social and political zeitgeist of the previous 12 months. After a year dominated by the regional nuclear crisis, there was perhaps only one serious candidate for word of the year 2017: north. The single character, pronounced kita in Japanese, encapsulates the country’s unease over North Korea’s advances in developing a nuclear arsenal, according to the Japan Kanji Aptitude Testing Foundation, which organises the annual poll. “It was the year in which people felt threatened and anxious by North Korea following repeated ballistic missile launches and a nuclear test,” the foundation said. A total of 7,104 people out of 153,594 voted for the character, which forms the first part of the Japanese name for North Korea – kita chosen. Alarm over Pyongyang’s missile programme reached its height in the summer when the regime sent two missiles over the island of Hokkaido, appropriately located in Japan’s far north. North Korea’s nuclear programme has figured prominently in Japanese political discussion since it launched a ballistic missile to coincide with Donald Trump’s meeting with the Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe, in February. In the autumn, Abe called a snap election and said would determine his approach to Japan’s two “national crises”: the growing elderly population and North Korea. The kanji announcement, broadcast live on TV, was made this week at Kiyomizu temple in Kyoto, where the head priest, Seihan Mori, wrote a giant version of the character with an ink-soaked calligraphy brush. Some have suggested that the choice was not only inspired by North Korea. Earlier this year some supermarket shelves were emptied of packets of crisps due to a potato shortage in Hokkaido, the northernmost island of Japan. Hokkaido again made the news earlier this month when Shohei Ohtani, who played for the local baseball team the Nippon Ham Fighters and has been likened to Babe Ruth, joined the US major league club the Los Angeles Angels. Previous kanji of the year have similarly reflected conflicting sentiments among the Japanese public. In 2016 they plumped for kin – a celebration of Japan’s 16 gold medals at the Rio Olympics, but a reminder too of the resignation of Tokyo’s governor, Yoichi Masuzoe, over an expenses scandal.

The Liberals’ margin of 10% in the seat has been whittled away by Labor’s high-profile candidate and Liberal attacks on Chinese political donors. From the electorate on Wednesday, the prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, warned that a vote for Keneally would take Bill Shorten one step closer to the prime ministership. “If John Alexander were to lose this seat, then Bill Shorten would be one step closer to being prime minister, and one step closer to being able to fully engage what he has described as his war on business,” Turnbull said. If the Liberals lose Bennelong on the weekend they will no longer have 75 seats, exactly half the House of Representatives, and will rely on support from independents to govern. It is also likely to further undermine Turnbull’s grip on the leadership. The Liberals’ increasingly aggressive campaign is a sign that they are now extremely worried about the seat. Newspoll on Tuesday showed that Bennelong was evenly balanced on 50-50 on the two-party preferred vote. It suggests that the Liberal party’s strident attacks on Labor senator Sam Dastyari over his relationships with the Chinese businessman and donor Huang Xiangmo may be having a negative impact. Shorten has branded Turnbull’s rhetoric as “China-phobic”. Speaking outside defence contractor Raytheon, whose office is at Macquarie Park in the heart of Bennelong, Turnbull denied his comments were alienating Chinese voters. “We are the most welcoming country in the world, the most successful multicultural society in the world,” he said. “You could not imagine modern Australia without the contribution of 1 million Australians with Chinese ancestry – one of whom, of course, is our granddaughter. “We have the strongest economic, family, social relationships with China and the Chinese people but all Australians, whatever their background, expect their leaders to put Australia first. “This is about Australia’s sovereignty. Everything we do is preserving and enhancing our sovereignty.” Alexander said Labor was running an unfair campaign and spreading lies about his record. “That is such a difficult thing for me to accept in the competition we are in,” he said. “There should be some rules and some standards.” But on Wedneday, the Liberal party upped the ante by launching a sharply negative website with the domain name kristinakeneally.com that highlights Keneally’s connections with the less savoury elements of the NSW Labor right faction, including Obeid and Macdonald, who are both serving time in jail for corrupt conduct. Keneally later gave evidence against them to the corruption watchdog, Icac. Turnbull defended the site. “Apparently Labor objects to us referring to that fact,” he said. “Well it is a fact. It is a historical fact. Her first two picks for cabinet – Obeid and McDonald – are in jail. That is a very relevant fact about her political career ... She has to live with her history, her political history.” Keneally did appoint Macdonald to cabinet but not Obeid. But Keneally dismissed the potentially damaging website as a waste of time by the Liberals. “Today we see a prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, who is making a fool out of himself,” she said. “Malcolm Turnbull stood up in front of the nation and admitted that he bought a website in my name, for the intent and purpose of smearing me, of spreading lies. Malcolm Turnbull’s website is wrong on the facts and he is wrong for the country. “I said yesterday that I thought this was going to get nasty off the back of the poll results and boy did Malcolm Turnbull come out and prove me right. “I mean, good on you, Malcolm. If you’ve got any other free time I’ve got some other household tasks you could take up.” Keneally said she had “ stopped” Obeid and Macdonald: “I testified against them and Icac praised my evidence.” Bennelong has seen a parade of senior ministers through the seat with announcements including $100m for a new transport hub. On Wednesday, Turnbull was flanked by his defence industries minister, Christopher Pyne, as he announced a new $20m defence contract, which he said would creating 50 new jobs at Raytheon. Labor is campaigning on education and health. Shorten accompanied Keneally to a press conference outside Ryde hospital and urged Turnbull to reverse the cuts to health funding including the freeze on Medicare rebates levels. The pair appeared to be determinedly on message, dismissing the smear campaign as a distraction. “It’s quite weird how obsessed he is by her candidacy,” Shorten said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2017/dec/13/jennifer-lawrence-to-star-in-film-adaptation-of-hannah-kents-burial-rites","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-13T02:48:17Z","webTitle":"Jennifer Lawrence to star in film adaptation of Hannah Kent's Burial Rites","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/dec/13/jennifer-lawrence-to-star-in-film-adaptation-of-hannah-kents-burial-rites","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2017/dec/13/jennifer-lawrence-to-star-in-film-adaptation-of-hannah-kents-burial-rites","fields":{"headline":"Jennifer Lawrence to star in film adaptation of Hannah Kent's Burial Rites","bodyText":"The Oscar-winning actor Jennifer Lawrence will reportedly star in and produce the upcoming film adaptation of the Australian author Hannah Kent’s award-winning 2013 novel, Burial Rites. Kent’s novel is based on the story of Agnes Magnúsdóttir, the last woman to be executed in Iceland in 1830. A farm worker, Magnúsdóttir was sentenced to death for her part in the murder of two men and, due to the structure of the Icelandic legal system, spent her last days at an isolated farmhouse with a family of upstanding citizens watching over her. Kent’s novel reimagines the story of these final months before Magnúsdóttir’s execution. Lawrence will play Magnúsdóttir in the film adaptation, Variety reports, which will be produced by TriStar Pictures. The American actor and star of the Hunger Games films and Silver Linings Playbook will be directed by Italian Luca Guadagnino, whose film Call Me By Your Name has been nominated for three Golden Globe awards. Kent expressed her enthusiasm for the casting choice on social media, saying on Twitter that Lawrence was “a tremendous talent”. The story of Magnúsdóttir has previously been made into a film for Icelandic audiences, 1995’s Agnes, which starred Icelandic actors Maria Ellingsen and Baltasar Kormákur. Burial Rites was one of the most talked-about Australian novels of 2013. Guardian reviewer Sarah Moss called it “beautiful and compelling”, while Observer reviewer Lucy Scholes said it was “a simple but moving story, meticulously researched and hauntingly told”. Kent’s second novel, The Good People, is set in a superstitious 19th century Irish village struggling to deal with a series of unexplained events."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/dec/14/greens-want-4-pay-rises-for-low-ranked-public-servants-to-boost-economy","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-13T17:00:08Z","webTitle":"Greens want 4% pay rises for low-ranked public servants to boost economy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/dec/14/greens-want-4-pay-rises-for-low-ranked-public-servants-to-boost-economy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/dec/14/greens-want-4-pay-rises-for-low-ranked-public-servants-to-boost-economy","fields":{"headline":"Greens want 4% pay rises for low-ranked public servants to boost economy","bodyText":"The Turnbull government could manufacture a vital lift in Australia’s stagnant inflation and wage growth by allowing low-ranked public service workers to receive an annual 4% pay rise for the next five years, according to the Greens. The Parliamentary Budget Office has costed the plan, seen by Guardian Australia, estimating it would cost the federal budget $963m. At the same time, the Greens want to rein in excessive pay for Australia’s most senior public servants by capping their total remuneration at five times the average earnings of full-time adults. They say the cap would reduce the maximum salary of the highest paid public servants to roughly $420,000, on current figures, and ensure public sector executives stop getting pay rises greater than those of average workers. The government is preparing to release its six-monthly update on the federal budget next week. Economists say the budget deficit is on track to be about $3bn to $4bn smaller at the end of 2017-18 – at roughly $25.8bn – than the government was expecting when the budget was released in May. The Greens have asked the Parliamentary Budget Office (PBO) to estimate how much it would cost the federal budget to give low-ranked public service workers an annual 4% to 5% pay rise for the next five years, in a bid to kickstart the economy’s stagnant inflation and wage growth. Peter Whish-Wilson, the Greens’ Treasury spokesman, said the commonwealth public service has not been immune from the trend towards excessive executive salaries in recent years, and rising income inequality between the average worker and bosses. He said since 2010, the salaries the senior executive service have risen 18%, and that of commonwealth departmental secretaries even more. Over the same period, the salaries of lower ranking public servants have risen just 13%. He says after the governor of the Reserve Bank, Philip Lowe, called on Australia’s workers in June to start demanding large pay rises from their bosses, saying the economy was suffering a “crisis” in wage growth, the commonwealth ought to kickstart the process by paying low-ranked public service workers more. The PBO says the salaries of public servants with Australian Public Service classification levels below the Executive Level 1 classification could receive an annual 4% pay rise for the next five years at the cost of $963m, or an annual 5% pay rise at the cost of $1.34bn. The costing assumes that the size of the Australian public service remains constant until 2027-28, and that the pay rises stop on 30 June 2023. The APS workforce comprises 152,095 employees (a 9% reduction from 167,331 in 2012), with 90% employed on an ongoing basis. At the moment, 73.8% of the workforce is employed below the Executive Level 1 classification. Whish-Wilson said such a plan would help to revive Australia’s historically low inflation, and reduce income inequality within the public service. “Government has the power over the public sector and can set a trend,” he said. “For years the argument against public sector pay increases has been that it would create a ‘wages breakout’. Now we have everyone from the RBA governor down essentially calling for a ‘wages breakout’. “A commitment from both federal and state governments to a minimum annual increase for their workers of 4% to 5% over the next five years would stimulate wages across the economy,” he said. Whish-Wilson also introduced a private members bill to the Senate last month which, if passed by parliament, would set a cap on the remuneration of the most senior public servants at five times the full-time adult average weekly earnings. He introduced the bill after the remuneration tribunal agreed in June to increase the remuneration for the commonwealth government’s departmental secretaries by another 2%. The remuneration tribunal ruling increased the total remuneration for Martin Parkinson, the secretary of the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet, to $878,940 (salary: $615,258), and John Fraser, the secretary of the Treasury, to $857,630 (salary: $600,341). The secretaries of the departments of defence, and foreign affairs, had their total remuneration increase to $831,000 (salary: $581,700), while the secretaries of finance, and health and ageing, had their remuneration increase to $788,380 (salary: $551,866). “The effect of this bill will be to reduce the maximum salary of executives in the public service to an amount, on current figures, in the order of $420,000,” Whish-Wilson told the Senate. “This is still a lot of money, and much more than most people earn.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/dec/30/fiona-patten-sex-party-name-served-its-purpose-now-its-time-for-reason","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-29T21:36:28Z","webTitle":"Fiona Patten: Sex party name served its purpose, now it's time for Reason","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/dec/30/fiona-patten-sex-party-name-served-its-purpose-now-its-time-for-reason","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/dec/30/fiona-patten-sex-party-name-served-its-purpose-now-its-time-for-reason","fields":{"headline":"Fiona Patten: Sex party name served its purpose, now it's time for Reason","bodyText":"When she was handing out how-to-vote cards at the July 2016 federal election, Fiona Patten realised it was time to change. Patten had been the Sex party’s first MP for close to two years and, from the upper house in Victoria, she had achieved things. She had proposed a parliamentary inquiry into voluntary assisted dying, an idea the Labor government under Daniel Andrews pursued. She had introduced a bill creating safe access zones around clinics that provided abortion, a move the late minister for women Fiona Richardson called “a significant contribution for women”. She had put up another bill to legalise and regulate ride-sharing companies such as Uber and again, the government had agreed. But people kept coming up to her at polling booths. “They said, ‘Congratulations, change your name, congratulations, change your name,’” says Patten over a coffee at the European restaurant, a political haunt opposite Parliament House. Membership had stalled and financial supporters were avoiding the party, in part because of the “look at me” name, perfect for getting attention when it launched in 2009 as the political arm of the sex industry, but a bit roll-your-eyes now. Patten says there was a shortlist of about 40 names and the party spent precious funds on market research. The Tulip party was in the mix. Another was the New Democrats, which is about where the party sits ideologically – progressive on social issues and pro-business – much as the Australian Democrats positioned in themselves the 1980s. They settled on the Reason party, now awaiting registration with the Australian Electoral Commission. On its website, Reason announces itself as a “movement for radical common sense”. There are more than 40 minor parties listed by the AEC, but Reason may prove to be significant. The Senate voting reforms before the 2016 election mean voters have greater say over where their preferences end up, rather than the little-known deals between tiny parties that made it possible to win a Senate spot with less than 1% of the vote. The game has changed. This year Cory Bernardi’s Australian Conservatives merged with Family First. The ABC’s election analyst, Antony Green, expects more mergers because “parties that occupy the same ideological space and compete against each will cut each other’s throat” under the new rules. There are a flurry of discussions going on about mergers, or alliances of some sort, or the sharing of resources to work on particular issues. Reason intends to be central to those discussions, emerging as a progressive, Democrat-style force in Australian politics. “We’re not going to see that number of small parties on the ballot ever again,” says Patten. “However, we’re not going to see the voters who didn’t vote for the major parties going back to them. I don’t think we’ll ever have the two-party system again.” It’s early days, she says, but “it’s people like the Secular party, like the Cyclists, the Progressives, the Arts party. There’s a whole range of them that pick up a couple of per cent [of the vote]. I don’t think they are all going to run again. “There are other organisations that wouldn’t want to go public right now that are very keen to have a reasonable voice in parliament, and they also want to counter One Nation and that conservative right.” Thinking big, Patten is inspired by French president Emmanuel Macron’s En Marche!, a movement as much as a political party. Already the Australian Cyclists party has endorsed Reason, announcing it will not stand candidates at the next federal election and urging its members to join Reason. Patten is talking to similar-minded independents in state parliaments, including the new Queensland independent Sandy Bolton. She plans to catch up with Senator Derryn Hinch over the summer break but she doubts if Reason would merge with Hinch’s Justice party. The deal-breaker for Patten is Hinch’s campaign for a national and publicly available sex offenders’ register. She can’t abide it. Hinch said in an email that, while the parties share some policy ideas, he has “absolutely no intention of joining the Reason party. Personally, I think her party name change was a mistake and almost ensures her demise.” Late in this parliamentary year the Victorian parliament debated laws to trial safe injecting rooms for drug users, based on Patten’s private member’s bill. She also released another bill, to make religious-owned businesses pay land and payroll tax, unless their work is involved in charity. The shareholder activist and anti-pokies campaigner Stephen Mayne has worked with Patten on attempts to amend the state government’s legislation to hand gambling venues 20-year licences. Patten proposed daily limits of $200 on eftpos withdrawals at pokies venues, and maximum bets of $1. The amendments were defeated but Mayne credits Patten with “getting the issues elevated – pivotal to that was her ability to cut through in the media and the upper house”. “It’s one thing to get elected and to sound off in the press and give speeches,” says Mayne. “It’s another thing to introduce legislation and then to go through the grinding process of negotiation and committees and drafting, and she’s done that with euthanasia, injecting rooms and the Uber bill, all of which were good pieces of legislation. “She is a rare beast because she’s a lefty but she believes in business as well … and she’s very charming.” Patten has been strategic in using her limited opportunities to introduce private member’s bills and attempt to refer issues to inquiries. The Andrews’ government lacks a majority in the upper house and relies on crossbench support to see legislation passed. There are five Greens, two Shooters and Fishers, one Australian Conservative MP (signed up by Cory Bernardi), a Vote 1 Local Jobs member and Patten. The Greens now have three lower house members after defeating Labor in the inner-city electorate of Northcote in a byelection last month. On social issues, Patten agrees with many Greens’ policies but she is curious about what impact they have had with their Victorian success. “For some reason they don’t seem to be proactive – they don’t put up pieces of legislation,” she says. “Even with the gambling, I put up numerous amendments to that. The Greens would say, ‘We’ve been calling for those amendments,’ but they’ve never done them. “The supervised injecting centre, and safe access zones, they said, ‘We’ve been calling for this for ages,’ but they’ve never in their time put up a bill to introduce either. I just don’t get it.” (The Greens declined to comment.) It is the Greens who pose the leftwing threat to Labor in the affluent Melbourne inner city, even though the state government is progressive. The parties loathe each other and Patten wonders if the Greens would prefer Labor not get progressive legislation passed, because it gives them a point of difference. “I don’t know whether it is because they don’t want the government to achieve it, where I’m more than happy for the government to achieve it because it means it gets done.” Patten says she’s more ambitious than she was when she was elected three years ago. Reason will stand at the next federal election, and hopes to win another seat or two at the Victorian election late next year. It needs to grow, she says, to go beyond social issues to have detailed policies on the economy, housing affordability, the environment. She says its key difference from Labor is that Reason believes strongly in the private sector – housing affordability, for instance, should be business-led. The party’s links with the sex industry have weakened as its interests have broadened. The Sex party was formed by the Eros Foundation to fight censorship. Patten says the industry lobby group now pays the salary of one staff member but party funding is much broader. Mayne says Patten has proved to be a hard-working, evidence-based politician. “She is trying to get up an alternative national party that is not of the right but not as far left as the Greens. She really is trying to resurrect the Democrats.” As for Patten, being a politician has been a revelation. “I’ve really enjoyed it,” she says. “I don’t mind hard work, but it’s probably more hours of the day then I ever thought possible. But I know I could do a lot more.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2017/dec/13/australia-to-bid-for-2027-rugby-world-cup-and-2021-womens-tournament","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-13T01:05:07Z","webTitle":"Australia to bid for 2027 Rugby World Cup and 2021 women’s tournament","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/dec/13/australia-to-bid-for-2027-rugby-world-cup-and-2021-womens-tournament","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/dec/13/australia-to-bid-for-2027-rugby-world-cup-and-2021-womens-tournament","fields":{"headline":"Australia to bid for 2027 Rugby World Cup and 2021 women’s tournament","bodyText":"Australia will bid to host the Rugby World Cup for a third time in 2027 and the women’s version for the first time, in 2021. Rugby Australia confirmed the dual bids on the same day it announced a new national women’s competition will kick off in 2018, and a day after Raelene Castle was installed as the organisation’s new chief executive. Australia has hosted the men’s World Cup twice before – in 1987, along with New Zealand, and 2003 – but never the women’s tournament, which has run every four years since its inception in 1991, and has never been held in the southern hemisphere. “The Women’s World Cup is growing from strength to strength off the back of an incredible tournament in Ireland this year and given Australia’s track record in hosting major events, we are supremely confident of delivering a tournament like no other in 2021,” Rugby Australia chairman Cameron Clyne said. The Australian Women’s Rugby team, the Wallaroos, finished sixth at the 2017 tournament, an event that saw record attendances and worldwide television audiences for the women’s game. RA also announced a domestic Super W competition of women’s XV rugby would run in March 2018 for six weeks and be contested between Queensland, NSW, ACT, Victoria, and Western Australia. “There has never been a more exciting time in the women’s game, and we are looking forward to the inaugural Super W competition kicking off in March before the second edition of the Aon Women’s University Sevens Series in August,” Clyne said. “These two competitions have strengthened the pathway for women’s rugby and are providing more opportunities than ever before for young girls and women to pursue their ambitions of playing the game at the highest levels and representing their country on the biggest stage, including the World Cup and the Commonwealth and Olympic Games.” In the statement, Clyne raised the NSW government’s controversial commitment to rebuilding Sydney’s stadiums, arguing that the resulting network of three rectangular venues would heighten Australia’s prospects of bringing the World Cups to Australia. When Australia last hosted the men’s Rugby World Cup, over 1.8 million spectators attended the 48 matches spread across 10 towns, and $300m was injected into the local economy. The 2023 men’s tournament will be held in France."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"us-news/2018/jan/16/us-childcare-parenting-mother-load","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-17T07:00:47Z","webTitle":"How America's 'childcare deserts' are driving women out of the workforce","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jan/16/us-childcare-parenting-mother-load","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/jan/16/us-childcare-parenting-mother-load","fields":{"headline":"How America's 'childcare deserts' are driving women out of the workforce","bodyText":"Not long after the 2016 election, Shelby McGowan got a somber phone call from her brother. “I’m so sorry,” he said. She replied: “About what?” “About your childcare expenses.” Just a few weeks earlier, Washington state voters had approved a statewide ballot initiative to raise the state’s minimum wage to $13.50 over four years. The measure was supported by voters who pictured a better quality of life for thousands of retail and food service workers. But few considered the economics of the daycare industry, which pays some of the lowest wages of any industry. Tuition at Advent Lutheran Child Center, the Spokane Valley daycare center where McGowan’s two children were enrolled, was about to go up by as much as $300 a month per family. And just like that, the entire state became the laboratory for a real-time experiment in the consequences of rising daycare costs. Washington state is a dramatic case, but not a total outlier. The cost of childcare and the cost as a share of families’ incomes have risen across the country for decades. Today, roughly one in four families spend more than 10% of their income on childcare, including more than half of families below the poverty line and two out of five families earning twice the poverty level. That’s if they can find licensed childcare at all. This summer, researchers at the Center for American Progress (CAP), a progressive thinktank, analyzed census data in 22 states and found that 51% of the population resides in “childcare deserts”. In those neighborhoods, the number of children under age five outnumber available daycare slots more than three to one. In response to this reality, countless families rely on relatives, unlicensed daycare, or schedules arranged so parents can trade off as caretakers. And study after study shows the burden falling more heavily on mothers, said Rasheed Malik, a policy analyst for the Center for American Progress. It’s women who are more likely to leave the workforce after becoming parents, often never to work full-time again. According to a recent comparison of policies across two dozen countries, it was access to affordable, reliable childcare, not flexible hours or new parent leave, that played the biggest role in closing the gender wage gap and ensuring that new mothers could remain in the workforce. At Advent in Washington state, the range of reactions varied. Some parents pulled their children out of its daycare program right away. Others, said Heidi Perry, who runs the daycare program, cut back on their hours at work in order to be home for their children. In some cases, children stayed home alone after school at a younger age that they might have otherwise. McGowan and her husband scaled back on contributions to their health savings account, their 401(k)s, and college savings plans. Dining out and family trips became non-starters. Friends quietly shopped for cheaper childcare options and left the program. “One day, I looked at the coat hooks, and some of the names were gone,” McGowan said. Perry ackowledged: “It’s a lot of money before you even account for the minimum wage increase … For some families, it became too much, and it was hard for us to see that.” In most other advanced economies, parents don’t pay for childcare by themselves but share the cost with the government, their employers, or labor unions. That’s usually not the case in the US, where in 2011, a typical two-income family paid more than twice their share of income toward childcare compared with families in other countries that belong to the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development. While some state and federal programs subsidize daycare, they have failed to keep childcare costs low for a majority of US families, Malik said. Existing policies, such as the childcare tax credit and flex spending accounts for daycare, disproportionately benefit parents who can afford childcare up front and pay substantial taxes. Proposals to extend help to more families have repeatedly died in Congress. What’s a family to do? One thing McGowan and her husband didn’t cut back on: their hours at work. McGowan made too much money to work less. By contrast, “it didn’t pencil” for her husband to keep working, but he wouldn’t feel comfortable giving up his job. “It’s those ingrained gender roles,” she said. “At least for him, he feels like he’s not contributing to the family if he’s not working.” She and her husband shopped for other options, but the very few centers that had openings for both their children didn’t impress them. Besides, she said, price shopping for her children’s welfare was difficult for her – and she wasn’t alone. Another parent, Chris McJimsey, felt no choice but to keep his son enrolled at Advent because he has developmental needs other daycare centers didn’t seem equipped to handle. “It was a big hit,” McJimsey said. “We’re a good, dual income household, but when you’re talking about $2,000, $2,500 extra a year, you’re definitely having to figure out where that money’s coming from.” One reason the impact was so profound is that childcare has historically been an exceptionally poorly paid profession. According to the University of California, Berkeley’s Center for the Study of Child Care Employment, the median hourly wage for childcare workers is $9.77. When the center ranked scores of occupations by earnings, childcare workers landed in the second-lowest percentile. “Most childcare workers would not be able to even afford the care they’re providing,” said Malik. The nature of the industry, he explained, is that a daycare center can charge more than college tuition, funnel most of that money toward labor, and still pay those providing care less than some fast-food workers. “You can’t scale and you can’t cut back, because the quality often comes from the ratio of children to providers.” On 1 January, the minimum wage rose again in Washington, to $11.50 an hour, and in 2020, it will make its last scheduled increase, to $13.50.

Chihuahua’s governor, Javier Corral, said on Monday that the federal government had withheld £30m to force state prosecutors to quash an investigation into allegations that president Enrique Peña Nieto’s Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) used shell companies to improperly finance election campaigns across Mexico in 2016. “It’s clear the money isn’t coming because of this investigation,” said Corral, who ousted the PRI in Chihuahua in 2016 with a right-left coalition of the opposition National Action party and Democratic Revolutionary party. “The Chihuahua government has acted against corruption. The Peña Nieto government is acting against the Chihuahua government,” he said. The accusations come as the country’s political parties are choosing candidates for the 1 July presidential election. Polls put the PRI in a distant third amid pervasive allegations of corruption. Last month, the Mexican newspaper Reforma and the New York Times reported that 240m pesos (£9.2m) earmarked for educational programmes in 2016 was allegedly diverted. Some was sunk into shell companies – contracted as education service providers by the state administration – as part of a scheme to finance PRI electoral campaigns. Alejandro Gutiérrez, a former PRI secretary-general, was arrested on 20 December and accused of participating in the scheme. Gutiérrez has denied wrongdoing. On Monday, the finance ministry issued a statement saying all state transfers had been made as normal. Peña Nieto also denied accusations of withholding funds, telling reporters the federal government worked closely with state governors “regardless of party affiliation”. PRI campaign manager Aurelio Nuño alleged on Monday that Gutiérrez had been tortured in custody – an accusation Corral called false. “We’ve touched the modus operandi of political corruption in Mexico,” said Corral, who alleged the finance minister, José Antonio González Anaya, informed him on 4 January the funds would not be flowing. Mexican state government finances depend heavily on transfers from the federal government as local tax collection is anemic, and analysts say presidents have used funding as a way of coercing governors. “What happened in Chihuahua … exposes how, when, where and through whom the PRI has diverted money to perpetuate itself in power,” wrote political science professor Denise Dresser in Reforma. “The finance ministry … pays out money with which elections are bought, governors corrupted and vendettas are aired out.” Corral took office after it was revealed his predecessor César Duarte had run up enormous debts. Duarte, who governed from 2010 to 2016, is among numerous state governors whose terms ended under clouds of corruption. At least four governors have been detained for graft offences over the past year. Duarte has left Chihuahua, where he is accused to embezzlement, but has called the accusations against him baseless and politically motivated. Since nearly a century of one-party rule ended in 2000, elections in Mexico have become increasingly competitive, prompting to parties to depend on vote-buying, analysts say. “Diverting public resources for political campaigns is increasingly common,” said Luis Pérez de Acha, a tax lawyer and member of the citizen coordinating committee of the National Anti-Corruption System. “Ten years ago, shell companies were used mainly for avoiding taxes, not for corruption or financing political campaigns. It was used a lot in 2012, and it worked very well – with total impunity.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2017/dec/13/chris-froome-team-sky-reputation-abnormal-drug-test","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-13T22:36:29Z","webTitle":"Chris Froome fights to save career after failed drugs test result","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/dec/13/chris-froome-team-sky-reputation-abnormal-drug-test","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/dec/13/chris-froome-team-sky-reputation-abnormal-drug-test","fields":{"headline":"Chris Froome fights to save career after failed drugs test result","bodyText":"Britain’s most successful road cyclist Chris Froome is fighting to salvage his reputation after a failed drugs test during his victory in the Vuelta a España in September. Following a joint investigation by the Guardian and Le Monde, which revealed that the 32-year-old had double the permitted levels of the asthma medication salbutamol in his body, the four-time Tour de France winner admitted that he had upped his dose of the drug during the race – but insisted he had not broken any rules. However, unless Froome can provide a sufficient explanation for the abnormal finding, or challenge the result, he is likely to be stripped of his Vuelta title by cycling’s governing body, the UCI, and could be given a ban from the sport of up to 12 months. Given that Team Sky also operates a zero-tolerance policy when it comes to failed tests, Froome’s future role in the team may also come under consideration. The Guardian understands that Froome and Team Sky have recruited a team of medical and legal experts to seek an explanation of the findings. In particular, they are examining whether Froome was dehydrated at the time, or whether there were other physiological factors that may have led to the failed test. One of the possibilities that will be offered to Froome is for a simulated test where he takes salbutamol and has his urine regularly assessed. However, informed sources expect the case to drag on for several more months – meaning Froome could still be under a cloud when he begins his season next spring. It is certainly a far cry from the elation Froome was feeling in September, when he spoke of his joy after becoming the first Briton to win the Vuelta, which also made him the first cyclist to claim the Tour de France/Vuelta double in the same year since 1978. Later in September he also won a bronze medal in the world time trial championships in Norway – a result he described as “an amazing end to an unforgettable season”. That period of sustained success led to him being nominated for this Sunday’s BBC Sport’s Personality of the Year award, where he was one of the leading contenders behind the boxer Anthony Joshua. But by then he had already failed a drug test, the result of which threatens to damage his reputation as one of Britain’s most successful athletes. That success had arrived late in Froome’s career. Until his mid-20s, his results were those of an average member of the peloton. However, the softly-spoken rider, who was born in Kenya but represents Britain, shot to prominence in 2011 with a second-place finish in the Vuelta. He explained his improvement had come about owing to the successful treatment of the parasitic flatworm bilharzia, which had robbed him of energy. The following year he won an Olympic bronze medal in London before securing his first Tour de France title in 2013. Such has been his dominance since, he now enjoys a £4m-a-year salary from Team Sky – making him the best-paid rider in the world. Yet he has never experienced the same affection that another home rider, Sir Bradley Wiggins, has enjoyed with the British public. Perhaps that has something to do with him having never lived in the UK, having grown up in Kenya and South Africa and then lived in Monaco for many years. Inevitably, given cycling’s troubled past with doping, Froome has also faced questions over whether he is clean, despite having never returned an abnormal drug test result before now. Such has been the vitriol at times that at the 2015 Tour de France one fan spat at him while another threw a bottle of urine in his face. The way he carried himself at the time earned him plenty of admirers and Froome has always vehemently insisted he is no cheat. Pointedly, when the Russian hackers Fancy Bears published documents showing that Wiggins had been granted therapeutic use exemptions for the powerful corticosteroid triamcinolone before three major races for a pollen allergy, Froome suggested his former colleague had been wrong. As he put it on his personal Twitter account last year, he was not prepared to “win at all costs”, adding “there are some athletes who not only abide by the rules that are in place, but also those of fair play”. Now, however, the spotlight is on him. Under World Anti-Doping Agency rules, riders are allowed a level of 1,000 nanograms per millilitre. However, Froome was found to have twice that amount in a urine sample taken during the Tour of Spain on 7 September. In a statement on Wednesday, he insisted that he had operated within the rules. “It is well known that I have asthma and I know exactly what the rules are,” he said. “I use an inhaler to manage my symptoms (always within the permissible limits) and I know for sure that I will be tested every day I wear the race leader’s jersey. “My asthma got worse at the Vuelta so I followed the team doctor’s advice to increase my salbutamol dosage. As always, I took the greatest care to ensure that I did not use more than the permissible dose. I take my leadership position in my sport very seriously. The UCI is absolutely right to examine test results and, together with the team, I will provide whatever information it requires.” Froome later admitted that the adverse test “comes as a big shock to people” and insisted his legacy had not been tainted. “I can understand a lot of people’s reactions, especially given the history of the sport. This is not a positive test,” he told the BBC. “The sport is coming from a very dark background and I have tried to do everything through my career to show that the sport has turned around.” If the test result is upheld Froome could face a significant ban, which may rule him out of next year’s Giro d’Italia and the Tour de France, where he was planning to go for a record-equalling fifth yellow jersey. In 2007 the Italian cyclist Alessandro Petacchi was given a 12-month ban for excessive salbutamol and stripped of his five stage victories in the Giro d’Italia. When asked for his reaction to the Guardian and Le Monde story, he said: “It’s an atomic bomb for cycling with Froome’s positive.” Tweeting on Wednesday, Froome added: “Thank you for all the messages of support this morning. I am confident that we will get to the bottom of this. Unfortunately I can’t share any more information than I already have until the enquiry is complete.” The test result is another blow for the credibility of Team Sky, who have struggled to recover their reputation after an anti-doping investigation was launched into allegations about a package delivered to Wiggins at a race in 2011. The UK Anti-Doping Agency closed its 14-month investigation in November after being unable to find sufficient evidence of wrongdoing. However, a second investigation by the digital, culture, media and sport select committee continues. Wiggins has always insisted that he is innocent and last month said his life was being made “a living hell” because of a “malicious witch-hunt” against him over the contents of the package. In a statement Team Sky said Froome received the notification of the adverse analytical finding from the UCI on 20 September, prior to the individual time trial event at the world championships. The team principal, Sir Dave Brailsford, said: “There are complex medical and physiological issues which affect the metabolism and excretion of salbutamol. We’re committed to establishing the facts and understanding exactly what happened on this occasion. I have the utmost confidence that Chris followed the medical guidance in managing his asthma symptoms, staying within the permissible dose for salbutamol. Of course, we will do whatever we can to help address these questions.” However the fact that Froome is battling to clear his name will only further ramp up the pressure on his beleaguered team – especially as it was built on the foundations of having a zero-tolerance drug policy. • Sign up to our weekly email, The Recap, here, showcasing a selection of our sport features from the past seven days. • This article was amended on 18 December 2017.

Jack Sargeant has announced he will apply to be Labour’s candidate in Alyn &amp; Deeside, north Wales, where a byelection is to be held in the new year following his father’s death. Sargeant said: “I’m standing to be a champion for our local community. They’ve stood with my family in difficult times and I want to repay them for their support and build on the hard work my dad did. “My dad was a local lad from Connah’s Quay and never lost his roots. That’s why people in Alyn and Deeside loved him and why we loved him. I grew up knowing how much he cared about his home and the people who live here and I want to carry on his legacy, keep delivering on the things he cared about.” Carl Sargeant was dismissed as cabinet secretary for communities and children on on 3 November following allegations of harassment. He apparently took his own life at the family home four days later. Sargeant’s family and friends have been highly critical of the way the Welsh first minister, Carwyn Jones, handled the situation, complaining that Sargeant did not know the nature of the allegations he was facing and had been left in limbo. Investigations have begun into how Jones handled the allegations, and whether news of his sacking was leaked. A third inquiry is to focus on allegations of bullying in the Welsh government. The final decision on whether Jack Sargeant will be the Labour candidate will be taken by local party members. “I never expected to be going into public life,” he said. “I studied engineering, not law or politics, but I think I can bring real-world experience into the Welsh assembly, and I think the assembly needs that. “I want to make a difference like my dad did, whether he was trying to get better housing for local people, to protect our environment by driving forward recycling plans across Wales and supporting green jobs, or standing up for women who had been subject to domestic violence, playing his part in getting a new law through the assembly to protect them.” Jones stayed away from Carl Sargeant’s funeral on the family’s wishes. Explaining why he was standing, Sergeant did not mention the first minister but said he had been pleased to meet Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour leader, at the funeral. “I’m a loyal Labour member, proud to be a Labour member,” he said. “It was an honour to meet Jeremy Corbyn when he came to dad’s funeral, but I’ll be my own man. I have my own principles and values. They’re Labour values. They’re about standing up for ordinary hard-working people.” The former Labour minister Leighton Andrews, who has been fiercely critical of Jones since Sargeant’s death, said there was support for Jack Sargeant across Wales. “Anyone who heard Jack speaking in the Connah’s Quay Labour club after his dad’s funeral will know that this is a determined young man who knows his own mind,” he said. “He has his own voice and values. Already support has been flooding in from all over the Labour party in Wales. His dad would be so proud.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2017/dec/11/steve-coogan-alan-partridge-brexit-bbc","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-11T00:01:06Z","webTitle":"Steve Coogan wrestled with including Brexit in Alan Partridge's return","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/dec/11/steve-coogan-alan-partridge-brexit-bbc","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2017/dec/11/steve-coogan-alan-partridge-brexit-bbc","fields":{"headline":"Steve Coogan wrestled with including Brexit in Alan Partridge's return","bodyText":"Realising that Britain had linked arms with Alan Partridge and voted for Brexit caused a crisis of confidence for his creator, Steve Coogan. It was only after some soul-searching that the comedian opted to include the decision to leave the EU in his alter ego’s return to the BBC. “The world has coalesced into a situation that is sympathetic to Alan, which for me is quite depressing,” Coogan told the Radio Times. “Sometimes I agree with Alan, but on Brexit I’m a remainer, and I feel quite conflicted about it. But the fact is having a fool praise something is a far more powerful indictment than just criticising it. “Alan can be like the boy who says the emperor’s wearing no clothes.” Partridge and Coogan are back on the BBC for an end-of-year special and a new series in spring 2018, following a few digressions into print and to Sky Atlantic, after Partridge’s career as sports commentator, presenter and pundit was shunted into the sidings of a professional life on Radio Norwich and domestic life in a motel room. Coogan has been playing Partridge for half his life, since the character was born in the 1991 Radio 4 comedy On The Hour. He crossed to television in The Day Today, but rapidly outgrew the sketch format, moving into Coogan’s Bafta-winning television show, I’m Alan Partridge. The comedian admitted much of Partridge is recognisably Cooganish and that the character allowed him to say things that would “probably be career-ending” if he came out with them. He described Partridge as an albatross around his neck until he started working on other projects including The Trip and the Oscar-nominated film Philomena. Coogan said he still has the character’s V-neck golf sweater, bought for £50 in 1991 and kept in a zipped bag in his home. He paid for it himself and said: “I never claimed back the tax on it. I get it out sometimes and stare at it, and think about how that investment worked.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/dec/11/mass-starvation-humanity-flogging-land-death-earth-food","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-11T06:00:14Z","webTitle":"Mass starvation is humanity’s fate if we keep flogging the land to death | George Monbiot","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/11/mass-starvation-humanity-flogging-land-death-earth-food","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/11/mass-starvation-humanity-flogging-land-death-earth-food","fields":{"headline":"Mass starvation is humanity’s fate if we keep flogging the land to death","bodyText":"Brexit; the crushing of democracy by billionaires; the next financial crash; a rogue US president: none of them keeps me awake at night. This is not because I don’t care – I care very much. It’s only because I have a bigger question on my mind. Where is all the food going to come from? By the middle of this century there will be two or three billion more people on Earth. Any one of the issues I am about to list could help precipitate mass starvation. And this is before you consider how they might interact. The trouble begins where everything begins: with soil. The UN’s famous projection that, at current rates of soil loss, the world has 60 years of harvests left, appears to be supported by a new set of figures. Partly as a result of soil degradation, yields are already declining on 20% of the world’s croplands. Now consider water loss. In places such as the North China Plain, the central United States, California and north-western India – among the world’s critical growing regions – levels of the groundwater used to irrigate crops are already reaching crisis point. Water in the Upper Ganges aquifer, for example, is being withdrawn at 50 times its recharge rate. But, to keep pace with food demand, farmers in south Asia expect to use between 80 and 200% more water by the year 2050. Where will it come from? The next constraint is temperature. One study suggests that, all else being equal, with each degree celsius of warming the global yield of rice drops by 3%, wheat by 6% and maize by 7%. These predictions could be optimistic. Research published in the journal Agricultural &amp; Environmental Letters finds that 4C of warming in the US corn belt could reduce maize yields by between 84 and 100%. The reason is that high temperatures at night disrupt the pollination process. But this describes just one component of the likely pollination crisis. Insectageddon, caused by the global deployment of scarcely tested pesticides, will account for the rest. Already, in some parts of the world, workers are now pollinating plants by hand. But that’s viable only for the most expensive crops. Then there are the structural factors. Because they tend to use more labour, grow a wider range of crops and work the land more carefully, small farmers, as a rule, grow more food per hectare than large ones. In the poorer regions of the world, people with fewer than five hectares own 30% of the farmland but produce 70% of the food. Since 2000, an area of fertile ground roughly twice the size of the UK has been seized by land grabbers and consolidated into large farms, generally growing crops for export rather than the food needed by the poor. While these multiple disasters unfold on land, the seas are being sieved of everything but plastic. Despite a massive increase in effort (bigger boats, bigger engines, more gear), the worldwide fish catch is declining by roughly 1% a year, as populations collapse. The global land grab is mirrored by a global sea grab: small fishers are displaced by big corporations, exporting fish to those who need it less but pay more. About 3 billion people depend to a large extent on fish and shellfish protein. Where will it come from? All this would be hard enough. But as people’s incomes increase, their diet tends to shift from plant protein to animal protein. World meat production has quadrupled in 50 years, but global average consumption is still only half that of the UK – where we eat roughly our bodyweight in meat every year – and just over a third of the US level. Because of the way we eat, the UK’s farmland footprint (the land required to meet our demand) is 2.4 times the size of its agricultural area. If everyone aspires to this diet, how exactly do we accommodate it? The profligacy of livestock farming is astonishing. Already, 36% of the calories grown in the form of grain and pulses – and 53% of the protein – are used to feed farm animals. Two-thirds of this food is lost in conversion from plant to animal. A graph produced last week by Our World in Data suggests that, on average, you need 0.01m2 of land to produce a gram of protein from beans or peas, but 1m2 to produce it from beef cattle or sheep: a 100-fold difference. It’s true that much of the grazing land occupied by cattle and sheep cannot be used to grow crops. But it would otherwise have sustained wildlife and ecosystems. Instead, marshes are drained, trees are felled and their seedlings grazed out, predators are exterminated, wild herbivores fenced out and other life forms gradually erased as grazing systems intensify. Astonishing places – such as the rainforests of Madagascar and Brazil – are laid waste to make room for yet more cattle. Because there is not enough land to meet both need and greed, a global transition to eating animals means snatching food from the mouths of the poor. It also means the ecological cleansing of almost every corner of the planet. The shift in diets would be impossible to sustain even if there were no growth in the human population. But the greater the number of people, the greater the hunger meat eating will cause. From a baseline of 2010, the UN expects meat consumption to rise by 70% by 2030 (this is three times the rate of human population growth). Partly as a result, the global demand for crops could double (from the 2005 baseline) by 2050. The land required to grow them does not exist. When I say this keeps me up at night, I mean it. I am plagued by visions of starving people seeking to escape from grey wastes, being beaten back by armed police. I see the last rich ecosystems snuffed out, the last of the global megafauna – lions, elephants, whales and tuna – vanishing. And when I wake, I cannot assure myself that it was just a nightmare. Other people have different dreams: the fantasy of a feeding frenzy that need never end, the fairytale of reconciling continued economic growth with a living world. If humankind spirals into societal collapse, these dreams will be the cause. There are no easy answers, but the crucial change is a shift from an animal- to a plant-based diet. All else being equal, stopping both meat production and the use of farmland to grow biofuels could provide enough calories for another 4 billion people and double the protein available for human consumption. Artificial meat will help: one paper suggests it reduces water use by at least 82% and land use by 99%. The next green revolution will not be like the last one. It will rely not on flogging the land to death, but on reconsidering how we use it and why. Can we do this, or do we – the richer people now consuming the living planet – find mass death easier to contemplate than changing our diet? • George Monbiot is a Guardian columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/dec/10/quit-hospital-boss-nhs-chair-kings-college-hospital-london","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-10T17:59:41Z","webTitle":"I’m quitting as a hospital boss: dire NHS funding problems give me no choice | Bob Kerslake","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/10/quit-hospital-boss-nhs-chair-kings-college-hospital-london","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/10/quit-hospital-boss-nhs-chair-kings-college-hospital-london","fields":{"headline":"I’m quitting as a hospital boss: dire NHS funding problems give me no choice","bodyText":"I have this weekend decided to stand down from my role as chair of King’s College hospital, London. This was not a decision that I took lightly. I love King’s and have the highest regard for the people who work there. But in the end I have concluded that the government and its regulator, NHS Improvement, are simply not facing up to the enormous challenges that the NHS is currently facing. This is especially true in London where the demands of a rapidly growing population are not being matched by the extra resources we need. King’s is a big teaching hospital that serves a population of more than one million people in south-east London. It provides world-class services such as neurosciences, haematology, liver, diabetes and cardiovascular, where it is a centre of excellence. King’s is also one of four major trauma centres and played a key role in the response to the Westminster and London Bridge attacks and the fire at Grenfell Tower. But most of all, it is the local hospital to a diverse and often deprived community. The hospital has struggled financially since it took on responsibility for another hospital, the Princess Royal University hospital in Bromley, in 2013. When I became chair in April 2015, the underlying annual deficit was in excess of £140m. Since then, major and positive changes have been made in how the hospital is run. Savings of £80m, twice the average of other hospitals, have been delivered in each of the last two years. Spending on expensive agency staff and consultants has been drastically reduced. Despite making savings, we have continued to perform well on cancer waiting times and have some of the best health outcomes in the country. But King’s, like many other hospitals, is fighting against the inexorable pressures of rising demand, increasing costs of drugs and other medical supplies, and the tightest spending figures in recent times. It was this squeeze that led Simon Stevens, the chief executive of the NHS, to argue publicly and rightly for an extra £4bn a year in the recent budget. In the event, the extra resources in the budget fell far short of that. Social care, critical to the health service because of its impact on discharges from hospital and facing an equal if not greater challenge, got nothing. After two years of delivering or getting close to the deficit target agreed with our regulator NHS Improvement, King’s has moved significantly away from its planned figure for this year. We’re far from alone – almost every hospital in London is struggling – but the scale of the deficit and the change means that we will be put into financial special measures. The secretary of state and the regulator normally extract a price for this at the top and King’s will be no different. We could fight back, but this puts King’s future at even greater risk. The right thing for me to do therefore is to step down and to do so publicly. Sadly, the reaction of the powers that be is often to shoot the messenger. So it is worth quoting here from the draft report of the independent Care Quality Commission following its recent inspection: “The chair was held in very high regard by staff at all levels. It was apparent the chair had gained the respect of staff with people reporting their approval at how the chair promoted the highest level of probity and governance and of how he demonstrated the organisation’s values and behaviours. Under his leadership the shape of the board was said to have changed to one where the right skills and vision was present at board level.” My two and a half years at King’s have been in equal parts inspiring and frustrating. There are undoubtedly things that I and the trust could have done better – there always are – but fundamentally our problems lie in the way that the NHS is funded and organised. We desperately need a fundamental rethink. Until then we are simply “kicking the can down the road”. • Bob Kerslake was chairman of King’s College hospital, London.

The cabinet minister, who is leading the UK’s negotiations with the EU, said he and Theresa May were seeking a deal that was best described as a “Canada plus plus plus” arrangement. That meant taking the best elements of deals already struck with countries such as Canada, Japan and South Korea, he said, and adding in services that were key to the British economy. “The odds of a WTO or no-deal scenario have dropped dramatically,” he said, admitting that he may not have been able to make that statement if last week’s negotiations had ended in deadlock, delaying trade talks until at least March. Davis also made clear that the promised divorce bill, which is expected to be between £35bn and £39bn, would be paid only once a trading arrangement had been agreed. “No deal means we won’t be paying the money,” Davis told the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show. The comments represented a slapdown to the chancellor, Philip Hammond, who claimed just days ago that it was “inconceivable that we as a nation would be walking away from an obligation that we recognised as an obligation”. The Brexit secretary said the substantive details of a trading arrangement must be in place by March 2019, although he conceded that “some minor negotiations” might continue as the UK entered a transitional period. He said the deal could not be formally signed until Britain had left the EU, but that it could be done “one minute, or one second after we leave”. Asked how Britain hoped to achieve its aims of a trade deal in eight months when it had taken Canada many years, Davis reiterated the government’s position that it is easier for the UK given that it already had the same standards as the EU. He said it was highly significant that the divorce agreement referred to “full alignment”. “It was changed from no divergence and that’s the point. No divergence would have meant taking cut and paste rules,” he said. Davis said, however, that full alignment would only affect a few sectors, such as agriculture, road and rail, and would mean the UK achieving certain outcomes but not necessarily in the same way as the EU did. “We are not looking to create a circumstance where animal welfare is worse in Britain than elsewhere or, safety of food is worse or pollution of waterways,” he said. Asked about Michael Gove’s suggestion that future governments could take the UK in a different direction with regards to the trade deal, Davis said that was a statement of the obvious. “Any new government is elected on a mandate of its own. That is a function of democracy. There could be consequences,” he said, admitting that could mean renegotiating elements of a deal."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2017/dec/10/robots-can-set-us-free-says-labour-tom-watson-automation","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-10T22:32:53Z","webTitle":"Robots can set us free and reverse decline, says  Labour's Tom Watson","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/dec/10/robots-can-set-us-free-says-labour-tom-watson-automation","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/dec/10/robots-can-set-us-free-says-labour-tom-watson-automation","fields":{"headline":"Robots can set us free and reverse decline, says  Labour's Tom Watson","bodyText":"Labour’s Tom Watson will call on society to “embrace an android” as he argues that the rise of automation in the workplace need not cause mass unemployment and should instead be welcomed. The party’s deputy leader will make the comments at the launch of the final report of the Future of Work Commission, which has concluded that people should not fear the “march of the robots”. Instead, it claims that if government investment is sensibly targeted, the technological revolution has the potential to reverse the UK’s economic decline and create as many jobs as it destroys. Watson, who convened and co-chaired the commission, is expected to say: “Much has been written about the impact of technological change and the dystopian future we could all face as a result of the rise of the robots. “It can sometimes feel like we are preparing for a world in which artificial intelligence, algorithms and automation, rather than human endeavour and hard work, will shape every aspect of our society and our economy. That sounds like a frightening prospect. But it needn’t be.” He will argue that allowing “21st-century machines” to take on the heavy lifting and routine tasks of the future will let the human workforce focus on activities that generate larger economic benefits. “That is liberating. So I suppose what I’m really saying is: robots can set us free ... A former prime minister once famously said ‘hug a hoodie’. Today, I’m asking you to embrace an android,” Watson will say. However, the study admits that taking advantage of the change requires ensuring the workforce is ready to take on jobs that need a different array of skills. The commission has brought together experts including the Nobel prize-winning economist Sir Christopher Pissarides, and Michael Sandel and Michael Osborne, professors from Harvard University and Oxford University respectively. They conclude that Britain’s low productivity, falling wages and inequality are down to poor government decisions, rather than the result of automation. Instead, they say “mass technological unemployment is highly unlikely”. However, to avoid problems, they call for action to prevent the growing gap between high-skilled and low-skilled workers, and in particular for “future-oriented planning” when investing in skills that will be necessary for a future workplace. Recommendations include a specific artificial intelligence curriculum to be developed for secondary schools, including ethics training, alongside a universal, lifelong future skills account that would help people retrain over their working lifetime as workplace demands shift. They also urge changes to tax and business rates regimes to incentivise companies to invest more in new technologies, an increase in research and development, and expanding employment protections to all workers including agency staff and contractors. Helen Mountfield QC, who co-chaired the commission, said: “Advances in robotics and artificial intelligence don’t need to spell the end of work. But we cannot sit passively by letting technological change just happen. “We need to decide what sort of future we want and make policy choices, design education and introduce a legal architecture to shape a future of good work which benefits everyone, in which the rewards of innovation are fairly shared.” The report comes after it was claimed that at least one-fifth of jobs across Britain were at high risk of being automated, rising to 40% in some parts of the country. The prediction by the Future Advocacy thinktank followed a warning from PricewaterhouseCoopers that more than 10 million workers were at high risk of being replaced by robots. There is little evidence of mass fears in the UK of being pushed aside by automation, but a survey has found that more than 70% of Americans are wary about a world in which machines perform tasks previously carried out by humans. The report comes as John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, launched another study that claims the UK’s financial system is failing to deliver investment to the high technology sector. The interim report, produced by Graham Turn of GFC economics, found that UK output from high-tech industries has fallen over the last 10 years. “Under the Tories, we’ve seen more and more investment flowing into property speculation whilst high-tech firms have been starved of the money they need, and research spending has lagged far behind,” said McDonnell. Turner said the worry was that regional inequality would rise due to a disproportionate number of tech companies being based in London and the south-east, and said there was also too little money spent on research and development. “The pace of automation and technological change is accelerating, threatening established business models and creating an economy characterised by frequent ‘disruptive’ episodes. Analysis shows that banks are diverting resources away from industries vital to the future of this country,” Turner said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2017/dec/11/call-for-more-hospital-beds-to-cope-with-winter-breathing-difficulties","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-11T07:01:15Z","webTitle":"Call for more hospital beds to cope with winter breathing difficulties","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/dec/11/call-for-more-hospital-beds-to-cope-with-winter-breathing-difficulties","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2017/dec/11/call-for-more-hospital-beds-to-cope-with-winter-breathing-difficulties","fields":{"headline":"Call for more hospital beds to cope with winter breathing difficulties","bodyText":"Hospitals need to provide more beds in the winter months to deal with the rising numbers of adults and children who struggle to breathe, according to a report that warns this is a major cause of the crisis in accident and emergency departments. The report from the British Lung Foundation says more and more people are ending up in an already hard-pressed A&amp;Es because of the increase in breathing problems caused by air pollution, an ageing population and the long-term effects of heavy smoking. In the last seven years, lung disease admissions to hospitals in England and Wales have risen at over three times the rate of all other conditions, says the report. They are at their worst in the winter, often complicated by seasonal flu. The foundation is calling for hospitals to be better prepared for this predictable surge in the number of cases. Only 10% of hospital trusts who responded to an FOI request had plans in place to make more beds available for respiratory patients, it says. “Year after year we are seeing an influx of patients admitted to A&amp;E with respiratory conditions,” said Dr Penny Woods, the chief executive of the foundation. “Despite this our analysis reveals that many hospitals are woefully unprepared. This is at a great cost to patients who suffer as a result. Taking a more seasonal approach to supporting people with lung disease will reduce needless attendances and admissions and ultimately improve patient care and outcomes.” More people go to A&amp;E in the summer, but mostly with injuries that do not require a stay in hospital. Those who arrive struggling for breath in the winter when the cold causes a tightening of the chest, making them feel as if they are drowning, are more likely to need a bed. Flu can cause serious complications for people who already have breathing problems, but the numbers of people needing medical help rises whether or not there is a bad flu season. In 2015-16, more than 676,000 adults and children arrived at A&amp;E with respiratory conditions and 41% needed to be admitted to hospital. The most common problems are pneumonia, lower respiratory tract infections, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and bronchiolitis in children under five. “Lung disease has always had a much larger impact on the health service than most people think. The third most common cause of death, lung disease costs the NHS and patients around £9.9bn each year,” writes Woods in a foreword to the report. “Sadly, it’s working its way up the NHS agenda for the worst reasons. Unlike other major disease areas, our lung disease mortality rate hasn’t improved in over a decade. We now have the fourth highest in Europe.” The report recommends more effort to prevent illness, including ensuring people get a flu jab and are followed up when they leave hospital. It says that more beds need to be made available in the winter months. And it calls for political action. “Government and NHS England need to take on board measures to tackle this seasonable and predictable crisis and support a Taskforce for Lung Health. This will improve all aspects of care for the 12 million people with lung disease,” said Woods. NHS England said the report highlights why it is urging people with acute respiratory conditions, such as lung complaints, to get their flu jab and to keep warm in the cold weather. In winter, respiratory hospital admissions double from 1,000 to 2,000 a day. Around one-third of excess winter deaths are due to respiratory illnesses. For every one-degree drop in temperature below five degrees, there is a 10% rise in elderly people presenting with breathing problems. “The NHS has robust plans in place this winter to manage expected increased pressures, such as surges in demand from the frail and elderly and those with long-term conditions, and will always have beds available for the sickest patients,” said a spokesman. Dozens of NHS hospitals had to issue black alerts last winter, unable to cope with the demand for beds. NHS England is under great pressure to prevent another meltdown and has ordered NHS Trusts to ensure no patients are kept waiting on trolleys in corridors or in the back of an ambulance. Emergency doctors have warned that trying to deliver to performance targets will be “nigh-on impossible” in departments with too few beds that are underfunded and under-staffed. NHS Trust chief executives have warned that some hospitals are already running on as high as 99% bed occupancy, when 85% is considered the safe limit."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"stage/2017/dec/11/daisy-pulls-it-off-review-park-theatre-london","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-11T17:00:10Z","webTitle":"Daisy Pulls It Off review – snobs, chums and scrummy tussles in schoolgirl tales spoof","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/dec/11/daisy-pulls-it-off-review-park-theatre-london","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2017/dec/11/daisy-pulls-it-off-review-park-theatre-london","fields":{"headline":"Daisy Pulls It Off review – snobs, chums and scrummy tussles in schoolgirl tales spoof","bodyText":"Denise Deegan’s parody of period schoolgirl fiction became an unlikely commercial hit in 1983. But, although it has now been revived with great brio as a seasonal diversion, I wonder whether it will make the same impact. Does anyone today, except a few nostalgic oldsters, still read the breathless stories of Angela Brazil on which it is palpably based? Deegan seeks to inject some social comment into proceedings by making the eponymous heroine an impoverished scholarship girl who wins a prized place at the posh Grangewood School. Falsely accused of being a liar, a cheat and a sneak and obdurately confronting a wall of snobbery, Daisy eventually wins out. She sticks with her one true chum, proves brilliant academically, sings like an angel and caps it all by being a star on the hockey pitch and discovering lost treasure. The tone and lingo are exactly right: this is a world of “scrummy tussles”, “inter-dormifights” and girls who are afraid, on the games field, to prove “a frightful muff”. Paulette Randall stages it elegantly with the aid of six chairs, a stepladder and a good deal of imagination as in a wind-strewn cliff-top rescue evoked through billowing skirts. In an enthusiastic, seven-strong cast, Anna Shaffer sensibly plays it straight as the aspirational Daisy, giving everyone else licence to go over the top. Pauline McLynn is the funniest as Daisy’s staunch, brow-beating ally, but there is lively support from Clare Perkins as a deep-throated bully, Shobna Gulati as the even more sinister Sybil and Freddie Hutchins doubling as the gymslipped Belinda and a dubious Russian music teacher. Yet a two-and-a-half-hour spoof proves rather too much of a good thing: I began to pine for the economy of the stage version of The 39 Steps or, going even further back, the brisk, schoolgirl monologues of the late, much-lamented Arthur Marshall. Deegan also seems visibly enthralled by the very thing she is satirising. The play ends up as a plea for widening the access to public schools without ever questioning their legitimacy in the modern age. Despite the double entendre in the title, the play is clean as a whistle and harmless fun, but somewhat relentless in its gaiety. At Park theatre, London, until 13 January.

Billy Irving, 37, touched down at Glasgow airport on Wednesday, the first of the so-called Chennai Six to arrive back in the UK after they were jailed in the southern Indian city on weapons charges. He and five other former British servicemen were working as security guards on the American-owned anti-piracy vessel the MV Seaman Guard Ohio in the Indian Ocean when they were detained in 2013. They were charged with carrying unlicensed firearms and ammunition. The men insisted they had been granted permits by the UK’s Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, something the head of export controls eventually confirmed to the Indian authorities. After years of campaigning, the men won an appeal against their convictions last month and were given permission to leave India, flying back to the UK earlier this week. Speaking to the Mail on Sunday, Irving said: “I can never forgive the UK government and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office,” he said. “We would have been freed much sooner if they had really engaged in our plight and fought for us. I feel disgusted and betrayed.” The six Britons – Irving, Nick Dunn from Ashington, Northumberland, Ray Tindall from Chester, Paul Towers from Pocklington, east Yorkshire, John Armstrong from Wigton, Cumbria, and Nicholas Simpson from Catterick, North Yorkshire – were arrested and detained along with three Ukrainians, 14 Estonians and 12 Indians when customs officials and police searched their ship. Irving’s fiancee, Yvonne MacHugh, who worked with the other men’s families and friends to campaign for their release, described former foreign secretary Philip Hammond as “next to useless and uninterested at best”. She accused Boris Johnson, Hammond’s successor, of hypocrisy for saying the Foreign Office (FCO) had worked on the case “unstintingly”. “For Boris Johnson to hint that he had some part in their return is the height of hypocrisy,” she said. “I’ve written to him a number of times asking for a meeting and never had a reply. How dare he.” “I will never forgive the FCO. At times, their lack of interest just made everything worse. They put business ventures before lives. They complicated situations and moved goalposts. They would offer to help, then didn’t follow up. They’ve never said, ‘Sorry, we messed up’. Billy and the other men would have been free two years ago if the FCO had been truly there for us.” During his four years in prison, Irving – from Paisley, Renfrewshire – contracted dysentery and lost 19kg (three stones). He described the experience as an “unbelievable nightmare” and spoke of his sorrow over not seeing his young son, William, grow up. He had only seen his son three times before his release this week. “To finally smell fresh air and feel cold, wet rain on my face is the most fantastic feeling in the world,” he said. “Now I just want to get to know my son, focus on being a proper father and spend time with my family.” The UK government said the case had been raised more than 50 times at ministerial level and nine times with the Indian PM since October 2013. A FCO spokeswoman said: “The UK government was delighted that the men were released and the foreign secretary also paid tribute to those who campaigned for them. “The Foreign Office worked tirelessly behind the scenes to reunite these men with their families. This included lobbying on their behalf, visiting them in prison, updating their families and maintaining close contact with their legal team.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2017/dec/10/labour-backs-easy-movement-of-eu-workers-after-brexit-says-keir-starmer","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-10T14:03:25Z","webTitle":"Labour backs 'easy movement' of EU workers after Brexit, says Keir Starmer","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/dec/10/labour-backs-easy-movement-of-eu-workers-after-brexit-says-keir-starmer","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/dec/10/labour-backs-easy-movement-of-eu-workers-after-brexit-says-keir-starmer","fields":{"headline":"Labour backs 'easy movement' of EU workers after Brexit, says Keir Starmer","bodyText":"Keir Starmer has said Labour is prepared to consider ongoing payments to the EU and accept the “easy movement” of workers in order to secure the benefits of the single market and customs union. The shadow Brexit secretary said his party’s ambitions for a close economic relationship with the EU also meant continued alignment of regulations and standards. He accepted that Labour was seeking something that would look like a “Norway style agreement for the 21st century”. And although he was clear that the party was not calling for a second referendum, he would not fully rule it out in the future. Speaking about what type of Brexit Labour wanted, Starmer said: “Do we want full participation of the single market? Yes we do. Do we want the full benefits of the customs union? Yes we do.” Speaking on the BBC’s Andrew Marr show, he said the party’s starting point would be viable options such as “staying in a customs union and a single market variant which means full participation of the single market”. Addressing the fact that the free movement of workers is one of the four freedoms linked to the single market, often described as indivisible, Starmer said rules on immigration could not stay the same. However, he added: “The end of free movement doesn’t mean no movement. Of course we would want people to come from the EU to work here, we would want people who are here to go to work in the EU.” Asked if that was best described as “easy movement if not free”, he replied, “yes, of course”. Starmer also accepted that Norway pays in money, saying: “There may have to be payments that has to be negotiated.” On regulations, he said: “What underpins access to the single market and customs union is a level playing field – if you want the benefits you have to stay on the same level playing field. The Labour party doesn’t have a problem with that. “We don’t want to deregulate. We don’t want to cut workplace, environmental rights. We are very comfortable staying on a level playing field.” Starmer insisted that Theresa May’s deal, struck last week over divorce arrangements for Brexit, had set her government on track to also want to replicate the benefits of the customs union and single market. He said that she was being unrealistic when she said that leaving the two blocs remained a red line alongside a promise for a soft Irish border. “You can’t sweep the customs union and the single market off the table on the one hand and also say you don’t want a hard border in Northern Ireland,” said Starmer. “And that is exactly the conclusion of the negotiations this week.” Those around Jeremy Corbyn are nervous about Labour becoming too committed to the single market because of fears that it could have a knock-on effect in some of the party’s key heartland constituencies, where there was a large majority to leave the EU. The leader himself has argued that membership could prevent Britain from taking advantage of Brexit by spending money on state aid, for example. It came as the SNP’s Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, called on Corbyn to get behind efforts to keep Scotland and the UK in a European single market and customs union to protect jobs. Calling for a meeting to discuss a joint approach, the MP for Ross, Skye and Lochaber urged the Labour leader to put aside party politics and secure a parliamentary majority for the move. He said Labour needed to “stop equivocating”. “We are now at a critical point in the Brexit negotiations. Extreme Tory plans to drag the UK out of the single market would cause economic catastrophe – costing the country hundreds of thousands of jobs, and hitting people’s incomes, livelihoods and living standards for decades to come,” he said. The Scottish National party leader, Nicola Sturgeon, also pressed Corbyn on the issue. “I think the majority exists in the House of Commons if Labour gets its act together, and I think the majority exists across the whole of the UK to stop that happening. The sensible compromise option and the least damaging option for our economy is to stay within the single market and the customs union so everyone who is of that view should come together and make that happen,” she said at first minister’s questions last week. This latest intervention reflects a growing confidence among the SNP leadership that they can rebuild support for the Scottish government’s stance on Brexit, after linking it directly with a second independence referendum proved so damaging in June’s general election. The SNP assumes that special terms for Northern Ireland will fuel public anger that the Conservatives have no mandate to enforce a harder line for Scotland, given the country’s majority support for remain and continued consensus that preserving the closest possible economic ties with Europe is the most desirable outcome. Both Sturgeon and Blackford’s calls for the devolved governments to be more fully involved in negotiations at stage two indicates a continuing frustration that Scotland has been sidelined in Brexit discussions so far, and most keenly felt now that expected talks on joint frameworks at the joint ministerial committee this week in London will have been superseded by the new regulatory framework agreed by May on Friday."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/dec/11/morning-mail-australias-carbon-emissions-reach-record-levels","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-10T19:49:40Z","webTitle":"Morning mail: Australia's carbon emissions reach record levels","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/dec/11/morning-mail-australias-carbon-emissions-reach-record-levels","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/dec/11/morning-mail-australias-carbon-emissions-reach-record-levels","fields":{"headline":"Morning mail: Australia's carbon emissions reach record levels","bodyText":"Good morning, this is Mike Ticher, standing in for Eleanor Ainge Roy, bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Monday 11 December. Top stories Australia’s emissions over the past year were the highest on record, when relatively unreliable emissions from land use are excluded, according to estimates by the carbon consultancy NDEVR Environmental. The latest quarter showed the second highest rise for any quarter since 2011, despite electricity emissions being driven down by wind generation. Emissions from transport were at record levels, with jumps in the use of diesel and aviation fuel. The government’s official release of data on emissions is now six months behind and NDEVR Environmental’s estimates attempt to mirror its methodology. Released in partnership with Guardian Australia, the results have proved very accurate when compared with data eventually released by the government. The ever-increasing emissions are taking Australia further from both its carbon-reduction commitments made in Paris and the much bigger reductions recommended by the government’s Climate Change Authority. In both 2015 and 2016, the government held on to the data showing rising emissions for months before quietly releasing it in the days before Christmas. The Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has arrived in Europe on his first foreign trip since US recognition of Jerusalem as the the country’s capital triggered a wave of condemnation and protest. A 25-year old man was seriously injured in stabbing attack in Jerusalem as tensions remained high between Israelis and Palestinians. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, hosted Netanyahu for a working lunch in Paris on Sunday, where he was expected to challenge the Israeli prime minister to explain whether he still supported a two-state solution or regarded continued occupation of the West Bank as a viable long-term solution. Macron has been leading the criticism of the US decision. Australia’s deforestation and land-clearing crisis is spreading from the east coast to the Northern Territory, where land targeted for clearing has increased nearly tenfold in just a few years. Applications for enormous amounts of clearing have been approved in the past two years, with the trees set to be burned and regrowth controlled with toxic herbicides. On one station alone, an area about one-fifth the size of the ACT is planned to be cleared, most of it to accommodate more cattle. Changes to laws in NSW are also expected to dramatically increase rates of clearing there and Australia’s richest graziers are eyeing the pristine Kimberley region of WA as the next frontier to strip of native vegetation. Thirteen companies that paid no tax in 2015-16 made $1.7m in political donations to the Liberal and Labor parties in that year, the Greens say. On Thursday the tax office released fresh tax data that showed 36% of the 2,043 largest public companies and multinational entities in Australia paid no tax in 2015-16. Last week the government announced new laws to combat foreign interference, including by banning foreign political donations. The Greens leader, Richard Di Natale, said: “Our democracy is broken when 13 companies have paid zero dollars in tax but can still find $1.7m to donate to the Labor and Liberal parties. This information exposes that simply cracking down on foreign donations will not end the influence of big money over our political system.” The most hotly anticipated and controversial Russian ballet in years has had its premiere as Moscow’s Bolshoi Theatre finally staged Nureyev, which tells the life story of the dancer. The theatre’s best dancers took to the stage on Saturday night with much of the Russian elite in the audience. But the ballet’s director, Kirill Serebrennikov, was conspicuously absent, having spent the past few months under house arrest. Nureyev’s summer premiere was cancelled at the last minute, with speculation that gay themes in the ballet may have angered some government figures. Rudolf Nureyev, who began his career at St Petersburg’s Mariinsky Theatre – known as the Kirov in Soviet times – is widely regarded as ballet’s most gifted male dancer. He defected to the west in 1961, had gay relationships and died from an Aids-related illness in 1993 aged 54. Sport Two goals from set pieces have given Manchester City a 2-1 win over their local rivals United, stretching their lead at the top of the Premier League to a monstrous 11 points. In the Merseyside derby a Wayne Rooney penalty rescued a 1-1 draw for Everton. As the Ashes series moves to Perth, with England in disarray, Ali Martin looks back at the history of the Waca ground, which will host its last Test on Thursday. “Even when empty, a stroll around the Waca is an evocative one. Though the seats are sun-bleached, the paint peels off in many places and the slightly ramshackle facilities are a throwback to the past, this outgoing Ashes venue still feels mighty special.” Thinking time In 2015, when two cyclones battered the northern coast of Arnhem Land in less than a month, many remote homelands had just two ways to get news: a payphone or Yolŋu Radio. During Cyclone Lam, the category-four storm that made landfall first near Elcho Island, announcer Sylvia Ŋulpinditj, production manager Gaia Osborne and another colleague delivered more than 170 cyclone updates in Yolŋu languages, working around the clock from the Darwin studio. The station – run by the ARDS Aboriginal Corporation – broadcasts across more than 40,000 sq km of Yolŋu country, including the six major communities of north-east Arnhem Land and 15 homelands where, for many, it is the only freely available media source. Taylor Swift sums up the two biggest issues for journalism in 2017, control and trust, writes Jane Martinson. In one sense, her desire for control is an affront to journalism’s ability to seek out truth and hold the powerful to account – and Swift is powerful. But at the same time it’s hard not to have some sympathy for her decision to do things on her own terms. Swift is far from some sort of Instagram Joan of Arc, carrying the sword of truth and justice. She hasn’t always got everything right, and her brand of feminism has justifiably been a lightning rod for many who argue that white women, notably rich ones, ignore the problems of others while appropriating their contributions. But speaking up for yourself and not letting somebody else do it for you is a powerful message for many young women, Martinson argues. Parliament may have finished for the year, but the dual citizenship crisis is not going away. The first Labor politicians to be referred, Katy Gallagher and David Feeney, are off to the high court early next year. And there could be more referrals after that. The next wave of cases is likely to focus on the question of whether MPs and senators did everything they could to renounce their other citizenship before they nominated to stand.

The joke is funny not just for being rude about Fairy May’s age, but because it’s close to being true. The last time Stewart was a small-screen regular was in the 1980s, when he starred in a run of ITV light-entertainment shows such as Copy Cats and Chain Letters. That speaks volumes not only about the success of this, the Edinburgh King’s panto, but of pantomimes across Scotland. Stewart is the co-star and driving force behind a show that packs them in for a full eight weeks. This is the 22nd time he’s appeared in the King’s panto, including four times in Cinderella alone. He couldn’t sustain popularity like that if his audience was hoping to see his old impressions of Esther Rantzen. Never mind the children, there are parents who weren’t born when he hosted Grampian TV’s Patter Merchants. No, the reason audiences come in their droves has nothing to do with television celebrity. They come because Stewart is good at panto. The same is true of his co-stars. It feels like an incidental detail that Andy Gray has been a regular in the Scottish soap opera River City for the past 18 months. Who cares about that when he’s such a hilarious dropped-octave Buttons? And although the memory of Grant Stott’s long stint as a daytime presenter on Forth 1 brings some authentic local colour, the crowds turn out because he’s grown into one of the country’s most imposing baddies. His role as Baroness Hibernia Hardup builds on 17 years at the hiss-and-boo coalface. Elsewhere in the UK you will see audiences tempted into the theatre with the promise of boy-band veterans, X Factor runners-up and reality-TV drop-outs. But rarely in Scotland. Here, where the music-hall tradition lingers on (Stewart hosts his own Big Big Variety Show), the demand for fly-by-night novelty acts scarcely registers. Like York’s Berwick Kaler, headline panto acts in Scotland still build their reputations on their live work. A case in point is Elaine C Smith at the King’s in Glasgow. In other circumstances, you might have expected the odd gag about her being the wife of Rab C Nesbitt, but here, that’s of no importance. Of paramount concern is that Fairy Bella Houston is back in her home city after an eight-year stint at His Majesty’s, Aberdeen. Thus, the story of this Sleeping Beauty plays out with a hierarchical pecking order, introducing us to pauper, princess, king and queen and only then to Smith, who declares, “It’s good to be home.” For good measure, she runs through a set list of songs that caters to Glasgow’s taste for sentimentality, line dancing and laughter (“Fly me to Dunoon,” indeed). It’s characteristic of a theatre that’s acutely aware of its own panto history. As a funny and charming Muddles, Johnny Mac even seems to have inherited the arched eyebrows of actor Gavin Mitchell and in turn, the late, great Gerard Kelly, who headlined the show for two decades. “Compemetition” is an obligatory word in this panto’s lexicon. Panto celebrity can have its own distorting effects, however. In Edinburgh, the focus on the three stars relegates the story of Gillian Parkhouse’s Cinderella to an afterthought – so much so that we scarcely see the Baroness actually doing anything bad to her stepdaughter. In Glasgow, the story is more carefully told (and half an hour longer), but Maggie Lynne’s Beauty has relatively little agency. On a more intimate scale at Perth theatre, the audience welcomes Barrie Hunter as Widow Twankey and the building itself like old friends. It’s Hunter’s seventh year on the trot and the theatre’s first outing after a three-year refit that has added bar space and a snazzy studio. Having declared the theatre open, the town provost does a quick cha-cha-cha with Widow Twankey and, after the interruption of a first-night fire alarm, the real firefighters carry the actors back on to the stage. Along with the youth-theatre chorus, it all adds to the homely atmosphere of a lacklustre show. All cylinders are firing in Stirling, though, where writer, director and dame Johnny McKnight confirms his position as latterday king of panto in Chick Whittington. Closely attended by Robert Jack as son Slick, Emma Mullen as daughter Chick and Helen McAlpine as the evil Queen Rat, he creates an air of anarchy even in the midst of a tightly drilled show. Jokes ricochet in all directions, the youth-theatre dancing is spectacular and the flashback 60s story (almost as wayward as McKnight’s own Lewis Carroll reworking Alice in Weegieland at Glasgow’s Tron) is ripe with jeopardy. It requires no TV endorsement to make this the best panto in Scotland. • Cinderella, King’s, Edinburgh, until 21 January.

Thank you so much for your enthusiastic campaigning for our avian friends. We really do have an astonishing variety of birds in Australia and we should celebrate them more often. I will leave you with some soothing words from Dr John Martin for the ibis lobby, who are still smarting from their shock loss this morning. Martin is a research ecologist who specialises in the Australian white ibis. He writes: Their colonisation of urban areas, and associated shift to a fast-food diet, is a remarkable example of their adaptability … Truly, if you asked anyone a month ago if the Australian white ibis would come second in a popular vote as the bird of the year I struggle to imagine even one person seriously predicting this result. I would have said it was unlikely to place in the top 50. This is a stunning result. You can read the full piece here: More scenes from behind the scenes of the bird of the year vote. The #birdoftheyear vote summoned in a brief, beautiful period of bird photos replacing political news and the sense of impending doom that usually populates Twitter. It was a lovely time, and we are keen for it to continue. Keep posting your bird photos. We need them more than ever. Further evidence that the magpie was a deserving winner. Thanks to Amanda Dell on Twitter for that link. The birds are reacting with reckless abandon and mild violence. Magpies: a cultural icon. All right, steady on. (This may happen.) Abbott’s booby and other endangered species Bird lovers had the opportunity to nominate a favourite bird that was not on our original list, and the most popular write-ins, by far, were the yellow-tailed black cockatoo, the black-throated finch and Abbott’s booby. The latter is a real thing. Abbott’s booby, or Papasula abbotti, is a seabird found on Christmas Island and is listed as endangered by both the EPBC and the IUCN red list. There are an estimated 2,500 breeding pairs. It received 243 write-in votes, all of which I am sure were concerned with the conservation of this endangered species and not making a reference to anything else. The yellow-tailed black cockatoo, Calyptorhynchus funereus, is also endangered. It received 304 votes. The black-throated finch, Poephila cincta, received 291 votes. The southern subspecies, Poephila cincta cincta, is listed as endangered. Magpies have been compared to Donald Trump, Malcolm Turbull, and Harry Potter this morning (that last one by me, sorry) and I have to say I don’t think they deserve any of it. I admit to having a deep affection for magpies after being woken up by the blighters carolling on the TV cable at 4am every morning of my teenage years, and do not like to see them slighted in this way. They are very smart and good and we should be proud of them, even if they are a bit violent. I’m not sure the AFL can claim this, tbh. I’ve been asked to dissect why Australia’s vast array of parrot species did not do better in the poll. The simple answer is that we have so many parrot species that it split the vote. No one could agree on a favourite. Most popular was the rainbow lorikeet in 6th place with 6,041 votes, followed by the sulphur-crested cockatoo at 11th with 4,051 votes; king parrot 12th with 3,449 votes, and the galah 13th with 3,405 votes. Then we have gang-gangs 15th with 2,871 votes; crimson rosellas in 19th spot with 2,379 votes, the stupidly endangered orange-bellied parrot in 21st spot with 2,324 votes; and Perth’s Carnaby’s black cockatoo with 2,249 (a personal favourite of mine, we used to have them in the backyard). The 50s pink Major Mitchell’s cockatoo was 27th with 1,828 votes and the common budgie 30th with 1,594 votes. They were all the parrot species we included in the original (limited by necessity) list. Total parrot votes: 30,191. We also had a huge number of write-in votes for parrots, including 11 for the corella and one specifically for male superb parrots. More from inside the bird of the year awards BuzzFeed’s Jenna Guillaume ran an alternative version of the Guardian Australia/BirdLife poll and is displeased with the official results. Sorry, Jenna. This is a very serious poll – we can’t tolerate this kind of branch stacking. Dissent. Deputy culture editor Steph Convery is being held hostage by a flock of sulphur-crested cockatoos, demanding to know why they only reached 11th place in the bird of the year poll. Cockies received 4,051 votes, or 2.7% of the whole. Supporters of the cockatoo must mobilise. We can rectify this next year! If you are still upset that the magpie has taken out the top spot, take a look at this piece by Karen Wyld on the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander relationships to birds. She writes: Raelee Lancaster, a Koori poet and research assistant, voted for the magpie. She told me, “I would say my connection to the magpie is somewhat of a cultural one. I grew up learning some Awabakal stories, as that is the land on which I was raised, and I learnt a bit about magpie Dreaming as a kid, but I don’t know if the things I learnt were my mob’s stories. Wyld voted for the wedge-tailed eagle, as did the Yorta Yorta woman Rebecca Hunt. Hunt said: The wedge-tailed eagle is significant to me because of Bunjil and his significance to creation, spirit and Victorian Aboriginal peoples. And on a personal note, they are majestic creatures who possess a beautiful balance of strength and grace and, specifically, they are monogamous birds who mate for life. That’s the kind of loyalty that I respect and that I see often reflected in our mob. A very accurate depiction of what happened at the Guardian Australia offices a short time ago, when we announced the winner of the Guardian Australia/BirdLife bird of the year poll. A brief discussion of ducks We didn’t include any species in our original list, an oversight that many of you sought to correct by writing in your own vote. Most popular was the Australian wood duck, Chenonetta jubata, which, I hate to break it to you, may actually be a goose. Either way, it got 15 votes. Next was musk duck (Biziura lobata) with 11 votes, followed by the Pacific black duck (Anas superciliosa) with nine votes and the pink-eared duck (Malcorhynchus membranaceus) with seven votes. There were two votes for the blue-billed duck (Oxyura australis) and one for “blue-billed dick”, which I’m going to hope was the same thing. We also received seven votes for “duck” and one for “duck &lt;3” which I think should count as at least two votes. There were two votes for the Radjah shelduck or burdekin duck (tadorna radjah) and one apiece for whistling ducks, both wandering and plumed. Opinion is divided. Over on ABC News Breakfast, BirdLife’s Sean Dooley has been explaining the appeal of the magpie which, on the surface, seems a fairly conservative choice. (Indeed Guardian Australia’s deputy editor, Will Woodward, thinks the popularity of the magpie and white ibis shows the essential conservatism of the Australian voting populace. I think it means shows the essential Australian desire to vote for the underdog – both species are much-maligned.) Here’s Sean Dooley: Magpies are easily tameable and people have a great connection with them. They love to feed them. Clearly, there are a lot of people out there who have a special relationship with a magpie. On the ibis, often described and dismissed as a “bin chicken”, Dooley said: This is our Ibis McIbis vote, they are remarkable birds and they’re resilient. People don’t like them because they come into the cities, like Sydney or Brisbane, and steal your lunch out of your hands or go into the bins. But they only do that because their natural wetlands in the Murray-Darling have been drained and altered so it is not suitable for them. The prime minister talks about being agile and adaptable – the ibis embodies that Australian spirit. The decision has not been universally popular. Our new overlords. You can watch our live discussion of the bird of the year results here: Surprising everyone who has put cable ties on their bicycle helmet to ward off an attack, 2017’s bird of the year is the Australian magpie (Gymnorhina tibicen) with a whopping 19,926 votes – that’s 13.3% of the total votes. I’m not saying this was First Dog’s doing as unofficial leader of the Any Bird But the Ibis coalition, but I’m not saying it wasn’t First Dog’s doing, either. Nipping at its heels was the Australian white ibis (Threskiornis molucca) with 19,083 votes, or 12.7%; followed by the laughing kookaburra (Dacelo novaeguinea) with 10,953 or 7.3%. The top 10 are: Australian magpie Australian white ibis Laughing kookaburra Tawny frogmouth Superb fairywren Rainbow lorikeet Willy wagtail Wedge-tailed eagle Southern cassowary Splendid fairywren The popularity of the #birdoftheyear poll surprised even us, an office full of warring bird nerds. We understand many of you have taken issue with the limitations of our voting system. Indeed, the University of Melbourne student union passed a motion condemning Guardian Australia for failing to provide preferential voting. To which I’d say: Let’s just focus on the birds, hey? Portrait of a ruthless killer In case you forget, birds are just feathered dinosaurs. For those wondering, the bird being used as a snack here is either a cockatoo or a corella chick. Slightly morbid but, as kookaburras routinely eat snakes and other reptiles, it’s not really that surprising. Nature, ain’t it grand? A very considered opinion: Currawongs have a beautiful song but I must confess my opinion of them is coloured by the 1990s Silver Brumby cartoon, which depicts the currawong as Zazu but without Rowan Atkinson’s charm. Listen to their beautiful music. I know my colleague Steph Convery is barracking for the sulphur-crested cockatoo to win #birdoftheyear. She even feeds them, and spoke to experts this week who said that is OK despite warnings to the contrary. According to Holly Parsons from BirdLife, feeding wild birds, provided you do a bit of research and pick the right food, is: ... really good for us, mentally and physically. Confidence. The oft-ignored King Island brown thornbill, named most likely to go extinct by BirdLife’s threatened species committee, which is probably the worst yearbook award, received two write-in votes in the poll. We also received four votes for the brown thornbill, Acanthiza pusilla, which is found down the east coast and in Tasmania. Said one voter: “I have them in my garden. They are tiny with beautiful flittering activity. A classic twitterer.” We did get four votes for the tiny, adorable Mallee emuwren. Look at it, though – it clearly deserved more. They weight the same as a teaspoon of sugar! Their eggs are the size of peas! Sadly, despite me shilling for them and other little brown birds in this article, the King Island brown scrubtit did not receive a single vote. All your bird photos are better than ours On Friday night we asked you to send us your bird photos and you responded in marvellous form with photos that, frankly, we had to check to make sure you hadn’t nicked them from Google images. THEY WERE THAT GOOD. Here are some of my favourites: You can add your own photos here. It’s time. After three weeks, one automated voting scandal, several social media campaigns and 149,848 votes, we will finally learn who the public has chosen to be Australia’s 2017 bird of the year. Thank you for joining us at this early hour. There’s an opening here to talk about early birds and worms but that kind of frippery would imply this is anything but serious, and that will not do. If the past three weeks have taught us anything, it’s that the Australian public holds very firm and passionate views about its birdlife. The results will be announced at 7.45am by Birdlife’s Sean Dooley on ABC news breakfast, as well as here on this blog and through Periscope and Facebook Live because this is the most exciting thing to happen at the Guardian Australia offices for several months and we will not play it cool. Grab a coffee, take a recording of the birdsong outside your window and post it on Twitter, and let’s settle in to see the results. You can follow along with the #BirdOfTheYear hashtag on the social media of your choice, tweet us at @GuardianAus, and tweet me at @callapilla. Yes, my avatar is a cassowary. That’s not a giveaway.

Ican led the campaign for a global treaty banning nuclear weapons that resulted in a UN treaty being adopted in July this year, under which states committed to never “develop, test, produce, manufacture, otherwise acquire, possess or stockpile nuclear weapons”. One hundred and twenty-three countries voted for the treaty at the UN general assembly in July. So far, 56 countries have signed up to it and three have ratified it. The ban treaty will come into force when 50 countries have signed and ratified it. Ican was established in Melbourne in 2007. Its founding chair, Dr Tilman Ruff, associate professor at the Nossal institute for global health at the University of Melbourne, said in Oslo the Nobel was recognition for the millions of campaigners who had worked over decades for the abolition of nuclear weapons. “That particularly includes the survivors of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki – the hibakusha – and victims of nuclear test explosions, including in Australia and the Pacific, whose painful personal testimonies have played such a crucial role.” Australia has not supported nor signed the treaty. But Ruff – who was also a member of International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War when that organisation won the peace prize in 1985 for its work highlighting the catastrophic health consequences of atomic war – urged Australia to follow the lead of New Zealand, Indonesia and other countries in the Asia-Pacific and sign and ratify the accord. “Nuclear weapons pose an existential threat in any hands and the risks of nuclear war are as high now as they have ever been. “Yet the current Australian government has done all it can to get in the way of efforts to end this existential threat to humanity.” The Australian government has maintained a longstanding opposition to a nuclear weapons ban treaty. As a key plank of its foreign policy, Australia has consistently maintained that, as long as nuclear weapons exist, it must rely on the protection of the extended deterrent effect of the US’s nuclear arsenal, the second largest in the world. Australia was a key agitator in preliminary meetings in trying to get the resolution establishing treaty negotiations defeated. But the push for a treaty won massive global support, with 123 nations voting in favour, 38 opposing and 16 abstaining. Australia joined the nuclear weapons states Russia, the US, Israel, France and the UK to vote against the resolution. China abstained. The treaty will not offer a practical path to effective disarmament or enhanced security, a Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade spokesman told the Guardian during negotiations. “Australia regards the treaty on the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons as the cornerstone of global non-proliferation and disarmament efforts.” But the nuclear ban treaty has widespread community – and growing political – support. A September poll by ReachTel found 73% of Australians support the ban on nuclear weapons and believe nuclear weapons pose a threat to global security. Seventy-three parliamentarians – including 60 members of the Labor party, eight Greens, one Liberal and one National – have signed Ican’s global parliamentary pledge, which commits parliamentarians “to work for the signature and ratification of this landmark treaty by our respective countries”. “We consider the abolition of nuclear weapons to be a global public good of the highest order and an essential step to promote the security and well-being of all peoples,” the pledge says. The nuclear ban treaty is supported by the majority of the nations on earth but it has no backing from the nine known nuclear states – the US, China, France, Britain, Russia, India, Pakistan, Israel and North Korea – which include the veto-wielding permanent five members of the security council. Critics argue that a treaty cannot succeed without the participation of the states that possess nuclear weapons. But proponents say a nuclear weapons ban will create moral suasion – in the vein of the cluster weapons ban and landmine conventions – for nuclear weapons states to disarm and establish an international norm prohibiting the development, possession and use of nuclear weapons. Non-nuclear states have expressed increasing frustration with the sclerotic movement towards disarmament. With nuclear weapons states modernising and in some cases increasing their arsenals, instead of discarding them, more states are becoming disenchanted with the nuclear non-proliferation treaty and lending their support for an outright ban."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"education/2017/dec/14/poorest-school-leavers-half-as-likely-to-attend-university-as-their-peers","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-14T00:00:16Z","webTitle":"Poorest school-leavers half as likely to attend university as their peers","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2017/dec/14/poorest-school-leavers-half-as-likely-to-attend-university-as-their-peers","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/education/2017/dec/14/poorest-school-leavers-half-as-likely-to-attend-university-as-their-peers","fields":{"headline":"Poorest school-leavers half as likely to attend university as their peers","bodyText":"The gap between students on free school meals able to study at university widened this year compared with their better-off peers – making the poorer group only half as likely to attend university in England. The figures from Ucas, the university admissions clearing house, showed that school-leavers in England from the most deprived backgrounds were the least likely to attend university, with the gap widening for the second year in a row. While other measures of deprivation used by Ucas were more positive, the slow change in the numbers of free school meals pupils attending university will be a concern as the government publishes its social mobility action plan, which includes widening access for those from deprived backgrounds as a main plank. “We must not let today’s figures mask the challenges which remain in this area. Young people from the most advantaged backgrounds are still 5.5 times more likely to enter universities with the highest entrance requirements than their disadvantaged peers,” said Les Ebdon, the director of Fair Access to Higher Education. “As a result, people with the potential to excel are missing out on opportunities. This is an unforgivable waste of talent, and universities must continue to press for transformational progress.” This summer’s Ucas admission data showed that the entry rate for pupils on free school meals was nearly 17%, while the entry rate for other pupils was close to 34%. The rate of successful applications grew twice as quickly among the better-off students than those from the more deprived households among 18-year-olds. The widening gap is a reversal of the trend seen until 2015, when pupils on free school meals became less than half as likely to go to university as their peers. Ucas pointed to its own “multiple equality measure” of deprivation, that recorded increases in all groups of students applying, although it too showed a widening gap between the most advantaged and the least advantaged. “This report provides further positive indications that the work universities and colleges do to improve fair access is paying off,” said Ebdon. But the biggest news came in the narrowing gap between the two groups at the most selective universities, with a 10.4% increase in entry to those universities from students from the most disadvantaged areas. The proportion of girls once again increased more quickly than boys, with white British boys once again the slowest growing portion of the student population."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business-to-business/2017/dec/21/lab-grown-luxuries-cruelty-free-silk-diamonds-and-leather-offer-an-ethical-alternative","type":"article","sectionId":"business-to-business","sectionName":"Business to business","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-21T12:36:08Z","webTitle":"Lab-grown luxuries: cruelty-free silk, diamonds, and leather offer an ethical alternative","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business-to-business/2017/dec/21/lab-grown-luxuries-cruelty-free-silk-diamonds-and-leather-offer-an-ethical-alternative","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business-to-business/2017/dec/21/lab-grown-luxuries-cruelty-free-silk-diamonds-and-leather-offer-an-ethical-alternative","fields":{"headline":"Lab-grown luxuries: cruelty-free silk, diamonds, and leather offer an ethical alternative","bodyText":"Every year, an estimated 150m carats of diamonds are extracted from the Earth. It’s an industry that has been tainted by its links to blood diamonds, war, exploitation and severe environmental impact, as immortalised by the 2006 film Blood Diamond, starring Leonardo DiCaprio. Yet diamonds remain one of the most sought-after items on the luxury market. The sector was worth an estimated $80bn in 2016, according to De Beers, with nearly half of the world’s demand coming from the US. But some startups are developing ethical alternatives. In 2015, DiCaprio announced he was investing in Silicon Valley’s Diamond Foundry, which grows the gemstones in labs. Made from carbon, synthetic diamonds (or CVD diamonds, which stands for chemical vapour deposition) are chemically identical to the real thing, but can be produced in a matter of weeks. Diamonds have been grown in labs for industrial use since the 1950s, but it’s only in the last few years that the technology has existed to produce large and pure enough stones that can be used for jewellery. Demand is subsequently skyrocketing – in the US and elsewhere. “Probably 90% of what we retail is CVD diamonds,” Diane Nightingale says. She co-founded Nightingale, a bespoke jewellers, with husband Stephen in the UK in 2013. Nightingale says that in the jewellery sector it takes a long time for UK habits to change “but between years one and two, we probably saw sales [of CVD diamonds] increase by 100%. The high street jewellers are wary of them so far, but our younger customers have really embraced [the concept].” It’s a disruption the traditional diamond sector is not welcoming with open arms. De Beers has reportedly spent tens of millions of dollars to develop technology that can identify man-made stones that look authentic. But the fashion sector seems more open to ethical alternatives to luxurious materials. Stella McCartney recently announced a collaboration with Californian company Bolt Threads, which has developed a protein-based polymer that can be spun into spider silk, as part of a Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) exhibition in New York. Bolt Threads co-founder Dan Widmaier started the business with two fellow PhD graduates who had been working on solving the “spider silk problem” for many years. On an environmental level, silk is also usually produced by boiling silk worms alive inside their cocoons and has been found to be the second-worst material in terms of environmental impact, just behind leather. Bolt Threads recently announced a partnership with Mountain Meadow Wool Mill, blending microsilk with US wool, and has opened a factory capable of producing 10 tonnes of its own material a year, equating to 100,000 shirts. Widmaier admits this isn’t enough, and that it has some way to go before it hits the 80bn new garments a year the world now consumes. But he acknowledges how far they’ve come. “Back in the beginning, my lab was a 10-foot by 10-foot room, full of a bunch of free-range spiders the size of a teacup saucer, and me working on engineering the biology of a yeast to try to make their silk. “What drives us is the idea that there are some really big problems on this planet that need to be solved. And we’re going to try and do our part to solve as much as we can.” Also part of a growing sector that combines biology, technology and fashion, known as biofabrication, is Modern Meadow. It creates leather, after producing collagen from genetically engineered yeast. It’s a second biotechnology company for founder Andras Forgacs, who started San Diego business Organovo in 2007 to pioneer the bioprinting of human tissue for medical use. In 2011, Forgacs started to get calls from leather companies. “They said, ‘we heard you can make skin, have you thought about making leather?’” he says. “It was a compelling opportunity for us – leather is a $100bn raw material market. The industry is very interested and very open. But the timeframe for developing these technologies is long.” The business hopes to reveal its full biofabricated leather range – named Zoa – in 2018. Because of the pollution and animal rights abuses associated with tanning – an estimated 430m cows would need to be slaughtered to keep up with leather demand by 2025 – a genuine lab-grown alternative to leather is interesting. Renée Cuoco, manager of the Centre for Sustainable Fashion at London College of Fashion, says the interest, acknowledgement and understanding about the issue has been significant, particularly among new designers. “I’m not surprised to see luxury brands are interested in this sort of innovation,” she adds. “There’s a certain risk element when it comes to animal cruelty ... It’s quite difficult to ensure bad practices aren’t happening throughout the supply chain.” But Cuoco urges caution, saying there is more work to be done beyond technological advances in the luxury sector. “We want to pay more attention to the environmental, social and cultural values of the industry, not just the financial value. So long as the industry is predicated on speed and growth, those innovations won’t have the true impact we need them to.” Sign up to the regular Guardian B2B email here for more insight and advice direct to your inbox."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2017/dec/13/melon-cheltenham-willie-mullins-thaw","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-13T19:00:08Z","webTitle":"Melon looks tasty for Cheltenham return as thaw enables resumption","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/dec/13/melon-cheltenham-willie-mullins-thaw","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/dec/13/melon-cheltenham-willie-mullins-thaw","fields":{"headline":"Melon looks tasty for Cheltenham return as thaw enables resumption","bodyText":"The National Hunt season has been all but stopped in its tracks since Saturday but at least one – and possibly all three – of Thursday’s jumps cards should go ahead as planned as a thaw arrives just in time for Cheltenham’s two-day meeting this weekend. Only Taunton, about 80 miles south-west of Cheltenham, has not called an inspection before racing on Thursday morning, while officials at both Warwick and Newcastle will inspect their tracks at 8am. The New course at Cheltenham, though, would have been raceable on Wednesday, according to Simon Claisse, the clerk of the course, despite total precipitation – rain and snow combined – of 48mm since Saturday night. “All the snow had pretty well gone by nine this morning, and you’d have been racing over it this afternoon,” Claisse said on Wednesday. “We’ve had another 3mm of rain since this morning, which makes 8mm in the last 24 hours, and the chase and hurdles are soft, and good-to-soft in places. The snow and rain has fallen on a course that is not irrigated through the autumn because we don’t need it in a fit state until December, and last week it was good ground.” Racing at Cheltenham is a precious commodity, with only nine days scheduled at the track each season before the Festival in March, and Saturday’s card includes both the Caspian Caviar Gold Cup, worth nearly £70,000 to the winner, and the International Hurdle, a trial for the Champion Hurdle in March. The entries for the latter race include My Tent Or Yours and The New One, stalwarts of the hurdling scene for several seasons, but it was the five‑year‑old Melon, the runner-up in the Supreme Novice Hurdle in March, that attracted the attention of punters on Wednesday. Willie Mullins’s entry, already the third‑favourite for the Champion Hurdle behind Faugheen and Buveur D’Air, is now top‑priced at 9-4 to win on Saturday, and closing in on The New One, a 15-8 chance, at the head of the market. Officials at both Warwick and Newcastle remain hopeful that Thursday’s card will get the go-ahead and Philip Kirby, who trains at Middleham in north Yorkshire, is likely to have his mare Lady Buttons loaded into the horsebox with the engine running as the clerks walk their tracks. The seven-year-old, who won a Listed race on her chasing debut at Bangor last month, has been declared for both a Grade Three event at Newcastle and the Listed Lady Godiva Novice Chase at Warwick, and will head for the midlands if Kirby’s first choice at Newcastle succumbs to the weather. Individuals facing British Horseracing Authority disciplinary charges will in future be able to access expert legal advice for a nominal fee, the BHA said on Wednesday. Jockeys and trainers already benefit from schemes set up by their trade associations to ensure that they can receive legal advice if they are facing a disciplinary inquiry. Non-licensed individuals will now be able to approach Sport Resolutions, an independent not-for-profit dispute resolution service, for similar advice on payment of a small administration fee. “It is of vital importance that there is no perception of an inequality of arms when participations are subject to a disciplinary procedure,” Catherine Beloff, the BHA’s director of legal and governance, said. “This gives an option for participants to have access to independent, experienced legal professionals for a fraction of what the cost would be otherwise.” Thursday’s tips, by Greg Wood Taunton 12.00 Brahms De Clermont 12.30 Canelo 1.05 Cucklington (nb) 1.35 Our Merlin 2.10 Molineaux 2.45 Top Notch 3.15 Workbench 3.50 Sheelbewhatsheelbe Newcastle – meeting abandoned Warwick – meeting abandoned Chelmsford City 5.45 Bezos 6.15 I’m Yer Man 6.45 Cookie Ring 7.15 Steel Train 7.45 You’re Cool 8.15 Bardd (nap) 8.45 Enigmatic"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"us-news/2017/dec/13/doug-jones-alabama-roy-moore-african-american-voters","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-13T20:02:37Z","webTitle":"The African American voters at the heart of Doug Jones' Alabama victory","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/dec/13/doug-jones-alabama-roy-moore-african-american-voters","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/dec/13/doug-jones-alabama-roy-moore-african-american-voters","fields":{"headline":"The African American voters at the heart of Doug Jones' Alabama victory","bodyText":"Doug Jones’s shock victory in Alabama relied heavily on a key component of the Democratic coalition: African American voters. Black voters have long been the linchpin of the Democratic base. But African American turnout has sagged recently in non-presidential elections. Jones was able to reverse that trend on Tuesday. In a state where African Americans make up 26% of the population, they made up 29% of the electorate, according to exit polls, and backed Jones by a margin of 96% to 4%. On Wednesday, African American voters saw the result as a small step forward in interviews with the Guardian outside a Montgomery supermarket. They viewed the result not in light of Alabama’s troubled racial history but simply as a win for a candidate they supported in Jones. Alisha Coleman of Montgomery praised the victorious Democrat as “an honest man” who will “make a change”. Betty Carter put the race in a broader perspective because of the possibility opened up by the Alabama result of Democrats taking a majority in the Senate next year. She added: “It made the national news, affected the stock market and I think it will be maybe somewhat of a turnaround for Alabama, for as far as politics and as far as racism.” Michael Blake, the vice-chair of the DNC and a New York state assemblyman, saw the results as part of an important historical moment for African American voters. “We’ve had, in the past five weeks, two black lieutenant governors [in New Jersey and Virginia], a black female mayor in Charlotte, a black female mayor in Atlanta, and a win for Doug Jones, who prosecuted Klansmen. How can you not feel validated?” Blake also saw broader ramifications from the increase in turnout and the DNC’s efforts organizing on the ground. “You had black turnout essentially reach and exceed where it was in 2008,” he noted. “It shows that we can and will win everywhere.” He also noted that increase in turnout was achieved despite Alabama’s restrictive voting laws. Attempts to reach out to black voters were crucial to Jones’s campaign. In the final days he brought in prominent African American surrogates including Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey and the former governor Deval Patrick of Massachusetts and held events in cities with significant African American populations such as Birmingham, Montgomery and Selma. Black areas were filled with signs proclaiming “vote or die” and the Jones campaign emphasized his role successfully prosecuting two members of Ku Klux Klan involved in the 16th Street church bombing in Birmingham, which killed four African American girls in 1963. The result was that turnout surged in predominantly African American counties in the black belt and in urban areas with large African American populations. In Greene County, Alabama, which is 80% percent black, turnout reached 78% of 2016 levels. In contrast, in white rural areas, turnout was just over half of that reached in 2016, when Hillary Clinton lost the state in a landslide. In other counties, Jones received more votes than Clinton did in 2016, including in Moore’s home county of Etowah. Jones also benefited from the fact that Moore, who had a history of controversial comments on civil rights, including the statement that the US was last great during the era of slavery, repelled African American voters. At a polling place in Montgomery on Tuesday, African American voters couldn’t even summon words to describe their contempt for Moore. “No comment,” said Sequoia Smith of Montgomery before breaking into knowing laughter and walking away when asked about Moore. The question remains what effect Jones’s election will have on a state that ranks near the bottom in almost every economic indicator and has been beset by political scandal in recent years. Sarah Smith of Montgomery said simply on Wednesday: “I hope it makes things better.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"culture/2017/dec/13/maxine-peake-and-johnny-marr-brought-the-story-of-my-homelessness-to-life","type":"article","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-13T19:09:39Z","webTitle":"Maxine Peake and Johnny Marr brought the story of my homelessness to life | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2017/dec/13/maxine-peake-and-johnny-marr-brought-the-story-of-my-homelessness-to-life","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/2017/dec/13/maxine-peake-and-johnny-marr-brought-the-story-of-my-homelessness-to-life","fields":{"headline":"Maxine Peake and Johnny Marr brought the story of my homelessness to life","bodyText":"I am very proud that Johnny Marr and Maxine Peake found my work and used it to make their short film The Priest (It’s the job of the artist to stand up to oppressive forces, G2, 11 December).

It really was quite astounding when they first played The Priest to me. Maxine had, uncannily and almost identically, captured my thought patterns, how I speak to myself, and Johnny’s beautiful yet sinister music reflected my impressions of the city I had found myself in while in the direst circumstances. (He explained what he was doing and I honestly started thinking that he had visited me inside my head. The accolades bestowed upon him aren’t just legend!) I suppose I kinda took their talents for granted, being familiar with their work, but to see it materialise in this way is completely overwhelming. By the time this came about, my stories were, to me any way, just words on a page. I was tearful when I first heard their interpretation breathe life back into these experiences. The accuracy of their presentation awoke dormant memories. The use of a female voice gave it a new dimension and has made this an everyperson tale, while keeping the integrity of the story. Musically it captures my fear and wonder of this strange situation of homelessness that affects so many people, often for no other reason except that they are poor. I am writing this because I want to thank Maxine and Johnny publicly for their candour, grace and artistry – and to thank Molly Windsor, who portrays the character so well, and everyone else involved in the project.

Rian Johnson, who has made his Star Wars directing debut with The Last Jedi, which opens in UK cinemas on Thursday, is the third white man to direct a film from the popular sci-fi series. Other directors of the franchise have been creator George Lucas and JJ Abrams, who directed Star Wars: The Force Awakens in 2015. However, Johnson said “hell yes, it’s time” that the on-screen diversity the rebooted Star Wars series has prided itself on was also extended to people behind the camera. “There are so many incredibly talented female directors, directors of colour out there, and so many that I would love to see play in this universe,” said Johnson. “So hell yes, please, I’d love it to happen.” Abrams, it is understood, will return to direct the final film in this trilogy. Disney recently announced that Johnson would be writing and directing the first in a brand new Star Wars trilogy. The directors of the other two films in that new trilogy have yet to be announced. The Last Jedi returns where The Force Awakens left off. Cast members John Boyega, Daisy Ridley, Oscar Isaac and Adam Driver return alongside the original trilogy characters of Luke Skywalker, played by Mark Hamill, and Princess Leia, played by Carrie Fisher. The film begins as Rey, played by Ridley, starts her Jedi training with Skywalker, while the resistance continue to battle the First Order, led by Driver’s Kylo Ren and Andy Serkis’s Snoke. While reviews of the the Last Jedi have been almost universally positive (the Guardian’s Peter Bradshaw said it was a film of “teetering temptations, spectacular immolations, huge military engagements”) some have accused Johnson of pandering to Disney, who bought the franchise from Lucasfilm in 2012 and were responsible for its reboot. Variety’s Peter Debruge accused Johnson of bending to pressure from Disney’s Kathleen Kennedy, the film’s producer, and fitting the film into the studio’s “unified corporate aesthetic”. Debruge said: “Johnson was either strong enough or weak enough to adapt to such pressures, and the result is the longest and least essential chapter in the series.” It was an accusation that Johnson denied, saying he was “not sure what that means” when people spoke about the Disneyfication of Star Wars in The Last Jedi. “I know that from the very start Lucasfilm and Kathy Kennedy and the folks at Disney, there was nothing imposed on this movie from anyone and I was not only allowed but encouraged to make the kind of Star Wars movie that I wanted to make,” Johnson said. The cast also spoke movingly about the loss of Fisher, who died in December last year during the filming of The Last Jedi. Johnson said he would remember Fisher “first and foremost” as a writer, and recalled “hanging out before the shoot and just at her house and she was digging out books that she wanted to talk about”. He added: “She was writing the Princess Diaries when we were doing the shoot and she was showing me all the old diaries she had kept and talking about words, and just hanging out with her. I feel really lucky that I got to have even a little bit of time to know her.” Domhnall Gleeson, who plays General Hux, said that the film was a fitting tribute to Fisher’s talents. “For the people who knew Carrie she’ll live forever anyway because she was just amazingly big-hearted and totally herself and as irreverent as anybody I’ve ever met – and wore it all very lightly,” he said. “And now we get to see her as Leia in this film for the last time and she’s really brilliant in it.” Johnson also refused to confirm or deny the rumour that Prince Harry and Prince William make secret cameos in the film disguised as Storm Troopers. However, the cast spoke about the Royals’ visit to the set, and Hamill said he had used it as an opportunity to attempt to settle an ongoing dispute between him and Fisher over whether his character Luke Skywalker could claim to be royalty. “When they told us that Carrie and I were brother and sister, I said ‘well wait, if Luke is Princess Leia’s brother, doesn’t that make me royalty?’ and Carrie immediately said no. But when I met the Princes, I told them I really wanted their opinion on this – ‘my mother was Queen Amidala, my father was Lord Vader and my sister is Princess Leia, doesn’t that make me royalty?’.” However, he said that William and Harry had not been able to settle the 40-year dispute. “Unfortunately it was a split decision because William said yes and Harry said ‘I need more information’,” Hamill said with a sigh."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"sport/live/2017/dec/14/chris-froome-failed-drug-test-live-webchat","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-14T14:01:22Z","webTitle":"Chris Froome's failed drug test – your questions answered","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2017/dec/14/chris-froome-failed-drug-test-live-webchat","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/live/2017/dec/14/chris-froome-failed-drug-test-live-webchat","fields":{"headline":"Chris Froome's failed drug test – your questions answered","bodyText":"We’ve got to go now to do some work - thanks for all the questions and apologies we couldn’t answer them all.

Continue reading Thanks markgreenwood asks: Hi Martha, Sean. What should we think about the state of British sport? Is this story another example of why we’re only a small step away from the Russian/Armstrong approach? Or, by challenging an extra puff on an asthma inhaler does it show how British is scrupulously careful and leading the world in keeping sport clean? Martha replies: Michael Charlie Smith replies: How much salbutamol actually is 1000mg (or whatever the limit is), how many puffs of an inhaler would you need to take to put that much in your system? Sean replies: Torresdelbabel asks: Given that this paper has long held the view that Team Sky and Froome were cheating and has never been particularity careful about mixing evidence and innuendo, is there anything Sky or Froome could say or do now that would change your assumption of a his guilt? (Or will we need to wait 50 years for a balanced reappraisal a la Tom Simpson?) Martha replies: Pleias writes In German-speaking media it was reported that Tony Martin is “furious” and claims that the UCI applies double standards in Froome’s case. He suggests that other cyclists would get and have been “banned with immediate effect” in similar cases. He further says that he cannot recall “a similar case in the recent past” and that “it is a scandal as he would have not been allowed to participate at the world cup”. Do you agree with that assessment? And if yes, is there a larger problem with the cycling industry protecting their stars (something that has already been claimed in the Armstrong era)? Sean replies: pipmk1 writes: There is no evidence that this substance has any beneficial effect on performance, lets try to keep a sense of perspective. Sean replies: quaidesbrumes asks: Why has it taken so long for the UCI to investigate this? Martha replies: vastariner asks: Given that cycling is now dealing with asthma medication rather than out-and-out Armstrong-type cheating, how much does that suggest cycling has got on top of the drug problem, or has it just moved deeper underground? And given cycling’s more aggressive stance on drug testing, how does it “do” in relation to other sports? We hear little about performance test failures outside cycling, strength sports and athletics? Sean replies: Rob Allen asks: Why was the decision taken to publish this now following a leak rather than after a UCI investigation had been completed? It feels a lot of the media are making judgements based on limited facts (shock horror I know!). Martha replies: pravda01 asks: Given Sky’s recent history with keeping records of what their riders are taking in the jiffy bag case. How can anyone take seriously records they produce of what Froome has been taking? Martha replies: thirdknee writes: I find this disturbing. What we know: he has asthma, is using a legal drug to resolve this, he has exceeded a threshold, the UCI are querying this, it can be explained by many biological factors. Therefore naturally the guardian etc. have blown this up, whipped up a frenzy without allowing the process – carried out by experts – to be completed. The story is cheap. Sean replies: BadlyWiredDog asks: What actual performance advantage would Froome gain from exceeding the WADA limit on Salbutamol if he’s proven to have done so? And if Salbutamol works as a PED in the context of a grand tour, how would he have been stupid enough to exceed the minimum dose on a day when he knew he was pretty much 100% likely to be tested? Martha replies: zzaymssik has two questions: 1. What’s the difference between an “adverse result” and failing a drugs test? 2. What is the performance gain he would have had from the dose he took? Sean replies: BillCar asks: The problem, as I see it, is that sportspeople (not just professionals) are always looking for that ‘edge’, and will skirt around and find loopholes in the incredibly confusing rules, until something like this happens and Froome, who ‘technically’ hasn’t broken any rules, is made a scapegoat for something that everybody’s doing? Are we getting near to the point where we just say ‘crack on lads, take whatever you like’, ridding us of this ridiculous ambiguity for ever? Martha replies: oommph asks: What would have happened had media sources not released this information? How would it have likely played out? Would it ever have been released and, if so, when? In the short term, Froome is still presumably on the SPOTY shortlist? Good idea or not? Martha replies: cilmeri asks: Is Slabutamol also a potential masking agent? I’ve heard contrasting information on this. Are there clauses in the Team Sky contract so that Sky can quit their sponsorship if a rider is caught guilty of cheating / failing a drugs test? Sean replies: Hello all, sorry for the delay in responding - Martha and I have just been in a departmental meeting that overran a little. We’ll start answering as many questions as we can now ... Cheers, Sean Chris Froome was hoping to win his fifth Tour de France title next year but, depending on how cycling’s governing body react after his failed drugs test, he may well be banned from the sport when the race begins on the tiny island of Noirmoutier in July. In a week when Froome may have had designs on winning the Sports Personality of the Year award, he is now fighting to save his reputation.

Dugdale arrived at Glasgow airport on Wednesday, having stayed in Australia until the conclusion of the show, and told waiting reporters that it was “good to be back”. After a reportedly tense meeting with Leonard and the parliamentary group executive, Dugdale released a statement via the party press office saying: “I deeply regret that this caused issues in the first weeks of Richard Leonard’s leadership and I am determined that it won’t affect Labour’s ability to scrutinise the Scottish budget.“Now I’m getting back to work, and the very first thing I did was to vote with Labour for a fairer alternative to Tory austerity and demonstrate that parliament has the powers to stop the cuts and lift children out of poverty.” Scottish Labour’s business manager, James Kelly, announced on Wednesday evening that Dugdale would receive a written warning for agreeing to take part in the ITV show without formal approval from party officials to be absent from the Scottish parliament. Leonard, a Corbynite reformer whose convincing victory in the leadership election was overshadowed by Dugdale’s surprise announcement, has previously expressed his disappointment at her decision to spend three weeks filming on location in Australia while the Scottish parliament was in session. Dugdale’s trip attracted criticism from across the political spectrum, including from some previously stalwart supporters. She has promised to donate her MSP’s salary for the duration of her absence and part of her earnings from the show, said to be a high five-figure sum, to charity. Dugdale has yet to confirm how much that amount will be. Since her eviction from the jungle camp, Dugdale has stood by her decision to take part in the contest, which she described as “an amazing opportunity to talk to young people who watch this programme about politics and, in particular, Labour values”. After becoming the second contestant to be voted out by the public, she told the ITV morning show Lorraine: “I know I’m going back to a good deal of criticism and I will take that face on. I’ve got to have a lot of conversations with people but I’m going back with my head held high. “I came out here to do what I wanted to do, I believe I’ve succeeded in that and I love my job.

Small family farms, where the profits are just enough to sustain the running of the farm, actually replenish the environment and provide for local communities. A non-slaughter farm is humane, realistic and beneficial all around. We need farmers. There is enough food for everyone if everyone takes only their fair share and stops killing and eating the animals. To read Monbiot, one would think there is no alternative (other than vegan) to industrialised, factory farming, ie the meat industry, which I so strongly disagree with that I have gone to jail to protest against it. I am sad to see well-meaning people like Monbiot give farmers an even harder chance to improve their lot. To make cows seem like culprits is truly tragic. Where would all the farm animals go? To farm animal sanctuaries? Highly unrealistic. My vision is that animal sanctuaries and farms should be one and the same thing. How about promoting small non-slaughter farms and leading people to something truly forward thinking? With all the statistics Monbiot quotes, it’s no wonder he can’t sleep at night. By stopping the killing, all of those statistics would be relegated to history. Small family farms where no member gets killed. Let that thought soothe you to sleep tonight, George. Chrissie Hynde London • Much of what George Monbiot says was true some years ago, but there have been positive developments in world food production. Fish farming is rapidly overhauling fish catching as more efficient and sustainable: output more than doubled between 2000 and 2015, while catching declined. Most of today’s beef is produced using concentrates, but developing improved grasses and legumes will allow cattle to be finished for slaughter without recourse to concentrates at all. Yes, there are areas with serious deterioration in soil quality, especially in sub-Saharan Africa, south-east Asia, north China and the Pampas. However, a recent FAO survey of 23 years of global data concluded that although about 20% of crop land (arable plus permanent crops) is degrading, almost the same proportion is improving. And the gradual decline in subsidies and international trade barriers is correcting global resource misallocation, where the wrong crops are often grown in the wrong countries and by the least efficient farmers. The evidence to date suggests that this, in conjunction with technological improvements, has significantly increased our chances of being able to feed the 10-11 billion global population expected by 2050. Rod Parker London • George Monbiot discusses the problem of feeding the world at length and thoroughly, but one thing he accepts as if it was a given that we can do nothing about: population growth. Norman Burlaug, who instigated the first green revolution, said in his 1970 Nobel peace prize lecture: ‘‘If fully implemented, the revolution can provide sufficient food for … the next three decades. But the frightening power of human reproduction must also be curbed: otherwise the success of the green revolution will be ephemeral only.” Human numbers are growing at about a billion every 12 years: how can that not be relevant? Roger Plenty Stroud, Gloucestershire • I agree with George Monbiot that we must move to eating more plant-based foods. He says we must also stop the use of farm land to produce biofuels and I agree with that too. What he doesn’t mention is the use of agricultural land to provide energy by means of solar panels. Surely we should ensure farmers are paid enough for the food they grow that they are not tempted to create solar farms? There are still plenty more buildings where the panels could be placed instead. Janet Poliakoff Nottingham • George Monbiot points out that livestock farming produces far fewer calories per hectare than crop farming. Livestock grazing accounts for almost two-thirds of agricultural land in the UK. Monbiot concedes that most of this cannot be used for crops, but seems to suggest that it should be used as a kind of nature reserve. This would result in livestock farming land producing no calories at all. How would this help world food production? David Robertson London • George Monbiot seems to overlook the fact that we have not evolved as herbivores, we are omnivores and “artificial meat” is unlikely to ever be a success. Second, population control, a combined effort by governments and churches, could achieve much in reducing population growth. Not a good prospect either way but probably more practical than trying to overturn the enormous vested and private interests in global agricultural systems. Dr Bruce Vivash Jones Cirencester, Gloucestershire • From climate change to heart disease, there’s no question that diets high in animal products cause harm to the health of the public and the planet. However, taxing citizens for their carnivorous appetites puts the financial burden in the wrong place (Meat industry heading towards ‘sin tax’ along lines of tobacco, 11 December). Taxpayers in the US already bear the burden as the government subsidises the meat and diary industry many times over. We pay for meat producers to pollute our environment while they get away with ridiculously cheap grazing fees. We pay again in grocery stores for these products, putting ourselves at risk of disease, food contamination and antibiotic resistance. And we pay a third time when the government props up the industry, like $20m forked out by the US federal government in 2016 to buy surplus cheese. Those who produce our food must be responsible for the means of production, not those who eat it. The solution is not more taxes on consumers. The solution is for policymakers to stop bailing out a failing industry and instead allow the industry to respond to market pressures demanding healthier, more sustainable food. Jennifer Molidor Redding, California, USA • According to the journal Nature, compared to legumes such as soy and peas, even the most efficient meat causes 40 times as much climate change per calorie of protein. Furthermore, a review by the UK government found that the threat from deadly new drug-resistant disease strains – which are driven by antibiotic use on filthy factory farms – is more certain than that from climate change. Governments will need a way to pay for these mounting harms. A tax on meat seems inevitable unless we shift toward better means of production. For example, plant-based and clean meat (cultured meat) have all the benefits of animal protein without degrading the environment or inhibiting our ability to use antibiotics.

Apart from the shortage of women, the other striking feature of the 12-strong shortlist is that only one of the contenders favoured by bookies – the boxer Anthony Joshua – comes to the contest free of the small nagging questions about their fitness to be heroes. The latest to be questioned is the four-times Tour de France champion Chris Froome, who faces further inquiries over an “adverse analytical finding”. The Guardian revealed on Wednesday that questions had been raised by a test carried out in early September when Britain’s best cyclist was on his way to victory in La Vuelta, the Spanish race that, in an almost unprecedented feat, he won only a few weeks after winning the Tour de France. The test suggests he exceeded the permitted levels of the asthma drug salbutamol, which as an asthmatic he can take in strictly controlled amounts. He protests that he stuck to the advice of his doctors, and Team Sky is confident that further testing on the speed with which his body absorbs the drug will exonerate him – as, last month, Bradley Wiggins, a former Team Sky member, was cleared of “jiffygate” doping allegations. Of the other leading contenders, the distance runner and icon of the London Olympics Mo Farah has now split from the controversial coach Alberto Salazar, strongly denying that it was connected with allegations of misuse of prescription drugs. Lewis Hamilton is a tax exile – as indeed is Chris Froome. They are all rich far beyond the dreams of Sunday night’s voters: Anthony Joshua, the boy from Watford, is tipped to be the first boxing billionaire. Their trouble is that they compete in a world of eye-watering rewards, where marginal advantage is the alchemy they all seek. It would be hard to design a better system to incentivise the use of performance-enhancing drugs. Worldwide, sporting authorities always appear just off the pace: playing catch-up, duped afresh by each novel drug, or new use of a familiar one. The incentive to cheat always looks stronger than the disincentive, despite the onerous nature of the drug-testing regime, with its obligation on athletes to report their movements months in advance and the intrusive nature of testing. On some estimates, only 1% of tests returns a positive result; yet some cyclists have claimed that 90% of their rivals dope. An anonymised survey of competitors in the World Athletics Championships in 2011 found 30% of respondents admitted to having used illegal drugs in the year before the competition, but just 0.5% failed tests. Against this onslaught of cheating, the main anti-doping agency, Wada, has a budget of a mere $30m a year, less than the annual earnings of a couple of top athletes. The Russians, smarting from the exposure of their state-sponsored doping programme – which led to the exclusion of more than a hundred of their athletes from last year’s Rio Olympics and now a further ban from next year’s winter games in South Korea – will be watching closely. The claim from Thomas Bach, the president of the IOC, that the latest sanctions on Russia would be a catalyst for a more effective anti-doping system, stretches credulity. But the yearning for athletes who appear to transcend human limits is as old as the Games of classical times. And so is trying to cheat."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"us-news/2017/dec/13/doug-joness-victory-over-roy-moore-could-mean-a-dramatic-shift-in-congress","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-13T22:45:43Z","webTitle":"Doug Jones’s victory over Roy Moore could mean a dramatic shift in Congress","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/dec/13/doug-joness-victory-over-roy-moore-could-mean-a-dramatic-shift-in-congress","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/dec/13/doug-joness-victory-over-roy-moore-could-mean-a-dramatic-shift-in-congress","fields":{"headline":"Doug Jones’s victory over Roy Moore could mean a dramatic shift in Congress","bodyText":"Doug Jones’s stunning victory over Roy Moore in Alabama – which handed Democrats a rare win in the Republican South on Tuesday night – threatens to imperil Donald Trump’s legislative agenda and raises the prospect that the 2018 midterm elections could dramatically shift the balance of power in Congress. Jones gave Democrats a much-needed adrenaline shot by beating Moore, the evangelical former state judge whose campaign was marred by multiple accusations of sexual assault and child molestation. And the morning after, Democrats immediately seized upon the remarkable win, which cuts Republican majority in the Senate to one, as a sign of more victories to come in 2018. “Alabama’s not an outlier – it’s a trend,” Tom Perez, the chairman of the Democratic National Committee, said on a conference call on Wednesday. Tuesday’s results put the House and the Senate majorities in play next year, Perez said, setting an ambitious goal ahead for an election year focused on the November midterms. Democrats have a plausible path to a House majority in 2018, but the midterm map was widely expected to favor Republicans in the Senate. Democrats must defend 10 seats in states where Trump won while, until Alabama shifted the ground, only two Republican seats were seen as vulnerable. Perez said Democrats have a real shot at winning Senate seats in Arizona and Tennessee, where the Republican senators are retiring after clashes with Trump, as well as in Nevada, where the Republican senator is being challenged from the right by a candidate aligned closely with the president. “The field is very wide open,” Perez said. “I think we will win the House of Representatives, I think we will win the US Senate.” Yet the circumstances of the race for the Alabama seat vacated by Jeff Sessions, who is now the attorney general, were unique. Moore, who late on Tuesday was refusing to concede the race, had been favored in the state until two women came forward to claim that he assaulted them when they were teenagers; a number of other women said the Alabama Republican had romantically pursued them when they were underage. Moore has denied all the allegations. On Tuesday night, Jones emerged to a euphoric reception just before 10pm local time. “Folks, I gotta tell you, I think that I have been waiting all my life and now I just don’t know what the hell to say,” he said, beginning a 10-minute speech. “I have always believed that the people of Alabama had more in common than what would divide us.” On Wednesday, at a relaxed post-election press conference, Jones brushed off Moore’s refusal to concede. He noted that he had a congratulatory call from Trump and said “when the president of United States who endorsed Roy Moore calls me and congratulates me I think it’s pretty clean cut”. Jones said Trump had also invited him to visit the White House once he arrived in Washington and that he had also heard from both Chuck Schumer and Mitch McConnell as well as both of the Yellowhammer State’s current senators. Senate majority cut Republican control of the Senate now rests precariously on the narrowest 51 to 49 seat margin. Jones struck a far more cautious note than many of his future colleagues who have demanded that he be seated right away in order to vote on the tax cut bill currently before Congress. The senator-elect didn’t take a position on the urgency of taking his seat in the Senate. “We’ll see the way it goes and I’ll go with it either way,” said Jones. On Capitol Hill, Chuck Schumer, the Democratic minority leader, said 2018 is “looking good for us”. “The Republican brand, even in deep-red Alabama, is positively toxic,” he told reporters on Wednesday. “If they continue to run the government for the benefit of the few special, powerful, wealthy interests, there will be many more Alabamas in 2018, many more,” he added. Schumer said the turn-out in Alabama followed a similar pattern as elections earlier this year in Virginia and New Jersey: an energized Democratic base; strong turnout by African American voters; decisive support from millennials; and significant gains among suburban white voters – an especially ominous sign for Republicans who are contemplating elections in affluent districts with highly-educated and high-income voters. “The suburbs are swinging back to us,” Schumer said. “Republicans, with their policies, are going to lose them in 2018. And now they’re even making it worse with their tax bill, which is an anti-suburban tax bill.” In the short-term, Democrats are mounting an unlikely effort to persuade the Republican Senate leadership to postpone the vote on their tax plan until after Jones is seated as a senator in the New Year. But a senior Republican aide said there was no intention of changing the timeline of the tax vote – the party hopes to have a bill on Trump’s desk next week. Jones’ victory is also a major political setback for Trump, who vigorously endorsed the Alabama Republican despite the sex allegations against him and held a rally on his behalf last week, just over the state line in Pensacola, Florida. Although most national Republican figures rushed to distance themselves from Moore in the aftermath of the allegations that he targeted teenage girls while he was in his 30s, Trump reaffirmed his support through tweets and public statements. On Wednesday, Trump, who rarely concedes defeat or accepts responsibility, claimed that he had known all along that Moore was unelectable, which, he said, was why he initially endorsed his opponent, Luther Strange, during Alabama’s summer Republican primary. “If last night’s election proved anything, it proved that we need to put up GREAT Republican candidates to increase the razor thin margins in both the House and Senate,” he said. However, as the soul-searching begins, Republican establishment figures like Senate leader Mitch McConnell are braced for an even uglier civil war with the populist faction whipped up by Trump’s former White House adviser Steve Bannon. Bannon blames entrenched Washington politicians for abandoning Moore and the interests of deeply conservative grassroots voters, while more moderate conservatives see his aggressive bid to takeover the party with firebrand candidates as a disaster for their image. Earlier this year, Bannon declared a “season of war” on the so-called GOP establishment and has vowed to recruit and field candidates against Republican incumbents in 2018. But some Republicans are hopeful the sting of defeat will deflate Bannon’s confidence – and weaken his influence with the president. “I don’t think Steve Bannon adds anything positive at all to the dialogue in the country,” New York congressman Pete King, a Republican, said on MSNBC, after calling on his party to “dump Bannon” the night before. In his floor remarks, McConnell did not mention the Alabama election results in his before succumbing to a coughing fit. He was granted permission to submit the rest of his remarks for the public record and left the floor. “Strange to say I guess from my side of the aisle, but I thought it was a great night for America, so I couldn’t be more happy,” Senator Bob Corker, a Republican from Tennessee who is retiring at the end of his term, told reporters on Capitol Hill. Yet Republicans downplayed the significance of the result, insisting that it did not signal a Democratic wave in 2018. “This isn’t a rebuke of conservative values or agendas,” Republican senator Cory Gardner, the chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, told reporters. “This was a rebuke of a candidate.” Ben Jacobs contributed reporting from Birmingham, Alabama."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/filmblog/2017/dec/16/the-last-jedi-star-wars-discuss-with-spoilers-porgs-force","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-16T18:05:44Z","webTitle":"Star Wars: The Last Jedi: the Porgs, the Force and the future - discuss with spoilers","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2017/dec/16/the-last-jedi-star-wars-discuss-with-spoilers-porgs-force","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/filmblog/2017/dec/16/the-last-jedi-star-wars-discuss-with-spoilers-porgs-force","fields":{"headline":"Star Wars: The Last Jedi: the Porgs, the Force and the future - discuss with spoilers","bodyText":"Fan theorists were certain that Rian Johnson’s The Last Jedi would be to The Empire Strikes Back what JJ Abrams’ The Force Awakens was to the original Star Wars, a movie full of Jedi training sessions on remote planets, rebel backs against the wall and darkling, curveball plot twists. In the end that was only part of the story, for this was a movie that gave us, in the words of Luke Skywalker in one of its earliest trailers, “so much more”. New Force powers, abundant alien creatures like nothing we’ve seen before, and a complex, yet satisfying return for the galaxy’s greatest hero. So what did you think of this latest episode in the long-running space saga? Was Luke’s triumphant and poignant last hurrah your personal highlight? Did Snoke deserve to be written out so ruthlessly, a mere pawn for Adam Driver’s Kylo Ren to access his full dark side inner rage? And what was going on with Leia’s space walk? Here’s a chance to give your verdict on the movie’s key talking points. The Marvel-style humour Rian Johnson is not known for sparky one-liners (though 2008’s The Brothers Bloom had its moments). Of the American director’s best-known films, Brick was slick and sharp as a vintage sheath knife in its high-school noir stylings, if not exactly funny, while Looper was brooding and serious from the opening credits. And so it comes as something of a shock that The Last Jedi is packed with comedy thunderbolts designed to provide sweet relief from the horrors of space war, while occasionally papering over the cracks of a creaking, multi-stranded plot (just like Marvel then – well, Lucasfilm and the comic book studio are both owned by Disney). Johnson even resorts to barely concealed tomfoolery to avoid having to deal with the six million dangling threads left to him by The Force Awakens’ JJ Abrams. What will Luke Skywalker do with the lightsaber – once his dear old dead Sith Lord dad’s – that has been returned to him from another world, we all wondered for two years. And why did the Jedi Knight’s laser sword “call” to Daisy Ridley’s Rey last time out at Maz Kanata’s castle on Takodana? We’ll never know now, because Skywalker used his first 10 seconds of screen time to chuck the weapon over a cliff, as if dismissing the enigma for another day. By the final scenes, the audience I watched The Last Jedi with had become so conditioned to getting a laugh every few minutes that Luke’s invincibility in the face of First Order firepower in that impressive endgame on Crait drew guffaws rather than awe. I’m not certain Johnson intended it that way. The creatures, robots and aliens The Porgs were clearly supposed to get on your nerves – they pretty much succeeded. But what did you think of Crait’s vulptices (crystal foxes), and Ahch-To’s nun-like Caretakers? How about BB-8’s evil twin BB-9E, or the giant, racing goat-monsters of Canto Bight? Why was Lupita Nyong’o’s Maz Kanata featured so briefly, and will she play a bigger role in Episode IX? Let the past be the past Star Wars’ traditional penchant for major twists and Abrams’ refusal to give much away in The Force Awakens has encouraged a billion fan theories and YouTube channels dedicated to dreaming up back stories for Rey, Snoke, Poe Dameron et al. But the only tale Johnson seemed interesting in telling in The Last Jedi was about Kylo Ren’s teenage battles with Skywalker after the latter discovered that his student had been turned to the dark side. We didn’t even get to meet the other Knights of Ren – though we can perhaps assume these were the fellow Jedi padawan who Skywalker said had left with Ben Solo after their spat on Ahch-To. Ren suggested during the scene in Snoke’s throne room that Rey’s parents were nobodies, and the one-time Jakku scavenger looked as if she believed him. Did you buy this anti-climactic epiphany? Or is the big reveal still being saved for part three? How about Snoke? Will we ever know who he was now that the giant alien freak has been rudely cut in half by his student in the dark arts? Some may turn to Star Wars novels and comic books to find out more, but (on the big screen at least) Andy Serkis’ tortoise-faced First Order big bad turned out to be pretty small fry. The shifting nature of the Force Star Wars surely needs to keep evolving if it is to last another 40 years. But the introduction of what we’ll call Force “projection” in The Last Jedi throws up all manner of potential problems. If Luke was able to project himself across the galaxy to Crait while never actually leaving Ahch-To, then what abilities might even more powerful Jedi have been able to master? Perhaps Obi-Wan Kenobi never fought Vader in 1977’s Star Wars, but simply “projected” himself all the way from his cave on Tatooine. He might still be there, enjoying his retirement and doing Taco Thursday each week with the local Jawas for all we know. Likewise, we can now see that powerful Jedi are able to link psychically across vast distances of space. This, of course, was hinted at in the original trilogy, where Luke and Leia were able to connect. That Rey and Ren appear to have upgraded the process from a nebulous nagging feeling to ultra-HD video comms suggests either that the original trilogies’ heroes were not doing it right or that the next generation is somehow far more powerful than any of its predecessors. Leia’s powers and Carrie Fisher’s elegant swansong We’ll never get to find out what other abilities Leia might have picked up since the original trilogy, but it was exciting to see that she’s capable of using the Force to transfer herself across dead space and come out the other side just about alive. Fisher played the role of the Resistance’s leader with rare charm and considerable humility. It seems likely the princess turned general will now get an off-screen death in Episode IX, which is certainly preferable to the mo-cap ghosted alternative. Where to next? If The Force Awakens left threads dangling, The Last Jedi has added millions more. Is Adam Driver’s Kylo Ren really ready to be the Darth Vader and Emperor Palpatine of this new Star Wars trilogy? Will Rey end up restoring the Jedi order, or will she follow Luke’s lead and set up her own Force movement, perhaps one that is equidistant between the dark side and the light? Is anyone else feeling a little nervous that Episode IX will once again be overseen by Abrams, otherwise known as the creator of Lost? That show was after all, famous for never quite bothering to resolve a number of its most vital enigmas."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/dec/22/cocktails-and-canapes-recipes-for-christmas-rosie-sykes","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-22T12:00:00Z","webTitle":"Rosie Sykes’ recipes for Christmas cocktails and canapés | Cocktails and canapés","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/dec/22/cocktails-and-canapes-recipes-for-christmas-rosie-sykes","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/dec/22/cocktails-and-canapes-recipes-for-christmas-rosie-sykes","fields":{"headline":"Rosie Sykes’ recipes for Christmas cocktails and canapés","bodyText":"Some days demand a stiff drink and a bite to eat, whether it’s a cosy night on the sofa, or the bright lights of Christmas.

My dear friend Peter and I once met in a bar in Manhattan to drink martinis and share a couple of plates of their famous devilled eggs, bringing to mind this quote from Pulitzer-prizewinning journalist Herb Caen: “Martinis are like breasts: one isn’t enough and three is too many.” In my book, it’s a sentiment that applies equally to stuffed eggs. The most delicious stuffed eggs I have eaten in recent memory – and the inspiration for this recipe – were at a supper cooked by the amazing chef James Ferguson. Makes 1 2 eggs 2 tbsp tinned anchovies, finely chopped 1 tsp olive oil Finely grated zest and juice of ¼ lemon ½ tsp dijon mustard A generous pinch of smoked paprika 2 tbsp mayonnaise A small handful of parsley, finely chopped Cornichons or small pickled onions, to serve 1 Put the eggs into a saucepan of cold water. Bring to the boil, then lower the heat so the water is just simmering. Cook for 12 minutes. Meanwhile, put the anchovies in a bowl with the oil and mash to a paste, then add the lemon zest, mustard, paprika and mayonnaise and mix until smooth. Stir in the parsley. 2 Lift out the eggs and cool completely in cold water until completely cold – this will take a good few minutes. Then carefully peel the eggs and cut them in half lengthways. Scoop out the yolks and add them to the anchovy mixture, then mash lightly together – I like a little bit of texture. Taste the stuffing mixture; season with lemon, salt and pepper to taste. 3 Depending on how many cocktails you are planning to have, it might be worth taking a tiny slice from the bottom of each egg-white “boat” so they sit steadily on the plate. Spoon or, if you’re feeling super-fancy, pipe the stuffing back into the egg-white boats, then serve at room temperature with a few cornichons or little pickled onions. Light-emitting diode...

Sip and perform a backwards somersault. ... with a squash and truffle brandade Strictly speaking, brandade is a Provençal dish of salt cod puréed with garlic, olive oil and sometimes potato, but I have used ithere because the texture of the end result is similar. We’re so spoilt these days with the wide range of squash and pumpkins available to us. In their many guises, they make such aIf you’re feeling extra-decadent, you can grate over a little parmesan as well. Makes 6 1 small squash – about 680g Salt and black pepper A small grating of nutmeg 2 tsp olive oil 60g (4 tbsp) unsalted butter 1 tbsp truffle oil 3 pitta breads or flatbreads A few shavings of fresh truffle (optional) 1 Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/gas 4. Cut the squash in half and scoop out the seeds of both halves with a spoon. Season the flesh side liberally with salt and pepper, then grate over a little nutmeg. 2 Put each half on to a large sheet of oiled foil, skin-side down, then splash over the rest of the olive oil and a good smattering of water. Wrap up the squash halves to form two parcels and bake for 50–60 minutes or until totally soft, but not brown. Scrape all the flesh out. If it seems waterlogged, tip into a sieve set over a saucepan and drain for about half an hour, or until the squash looks dry. Then put the pan over a medium heat and let the liquid simmer and reduce until syrupy. 3 Meanwhile, mash the squash. When the liquid has reduced, add the squash to the pan to warm through. Now gradually beat in the butter, bit by bit, until you have a lovely rich and glossy mixture. Season to taste with salt and pepper, then stir in three-quarters of the truffle oil. 4 Put the pitta breads or flatbreads under a hot grill to warm through, then cut into bite-sized strips. 5 Scrape the squash brandade into a warm bowl and sprinkle with the rest of the truffle oil (now is the time for a few shavings of truffle, if you have one tucked away somewhere), then surround with the strips of bread. Trainwreck... This will either cause an incident or revive those at the scene. For this drink, crushed ice is best, as it helps to cool the ingredients quickly and melts in such a way as to soften the harshness of the alcohol. But if you don’t have an ice-crusher or a powerful blender, ice cubes will do. Makes 1 Crushed ice 2 parts rye whiskey or bourbon 1 part Campari 1 part simple syrup, ideally infused with orange or grapefruit zest 2 parts orange juice – or, if in season, blood orange juice Orange slices, for decoration Paper drinking straw 1 Half-fill a small metal Julep cup or short tumbler with ice. Pour in the rye whiskey or bourbon, the Campari, syrup and orange juice and stir well. 2 Top up with enough ice to give your drink a bountiful appearance. Garnish with half-moon-shaped slices of orange and add a paper straw. ... with white bean croquettes with herby mayonnaise A few stints of living in the south of Spain have made me a croquette aficionado. I like this type for home cooking, because it doesn’t involve making a bechamel sauce, so it’s relatively simple and very tasty. Makes 8 1 tbsp extra virgin olive oil 1 medium red onion, finely sliced 1 small sprig rosemary, leaves stripped and finely chopped 2 garlic cloves, crushed 120g baby spinach leaves 400g tin of cannellini beans, drained 100g panko or other breadcrumbs 1 tbsp mint, finely chopped 1 tbsp parsley, finely chopped A generous pinch of chilli flakes 75g mayonnaise 1 egg 6 tbsp light olive oil 1 Heat the extra virgin olive oil in a saucepan over a low heat and add the onion and rosemary. Cook very gently until soft and sweet, then add the garlic and stir about for a minute. 2 Add the spinach and mix well, stirring until it wilts. Add the beans and warm through. 3 Transfer the contents of the pan to a food processor and whizz to a smooth paste. Add 20g of breadcrumbs. Pulse to combine. The mixture should be quite stiff – if it seems too wet, add more breadcrumbs. Scrape into a bowl and transfer to the fridge for an hour or so. Meanwhile, stir the mint, parsley and chilli flakes into the mayonnaise. 4 Lightly beat the egg in a shallow bowl. Put the remaining breadcrumbs into another. Scoop out tablespoonfuls of the croquette mixture, roll into balls and then flatten into pucks. Dip the croquettes in beaten egg and then breadcrumbs, shaking off any excess. Double-dip the croquettes to give them an extra-crisp shell, if you like. 5 Heat the light olive oil in a small frying pan and, when hot, fry the croquettes in batches of three to keep the oil hot. Keep turning them until they are golden all over, then drain on kitchen paper. Eat while hot, dipped in, or drizzled with, the herby mayo. Rosie Sykes is a freelance chef and menu consultant.

Greening will use a speech on Thursday to set out measures including £50m for schools to open new nursery places. “Talent is spread evenly across our country, but opportunity isn’t,” she told the Guardian. “At each stage of a child and young person’s life, there are gaps that open up, and we need to make sure that we stop that.” The Conservatives have been under pressure to demonstrate their commitment to the issue after the social mobility commission, chaired by Alan Milburn, resigned earlier this month. Alongside the nursery funding, policies to be announced by Greening include £23m for a “future talent fund”, targeted at bright students from poorer backgrounds, and closer cooperation with businesses in providing apprenticeships and drawing up technical qualifications. The shadow education secretary, Angela Rayner, who has repeatedly pressed the government over cuts to early-years provision, said that “despite the rhetoric from the government, it is the Tories who are responsible for setting back a generation of young people. Ministers have slashed funding for Sure Start, cut school budgets by £2.7bn, imposed real-terms cuts on teachers’ pay and abolished the educational maintenance allowance, which has made it harder for those from disadvantaged backgrounds to stay in education.” But Greening told the Guardian: “I do feel that all the opposition have had to offer on this has been money and slogans. “If there’s one thing we’ve learned over the past 30 years, it’s that if you could buy your way out of this problem we would have done it.” She said funding per pupil had increased by 70% in real terms between 1990 and 2020, while rejecting the idea that Sure Start closures had affected early-years provision. “We need to move beyond a simplistic argument that it’s the amount of money you spend, or whether there’s a Sure Start or not. It’s about what actually happens on the ground, and the impact that it makes.” She said the package as a whole would create “a structure and an architecture” to tackle the problem - but solutions would be different across the country. “What we’ve learnt over the years is, yes, we need a national strategy – but it needs to be tailored to very different communities, and how we might do this in rural Cambridgeshire is very different to what will work better, say, in Scarborough, or Oldham, or Derby.” One of the ambitions set out in the new strategy is to close the “language gap” that means some children arrive at school less prepared for education. “We know some children turn up at reception, they’re already behind, and they can’t make the best of their school years,” Greening said. “They can’t understand as well and they can’t articulate as well when they want to communicate with their teacher. And we know that they go on to do far worse in their GCSEs because of that. They go on to have lower opportunities post-16 because of that; they go on to have much more restrictive and worse career options because of that.” But the Pre-school Learning Alliance, which represents nurseries, warned that the £50m boost to school-based nurseries would not be enough. “Research has shown that investment into the early years is the most effective way to improve children’s long-term life chances, and yet, for years now, the sector has been chronically underfunded,” said its chief executive, Neil Leitch. “The education secretary is right to say that where you start in life often decides where you finish. It’s time, then, that the government put its money where its mouth is and invested what’s needed to ensure that all children get the start they deserve.” Peter Lampl, chairman of the Sutton Trust, which aims to boost attainment of pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds, welcomed the government’s strategy, which is called Unlocking Talent, Fulfilling Potential. But he warned that the government appeared to be ducking reform of schools admissions policies. “There are areas where more should be done. We need to be sure that the resources are there to match the ambitions of the new plan, particularly to support good teaching in disadvantaged areas. Admissions policy seems to have been put in the ‘too difficult’ box, yet without reforming admissions poorer pupils will continue to miss out on the best schools,” he said. Lampl also highlighted the need to ensure that disadvantaged pupils had access to the best apprenticeships and did not graduate from university with the largest debts. Education funding was a divisive issue during the general election campaign, with some Conservative MPs complaining that they struggled to respond to Labour’s argument that schools were suffering too many cuts. Greening responded to those concerns by setting aside an extra £1.3bn for the core schools budget over the next two years after the general election – but with the Treasury refusing to underwrite the pledge, she was forced to dip into other parts of the Department for Education’s budget in order to find the money."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2017/dec/12/roy-moore-loses-alabama-senate-race-doug-jones-wins","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-13T13:35:59Z","webTitle":"Alabama election: Democrats triumph over Roy Moore in major blow to Trump","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/dec/12/roy-moore-loses-alabama-senate-race-doug-jones-wins","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/dec/12/roy-moore-loses-alabama-senate-race-doug-jones-wins","fields":{"headline":"Alabama election: Democrats triumph over Roy Moore in major blow to Trump","bodyText":"The Democrat Doug Jones has beaten his Donald Trump-backed Republican rival Roy Moore in the diehard Republican state of Alabama, setting off a political earthquake likely to shake Washington. His victory in a special election for a US Senate seat – by a margin of 49.9 to 48.4 with 100% of precincts reporting – is a major personal blow to the president and his efforts to pass tax reform on Capitol Hill. Jones was able to become the first Democrat in a decade to win any statewide office in Alabama by beating Moore, who had faced multiple allegations of sexual assault during a campaign which exposed Republican party faultlines. Moore, who late on Tuesday was refusing to concede the race, had been favored in the deep red state until two women came forward to claim that Moore assaulted them when they were teenagers; a number of other women said the Alabama Republican had romantically pursued them when they were underage. Moore has denied all the allegations. Alabama has long faced a profound racial divide, which was reflected in the results. According to an exit poll, Jones won 95% of the African-American vote but only 27% of the white vote in the Yellowhammer State. However, widespread African-American turnout on Jones’s behalf overcame Moore’s margins in rural, predominantly white parts of Alabama. Jones also made significant inroads among college-educated whites. He won well-educated Madison county by a margin of 57-40. A center of the aerospace industry, the county voted for Trump by a margin of 55-38 in 2016. ‘More in common than what would divide us’ Jones emerged to a euphoric reception just before 10pm local time. “Folks, I gotta tell you, I think that I have been waiting all my life and now I just don’t know what the hell to say,” he said, beginning a 10-minute speech. “I have always believed that the people of Alabama had more in common than what would divide us.” The election had never been either about him or Moore, he insisted. “This entire race has been about dignity and respect. This campaign has been about the rule of law. This campaign has been about common courtesy and decency and making sure everyone in this state, regardless of what zip code you live in, is going to get a fair shake.” His speech was met with cheers and applause and chants of “USA! USA!” The Democratic victory will reduce the Republican majority in the Senate to 51-49 once Jones takes his seat on Capitol Hill. This significantly reduces the margin for error as Republicans attempt to push through a major corporate tax cut. They already have one defector in senator Bob Corker, and Jones’s election means a single additional Republican breaking ranks would sink the legislation. Moore’s defeat also marks a major personal blow to Trump, who endorsed the Alabama Republican and held a rally on his behalf just over the state line in Pensacola, Florida. Although most national Republicans rushed to distance themselves from Moore in the aftermath of the allegations, Trump reaffirmed his support through tweets and public statements. Shortly after the results were called, Trump tweeted his congratulations to Jones: Early on Wednesday morning, the president tried to claim he had always known Moore would lose, recalling his backing for opponent Luther Strange in the Republican primary that had preceded the special election. “The reason I originally endorsed Luther Strange (and his numbers went up mightily),” Trump wrote, “is that I said Roy Moore will not be able to win the General Election. I was right! Roy worked hard but the deck was stacked against him!” Moore’s defeat is a significant blow to the efforts by Steve Bannon and the populist Trump wing of the Republican party to undermine Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell. Bannon and his allies are planning a series of primary challenges against establishment Republicans in 2018. Moore’s defeat significantly reduces their leverage as the joint efforts of Bannon and his rightwing news website, Breitbart, could not elect their preferred candidate in a state that Trump won in a landslide in 2016. Steven Law, the head of the McConnell-allied Senate Leadership Fund, put the blame squarely on Bannon moments after the race was called. “This is a brutal reminder that candidate quality matters regardless of where you are running,” Law said. “Not only did Steve Bannon cost us a critical Senate seat in one of the most Republican states in the country, but he also dragged the president of the United States into his fiasco.” Cory Gardner, the head of the National Republican Senate Committee, which flatly refused to back Moore, said: “Tonight’s results are clear: the people of Alabama deemed Roy Moore unfit to serve in the US Senate.” While national Republicans accepted defeat, at Moore’s election night event, the candidate and his supporters still held out hope. ‘The evening is not over yet’ Moore’s campaign chairman, Bill Armistead, took the stage to insist that “the evening is not over yet” and cited Alabama’s provision for an automatic recount if result was within half of a percentage point. He also noted optimistically that there were still outstanding military ballots. Moore then took the stage to say: “When the vote is this close, it’s not over.” He then bemoaned that he had been “painted in an unfavorable and unfaithful light” before urging attendees to go home and go to sleep. Cal Zastrow, a friend of Moore who had come down from Michigan to volunteer for the campaign, tried to frame the results within a bigger picture. “I was cheering for him and supporting him but Jesus is wonderful whether Roy Moore wins or loses,” he said. “I’m not distressed. I’m not discouraged. Jesus is wonderful.” At Jones’ election night party hundreds of supporters, many waving signs, erupted in cheers at a hotel ballroom in Birmingham when, on giant TV screens, CNN declared the race for the Democrat. There were hugs, smiles, tears and chants of “We want Doug!” The raw emotion was evident. John Parker, 26, a bartender, said: “I think it’s astounding and unprecedented in Alabama politics, and a response to what we’re seeing nationally. This is a direct response to President Trump. Roy Moore is unfit for any job, let alone [that of] a public servant. Alabama tonight voted for America.” He added: “There is hope and joy. Tomorrow’s another day in Alabama.” Caitlin Barringer, 29, who works in healthcare, said: “We finally have a person who will represent all of Alabama. I can’t believe it’s taken this long for people to realise that Roy Moore is not what he says he is.” Looking at the media crews in the ballroom, she added: “I’m thankful everyone from all over the world is here and Alabama has shown we are so much more than closed-minded people.” Community activist Keith Williams, 43, who is African American, said: “Miracles do happen. I have a message for America: don’t count Alabama out. The progressive movement is going forward.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2017/dec/12/manchester-city-pep-guardiola-defensive-signing","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-12T22:34:45Z","webTitle":"Manchester City need defensive signing to avoid trouble says Pep Guardiola","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/dec/12/manchester-city-pep-guardiola-defensive-signing","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/dec/12/manchester-city-pep-guardiola-defensive-signing","fields":{"headline":"Manchester City need defensive signing to avoid trouble says Pep Guardiola","bodyText":"Pep Guardiola believes he may have to sign a defender in the January transfer window or Manchester City could be “in trouble”. Benjamin Mendy is recovering from a serious knee problem and will not return before April while John Stones has a pulled hamstring and is unlikely to play before the new year. Guardiola also admits Vincent Kompany is too injury-prone to be relied on, the captain having to be replaced at half-time of the 2-1 win over Manchester United at Old Trafford owing to his latest muscle malady. “We are thinking about it,” Guardiola said. “In that department we have too few players and to handle all competitions we are in trouble, real trouble if this is the case. But I can’t assure anything. We’re going to see what will happen in January. “Maybe we are thinking of looking at another central defender because of Vincent’s problems, John Stones is four or five weeks out. And we miss an important player like Mendy.” Guardiola may again try to sign West Bromwich Albion’s Jonny Evans following last summer’s failed bid. He had to turn to Eliaquim Mangala as a 59th-minute replacement in the derby, Ilkay Gündogan having replaced Kompany at the interval. Mangala was nearly sold in the summer but Guardiola may now have to use him more. “We were clear on Mangala that we needed a solution in the summer,” the manager said. “The moment we didn’t I met with him in my office and said: ‘Now you are my player, you’ll be treated like everyone else.’ The reason we looked for another one, he knows. But in some games he is going to help us. “At half-time of the derby I didn’t use Mangala because I tried to send a message to the players that I wanted to win the game. After we scored, I thought Zlatan Ibrahimovic would come in, so I decided to put Mangala in front, and pulled a striker out [Gabriel Jesus] because I wanted one more man in the middle to make more passes.” Guardiola has a contingency plan should Kevin De Bruyne or David Silva be injured. “They are so important players and if it does happen Gündogan will be ready, Phil Foden will be ready, Yaya Touré will be ready for us to find a solution.” Sunday’s derby victory was a fifth consecutive 2-1 scoreline for City. Guardiola praised the spirit of his side, who travel to Swansea on Wednesday evening, in being able to win while not always performing at their best. “It’s a very healthy team spirit,” he said. “When you win a lot of games it helps you to build that spirit but the most important thing is the spirit wasn’t lost last season even though we were more sad, more upset because the results were not like we expect. It’s impossible to achieve [City’s record-equalling] 14 league wins in a row just by playing football. Forget it. “The people outside the club can discuss many things but in games our spirit shows we were there to try to do our thing, like at Old Trafford, which is so demanding a stadium. Nobody can assure you, but my feeling is right now – I don’t know in the future – we are going to try to do that, play with spirit.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2017/dec/12/a-less-rose-tinted-view-of-justin-trudeau-canada","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-12T19:41:22Z","webTitle":"A less rose-tinted view of Justin Trudeau’s Canada | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/dec/12/a-less-rose-tinted-view-of-justin-trudeau-canada","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/dec/12/a-less-rose-tinted-view-of-justin-trudeau-canada","fields":{"headline":"A less rose-tinted view of Justin Trudeau’s Canada","bodyText":"Despite pleasure in seeing my country praised, I am not quick to agree with Will Goble that Canada may be considered an enlightened democracy today (Letters, High cost of wrecking the Soviet Union, 11 December).

It needs a national response","bodyText":"Six months to the day after the Grenfell Tower fire, those directly affected are coming together with the wider community for a memorial service in St Paul’s Cathedral to honour the 71 people who lost their lives. The status of that national commemoration is as important as the timing. The event takes place in the same week as the start of the procedural hearings for the official Grenfell inquiry. Prince Harry and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge will attend, and there are rumours that the prime minister will be there. For some, this will be a fitting tribute to lost loved ones and lost homes. For others, it will be a painful juxtaposition that will make it too difficult for them to attend. Elizabeth Campbell, the leader of Kensington and Chelsea council, has been asked not to go. It will be a national event, with appropriately local input. The cathedral will be decorated with a specially commissioned banner featuring the green Grenfell heart. Music will come from the Ebony Steel Band, and a children’s choir made up of girls from the Al-Sadiq and Al-Zahra schools. Their voices will remind us of the 18 children who died in the fire, and the youngest victim, a stillborn baby who never had the chance to breathe. It is right that this should be a national memorial service. But what that also highlights is the parallel and continuing failure of national authorities to fully step up and undertake their responsibilities with regard to those so grievously affected. Six months on, what has been accomplished for the survivors and bereaved, the local and wider communities? What has been put in place to help children and young people doing their homework in hotel rooms, or those in the community who grieve for their friends each day as they pass the tower? Answer: not nearly enough. I cannot pretend to speak for those affected, but I can tell you the most pressing issue: housing. It’s the problem that prevents people from moving on or processing their grief. We know that half of the households who need to be rehoused are still living in hotels. We know that four out of five will spend Christmas in one room, with no cooking facilities. We know that rehousing targets themselves have shifted or been missed: from Theresa May’s famous “three week” pledge, to “by Christmas”, to “by the first anniversary”. If there was little trust at the beginning, it has fallen further with each failed promise. The council says it is buying “two homes a day”, but there are issues with the quality of housing being procured. The much-publicised luxury flats bought early on weren’t completed for months. Properties are being offered and then withdrawn. Several families have been allocated homes that are inadequate: unadapted for disabilities, or outside the borough. Survivors are being made to bid against each other. Homes fall through. People are demoralised and lose hope. That may sound normal to people who have bought properties before – but this is not a case of individuals choosing to move. This is a case of citizens bereaved by the state. They have lost everything. Passports. Childhood photos. Degree certificates. Family records. Jewellery. Birth certificates. Babies’ hospital bracelets. Pets. All were lost in the fire. Think of the daily practical difficulties that come with living in a hotel room. It is hard to look after a baby in a hotel, without room for them to play, or crawl, living with boxes stacked up to the ceiling. Imagine coordinating the school run, or the daily washing of clothes. And who is there to help? Key workers and housing officers appear to be under-resourced and undertrained. Some families have had nine key workers, some have had six or seven different housing officers. This means traumatised people having to tell their stories again and again.” This is why families rely on volunteers,” one of them told me. “Volunteers have been constant while everyone around them is constantly changing.” Think of those bereaved. Many have not received adequate counselling or support, and it’s unclear if the council or government have a full list of them six months on. “The saddest thing,” I was told by Ahmed Chellat, who lost five relatives in the fire at Grenfell, “is coming home at night. For years you’d see the lights and think, ‘Abdul is there in his house.’ I can’t look at it [the tower]. I just can’t.” Where progress has been made, it has often been hard-won. It is commendable that the council has adopted the Hillsborough charter, which commits it to putting public interest above its own reputation, to a duty of candour and to being accountable and open. The council’s barrister mentioned this at length in his statement to the inquiry on Tuesday. And yet, the support group Grenfell United insists that this only happened after pressure from survivors. The new chief executive promised a culture change, but still Conservative councillors are accused by residents of falling asleep in meetings and of checking their phones as survivors give harrowing testimony. “It violates our dignity,” Samia Badani, a local resident from nearby Bramley House, told me. “They have to work on the relationship with us. We don’t see real engagement.” After six months, it is time to take stock. Grenfell is a unique national tragedy and everything we have seen re-emphasises the fact that it requires a national response. Kensington and Chelsea council has been massively restructured. But still, no one observing can truly believe that it can raise its performance enough to give suitable and timely help to children whose Christmas holidays will be spent in one room. The service at St Paul’s will be a milestone, but just as vital is to know what, in practical terms, comes next. Grenfell is, in many respects, a tragedy about listening. In all the noise, we have learned that those affected are the experts on their own lives. Grenfell has taught us that authorities should listen to those involved when they say they are not being listened to. They aren’t being listened to, even now. We must rectify that. Isn’t that their right? • Seraphima Kennedy is a writer and academic researcher.

Top stories Environment funding has been slashed by a third since the Coalition took office according to new analysis by the Australian Conservation Foundation and WWF Australia. Figures show nearly half a billion dollars has been cut since 2013 and forward estimates show that by 2020-21 the Turnbull government plans to have reduced environment spending to less than 60% of the 2013-14 figure. The ACF economist Matt Rose says the government “has no idea how important the environment is to the wellbeing of Australia, the Australian people, the economy and our sense of who we are.” Programs to maintain diversity and protect endangered animal and plant populations and ecosystems are among the hardest hit, with their funding to be cut in half across those eight years. The environment minister, Josh Frydenberg, said the government had “maintained environmental standards while reducing red tape with a one-stop shop for environmental assessments” and pointed to funding for the Great Barrier Reef and a national threatened species strategy. However, the ACF and WWF say the figures show the need for a significant boost in environmental investment in the 2018-19 budget. They called for a new $1.1bn environment fund to boost threatened species recovery, support the expansion and management of protected areas and improve Great Barrier Reef water quality. Donald Trump has lashed out at a female Democratic senator after she called for his resignation over sexual misconduct accusations. The US president tweeted: “Lightweight Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, a total flunky for Chuck Schumer and someone who would come to my office ‘begging’ for campaign contributions not so long ago (and would do anything for them), is now in the ring fighting against Trump.” The New York senator dubbed the attack a “sexist smear”, hitting back on Twitter minutes later: “You cannot silence me or the millions of women who have gotten off the sidelines to speak out about the unfitness and shame you have brought to the Oval Office.” Trump singled out Gillibrand while ignoring the male senators who have also called on him to step down. Australian gas prices are still too high, despite government intervention to increase supply to the domestic market, according to competition watchdog the ACCC. Major gas companies agreed in September to increase supply to avoid a domestic shortfall in 2018, a move which meant the Turnbull government didn’t have to impose its threatened export trigger. The ACCC said there had been some improvements in the availability of gas and prices offered to users in the east-coast market, “however, the east coast gas market is still not functioning effectively and domestic prices are still in excess of the ACCC’s estimates of benchmark prices”. The education minister, Simon Birmingham, has blasted as “woeful” school students’ understanding of government, civic institutions and society values, after the Naplan civics and citizenship test results showed their knowledge of Australian society is either stagnant or declining. For Year 10 students in 2016, just 38% achieved or exceeded the proficient standard, down from 44% in 2013. Birmingham said the results were of “serious concern”. The results were published alongside the final 2017 Naplan scores, which showed that the average reading and numeracy skills of Australian primary school students had improved only marginally in the 10 years since the tests were introduced, while writing skills had deteriorated. New Zealand has become the first major country to effectively ban vaginal mesh implants in response to safety concerns over the surgery. The health ministry has written to leading mesh suppliers asking them to stop marketing the products from January – or prove that their products are safe. “We’re always cautious about the use of the word ‘ban’, but effectively the companies are agreeing no longer to sell these products ... in New Zealand from the 4th of January,” the ministry’s health spokesman, Stewart Jessamine said. The move goes considerably further than recent announcements in other countries, such as Australia and the UK, which only restrict the use of pelvic mesh operations for organ prolapse.

The Manchester City manager, Pep Guardiola, and Manchester United’s José Mourinho stood their ground on Tuesday over the tunnel clashes at Old Trafford, Guardiola insisting his team’s celebrations were “definitely not” excessive and Mourinho responding with a barbed remark about his opponents’ conduct. Guardiola is adamant that he and his City team celebrated Sunday’s derby win in an apt and respectful manner. Following the 2-1 victory a scuffle involving up to 20 players and staff of the clubs broke out in the corridor outside City’s dressing room. With many of the details in dispute, the Guardian’s football cartoonist David Squires imagines what might have taken place inside the Old Trafford tunnel. Thinking time Stars Wars fans will feast on an explosive thrill-ride of galactic proportions when The Last Jedi is released on Thursday, says the Guardian’s chief film critic, Peter Bradshaw. He says the excitingly and gigantically proportioned eighth film in the great Star Wars saga is stacked with colossal confrontations, towering indecisions and teetering temptations, spectacular immolations, huge military engagements, and very small disappointments. The character-driven face-offs are wonderful and the messianic succession crisis about the last Jedi of the title is gripping, including the late Carrie Fisher starring as General Leia, Bradshaw says: “The Last Jedi gives you an explosive sugar rush of spectacle. It’s a film that buzzes with belief in itself and its own mythic universe – a euphoric certainty that I think no other movie franchise has.” The new film from The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert director Stephan Elliott, Swinging Safari, is fabulously sly, cynical and a cheeky coming-of-age story, says Luke Buckmaster. The semi-autobiographical slice of 1970s suburbia is, as narrator Richard Roxburgh puts it, a time “with too much time, too much money and too much cask wine.” Starring Kylie Minogue, Guy Pearce, Asher Keddie and Julian McMahon, the film whisks the audience into a suburban cul-de-sac, which would be quiet and peaceful were it not for the many graceless dingbats who inhabit it. And for anyone worried that the manic trailer cherry-picks all the kooky bits from the film to make it look more zany, Buckmaster can set your mind at ease. “I can assure you the actual film is 10 times as batshit crazy as the marketing materials suggest.” Inequality is not a personal choice, it’s a choice governments make, writes Dr John Falzon, chief executive of the St Vincent de Paul Society national council. Falzon says social services minister Christian Porter’s latest attack on welfare recipients is another distraction from the uncomfortable reality of class inequality in the current generation. He says it’s time to come up with innovative solutions to the growing inequality gap, and full employment should be a policy priority. We should be embarking on a serious reframing of how we can, collectively and with common resources, achieve social and economic security for everyone.

Warburton, the Lions captain on their past two tours, is unlikely to play this season because of neck and knee problems while Faletau suffered knee ligament damage during Bath’s European Champions Cup defeat at Toulon last Saturday. Faletau was taken out at a ruck by the Toulon centre Mathieu Bastareaud and twisted the left knee that twice suffered ligament damage last season. He has a grade three medial ligament tear and will see a specialist to find out whether surgery is required. Whatever the outcome, he will be out of action for three to four months. The lower end of the estimate would mean he would back in action one week before the end of the Six Nations. “A grade three tear is the most serious one a player can have,” said Todd Blackadder, Bath’s director of rugby. “I was pretty excited at having Toby back after four big games for Wales in the autumn and to lose him is a blow.” Bath hoped their England flanker Sam Underhill would be fit for the return against Toulon at the Rec on Saturday, but he is still feeling symptoms after suffering a second concussion of the season last month while playing against Australia at Twickenham. The England centre Manu Tuilagi is in line to make his return from injury for Leicester against Munster at Welford Road on Sunday. He, along with his fellow midfielder Matt Toomua, is back in training having suffered a knee injury following the opening match of the season that was his second start this year. “We will make a call on Manu and Matt later in the week,” said the Leicester director of rugby, Matt O’Connor. “Manu is buoyant and wants to make a contribution.” There is a vacancy in the back division with the full-back Telusa Veainu out for eight weeks after suffering a broken jaw in Munster."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/2017/dec/12/faulk-mcnabb-suspended-nfl-espn-ringer-lawsuit","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-12T21:34:07Z","webTitle":"Faulk, McNabb among pundits taken off air amid sexual harassment allegations","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/dec/12/faulk-mcnabb-suspended-nfl-espn-ringer-lawsuit","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/dec/12/faulk-mcnabb-suspended-nfl-espn-ringer-lawsuit","fields":{"headline":"Faulk, McNabb among pundits taken off air amid sexual harassment allegations","bodyText":"Hall of Fame running back Marshall Faulk and six-time Pro Bowl quarterback Donovan McNabb are among five on-air pundits and a senior executive who have been suspended by ESPN, the NFL Network and Bill Simmons’ The Ringer after a former co-worker alleged sexual misconduct in a lawsuit. Faulk, along with fellow ex-players Heath Evans and Ike Taylor, allegedly groped and made sexually explicit comments to former wardrobe stylist Jami Cantor when they were colleagues at the NFL Network, according to a lawsuit filed against NFL Enterprises by Cantor. NFL spokesman Brian McCarthy on Tuesday identified the three as Faulk, Ike Taylor and Heath Evans and said they have been “suspended from their duties at NFL Network pending an investigation into these allegations”. Former NFL Network executive Eric Weinberger, who’s since become the president of Bill Simmons’s media group, and McNabb, a former NFL Network analyst who’s since left for ESPN, are among those named in the suit. The complaint alleges Weinberger sent “several nude pictures of himself and sexually explicit texts” and told Cantor she was “put on earth to pleasure me”, while Taylor is said to have sent Cantor “sexually inappropriate” photos and a video of him masturbating in the shower. Weinberger has been suspended from The Ringer, who issued the following statement: “These are very serious and disurbing allegations that we were made aware of today. We are placing Eric on leave indefinitely until we have a better understanding of what transpired during his time at the NFL, and we will conduct our own internal investigation.” ESPN said McNabb and Eric Davis, another employee named in the complaint, have been pulled from the air while the network investigates the lawsuit. Josh Krulewitz, a spokesman for the company, said Tuesday in a statement that neither McNabb nor Davis would appear on any of the networks while the investigation proceeds. None of the men accused responded to messages seeking comment from the Associated Press. Cantor worked at the NFL Network for a decade until she was fired in October 2016. She filed an amended complaint originally filed in Los Angeles Superior Court in October. In the suit against NFL Enterprises, she alleges age and sex discrimination, sexual harassment that created a hostile work environment, wrongful termination and defamation."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"politics/shortcuts/2017/dec/12/alan-partridge-is-a-brexiter-how-would-other-classic-tv-characters-vote-in-2017","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-12T07:00:27Z","webTitle":"Alan Partridge is a Brexiter – how would other classic TV characters vote in 2017?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/shortcuts/2017/dec/12/alan-partridge-is-a-brexiter-how-would-other-classic-tv-characters-vote-in-2017","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/shortcuts/2017/dec/12/alan-partridge-is-a-brexiter-how-would-other-classic-tv-characters-vote-in-2017","fields":{"headline":"Alan Partridge is a Brexiter – how would other classic TV characters vote in 2017?","bodyText":"Alan Partridge has always favoured the sports casual blazer so beloved of Nigel Farage. The similarity of Partridge’s political leanings to the ex-Ukip leader were confirmed this week after Steve Coogan revealed his creation is firmly in the leave camp, telling the Radio Times that, as a remainer himself, he was conflicted. However, he said: “Having a fool praise something is a far more powerful indictment than just criticising it.” So, that’s Partridge. But how would other TV characters adjust to the Brexit age? Let’s go back to the 80s when Bread captured the giro-to-giro existence of the Boswells and right now the family would be tearing their hair out at the prospect of universal credit and sticking Jeremy Corbyn’s face at the top of their “borrowed” Christmas tree. (Lilo Lill, as ever, would be a one-woman swingometer with an access-all-areas pass to the backdoor of the food bank.) Further south in the same time period, it would be safe to assume that Del Boy was proud to vote leave in the hope of bringing back the pre-EU days when Britain stood as proud as Nelson Mandela House and you could flog imported blowup dolls down the market without regulation.

We use a treatment to kill living lice and then dehydrate eggs using heated air. Then we nit comb and forensically remove everything. We need to see the kids twice, a week apart, because after the first time there will be eggs left over that no one can see. There’s a narrative that goes around that everyone gets lice and there’s a weariness around parents of, “Oh well, everyone gets them,” but it’s very different if you are the child. People forget what it’s like to be a kid with lice. The child gets excluded, talked about, bullied. Mums try to protect their own children so won’t invite the child with nits to parties. It makes childhood quite an unpleasant experience. Most children who come to us have gone through all the products and they haven’t worked. There’s a lot of emotion around headlice. We’ve seen kids with phenomenal infestations, their heads overflowing with lice. They generally don’t look well and are withdrawn. People are talking about them, avoiding them at school. After the first appointment, when they’ve had a big clear-out, it’s as if it’s gone, and they are a different child when we see them at the second appointment. They’ll be smiling, less peaky in colour, have more energy. We see a dramatic transformation. There was a six-year-old girl who started to wince when her hair was touched. Her head was covered in nits, like a helmet and her hair was falling out. We had to shave her hair off. We also had a girl last summer who pulled off bits of her scalp from scratching so much. There were thousands and thousands of nits. We don’t judge anybody, we’re here to get rid of them and get these kids’ lives back on track. We find boys are more needy than girls, more “mummy mummy” about getting their hair dealt with. But we see more girls because they have a lot of hair. We had a teenager who dyed her hair pink to get rid of her nits, but it dyed all the eggs, so when they hatched all the lice were pink. Lice don’t like testosterone so adult males get them less, but that’s also because they tend to have less hair. We get plenty of mums with them. Children are generally a strong reflection of the parents. If you have rude kids their parents will be rude as well. It’s one of the things I find very interesting about working with kids – they are so influenced by the immediate environment they’re in. We talk about it a lot. The nanny: ‘Don’t let the dad take you home’ What they say about fathers I’ve found to be completely true. When their wives aren’t around or once their children go to bed, they often become inappropriate. I’ve been invited on family holidays by fathers and asked to come days before the children arrive. I always have to let them know I have a boyfriend when I start work to try to put them off. My main rule is don’t let the dads take you home. I make a point of never wearing make-up on the job, never wearing gym kit. I look like shit when I’m working. But I think it’s the youth that men are attracted to. My friends who are nannies always get the worst reception at the school gates. Even when we rock up looking awful the mums give us death stares. The richer the parents are the stingier they tend to be. I have some parents I’ve worked for for a long time asking me for “mates’ rates” when they drive around in Range Rovers and Porsches. There was one family that I quit after a week. They were absolute horrors and the kid was completely out of control. Their mum was in complete denial. I spent every day trying to stop the cat murdering the pet rabbit which roamed the garden. The child was so malicious he was like Damien from The Omen and the parents didn’t discipline him at all. They thought he would grow out of it. Parents don’t punish their children any more, they make excuses or blame you when they act up. The mums who work have so much more respect for you, they really value you. With the mums who stay at home, I think the reason why the dads pay so much attention to nannies is because they come home from work and see the nanny cooking, looking after the kids. The wife is upstairs hungover from lunch. Mums that I work for have me because they know I don’t take shit from the kids and I know a lot of things that I shouldn’t. They confide in me, but at the same time they hate me for it. They tell me about their relationships with friends and how they’re not sleeping with their husbands any more. They all seem desperately unhappy. With the kids, you notice their innocence is taken away from them so quickly. They’re all on Instagram from 10 years old – and they have boyfriends from year five. There’s also so much bullying on social media. I can hear them fighting with each other on Instagram Live and Snapchat. Then they won’t go to sleep because they’re so stimulated by their iPads and phones. The nursery assistant: ‘The girls are easier to handle’ I always imagined I’d be working with cute kids who didn’t speak that much, but two- to five-year-olds are completely exhausting – they do not stop talking. One of the three-year-olds was playing in the sand pit last week and told a mosquito to “Fuck off!” We had to have words. The girls are definitely easier to handle; the boys can be a bit disgusting. Last week a little boy came up to me with a massive turd in his hands. I thought he’s just picked up a fox poo or something, so I asked him where he found it, and he said: “In my pants.” Then he went and put it in the toilet. The biggest part of my job is changing nappies and cleaning them up after they poo themselves. The worst thing about the job is probably when the children hurt each other. I’m always shocked by how malicious little children can be. The boys are so much more aggressive than the girls – not all of them, but it’s definitely more prevalent. Girls tell the teacher, boys attack each other. Also it’s interesting that boys and girls are as vocal as each other at that age. The parents can be challenging. They accuse us of losing the kids’ things and get very overbearing about what we’re feeding them. Having said that parents notice a massive improvement in their children’s happiness when they come here. The kids don’t want to go home. The children’s entertainer: ‘I’m competing with their phones’ There’s always one naughty kid at each party who ruins it for everyone. When you’ve got a group of 20 kids there’s always one or two who want to be the centre of attention. The thing I like about working with kids is they ask you the most ridiculous questions. Everything has to be explained. I get asked: “Why are you standing up?” and “What are you going to do?” They always want to learn, but it does get annoying, especially if you’re hungover or tired. Sometimes, when they ask too many questions I just ignore them. Kids like to do strange things. Quite often they’ll just shout or do silly things. I had a kid a few years ago who halfway through singing and dancing pulled his trousers and pants down, which is quite an awkward thing to deal with as an entertainer. As a male entertainer one of the scariest things is being left alone in a room with the kids. If any accusation is made against us our careers are ruined. If the kids want to give you a hug, or ask to go to the toilet, or they’re all hanging on to my leg, it’s very scary for me because I can’t have them do that. I’m paranoid that the parents could take it the wrong way. Disney had a case a couple of years ago where Tigger was in a picture with a grown woman and she complained that Tigger had his hands on her bum. So now all the characters have to have their hands visible in every picture. Presenters like Rolf Harris have ruined it for our industry. I can’t hug kids; I’ll give them a pat sometimes, but it’s quite scary to be honest. When I worked in Santa’s Grotto we used to get kids as young as three asking for iPhones and very often they’d get them. I think the worst thing with kids these days is their obsession with technology. As a kids’ entertainer I’m constantly competing with video games and toys. It’s sad, but they’re just not interested in magic tricks when they have their own Nintendos. I did a six-year-old’s party a few months ago and when I was trying to do my routine all the kids marched off upstairs to play on the computer. When I went upstairs to get them one told me to fuck off because they wanted to play on the Wii. These days all parents can do to punish kids is take away their computer or the internet. Any discipline is frowned upon. If a mother shouts at her child in the supermarket she’s embarrassed, and if she hit a child she’d be arrested. The private tutor: ‘A lot of the kids are spoilt’ I often think it’s ridiculous how much money I get for a job that almost all parents could do. I teach the 11-plus exams, or the 8-plus exams to children whose high-powered parents aren’t UK nationals. It’s all online – I just Google it, and print off sample papers. I also get £40 an hour teaching five-year-olds English. I teach eight of these sessions a week at £40 an hour and the kids always go to the loo for at least 10 minutes during the lesson. I worked out I get £30 to wait for a child to take a shit. Two kids I tutor have cameras in the room, and the parents don’t tell you explicitly. I have some parents who haven’t told their kids that I’m a tutor. They say I’m a friend because they can’t let school find out the child has a tutor. But then they want you to follow a syllabus, which is hard when you’re pretending to be their “friend”. A lot of the kids I teach are very spoilt. The parents are only there from midnight to 6am because they’re at work and when they see the kids they don’t want to tell them off for something they did four days ago involving a tutor they haven’t met. The nicer kids offer me coffee and treat me like a person rather than staff. Kids find it very odd that I have a boyfriend who isn’t my husband. Parents get awkward about it as well. The kids with divorced parents are more grown-up. I tutored an eight-year-old who didn’t pass his 8-plus exams, and a lot of his friends did. He would say things like: “What do I need to do to succeed?” He reiterated things that his teachers and parents said. The social worker: ‘They always teach me the latest lingo’ I deal with kids from 0 to 18 years in all areas of child protection, so I work with kids in care and also those at home with their families. I am always shocked at the extent to which poverty and deprivation lives next to extreme wealth. People just aren’t aware of this. Working with young people and the police in these communities, I really doubt the politicians have any understanding of the experience of young people. I work with a lot of teenagers who don’t want to go home and I’m trying to be the middle man between them and their parents. It’s like having responsibility for a difficult child, with all the worry and sleepless nights about making sure they are OK, without all the benefits of being their parent. I also work with young people who are associated with gangs. They teach me quite a lot about what is happening “on road” as it’s called. I’m learning a lot more from them than I’m ever teaching them. They teach me all the latest lingo, most recently a whole host of words meaning blow job. I try really hard to not listen when they talk about these things, but I can’t help it. They always try to improve my street cred, introducing me to new grime artists and when they give me a compliment on my outfit I’m never sure whether it’s a good thing or a bad thing. It’s difficult to know whether the involvement you’ve had with a family has made a difference, because you never find out what happens to them. I often look back and think about the babies I have placed in adoption and wonder whether it was the right decision. Are they happy? I’m sure we make a lot of mistakes, but you never know what the future holds, so we’re just hoping that what we’re doing is making a difference in ways that we will never know. Often there are some real hard nuts to crack, but we never give up on kids. I often get exasperated with some of the younger teenagers when I think they have huge potential. That’s often when I’m most honest with them. I say: “I believe in you so much, why are you doing this to yourself? Why are you purposefully messing up your life?” I also get hugely frustrated with the parents, because I wonder what on earth they are doing. A big part of the job is discussing parenting with parents. But what I’ve noticed is that, regardless of background, in some ways every family is the same – children are the most important part of parents’ lives and kindness prevails. The lecturer: ‘None of us wants to fail a student’ In this field you’re perceived to be an expert, but there’s no such thing. If you’re a day ahead of the students you’re the expert – and you’d be surprised how many lecturers feel like that. When I started I could be a bit rude. I wouldn’t let students get away with talking or taking the piss. I would just stop the lecture and tell them to “Shut the fuck up” and everyone would go completely silent. You couldn’t do that now, you’d probably get reported. The worst thing is cheating. We have to kick out third year students who have been caught after all their hard work. Students come to you begging and crying and it’s soul destroying and you feel for them, but there’s nothing you can do. There are only two answers – cheat better or do the work. No matter how annoying the student is, I cannot envisage any member of staff, even the complete wankers, ever wanting to fail anyone. It’s a reflection on themselves. I often have parents call me up and I refuse to talk to them – their kids are adults. Intelligence has nothing to do with life, it’s about application. If you see someone trying to do well but failing, you do try to help. If you see a student who is a complete smart arse and puts zero effort in, you don’t give them any help. You don’t give a shit about the ones who think they are super clever, because in life there’s no such thing as super clever – it’s only in that person’s mind. The volunteer boxing teacher: ‘It gives young people hope’ Boxing tends to attract a lot of angry young boys, misfit kids. The club gives them a structure that they haven’t got at home and they feel quite cool doing it. People in the sport who do well are people they don’t mind admitting they like. Look at Anthony Joshua or Muhammad Ali – they look like comic-book heroes. A lot of young people who come to the club are from housing estates in the surrounding areas where there’s knife crime, drug-related activities and things that can steer you in a dark direction. A boxing club, relatively speaking, is a pretty safe place to be. The worst you’re going to get is a bloody nose. If you’re hanging around a housing estate at 2am you’re probably going to encounter far more severe things. The motivation for me is that it’s giving a lot of young people hope. We do simple qualifications with them in nutrition, health and safety, time keeping. They are general life lessons in how to conduct yourself – basic stuff that they may switch on to in a different environment. The hardest part is when you can see that a kid has a lot to offer, but you can also see them thinking that they’re not very good. We want to give them a sense of their own self-worth. A lot of them think they have to get results quickly and that probably comes from status anxiety. It’s a mixed club. We have Muslim kids, white working-class kids, Afro-Caribbean kids. We have a lot of Bangladeshi Muslim boys in our gym and without slipping into cliché they are really hard-working. They will do a part-time job, boxing three times a week, four A-levels and seemingly balance that pretty well. Then we have some white working-class lads who are not doing very well at school, who are more angry – an anger that they should be getting more than they’re getting. A lot of the foreign kids feel more grateful for the opportunity. You get a sense that they’re more respectful of education and have to work bloody hard to give themselves a chance. We’ve had to step in recently with social media stuff that they get into. One of our 15-year-olds started posting right-wing anti-Muslim propaganda on his Facebook page. I don’t think the boy actually knew what he was doing – he didn’t know anything about Britain First. But it’s insidious how they hook these kids up with this stuff. We’ve had to step in a couple of times with racial stuff. There are not many sporting clubs where you would get a lot of Muslim kids mixing closely with the local white kids and the black kids, so this gives them all an opportunity to have a neutral ground. The author: ‘The key is not to talk down to them’ Being a kids’ author is a dream job. I feel like I’m cheating at life because I spend my days drawing and get paid for it. I spend half my year sitting in my shed in the garden drawing and writing and the other half at schools meeting kids. It started by reading books to my children at night and thinking: “I can do better than this.” I just sort of had a go. I had no idea how competitive it was writing children’s books – everybody says you can’t make a living from it unless you’re JK Rowling. But that’s turned out not to be true. I like being around kids. I think the key is not to talk down to them. When I see children in a school, I’m the fun part. They spend the rest of their day doing times tables, so I am a bit of light relief. If someone is being naughty then the teachers police them, so I’m never the bad guy. It’s a bit different when I do literary festivals. Parents take it as an opportunity to down tools and stand at the back chatting over a coffee. So I have to maintain order and that can be quite annoying. I can’t tell someone else’s kids off. In the main the children are really good. Once they see I can draw they respect me and want to be my friend. Sometimes one of the kids will break away from the line and hug my leg and tell me they love me. It’s very extreme emotions that they display, which is funny – they’re just these pure little souls. Sometimes, however, the kids will stand up and announce that they’re bored – they don’t sugar coat it. They have no filter and don’t care what you think of them. Once, when I was at a school to do a reading, I was standing at the front during assembly with about 300 kids in the hall, and was introduced by the headteacher. Nobody, apart from me, was looking out at the children. Then one kid at the back started giving me the finger and mouthing “Fuck off!” He was about seven. It was at the beginning of my reading and I got completely tongue tied. I didn’t know what to do, but I didn’t want to grass him up. Then, at the end, when the kids were asking questions, his hand went up, so I thought: “Come on then, what are you going to say?” But he asked a perfectly normal question, so he’d obviously become engaged at some point. It’s funny when that sort of thing happens but it really threw me at the time. I just remember thinking it was a very clever way to be naughty, because no one could see but me. That said, towards the end, I did see him getting yanked off to the side by one of the teachers. The primary school teacher: ‘I have to be a carer and social worker’ My first job was in a big primary state school in west London. Nothing had prepared me for the roles I was expected to fill: teacher, social worker, carer and support network. A lot of my pupils were latchkey kids, their parents working day and night. One little boy didn’t even get a key, so had to climb through a window to get into his house after school. They craved adult attention because they literally didn’t see their parents. A lot of the kids would get terribly attached to the teachers. Others had issues because their parents were addicted to drugs – some kids had been born addicted to drugs. A lot of them needed a firm hand because they would be rude – nobody ever told them off and they didn’t have any work ethic. But it’s worth it because you see how much they appreciate attention and progress. A lot of children cry when they change years and have to say goodbye. I think the whole system in this country is so unfair. We don’t put enough money into schools. Teachers here are hugely undervalued. The real brains don’t even want to go into teaching, or can’t afford to. A lot of my colleagues have moved abroad for a better quality of life. Some have gone to Germany, Spain, Singapore and international schools, because the wages are fairer. The ideal system would be for kids go to their local school and get a good education. Sadly it doesn’t work out that way."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"us-news/2017/dec/20/the-donald-trump-quiz-of-2017","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-20T12:21:16Z","webTitle":"The Donald Trump quiz of 2017","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/dec/20/the-donald-trump-quiz-of-2017","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/dec/20/the-donald-trump-quiz-of-2017","fields":{"headline":"The Donald Trump quiz of 2017","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/dec/29/worst-of-2017-harvey-weinstein-unicorn-lattes","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-29T09:00:25Z","webTitle":"17 things I won't miss about 2017","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/29/worst-of-2017-harvey-weinstein-unicorn-lattes","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/29/worst-of-2017-harvey-weinstein-unicorn-lattes","fields":{"headline":"17 things I won't miss about 2017","bodyText":"It was a popular opinion that 2016 was an awful year in terms of geopolitics, celebrity deaths, and the planet being ravaged by greed, online idiocy and so on.

Weinstein was sacked from the company he co-founded, and stripped of his Academy membership, but those guilty of poor behaviour have a way of creeping back into the public sphere, often without proper repentance. Louis CK And can I just revel specifically in another predatory male’s downfall, a man who – in addition to repeatedly masturbating in front of women – was NEVER FUNNY and yet somehow won all the plaudits and was revered by comedians the world over. HE WAS NEVER FUNNY. I am fine with dark jokes about uncomfortable topics, but CK was clearly a douche from the beginning. To wit, the clip in which he bullies an audience member (possibly a set-up, not that it matters) and says: “Can you just die of Aids?” Fidget spinners May they spin off into the distance and never return – just like hoverboards in 2016. The only vaguely interesting thing about fidget spinners was the rather tragic story of the woman who invented them years ago but couldn’t afford to renew the patent, earning zero money for her creation. The ‘first stage’ of Brexit talks These talks dragged on so long that I managed to move house and acquire a dog in the meantime. Finally, as of Theresa May’s last-minute dash to Brussels, like a student sliding in with their homework at the last second, the first stage talks are “finished”. Except they are not really finished at all because literally nothing was sorted out. #NuggsForCarter This was the hashtag started by teenager Carter Wilkerson, whose tweet requesting free chicken nuggets from the US fast food chain Wendy’s didn’t just go viral, it became the most retweeted tweet of 2017 in the UK and (and got endless free publicity for Wendy’s). The awfulness of people actually buying merchandise based on this tweet was offset by the fact Wilkerson classily donated some of the profits to charity. Millennial pink I actually like the shade known as “millennial pink” – but why ruin it with this description? While we’re at it, could the entire world stop blaming millennials for everything that isn’t our fault? And is actually the previous-but-one generation’s fault. (It is though.) iOS 11’s first iteration iPhones crashed, slowed to the pace of kerb crawlers, automatically turned on Bluetooth (is this 2005?), and typing “I” resulted in an odd square and a question mark. I cannot think of a worse first release of an operating system, mobile or otherwise, than iOS 11. Plus all I want for Christmas is for the night shift mode to move back to the accessible menu, thank you. Trivago woman Part of me thinks this advert was so banal it was a stroke of social media genius, as the woman on the Trivago billboards became a viral topic by virtue of being everywhere but at the same time having zero presence. Trivago woman followed you around like a gallery attendant, creeping up just as you’re about to break the no photos rule. Trivago even capitalised on her popularity by publishing a fact sheet on the actress. I might actually miss her ubiquity and button-down Oxford shirt – she has been haunting us, it turns out, since 2015, but it feels like she’s been there for all of time. Atrocity The Rohingya population being raped, murdered and driven out of Myanmar. Assad continuing to bomb and torture Syrian civilians. Yemen torn to bits by civil war and a Saudi intervention while its children starve to death. It would be really great if 2018 saw less slaughter. Everyone tweeting “let that sink in” We get it. The world has turned to trash – it has already sunk in. Just look at the entry before this one. And the EU referendum result. And Donald Trump – DONALD TRUMP – being inaugurated as president of the United States. Props to the person who dreamed up this image, though. Steve Bannon Steve Bannon looks like a sweet that has been in your back pocket and sat on three thousand times, and is now just whiskery mush. This would be fine, if what came out of his mouth wasn’t just as grim. Blessedly, since Bannon left the White House in August we’ve heard less from him. But he’s back at Breitbart, still stoking the culture wars. Mother! The film-maker Darren Aronofsky’s biblical parable was excruciating. Two-thirds of the way in and mother! made me wish I had never been born. One review read: “This delusional freak show is two hours of pretentious twaddle … I hesitate to label it the ‘worst movie of the year’ when ‘worst movie of the century’ fits it even better.” After it was booed at the Venice film festival, Paramount even came out to publicly defend the film following awful audience ratings. My good colleague Peter Bradshaw enjoyed it, however, which is something I will be taking up with him. Marriage inequality in Australia I did sort of think this postal referendum was a waste of time and money, since it was non-binding, but it was super cheering that 62% of Aussies supported same-sex marriage, and this has paved the way for the historic bill that has now passed and will amend the Marriage Act. It also gave us this remarkable television interview with politician Bob Katter: ‘Unicorn’ lattes Look, if I had to list all the absurd food trends of 2017 I’d be here for longer than Mother! lasted, which was something approaching 9,000 hours. But a mention must go to “unicorn” coffees and bagels – exactly the same as their non-unicorn counterparts, but multicoloured. Thanks to unicorn food products I not only considered deleting my Instagram, but also purging several people from my life. A return to normal food in 2018, please. Confederate flags At a far-right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, an anti-Nazi protester was killed after being run down. If these hideous far-right rallies have achieved anything, it’s fresh impetus in the push for the removal of Confederate flags and monuments, after South Carolina removed its capitol building flag back in 2015. Many others have followed suit in 2017, including the Six Flags theme parks. All remaining Confederate flags should follow in 2018. Gypsy If Gypsy passed you by, then all I can say is, congratulations. Netflix has made a name for itself with its original programming, including Orange Is the New Black, but Gypsy was so bad, despite a quality duo in lead Naomi Watts and director Sam Taylor-Johnson. The premise was a lesbian-curious therapist who became obsessed with the girlfriend of one of her clients, except that their sexual chemistry had the frisson of a sexual health clinic waiting room. Gypsy was duly cancelled. (I recommend Mindhunter instead). Robert Mugabe BYE M8. It’s been fun despotic.

Your diary clears, your retinue of staff vaporises. Suddenly, no one is listening any more. Ego, hubris, whatever you call it, as we rise to positions of power, we too often come to “believe our own hype”. The inevitable fall can be bruising. This is especially true if you are an MP. Until June this year, Neil Carmichael was Conservative MP for Stroud and chair of the education select committee. Losing his seat after the surprise election called by Theresa May in April “came as a shock”. “It’s brutal,” says Carmichael, 56. Within a week, he had to clear his office and fire his staff. “I am still at sea,” he admits as we sit in a corridor of the government offices at Portcullis House, Westminster. To get in here, Carmichael had to pull out his new card with “Ex-MP” emblazoned across it. It got us through security, but while we talk, Carmichael is greeted by a succession of serving MPs who peer compassionately from the other side of the fence. Justine Greening makes noises about having a drink; Meg Hillier sympathises about the lack of support for those spat out of power. First on Carmichael’s to-do list is finding a new job and keeping his family fed. “I also want to make sure that what I stand for doesn’t get forgotten.” He feels immensely frustrated that he can’t complete his “unfinished business” at the education select committee, such as improving academies and monitoring the impact of Brexit, about which he, as a remainer, worries. He rattles off a list of his achievements. His influence has vanished, but his drive remains. He intends to stand again. Carmichael has a farm and woodland in Northumberland. But for the time being he drives his red tractor across his moderately sized garden in Stroud; it otherwise sits underemployed, rather like its owner. Carmichael suddenly has no particular place to go. “I found myself getting up at the same time as I used to without necessarily needing to,” he says. “I’ve found it emotionally quite testing. I’ve learned a little bit about myself, because I discovered that perhaps I overlooked a lot of things I shouldn’t have overlooked – such as my relationship with others outside politics.” He twists in his chair, looking mournful. “You lose sight of what’s actually important to you in your own personal life, and that’s what I did.” A “personal relationship” has taken the toll, he says, declining to specify further. It’s clear that Carmichael has suffered more than one loss in the election. Thankfully his three children were “an incredible support when I lost, and I was really quite moved by that”. Much as we are defined by what we do, it’s how we define ourselves that matters, and that takes some realignment. “I lost the election,” a chastened Carmichael says, “so I have to think about my own person, my own role and a different purpose.” “There’s nothing as ex as an ex-MP,” says a woman at the Association of Former Members of Parliament. But listening to Carmichael, the hardest lesson may not be dealing with the ignobility conferred by your newfound lack of status, the really tough bit is dealing with your newfound sense of self. If you hadn’t already realised it, you soon discover just how much your work and your identity are entwined. Estelle Morris is one who knows. She resigned from her post as secretary of state for education in 2002. Although this was her decision, it was still painful. She felt shut out of the club; her once packed diary was now empty. “It was like a bereavement,” she says. “It was in stages. To begin with, you’re in shock. It diminishes your feeling of self and you just have to get on with it.” When she resigned as a cabinet minister, Morris said with remarkable honesty: “I just do not think I’m as good at it as I was at my other job.” She wishes now that she had remained minister of state for schools, where she had less power but was able to get the real work done. More power meant less control. “There’s your relationship with the education system and managing that – what I call the real job – then there’s the other job, managing the politics of it; Whitehall, Downing Street and the political media.” It was the “other job” that Morris hated, along with unwanted press intrusion. “I had a choice. You don’t have to live with it.” So she left. “What you don’t realise is that you’ve got to pick up your sense of self afterwards, and that’s a really big issue. Eventually, after many years, you get to a sense of equilibrium.” Now, Morris sometimes feels she should have stuck it out, for the sake of the teachers. “I should have been able in my mind to shrink it down to the importance it was, and I found that quite difficult to do. That was sapping my confidence. But what I say is that if I could do the job again, I’d do it differently and survive.” Adapting to life outside politics was surprisingly hard, Morris says. “I’ll tell you a silly thing: it was a long time before I walked in front of the Department of Education. Instead, I’d do circuitous routes. I had not come to terms with leaving, and I think that’s going back to your ego bit – this is the building I used to go in and do things. Now I walk past and would have to go through security.” Work is her life, she says, and she still loves politics. She was brought up in a working-class political household; her father was also an MP. She is close to her sister and two nieces, but otherwise lives alone (something the press wouldn’t let go of all those years ago). “I’m not bad alone. I’m only all right because I’m very busy.” Now 65, she works with educational projects, charities and sits in the House of Lords as Baroness Morris of Yardley. “I love that, a day where you’ve moved quickly and there’s that sense of momentum.” But she still recalls the “fripperies” that accompanied her cabinet position: never pushing a button in a lift; two-minute, between-floors conversations; or meetings scheduled for car journeys. “There is a danger that people can think, ‘This is all about me.’ The machine makes you feel different.” *** As Morris did all those years ago, John Fotheringham, 60, has spent the last two years trying to find out who he is when he’s no longer in a position of power. As a senior partner at Deloitte, he managed the big accounts, HMRC and DWP. This meant he was away working for most of the week, meeting his wife and family at weekends or during holidays. “My balance has definitely shifted,” he says. “I was what I did five days a week.” His wife, he says wryly, is “much more interested in me when I’m not at home”. Fotheringham was the traditional breadwinner. In this respect, he overachieved. “We were incredibly well paid,” he says over a beer in a smart pub near his bridge club. Six figures? “Seven.” I pause to sip my orange juice. “You’re encouraged not to be particularly visible, but you make a lot of money and you have a lot of influence over a lot of things. You’re frequently paid massively more than the clients you’re advising.” Fotheringham appears affable, but admits having a senior position can make a person hardnosed. “You become much more spiky and ruthless about what you do with your time.” Partners at Deloitte are required to retire by 62; Fotheringham bowed out at 58. He hadn’t prepared for life after. He had no interests and far too much time. While at work, he felt valued and competent; at home, he feels adrift in his wife’s world, left discussing the minutiae of domestic life. Previously, “We’d only talk about things that were A or B priority, whereas now you get stuck into things like the garden, the shopping and the rest of it.” Fotheringham is not a C-priority man. “I feel like this new kid on the block in this domestic environment. Feeling like an incompetent at home – it’s a strange shift. The only place where I’m vaguely competent is in the garden. When I was at home [before retirement], it was the king returning before he went away again. It’s very levelling – ie diminishing.” During the first year of retirement, he threw himself into finding his father a suitable care home and establishing him there. He describes this as a “project”, and when his father died, Fotheringham says, “suddenly I felt I’d fallen off this cliff. That was when I felt the most unsettling/depressing.” The depression deepened, as did his drinking. “I didn’t feel I was achieving anything constructive. I was used to a set of things where you felt you’d done a lot and helped a lot of people, and when you took that away, you just felt like you weren’t someone, worthless.” He enrolled for a contemporary art appreciation course at City Lit, and is keen to channel his considerable energies (“50% spare capacity”) into a new project. One such project is his relationship with his wife. Reflecting on what went wrong when he retired, he counsels younger people not to become obsessed with work and to develop constructive hobbies; in short, spread their identity across a larger field. He used to write poetry on the train to work, he says. “You could lose yourself completely, and at the end of it, you had a relatively good, short poem.” So why not write now? “You need a bit of angst to write poetry, and at that time I did.” *** Not everyone flounders when their power ebbs away. Nicholas Phillips, 79, steadily worked his way up the legal ladder, never applying for positions, always accepting invitations, eventually becoming lord chief justice and, finally, the inaugural president of the supreme court. No further ascendancy was possible. The next step became retirement, although the word doesn’t quite cover it; he still holds a variety of legal offices, which means he travels a lot. Maybe this, and his love of Dorset, where he spends much of his time, accounts for his healthy glow. He does not seem to be striving for anything more. He sits, tanned and composed, in his beautiful north London home, clearly astonished at the opportunities he has had: “In a way, it’s quite hard to believe I have held these offices, having never really set out ambitiously to achieve them. Now that I’ve done all these things, I’m back, an ordinary person.” How does that feel? “A great relief. One of the things about my life in the law is that you can’t talk about your work. You have to be extremely careful in expressing opinions.” I discover that he swims every day, outside, throughout the year, and hear later that he marched the photographer five miles over steep cliffs to reach a secluded cove for a bracing dip before retiring to the pub in the Dorset village from which he takes his title, Lord Phillips of Worth Matravers. Seeing him so relaxed in his sitting room, I try, with some difficulty, to picture him at the supreme court presiding over the most intractable cases. He was tested to his limits when he was nominated to conduct the BSE inquiry, and individuals’ entire futures and livelihoods rested on his interpretation of events. “I found I couldn’t sleep and was waking early. I tried hypnosis, but it didn’t work. I can understand people who break down under stress, because I reckon I came quite close to it.” Phillips cites his best skill as “dispassionate analysis, which is what being a judge or a lawyer is all about. That is a good thing and a bad thing: sometimes people get annoyed with you, because you aren’t expressing passion; you’re coldly analysing a situation they feel passionate about.” He chooses his words carefully. “Sometimes, my family would prefer me to get a little bit more passionate. I’m still quite a reserved person.” He is one of those rare people who really seem unaltered by their position. “I think I’ve got fairly broad shoulders,” he says, “I’ve been happy in my skin. I think that’s just personality.” Choosing to leave a high-powered job earlier in your career is quite a different matter, however. Farhana Safa, 35, was an eye surgeon, trained at Moorfields and on her way to the top, a practising registrar not long to become a consultant. Her path was defined, her status secure, her parents delighted. They had arrived as immigrants from Bangladesh and struggled, taking any job and living on council estates while they started a family. It was to much disbelief that Safa announced she was going to quit her job, and for what? She didn’t even know. “I felt like an idiot,” she says. When people asked why she was leaving, all she could say was, “I feel like I could be very good at something else. I just don’t know what.” She knew only that it had to be more creative. Her decision was “excruciatingly difficult on all sorts of levels: giving up the stability of your job, giving up your income, being able to say that’s what you do. I felt like I was changing my name, because your job really becomes a part of you. I felt like I was a failure to admit I wanted to leave. I felt absolutely lost, like I was a nobody.” Safa signed herself up for a different course every day of the week: singing, shoe design, creative writing, photography, piano, samurai swordsmanship. After six months of liberation, she panicked and decided to think logically: what did she love? Cars. “I thought, ‘That’s it! That’s what I’m going to do!’” With no design background, she worked harder than she’d ever worked, drawing day and night, to secure a place on an MA at the Royal College of Art in vehicle design. “Being an underdog is quite nice, because nobody expects anything of you.” Meanwhile, she enrolled with casting agencies and won a part as a nurse in Doctor Strange, teaching Benedict Cumberbatch how to fake surgery. Gradually, she forged a new identity, landing an internship and then a job with Land Rover, where she is now employed as a car designer. It’s a world where, as an Asian woman, she stands out. “There are very few women in positions of authority and influence in this industry, so that’s where I’d like to work myself up to.” Status still matters to Safa, but she feels this time she’s on the right ladder. This doesn’t mean she can relax, though. “I am anxious every single day. Because I feel like, can I prove myself, am I good enough?” We sit in her minimalist London flat, a futuristic model of a car at its centre – her degree show piece. Safa managed to convince a car firm to spend time and money on moulding liquid metal to her design. She has performed alchemy in many ways, not least on herself. A while ago, she bumped into an old colleague. “I almost felt like I didn’t recognise myself. I was trying to think of who he thought I was. I have changed so much in these last couple of years.” Leaving a top position necessitates change, in both identity and lifestyle. For most of her life, Gill Sewell, 57, had been the family breadwinner. She and her husband, Simon Risley, had three daughters – now 18, 21 and 22 – and Simon worked full time, largely from home, before going part time and eventually retiring. The family dynamic changed sharply when Sewell took voluntary redundancy from her job as assistant director of children’s services at Hammersmith &amp; Fulham council in July 2012. “It was a drastic change in the way I lived,” she says. “I buy much more secondhand and things like that, but all the things that have changed have felt like more enriching changes, where my life feels more grounded, more real. I’m feeding my ego less.” Until then, she had a six-figure salary, a staff of up to 700 and a budget of £25m. “I was a bit of a terrier. I was driven and worked long hours. That was the sort of Gill I was.” But she became disheartened with budget cuts and increasingly felt she couldn’t “make a difference”. The services she’d started 10 years earlier she now had to close; the people she’d employed, she had to make redundant. Power in and of itself is neither good nor bad, she says; it’s how you use it. She does admit, though, that she got a bit too used to people saying yes to her because of her position. “That’s never healthy for anyone. I had to learn to change my behaviours.” Sewell became a Quaker at the age of 23, and that has served as a great leveller. In the Quaker church, voluntary roles are rotated. “There isn’t an elevation,” Sewell says: everyone is equal. Coming from local government, she had to make a conscious effort to sit and listen in meetings, rather than “push an agenda”. Shortly after she left her job, Sewell was diagnosed with ovarian cancer. She took a year off, forced to lie on the sofa at home. “I’d been a pivot, I earned all the money, I paid all the bills, and that shifted. I then became an at-home mother, albeit on the sofa feeling sick. I’ve had to learn to be a different Gill, even in the home context.” She recovered and took on a full-time job with the Quakers only to discover, less than two months in, that she had breast cancer. “That was when I learned to live more comfortably with the softer side of myself, to live with the vulnerability, with that identity of being a patient.” She was astounded by the kindness and generosity shown to her when she was unwell. “Some of them were people I made redundant. I went out and had tea with them during my recovery.” She is back working for the Quakers now. Her cancer is in remission. “I’ve looked death in the face several times and I’m just going to ignore it now. I’ve realised that the best way of changing anything is by changing myself.” There are, Sewell now believes, more enduring ways to gauge personal success than by status. “I think I’ve started big and got small.” • Commenting on this piece?

Barely a week goes by when the New York City FC head coach is not linked with a vacancy either in Europe or the United States. Even before Bruce Arena resigned after failing to lead USA to next summer’s World Cup finals, Vieira was touted as a possible replacement, leading the Frenchman to issue to a quick and firm denial regarding his interest in the position. This came soon after Vieira revealed he had tentative talks with Ligue 1 side St Etienne in the summer. The rumours and speculation will only increase if Vieira leads NYC FC to the MLS Cup this year, in just his second season as a professional head coach. On Tuesday evening Vieira’s men take on the Columbus Crew in the first match of the two-legged MLS Eastern Conference semi-finals. Vieira, though, deals with the endless barrage of questions about his future with grace. “I am happy here,” he says, almost like a mantra. “It is flattering ... to be linked with different clubs around Europe but it is just journalist talk,” Vieira told the Guardian. “I am doing what I love and am where I want to be. It was just speculation [regarding the USA job] and the best way to kill speculation is to be true and to be honest straight away and people will not talk about it anymore.” When Vieira arrived in New York after a spell as Manchester City’s reserve team and Elite Development squad manager, it was widely assumed that the 41-year-old had been given a golden opportunity by City Football Group to further his coaching career and, if he proved himself in the US, would return to the Etihad to replace Pep Guardiola. Managing City is “the fairytale story,” Vieira even said last year. Vieira, though, seems happily settled in New York with his wife and daughter and intends to see out his contract at NYC FC, which has one more year left to run. He could even stay in MLS beyond 2018. “Why not?” he says with a smile. “I don’t have any reason why not.” For now the former Arsenal, Internazionale and France midfielder is looking to do what the New York Yankees could not this year – bring a major trophy to Yankee Stadium. Due to the Yankees’ extended play-off run, NYC FC were forced out of Yankee Stadium in their final game of the regular MLS season (to, of all places, Citi Field, the home of the New York Mets). It was the second occasion in a short space of time this happened to NYC FC due to the demands of the Yankees. With the Bronx Bombers having fallen just short in their attempts to reach the World Series, the schedule is clear for NYC FC’s MLS play-off run but further stadium clashes likely await next season (and, indeed, every year until they find their own facility). Vieira is philosophical about the issue. “It is challenging – there is no doubt about it. But we knew what to expect. It is not a surprise for us,” he adds. “What is important to us is to find the best facilities that we can have to find the feeling that we are playing at home. It can happen again next year but it is something that we knew we would face as Yankees are a massive franchise and are expected to do well. We will just have to deal with it.” The manner in which Vieira has dealt with this huge inconvenience demonstrates the extent to which he has not only acclimatized to the particulars of MLS but thrived too. After the franchise’s dismal inaugural season under Jason Kreis, Vieira has led NYC FC to the play-offs twice in two attempts. “I am a better coach, I believe, than when I arrived,” says Vieira, speaking at a NYC FC event launching the first 10 new mini-soccer pitches across the city. How exactly has he improved? “There are lots of different scenarios you are facing – you are reacting, anticipating, making different decisions and then you reflect on those – and you see if you made the right ones and that can be on or off the field.” Such is the high regard in which Vieira is held in the States, his views on how to revive US soccer following the humiliating failure to reach Russia 2018 are taken seriously. Some pundits have called for a complete overhaul of the system but Vieira urges caution in that regard. “[Failing to reach Russia 2018] is not a step back it is a short drama,” Vieira says. “When you look at what has happened in the past few years and how the game has developed in this country – they are producing players who are doing well in Europe... it is just a question of time. It will take time to produce players who can challenge for the World Cup. “When you have a game and you just need a point [as USA did against Trinidad and Tobago but lost 2-1] ... it can happen in our sport. I feel for the players - they will not be happy with the way they performed.” NYC FC go into the play-offs after ending the regular MLS season with just one win in seven matches; Toronto FC, meanwhile, are heavy favourites for MLS Cup glory. Should Vieira overcome the odds and secure a first major trophy for NYC FC, you can bet the rumour mill will go into overdrive."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"technology/2017/oct/29/why-we-need-a-21st-century-martin-luther-to-challenge-church-of-technology-95-theses","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-29T08:30:22Z","webTitle":"Why we need a 21st-century Martin Luther to challenge the church of tech","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/oct/29/why-we-need-a-21st-century-martin-luther-to-challenge-church-of-technology-95-theses","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2017/oct/29/why-we-need-a-21st-century-martin-luther-to-challenge-church-of-technology-95-theses","fields":{"headline":"Why we need a 21st-century Martin Luther to challenge the church of tech","bodyText":"A new power is loose in the world. It is nowhere and yet it’s everywhere. It knows everything about us – our movements, our thoughts, our desires, our fears, our secrets, who our friends are, our financial status, even how well we sleep at night. We tell it things that we would not whisper to another human being. It shapes our politics, stokes our appetites, loosens our tongues, heightens our moral panics, keeps us entertained (and therefore passive). We engage with it 150 times or more every day, and with every moment of contact we add to the unfathomable wealth of its priesthood. And we worship it because we are, somehow, mesmerised by it. In other words, we are all members of the Church of Technopoly, and what we worship is digital technology. Most of us are so happy in our obeisance to this new power that we spend an average of 50 minutes on our daily devotion to Facebook alone without a flicker of concern. It makes us feel modern, connected, empowered, sophisticated and informed. Suppose, though, you were one of a minority who was becoming assailed by doubt – stumbling towards the conclusion that what you once thought of as liberating might actually be malign and dangerous. But yet everywhere you look you see only happy-clappy believers. How would you go about convincing the world that it was in the grip of a power that was deeply hypocritical and corrupt? Especially when that power apparently offers salvation and self-realisation for those who worship at its sites? It would be a tough assignment. But take heart: there once was a man who had similar doubts about the dominant power of his time. His name was Martin Luther and 500 years ago on Tuesday he pinned a long screed on to the church door in Wittenberg, which was then a small and relatively obscure town in Saxony. The screed contained a list of 95 “theses” challenging the theology (and therefore the authority) of the then all-powerful Catholic church. This rebellious stunt by an obscure monk must have seemed at the time like a flea bite on an elephant. But it was the event that triggered a revolution in religious belief, undermined the authority of the Roman church, unleashed ferocious wars in Europe and shaped the world in which most of us (at least in the west) grew up. Some flea bite. In posting his theses Luther was conforming to an established tradition of scholastic discourse. A “thesis”, in this sense, is a succinctly expressed proposition put forward as the starting point for a discussion. What made Luther’s theses really provocative, though, was that they represented a refutation of both the theology and the business model of the Catholic church. In those days, challenging either would not have been a good career move for an Augustinian monk. Challenging both was suicidal. To understand the significance of this, some theological background helps. A central part of Catholic theology revolved around sin and the consequences thereof. Sins were divided into three grades – original, venial and mortal. The first was what you were born with (because the default setting for humans was “flawed”) and was absolved by baptism. The second category consisted of peccadillos. The third – mortal – were grievous sins. The church had established an elaborate machine for enabling its members to deal with their moral transgressions. They could confess them to a priest and receive absolution on condition that they did a prescribed penance. But for a medieval Catholic, the visceral fear was of dying with an unconfessed – and therefore unabsolved – mortal sin on your record. In that case, you went to hell for eternity, tortured by perennial fire and all the horrors imagined by Hieronymous Bosch. If you died with just unabsolved venial sins, however, then you did time in an intermediate prison called purgatory until you were eventually discharged and passed on to paradise. Being in purgatory was obviously better than roasting at gas mark six, and your place in heaven was ultimately guaranteed. But if you could minimise your time in the holding area then you would. Into this market opportunity stepped the Roman church with an ingenious product called an indulgence. This was like a voucher that gave you a reduction in your purgatorial stay. Initially, you could get an indulgence in return for an act of genuine penitence – following the confessional model – or for visiting a holy relic. But there came a moment (in 1476) when Pope Sixtus IV announced that indulgences could be purchased on behalf of another person – say a deceased relative who was assumed to be suffering in purgatory, and therefore lying beyond the reach of confession and absolution. In a continent of credulous and devout believers, this turned indulgences into a very big business. And, as with the US sub-prime mortgage market pre-2007, it got out of hand. By 1517, as Luther saw it, indulgences had become a racket in which a crass financial transaction substituted for the serious duty of real repentance. A couplet coined by a particularly enthusiastic indulgence-hawker captured this crudity nicely: As soon as a coin in the coffer rings, The soul from purgatory springs. The audacity of Luther’s 95 Theses on the Power and Efficacy of Indulgences came from the fact that in attacking the theology underpinning the doctrine of purgatory they were also undermining the business model built upon it. In two consecutive theses, 20 and 21, for example, Luther set about attacking the very essence of papal authority. “When he [the pope] uses the words plenary [ie total] remission of all penalties,” Luther wrote, “he does not actually mean ‘all penalties’, but only those imposed by himself.” Therefore, continues thesis 21, “those indulgence preachers are in error who say that a man is absolved from every penalty and saved by papal indulgences.” This might not look like much to a modern reader, unfamiliar with the intricacies of 16th-century Catholicism, but it was the equivalent of calling the pope a liar. And in the Europe of 1517, that was fighting talk. People had been burned at the stake for less. In the ordinary course of events, the church would have squashed such a turbulent friar as one would a mosquito. All it would have required was a letter to his religious superior, followed by a kangaroo court in Rome, and that would be that. But it didn’t happen. Instead, Luther escaped death, survived excommunication and went on to light the fire that consumed Christendom. How come? Historians cite two main reasons. The first is that Luther was lucky in that Frederick the Wise – the local bigwig who was one of the seven electors of the Holy Roman Emperor – protected him and indeed saved his life (protection that was continued by Frederick’s heirs and successors). The second is the printing press, which is what enabled Luther to “go viral”, as modern parlance has it. Of course we’ve known for eons about the role of print in the Reformation. But it’s especially interesting to look back at the story in the light of what has happened to our own media ecosystem in the past few years. After all, we have lived through political earthquakes that were fuelled at least in part by new media, and we find ourselves contemplating what has happened with the same kind of “informed bewilderment” that must have afflicted Pope Leo X as he watched his pestilential priest become the most famous man in Germany. What happened, in a nutshell, is that Luther understood the significance and utility of the new communication technology better than his adversaries. In that sense, he reminds me of Donald Trump, who sussed how to use Twitter and exploit the 24-hour news cycle better than anyone else. But whereas Trump contributed nothing to the communications technology that he exploited, Luther did. His understanding of the new media ecosystem brought about by print has been expertly explored by the Reformation historian Andrew Pettegree in a brilliant book, Brand Luther: 1517, Printing, and the Making of the Reformation (Penguin, 2015). Unlike most scholars of his time, Luther was both interested in and knowledgable about the technology of printing; he knew the economics of the business, cared about the aesthetics and presentation of books and understood the importance of what we would now call building a brand. He knew, for example, that his message would only spread if he gave printers texts that would be economical to print and easy to sell – unlike conventional scholarly books in the early decades of printing. Because paper was expensive, printing a standard scholarly tome required capital resources for buying and storing the necessary reams of paper. And because there was no developed market for distributing and marketing the result, many printers went bankrupt – which is why most printing and publishing was concentrated in large towns with established universities where at least some of the necessary infrastructure existed. Although the original 95 theses were in Latin, as were most theological books of the period, Luther decided that he would write in German. In doing so he immediately expanded his potential market by orders of magnitude. He also developed a literary style that was, as Pettegree observes, “lucid, readable and to the point”. But his masterstroke was in enabling printers to make money by publishing his works. Because paper was expensive, he channelled his output into extended pamphlets that could be printed on one or two sheets of paper, suitably folded into eight or 16 pages at most. The strategy worked. Within five years of posting his theses he was Europe’s most published author. A printed sermon or a commentary by Luther was a surefire seller, and appealingly inexpensive to produce. The nascent printing industry was quick to respond: Wittenberg, which had a solitary shambolic printer when Luther began, was soon home to a handful of presses, including one run by Germany’s most accomplished publisher, Moritz Goltz. Luther, proactive to a fault, took care to spread his work among all of these new publishing houses and was, Pettegree observes, “sufficiently popular to put bread on the table of publishers throughout Germany”. By the time Luther died in 1546, nearly 30 years after posting the 95 theses, this small town in Saxony had a publishing output that matched that of Germany’s biggest cities. Luther was clearly a remarkable, complex individual – charismatic, divisive, inspiring, intense, gifted, musical, courageous, devout and lucky. He also had a very unattractive side – as seen most starkly in the misogyny and ferocious antisemitism with which his works are peppered. But I’ve always been fascinated by him, and as the 500th anniversary loomed and Trump rose to power on the back of our new media ecosystem, I fell to pondering whether there are lessons to be learned from the 95 theses and their astonishing aftermath. One thing above all stands out from those theses. It is that if one is going to challenge an established power, then one needs to attack it on two fronts – its ideology (which in Luther’s time was its theology), and its business model. And the challenge should be articulated in a format that is appropriate to its time. Which led me to think about an analogous strategy in understanding digital technology and addressing the problems posed by the tech corporations that are now running amok in our networked world. These are subjects that I’ve been thinking and writing about for decades – in two books, a weekly Observer column, innumerable seminars and lectures and a couple of academic research projects. Many years ago I wrote a history of the internet, motivated partly by annoyance at the ignorant condescension with which it was then viewed by the political and journalistic establishments of the time. “Don’t you think, dear boy,” said one grandee to me in the early 1990s, “that this internet thingy is just the citizens band [CB] radio de nos jours?” “You poor sap,” I remember thinking, “you have no idea what’s coming down the track.” Twenty-five years on, I now describe myself as a recovering utopian. When the internet first appeared I was dazzled by its empowering, enlightening, democratising potential. It’s difficult to imagine today the utopian visions that it conjured up in those of us who understood the technology and had access to it. We really thought that it would change the world, slipping the surly bonds of older power structures and bringing about a more open, democratic, networked future. We were right about one thing, though: it did change the world, but not in the ways we expected. The old power structures woke up, reasserted themselves and got the technology under control. A new generation of corporate giants emerged, and came to wield enormous power. We watched as millions – and later billions – of people happily surrendered their personal data and online trails to be monetised by these companies. We grimaced as the people whose creativity we thought would be liberated instead turned the network into billion-channel TV and morphed into a new generation of couch-potatoes. We saw governments that had initially been caught napping by the internet build the most comprehensive surveillance machine in human history. And we wondered why so few of our fellow citizens seemed to be alarmed by the implications of all this – why the world was apparently sleepwalking into a nightmare. Why can’t people see what’s happening? And what would it take to make them care about it? Why not, I thought, compose 95 theses about what has happened to our world, and post them not on a church door but on a website? Its URL is 95theses.co.uk and it will go live on 31 October, the morning of the anniversary. The format is simple: each thesis is a proposition about the tech world and the ecosystem it has spawned, followed by a brief discussion and recommendations for further reading. The website will be followed in due course by an ebook and – who knows? – perhaps eventually by a printed book. But at its heart is Luther’s great idea – that a thesis is the beginning, not the end, of an argument. John Naughton’s theses No 19: The technical is political This thesis challenges the contemporary assertion of the tech industry that it stands apart from the political system in which it exists and thrives. This delusion has deep roots – for example in the fact some of the dominant figures of the 1970s computer industry were influenced by 1960s “counterculture”, which was suspicious of, and hostile to, the US political and corporate system that had enmeshed the country in the Vietnam war. It found its wildest expression in John Perry Barlow’s 1996 Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace. The idea that the tech industry exists, somehow, “outside” of society was always misconceived, even when the industry was in its infancy. After all, it was built on the back of massive public investment in defence electronics, networking and research conducted in corporate laboratories such as Bell Labs or consultancies such as BBN. But in an era where it’s clear that Google and Facebook have, unintentionally or otherwise, been influencing democratic politics and elections, it is positively delusional. We have reached the point where almost every “technological” issue posed by the five giant tech companies is also a political problem requiring political and possibly legislative responses. The technical has become political. No 92: Facebook is many things, but a “community” it ain’t One of the favourite phrases of Mark Zuckerberg is “the Facebook community”. Facebook is many things, but a community it is not. It’s a social network, which is something quite different. In a social network (online or off), people are connected by pre-existing personal relationships. Communities, on the other hand, are complex social systems because they consist of people from different walks of life who may have no personal connections at all. A good example is the English village where I live. I am friends with some villagers, and know my neighbours pretty well. But there are many others in the village whom I don’t know and with whom I may have little in common. But there’s no doubt that they and I are all members of the same community. Online groups confirm the power of homophily – the tendency of individuals to associate and bond with others of similar ilk. Facebook provides a framework that contains innumerable homophilic groups. But it isn’t a community in any meaningful sense of the world."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"culture/2017/oct/27/andrew-hunter-murray-writer-actor-qi-elf","type":"article","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-27T13:00:30Z","webTitle":"Andrew Hunter Murray: ‘I have an extremely amusing floral shirt’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2017/oct/27/andrew-hunter-murray-writer-actor-qi-elf","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/2017/oct/27/andrew-hunter-murray-writer-actor-qi-elf","fields":{"headline":"Andrew Hunter Murray: ‘I have an extremely amusing floral shirt’","bodyText":"The funniest standup I’ve ever seen Stewart Lee – in his early days, before he went electric and started using a mic, the sellout.

The memorial and education centre will be built in Victoria Tower Gardens, a prime site beside the Houses of Parliament and the River Thames, despite objections from some local residents. The project, to which £50m of public money has been committed, is expected to be completed by 2021. The winner was announced at the Victoria and Albert Museum on Tuesday in the presence of many high-profile figures involved in the competition, including the communities secretary, Sajid Javid, the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, the former chancellor Ed Balls, Sir Peter Bazalgette from the UK Holocaust Memorial Foundation, the Design Council chief executive, Sarah Weir, and Ephraim Mirvis, the chief rabbi. Holocaust survivors were also present. The winning design was intended to be not something you look at but something you experience, said Ron Arad, an Israeli designer who is part of the winning consortium. Much of it is below ground, with 23 tall bronze “fins” emerging from the earth and drawing visitors down narrow stairs into the exhibition space and learning centre. “The message of this is so powerful; it is more than just a project,” said Adjaye, a Ghanaian-British architect whose credits include the National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington DC and the Tower Hamlets Idea Store. “The complexity of the Holocaust story, including the British context, is a series of layers that have become hidden by time. Our approach to the project has been to reveal these layers and not let them remain buried under history,” he said. “To do so we wanted to create a living place, not just a monument to something of the past. We wanted to orchestrate an experience that reminds of the fragility and constant strife for a more equitable world.” A shortlist of 10 finalists was whittled down from 92 entries submitted by architecture and design teams from 26 countries. The shortlisted teams included some of the world’s leading architects and firms, such as Daniel Libeskind, Zaha Hadid Architects and Norman Foster, as well as artists including the sculptor Anish Kapoor and the Turner prize winner Rachel Whiteread. The selection jury was unanimous in its choice of the team consisting of Adjaye Associates, Ron Arad architects and the landscape architects Gustafson Porter + Bowman as the winner. The learning centre will showcase the testimonies of 112 Holocaust survivors, recorded specially for the memorial. As well as the 6 million Jews killed in the Holocaust, the memorial will commemorate the persecution and deaths of Roma, gay and disabled people. But, Bazalgette, said “remembering is not enough. The new memorial is also about today and will look forward.” Hate crime, antisemitism and Islamophobia were rising and the internet and social media were used for the mutual confirmation of prejudices, he said. Holocaust denial was likely to increase in the next very digital decade, he added. Khan said: “For me it’s personal, as mayor of this great city, in which diversity is a strength not a weakness.” He added: “It breaks my heart that, here in the most progressive city in the world, children going to a Jewish school need protection.” Lili Pohlmann, 87, who was born in Poland and arrived in Britain in 1946, said she hoped the memorial would also commemorate the “righteous among nations”, those who helped Jews and other targets of the Nazis to escape. “They showed such humanity. They fought not with weapons but with their hearts. These people also need to be remembered and commemorated,” she said. The siting of the memorial next to parliament was of great significance, said Bazalgette. “The new memorial will be a national asset that asserts our civil values. It will stand in the shadow of parliament to remind us what happens when democracy and civil society is subverted.” Javid said the monument would be constructed “right in the heart of our democracy … Through this project, we stand up as a nation; we stand together, regardless of our religion, race or background; and we stand against ignorance and bigotry. “The new learning centre will not only remind us of mankind’s capacity for darkness through the story of the Holocaust and other genocides – crucially, it will also remind us of our incredible capacity for good.” The project became embroiled in controversy earlier this month when the Imperial War Museum (IWM) called for the learning centre plan to be reconsidered because it would compete with its own Holocaust galleries, opening in 2020, less than a mile away. The IWM, which has been the national museum for the Holocaust since 2000, said the learning centre was likely to replicate its own advanced plans for a £33.5m digitally enabled learning and events suite, and the public should be offered one facility, rather than competing educational resources. Bazalgette said the memorial foundation would meet the IWM in the next few days to discuss ways of complementing one another. “I’m confident we’ll work together,” he said. The Victoria Tower Gardens site also triggered objections from local residents, who said it was completely contrary to London’s ambition to protect its green spaces. A letter signed by dozens of MPs and peers, and sent to all members of the House of Lords earlier this year, said: “The gardens are extensively used by residents, visitors to London and the many thousands who work nearby, including those working in the Palace of Westminster. They are an oasis of calm, enjoyed as a place of exercise, play, picnics, sunbathing and dog walking.” The memorial would “change irrevocably” the character of the gardens, which would cease to be an amenity for ordinary people, it said. Residents also raised concerns about increased security in the area as a result of the memorial. The proposal will be subject to planning permission, including consultation with local residents. “Everybody’s voice will be heard. I’m confident that at the end of it everyone will be satisfied,” said Bazalgette."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/oct/24/austrias-far-right-freedom-party-invited-to-enter-coalition-talks-sebastian-kurz-ovp-fpo-europe","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-24T15:00:43Z","webTitle":"Austria's far-right Freedom party invited to enter coalition talks","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/24/austrias-far-right-freedom-party-invited-to-enter-coalition-talks-sebastian-kurz-ovp-fpo-europe","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/oct/24/austrias-far-right-freedom-party-invited-to-enter-coalition-talks-sebastian-kurz-ovp-fpo-europe","fields":{"headline":"Austria's far-right Freedom party invited to enter coalition talks","bodyText":"Austria’s conservative leader has invited the far-right Freedom Party for talks to form the country’s next coalition government, opening the door for the controversial party to return to power after more than a decade in opposition. Sebastian Kurz, whose Austrian People’s party (ÖVP) came top in elections on 15 October, said his party and the rightwing populists (FPÖ) were in favour of lowering taxes and shared “similar approaches” on the subject of immigration. The 31-year-old, who is poised to become Europe’s youngest leader, warned that a coalition with the far right was only an option as long as Austria’s “pro-European direction” was retrained, citing the country’s upcoming presidency of the Council of the EU in the second half of 2018. The coalition talks are expected to start on Wednesday. Founded by former members of the Nazi party after the second world war, the FPÖ has previously formed governments with both the centre-left Social Democratic party of Austria (SPÖ) and the centre-right ÖVP. The Freedom party came third in Austria’s national elections in spite of having lead in the polls for much of the year. Speaking to journalists in Vienna on Tuesday morning, Kurz praised the FPÖ leader, Heinz-Christian Strache, for his “strong creative will and desire to change Austria”. Strache later accepted the invitation to the coalition talks but warned that his delegation would “not make things easy for the ÖVP”. The FPÖ general secretary, Harald Vilimsky, emphasised that the FPÖ was not prepared to make a return to power conditional on giving up its membership of far-right Europe of Nations and Freedom (ENF) group in the European parliament. Kurz had repeatedly criticised the FPÖ in the run-up the elections for its links to Eurosceptic parties such as France’s Front National or Italy’s Northern League. Austria’s previous coalition government collapsed in May after months of deadlock over policy disputes between the SPÖ and ÖVP, which had jointly governed in a “grand coalition” for the last decade. “The goal is clear, to form a stable government with a solid majority in parliament,” Kurz said on Tuesday. “If that’s not possible, a minority government is definitely an alternative.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"fashion/2017/oct/24/bright-eyes-bold-coloured-eyeliner-is-not-just-for-summer","type":"article","sectionId":"fashion","sectionName":"Fashion","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-24T14:12:36Z","webTitle":"Bright eyes: bold coloured eyeliner is not just for summer","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2017/oct/24/bright-eyes-bold-coloured-eyeliner-is-not-just-for-summer","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/fashion/2017/oct/24/bright-eyes-bold-coloured-eyeliner-is-not-just-for-summer","fields":{"headline":"Bright eyes: bold coloured eyeliner is not just for summer","bodyText":"For many people, bright-coloured makeup – greens, yellows, blues and purples – only see the light of day in summer. It’s the burgundys, browns and creams that come out for winter. But bold eyeliner is the perfect way to add a pop of colour to your face without looking like you are stuck in another season. With yellow and red among this autumn and winter’s big colours, as seen in shops and on catwalks, I’ve been inspired to wear my yellow liner loud and proud. Here is how I get a simple, colourful look, focusing on making a statement with my eyes but at the same time keeping the rest of my makeup as neutral as possible. Step one I begin by applying makeup to my face – a primer and foundation followed by a loose powder to set everything in place. Then I apply foundation on top of my eyelids to cancel out any discoloration. The colourblend HD camera-ready foundation in the shade C10 (via Flawlessshades.com, £21.00) is ideal as it has a lovely rich and warm tone, which works to colour correct around my eye. Step two I set the foundation on my eyelids with a loose powder, which will help any the other products applied later to sit better. I do this with the Sacha Cosmetics buttercup banana powder (via Superdrug, £19.99) as it helps brighten eyelids and creates a great base. It is a light-textured powder that does not feel heavy on the eyes. There are different colours available for different skin tones – the banana powder is a perfect tone for deeper complexions. Step three To add a little bit of depth and definition before I apply my eyeliner, I like to blend a warm brown-toned eye shadow in the crease of my eye and on my lower lash line. I love the shade Filthy Rich by Buxom Cosmetics (via Debenhams, £8), as it is a perfect balance of brown and orange with an easily blendable texture. Step four Once my eye is prepped and ready, I begin applying eyeliner across my lash line in small strokes and try to keep a sharp wing at the end. The Nyx Cosmetics Vivid Brights liner range (via Boots, £5.50) is great – the thin brush makes the application process easier and the different range of shades complement every skin tone beautifully. I use the colour Halo – a brilliant bright yellow. Then I complete my look by applying mascara on both my top and bottom lashes to add definition. I use the Nip + Fab mascara (via Superdrug, £9.95), a jet black with a perfect brush and attractive price, to give both volume and length where needed.

At first I find the whole thing so awkward I have to suppress an embarrassed laugh. But as we make our wordless way through the dappled shade, I feel an atmosphere of calm and thoughtfulness envelop us like a protective cloak. The others in my group are undergraduate students, chaplains and other staff of Nottingham Trent University (NTU), all taking part in a mindfulness walk, intended to bring some space and quiet reflection into students’ hectic lives. Guided by the chaplains (who speak occasionally), we pause as a group to consider questions in the booklets we have been handed: “who am I?”, “where am I going in my life?” and “what brings me a sense of excitement?” Left to our silence, we note down our answers. Stopping by a rubbish bin, we ask, “What rubbish am I carrying with me in my life?” We tear off our answers and throw them in the bin. It sounds silly, but weeks later I still feel lighter for casting off that scribble on a scrap of paper. Back in the bustling City Campus of NTU, students and staff weave their way around each other, a mass of hoodies and headscarves, skullcaps and backwards caps, hipster beards and hi-tops. Posters advertise a programme of free yoga, craft classes and eating-disorder information sessions: my visit coincides with Wellbeing Week, designed to raise awareness of mental health and encourage students who need help to seek it. This is just one part of NTU’s strategy to meet a dramatic rise in the need for support. Last month, the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR) published a report revealing that nationally, the number of first-year students who disclose a mental health problem has risen fivefold in the past decade. A record number of students with mental health problems dropped out of university in 2015, the latest year for which figures are available. In the same year, 134 students killed themselves, the highest number on record. Similarly, the number of UK students seeking counselling has rocketed by 50% in the past five years, to more than 37,000, according to figures obtained by the Guardian. This trend is reflected at NTU: wellbeing services received 38% more referrals last year than in 2014/15. There are many reasons mental health problems may arise at university. It is a time of transition: people are no longer living in the family home, but not yet fully independent either. Added to this, some might experience the big fish – small pond effect, where teenagers who are used to being recognised for their achievements find themselves in a more competitive yet more anonymous environment. Difficulties that have been repressed throughout school can bubble up when students leave their support network behind. As Glenn Baptiste, a mental health adviser at NTU says, “Sometimes it might look like it’s a problem that’s occurred within university, but that’s not always the case. If students come here with ongoing issues that they’ve not discussed, the university environment can make life difficult.” Even students who have previously sought help may find the move to university makes access more complicated, as they move from adolescent to adult support services. According to a report by the Joint Commissioning Panel for Mental Health, a third of students who had access to child and adolescent mental health services (CAMHS) found their care was interrupted in the transition to university. Nearly a third more lost access to their support altogether. Student Services manager Alison Bromberg says the most common mental health problems reported by NTU students are anxiety and depression. Bromberg can see how the challenges young people face today play their part in this rise - the burden of student debt, economic uncertainty, global political upheaval, apocalyptic climate change - “but,” she says, “I also think that a lot of work has happened and is still happening to reduce the stigma around discussing mental health and emotional needs. I think it’s making it more possible for people to come forward and ask for that support.”, global political upheaval, economic uncertainty, student debt In a small office, Sam, a fourth-year student at NTU in her early 20s, sits twiddling a pen and jiggling her knee. She comes across as articulate but nervous, giggling occasionally after speaking. One day, she was in the kitchen of her shared student flat, chatting with her housemates, when out of the blue she felt as if she couldn’t breathe. The same thing happened again in a lecture, and again and again. Assuming it was linked to her existing health problems – migraines and a minor heart condition – Sam booked an appointment with her GP. It never crossed her mind that it might be psychological. “When he told me it was panic- and anxiety-related, it was a bit of a shock,” Sam says. At the same time, she noticed a problematic pattern in her studies: she would do well in the first term, but then stop going to lectures and end up failing her summer exams and having to resit them. This year, however, she has managed to break that cycle with the help of Baptiste, who has a background in community mental health, counselling and cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). An adviser rather than a therapist, Baptiste’s job is not so much to counsel Sam as to help her develop strategies to manage her mental health and studies. Sitting in on their session, I can see how his calm manner relaxes Sam as she listens to his practical advice. They work through her primary anxiety at the moment: an upcoming presentation. She fills in a worksheet that breaks down her fears into her core belief about the presentation (“I won’t be able to answer the questions”); her thoughts arising from that belief (“I will look stupid and get a bad grade”); the feelings provoked by those thoughts (“nervous, panicky”); and the physical reaction and behaviour that follow (“I’ll stutter and shake, and I’ll forget to breathe. Then I’ll want to leave”). At times, Sam tries to race ahead, to write a feeling in the box for thoughts, and Baptiste gently corrects her. Finally, he says, “We know these all feed into each other, so what do we need here in the core belief box? Something realistic and balanced: presentations are difficult for you, so accept that, but you know you have done them in the past. In the build-up, tell yourself this healthy core belief, and that will give you the ability to manage your thoughts, feelings and behaviour.” For Sam, this CBT-style approach clearly works. She smiles with quiet pride as Baptiste points out that, according to her self-assessment forms, her mental wellbeing has drastically improved over the last five months, from a rating of 20% to 48%. He tells her that such an increase is, “of huge significance, and that’s down to you. Historically, in the last three years, this is the period when you drop out. We’re rewriting history. Well, you are.” The session is very practical, positive and solution-focused; there is no suggestion of delving below the surface and into her past to explore where these problems might stem from. Some students I spoke to wanted therapy to explore these deeper questions and find the meaning behind their issues; but Sam tells me she is not interested in therapy that might ask these sorts of questions: “I’m just interested in finding ways to deal with it, seeing if I can try to resolve it, rather than looking at why it started.” Sam is one of more than 2,000 students who received help over the last academic year at NTU, an average of 80 a week; or more than 11 students every day. Student services manager Alison Bromberg says this is not just a problem for universities: “Whatever is happening in society will happen in university, so whatever you see here is reflected in the country.” The statistics back her up: in February, in a survey by the Association of Schools and College Leaders, 55% of schools reported an increase in stress and anxiety among their pupils. A 200,000-strong study found that young people in the UK have the poorest mental wellbeing in the world, with the exception of Japan. Rosie Tressler, CEO of student mental health charity Student Minds, tells me, “The 2016 Student Academic Experience Survey provided strong evidence that [undergraduates] have lower levels of wellbeing than the rest of the population, with roughly one-third reporting psychological distress, and we know that the median age of higher education students overlaps the peak age of onset for mental health difficulties.” In other words, evidence suggests many people with mental health disorders first experience symptoms between the ages of 18 and 25. *** In September 2016, the thinktank the Higher Education Policy Institute (Hepi) published a report stating that some universities needed to treble what they spend on mental health support, warning that the number of student suicides was on the rise. ONS figures show that in the last 10 years, the number of student deaths by suicide has risen by more than 50%. This is not fear-mongering; it is a deeply serious problem, says Ged Flynn, CEO of Papyrus, a charity for the prevention of young suicide: “We hear daily from young people having suicidal thoughts and from those who are concerned about them. University life can add to the pressures that young people already experience these days.” When I asked students around the country about their experiences of mental health, they talked about stressful deadlines, difficulties forming new relationships, balancing a job with studies, financial worries and social pressures. They also painted a picture of patchy provision: while some received prompt and effective help, others described underfunded services, excruciatingly long waiting times and dismissive attitudes. One student talked about desperately trying to get a counselling appointment when booking opened at 9am, only to find that all the slots had gone when she got through at 9.03am. A final-year student at another university wrote that she is experiencing increasing anxiety and can’t get help: “A good counsellor I saw in my first year has left, and they are not recruiting any more, so there are lots of students chasing very few appointments. They refer you on or offer leaflets. It seems very inadequate.” Alex, 21, was a student at a Midlands university when she was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, anxiety and severe depression. She says services are able to deal only with the most seriously distressed students: “Because of the strain on the service, if you weren’t suicidal at the current time, you weren’t helped. You had to be five minutes from death or you had to wait weeks. You had to be at your worst.” The counselling she was eventually offered was helpful, but she felt the eight-week wait was too long and the six weeks it lasted too short. For long-term therapy on the NHS, she was told she needed to wait a year, by which time she would have graduated and moved home. “So it’s kind of pointless,” she says. For others, such as George Watkins, 21, who is at Cardiff and has had anxiety and depression for eight years, the experience has been more positive: “It is since coming to university that I have made the most progress. I came off the crippling medication, came through suicidal patches and have now come more or less out the other side.” After having a breakdown around the time of his GCSEs, Watkins didn’t leave his house for six months, and then didn’t leave his small town in Dorset for three years. “Going to university was the best thing that could ever have happened, but probably the hardest thing I will ever do, mentally,” he says. “All of a sudden, I didn’t have my support, I was surrounded by people, it was very intense. There is a massive prevalence of drink and drugs, and it’s hard not to feel a bit of an outcast if you don’t take part in all that.” Watkins benefited from a supportive mental health service, but says it is bursting at the seams. “The team here does a fantastic job, but there is not enough funding to meet the demand.” He points out that, if one in four people has a mental health problem, as a recent YouGov survey found, that equates to 7,500 of Cardiff’s 30,000 students: “That is far more than our services here could handle.” He has now been elected as the university’s mental health officer, and is campaigning for more funding. “I’m not going to kid myself that we’re going to have some kind of utopia. What I’d like to see is a good level of support that’s accessible to everyone. That’s the best we can do.” *** The 2016 Hepi report notes that in some institutions the funding for counselling services is less than £200,000. (The average pay for university vice-chancellors now exceeds £275,000.) However, it also notes that several institutions, including Imperial College London, the University of Leeds and Brunel are trialling new methods for dealing with the ever-growing need for better support. NTU’s work to develop specialist training is also mentioned. Over the last two years, Alison Bromberg and her team have implemented a new system designed to make it easier for students to access help, starting with a single port of call for all inquiries. Crucially, it’s not just students who can get in touch: friends, family or staff members can alert support services if they think a student may need help. This change in policy was because “young people in transition don’t always find it easy to come forward”, explains Bromberg. A student, or someone concerned about a student, fills in a simple form on the wellbeing website. They then receive a call or email within two days and, where appropriate, then arrange a face-to-face meeting. For some students, that might mean accessing an online system that offers self-help modules on managing issues such as depression, anxiety and body image (this system is also used by the NHS). Students may also have the opportunity to work with an adviser such as Baptiste, receive counselling (usually up to six sessions) or work with a support officer who can liaise with academic staff. “It is distinct from a more therapeutic approach that some students get solely from counselling,” says Bromberg. “But we’re quite clear that they are distinctive offers.” NTU has invested in three new members of staff on its wellbeing team, including adviser Rachael Sisson. I sit with her in a small room where large windows let in the sunshine. She works through the messages that have come through the online form, prioritising those most in need and phoning them first, making notes on her pad as she listens. She has a warm but professional style that I imagine would be a tonic for a student in distress. Sisson phones and leaves a message for one student who is worried about his flatmate, whom he describes as being very emotionally volatile. She cannot contact the flatmate without his express permission, so, as with most third-party referrals, she will encourage his concerned friend to raise the issue directly. She reads about another student who has written to request counselling after experiencing issues for a few years. She makes some notes on her pad before she dials: GP? Academic staff? She introduces herself in an upbeat way and asks questions. “It sounds like you’re feeling a bit by yourself,” she says, gently, and offers him a wellbeing appointment – a 50-minute, face-to-face session. This might be the first time these young people have ever spoken to anyone, and I’m glad that it is Sisson’s voice they hear on the end of the line. “I hope I come across as approachable and interested in their situation,” she says, “and through that I build a bit of a rapport. They’re in touch about really personal, sensitive issues, so I try to make that as easy as possible.” Sisson’s background in social work means she is well trained to talk about these kinds of problems; but Bromberg recognises that the whole university must be prepared to respond appropriately when faced with a student who is struggling. Her team has opened mental health first-aid training to all staff, to teach them how to listen calmly and hold silences for longer than feels comfortable. If universities can intervene at the right time, it can have a huge impact. Claudia de Campos, a child and adolescent psychotherapist and visiting lecturer at the Tavistock clinic in London, explains: “The things that we can’t talk about take on a life of their own, and seep through in ways we are not aware of. If something can be thought about and made sense of, spoken and elaborated, it loses its hold – and, depending on the nature of the problem, is less likely to get passed on to the next generation.” For George Watkins at Cardiff, the stigma is exacerbated by so-called “lad culture”, where putting on a brave face pushes some to ignore their feelings. Things may be changing, but as Midlands student Alex says, with more than a hint of exasperation: “Reducing stigma is a huge deal, but even if we reduce it loads, it will be pointless if there is no money in any services to get anything done, and people who seek help are told, ‘Go and have a good sleep – see how you feel.’” At NTU, Alison Bromberg still thinks there is cause to feel optimistic about the future. “I do. I actually do. It feels as if we’re embracing a much more holistic framework across the sector.” She cites proposed changes to the university curriculum, such as creating course content for all students on subjects such as coping with change and understanding stress and anxiety. “We’ve got to make sure mental health becomes everybody’s business. That’s the journey we’re on. And I think we’ve come a long way.” Some names have been changed. • In the UK, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123.

What he was hoping for, in the largest single surviving remnant of the Third Reich, is some hint of the past. But there is little of that here today. The Third Reich destroyed many cities, but it never built one. It began some – notably the industrial city of Wolfsburg – and it planned many others. But mostly, its ideas about what they called the Volksgemeinschaft (“people’s community”) went unrealised. With one exception: the Strength Through Joy (Kraft durch Freude) resort of Prora, on the Isle of Rügen. Commissioned by KdF, the leisure organisation operated by Robert Ley’s German Labour Front, Prora was planned in the mid-1930s to the designs of Clemens Klotz and substantially built before the outbreak of the second world war. It was intended as an immense holiday camp, the largest in the world at nearly three miles long, stretching in a sandy arc along the Baltic Sea. But Prora would never welcome holidaymakers. Instead its use has been largely military, first as a training camp for the Nazi military police, then for the East and later United German armies. That is, until now. If you make your way to Prora today, along the sparse roads that run through sleepy, rural Rügen, you’ll see billboards. Some show people running happily along the beach, others show the bleak blocks spruced up and populated via computer rendering. The Strength Through Joy resort is now for sale, awaiting its first residents. Dark past You could say that Prora was the first modern holiday resort. Repeated concrete blocks in rows, each with a view of the sea, connected to nightclubs and restaurants, all two decades before the coasts of Spain and Greece developed their own equivalents. Its architecture has none of the colourful style of the Weimar Republic, but rather an arresting lack of sentimentality and detail. The leisure centres and cafes are decorated with classical columns, and the unbuilt festival hall would have pushed Prora a little closer to Poundbury, but this is a machine aesthetic, and a chilling one. The first civilian use for Prora, in the late 1990s, was for a YMCA in one of the eight mindbendingly long blocks. Cologne-based writer Christian Werthschulte remembers staying there as a teenager, and “hated every minute of it”. It’s not hard to imagine why – even with its gorgeous sandy beach the place feels bleak and harsh. The youth hostel was recently renovated, but other blocks have been sold to developers. Some of these are being renovated, some are being stripped back to their concrete frames for the same purpose, but walk along the sandy beach and you’ll find that one huge long block has been transformed, its dun concrete painted and gleaming glass balconies added; two others are undergoing a transformation into the same. Compared with the delicate way Germany normally handles its fascist heritage, this is unusual. Prora’s dereliction, like that of Albert Speer’s Zeppelinfeld in Nuremberg, once stood as an instructive image of Nazi hubris. Now, it is becoming the place it was intended to be. Wertschulte, recalling his school trips there in his youth, points out that “it would be a good place to teach Germans about everyday life under the Nazis”. That was indeed the original plan. Katja Lucke, who works at the Prora Documentation Centre museum, tells me that after its military use was wound down, an independent study “recommended a mixed use of the building complex: for soft tourism, education, culture, living and social care. The use would have been connected with the consideration of the history of the building and the intention to protect and preserve it”. But, realising the complexity of the task, “the federal finance and estate office decided to sell it, basically to get out of the responsibility”. Instead of treating Prora as a whole, the state sold it off, piece by piece. A sceptical local government “had not too much influence and not too expensive lawyers”, says Lucke. As a result, “every block has a different investor”. Ironically, investors are attracted by the subsidies the building is given as a heritage monument. The units in Block 1 have been on sale now since 2016, and they cost between £300,000 and £600,000. Most have now been sold. Show flats are available for viewing: when you’re inside, it’s much like any contemporary luxury apartment, with sleek kitchens and glass balconies. The flats are aimed at the typical German luxury clientele – middle aged, wealthy, seldom from the local area. These units are explicitly marketed as second homes for people from Hamburg and Berlin; what Iris Hegerich, of the Berlin-based developers IrisGerd Immobilien, has called “high-calibre customers”. In the winter, as with any other resort, it will be empty. As a result, the plans have been unpopular in nearby towns like Binz and Sassnitz, where there will be little benefit to be had from the new resort. ‘Why not make the place nice?’ Has the history of the site been a help or a hindrance in marketing Prora? “Both,” says Elisa Weizmann, a spokesperson for IrisGerd Immoblien. “The story belongs to this ensemble and will always be part of Prora. The untouched nature of Prora makes it easy to forget the dark past. Through the reconstruction of this building we are concentrating on creating something new for the future.” Units are advertised on the promise that the buyer can be beside “one of the most beautiful beaches in Germany at any time”. It is striking, visiting Prora, how normal the imagery put out by the property companies is. You could be anywhere. But of course you are not – you’re in the largest built relic of German fascism, a place where mass murderers were trained. But as one beach-goer comments, “Germany is full of memorials”. Why have another? Why not make the place nice? For Katja Lucke, Prora offers “a chance to explain National Socialist ideology and to experience it, because one can see it”. Given how similar Prora now seems to many modern resorts, it also makes clear how certain Nazi ideas about mass tourism became “normal”, albeit in a different form. It’s not the only Nazi-era idea gaining prevalence in Germany today. In the summer and autumn, election posters all over Rügen – which is part of Angela Merkel’s constituency – urged a vote for the Alternative für Deutschland (AfD), a party which bases its appeal on hostility to foreigners, family values, and an end to interrogations of Germany’s past. The AfD argues there should be an end to “monuments of shame” such as the Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe in Berlin. The party’s vote rose sharply in this rural, depopulated island. Now that you can live in the old Strength Through Joy camp and enjoy it as a holiday resort like any other, the “normality” the AfD wants from the remnants of Germany’s past is being realised – through the simple wonders of the real estate market.

The Brexit ultras of the Conservative party and the Eurosceptic press have jumped at the chance to distract attention from the harsh realities facing the UK in Brexit negotiations. Chief among those realities is that the EU27 are no more likely to agree to open the next phase of negotiations in December than they were before last week’s summit, unless there is serious movement by the UK on the financial settlement. The British government’s approach to the settlement is another unforced error on its part. While it indulges in a bidding war with itself on the headline number, it should instead have been managing expectations and engaging on the elements that will make up the eventual bill. Focusing on the headline number is self-defeating domestically, as for some in the government any number would be too high. It is self-defeating in negotiations too, partly because it highlights divisions in the government, but also because the other member states are not looking for a number at this stage but rather an acceptance of specific liabilities. It has been obvious all along that the exit bill issue is as much about the UK showing good faith and realism as it is about the actual money, but so far the government has shown neither. Most of the exit bill is composed of the payments due after Brexit day on commitments made up until the UK ceases to be a member of the EU. The EU budget has two columns – commitments and payments. The commitments column is not actual money. It shows what legal commitments can be made in a given year. Those commitments are then paid out from the payments column of successive years’ annual budgets. These outstanding annual commitments (estimated to be around €30-35bn on Brexit day) are seen by the EU27 as an absolutely clear-cut obligation. They are akin to the outstanding balance on a credit card bill. The obligation does not go away just because you cut your card up. If the UK cannot even agree to this most basic of obligations, then this is all going nowhere. Agreement to this element would also cover much of the so-called “gap” in payments in the EU’s financial planning for 2019 and 2020. It would not meet future payments on commitments made in those years (for which the UK has already agreed the overall commitment ceilings), but these could be reasonably linked to a transition agreement, and, crucially, agreed later in negotiations. This could be acceptable if the payments due on pre-Brexit commitments are agreed to first. That show of good faith and realism on the credit card bill is essential to any progress. Other elements of the exit bill can be packaged nicely and there’s little reason to think the EU27 would not agree to do so. Pension commitments, loan guarantees and so on again require a firm, specific commitment to meet them, and a negotiation on how to calculate them, but do not need a number at this stage. The Department for International Development would have to spend the equivalent amount to the payments due to the European Development Fund to meet the government’s own commitments on aid anyway, so agreeing that could be sold as being effectively budget neutral. Instead of engagement on these issues however, the EU27 have been met by cries of “whistle for it”, vague Florentine promises, objections to agreed sequencing, efforts to divide the member states, self-harming threats of no deal, and obvious attempts by some to set up the EU27 to take the blame whatever happens. They also see that the government is so split that the PM may not be able to sell what is agreed in Brussels at home. Where is the incentive to move while this is the case, particularly while there are few signs of a unified UK government position on what it wants from the next stage anyway? As Radek Sikorski, the Polish former foreign minister, recently said, the prime minister must “get a unified position out of her cabinet, and persuade people that this is really serious.” Shouting (low) numbers back and forth across the cabinet table, or indeed the Channel, will not persuade anyone. There will be a Brexit bill and it will be tens of billions of euros. A future trade agreement would however be worth hundreds of billions. Accepting this reality, and selling it as such, are the first steps to any agreement. • Steve Bullock was a negotiator for the UK in the EU at the UK Permanent Representation to the EU from 2010-2014.

The back of the Pixel 2 is nearly identical to the larger Pixel 2 XL – the same glass panel at the top, same textured “hybrid coating” on the aluminium body, same fingerprint sensor and rounded corners. This time the camera is placed to the right of the flash, not the left, and the matt grey Google logo replaces the shiny chrome one. It’s attractive from the back, but the front is much more bland and dated. Instead of a 6in 18:9 elongated screen that fills most of the device, the Pixel 2 has a 5in regular OLED display with large top and bottom bezels that house a set of stereo speakers. It’s a little disappointing, looking like a smartphone from 2015 – not a top-end phone from 2017. The 1080p screen is of good quality with a decent colour range, but doesn’t look quite as good as Samsung’s best. Most will be perfectly happy with it. Despite having a small screen for an Android smartphone, at just 5in, the phone is about the same size as a Samsung Galaxy S8 with its 5.8in display. The Pixel 2 is 69.7mm wide, 1.6mm wider than the Galaxy S8 and 2.4mm wider than the iPhone 8. It’s also 7.8mm thick compared to 7.3mm for the iPhone 8 and 8mm for the Galaxy S8, and it weighs 143g, 5g lighter than the iPhone 8 and 12g lighter than the Galaxy S8. You can’t really tell though. The Pixel 2 is water resistant to IP67 standards (immersion to a depth of 1m) matching the iPhone 8, not the higher IP68 rating (1.5m depth) of the Galaxy S8. The textured coating aids grip and feels durable, but some will not like that it doesn’t have the smooth finish of glass or uncoated metal. Specifications Screen: 5in FHD AMOLED (441ppi) Processor: octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 RAM: 4GB of RAM Storage: 64 or 128GB Operating system: Android 8.0 Oreo Camera: 12.2MP rear camera with OIS, 8MP front-facing camera Connectivity: LTE, Wi-Fi, NFC, eSIM, Bluetooth 5 and GPS Dimensions: 145.7 x 69.7 x 7.8 mm Weight: 143g More than a day’s battery life The Pixel 2 has the same processor, storage and memory as the Pixel 2 XL and performs just as fast, making it one of the smoothest and consistent Android smartphones available. Battery life was also good, lasting just over 28 hours between charges, a period in which I responded to hundreds of emails, messages and notifications, took some photographs, played a quick game, listened to around three hours of music and watched a 50-minute episode of Van Helsing downloaded from Netflix using Bluetooth headphones. It took close to two hours to fully charge the Pixel 2, while standby battery life overnight wasn’t quite as good as the Pixel 2 XL in my testing, dropping around 5% overnight compared to just 1% battery. Android Oreo Like the Pixel 2 XL, the Pixel 2 is one of the first smartphones to run the latest version of Android 8 Oreo, which feels polished and well optimised with smooth animations and snappy response all round. There’s also tight integration of Google Assistant, including squeezable sides on the phone to fire it up, and a new permanent widget on the homescreen that is designed to put Google’s smarts front and centre. The Now Playing feature recognises music playing around you using local machine learning and a database, meaning it works offline — no internet connection required. It works well. Google’s new Lens feature recognises objects in photos, identifying landmarks, media and art, and giving users more information on even relatively obscure local monuments. Camera Both the front and rear cameras are the same on the Pixel 2 as they are on the bigger Pixel 2 XL. The 12.2-megapixel camera on the Pixel 2 is fantastic. Google’s HDR+ processing produces some of the most detail-rich, well balanced photos of any smartphone, and makes it difficult to capture a bad photo. Low light performance is excellent, but it lacks extensive manual controls. The eight-megapixel selfie camera is also cracking, while motion stills are a fun gimmick. Google’s Portrait Mode is also very good. Observations The Pixel 2 did not exhibit any clicking or whining noises during the test period, as some users have reported Stereo front-facing speakers are loud and clear, but aren’t capable of really filling a room Unlimited photo and video backup through Google Photos is included in the price The lack of a headphone socket is disappointing, even if there’s a USB-C to 3.5mm adapter in the box Price The Pixel 2 costs £629 with 64GB of storage or £729 with 128GB of storage and are exclusive to EE, Carphone Warehouse and the Google Store in the UK. For comparison, the 5.8in Samsung Galaxy S8 with 64GB costs under £540 (£689 at launch), the 5.5in OnePlus 5 with 64GB costs £449 and the 4.7in iPhone 8 with 64GB costs £699. Apple’s upcoming 5.8in iPhone X with 64GB of storage will cost £999. Verdict The Pixel 2 has everything good about the guts and software of its larger 6in sibling, the Pixel 2 XL, but squeezed into a smaller phone. On paper that sounds fantastic, but the large bezels around the screen, with big top and bottom panels, make the Pixel 2 look dated next to its top-end Android competition. The wasted space makes the Pixel 2 a lot larger than it needs to be for the small 5in screen and a lot less cutting edge than you might expect from a £629 phone. Good battery life, a cracking camera and excellent performance still make the Pixel 2 a good phone, but it feels like a missed opportunity to be the best. Pros: very fast, long battery life, great screen, squeezable sides, latest version of Android and rapid updates, interesting built-in AI, water resistant, fantastic camera, unlimited photo and video backup Cons: large bezels, dated design, expensive, no expandable storage or removable battery, no headphone jack, no wireless charging Other reviews Samsung Galaxy S8 review: the future of smartphones OnePlus 5 review: as fast and smooth as 2016’s Google Pixel, without the price tag HTC U11 review: the first squeezable phone iPhone 8 review: so this is what good battery life feels like"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"}]}}
