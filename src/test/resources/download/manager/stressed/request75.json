The group recorded two successive live shows for this limited-edition, screenprinted double album, with celebrated Norwegian adventurers Maja SK Ratkje (vocals) and Arve Henriksen, who plays flutelike, wind-toned ambient trumpet. The effects often suggest rubbed wineglasses or babbling brooks, but there are plenty of smoky, mysteriously hooting jazz-horn sounds and the participants’ jazz links are plain in both the rhythmic language and the collective improv feel. The disconsolately echoing purity of Ratkje’s chants dramatically contrast with churning electronic undercurrents and Mapp’s fast-moving basslines, while her scat-like staccato inventions rise amid orchestral effects like hordes of violins. Henriksen’s half of the set is more song-shaped, as his plaintive trumpet exhalations and querulous-chorister vocals wheel amid fast, free-swing drum patterns, church-organ reverberations and nudging jazz-piano chords. It’s electronica, but with plenty of mood-swinging clout."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"technology/2017/aug/30/spambot-leaks-700m-email-addresses-huge-data-breach-passwords","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-30T09:53:22Z","webTitle":"Spambot leaks more than 700m email addresses in huge data breach","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/aug/30/spambot-leaks-700m-email-addresses-huge-data-breach-passwords","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2017/aug/30/spambot-leaks-700m-email-addresses-huge-data-breach-passwords","fields":{"headline":"Spambot leaks more than 700m email addresses in massive data breach","bodyText":"More than 700m email addresses, as well as a number of passwords, have leaked publicly thanks to a misconfigured spambot, in one of the largest data breaches ever. The number of real humans’ contact details contained in the dump is likely to be lower, however, due to the number of fake, malformed and repeated email addresses contained in the dataset, according to data breach experts. Troy Hunt, an Australian computer security expert who runs the Have I Been Pwned site, which notifies subscribers when their data ends up in breaches, wrote in a blog post: “The one I’m writing about today is 711m records, which makes it the largest single set of data I’ve ever loaded into HIBP. Just for a sense of scale, that’s almost one address for every single man, woman and child in all of Europe.” It contains almost twice the records, once sanitised, than those contained in the River City Media breach from March, previously the largest breach from a spammer. The data was available because the spammers failed to secure one of their servers, allowing any visitor to download many gigabytes of information without needing any credentials. It is impossible to know how many others besides the spammer who compiled the database have downloaded their own copies. While there are more than 700m email addresses in the data, however, it appears many of them are not linked to real accounts. Some are incorrectly scraped from the public net, while others appear to have been simply guessed at by adding words such as “sales” in front of a standard domain to generate, for example, “sales@newspaper.com”. There are also millions of passwords contained in the breach, apparently a result of the spammers collecting information in an attempt to break in to users’ email accounts and send spam under their names. But, Hunt says, the majority of the passwords appear to have been collated from previous leaks: one set mirrors the 164m stolen from LinkedIn in May 2016, while another set mirrors 4.2m of the ones stolen from Exploit.In, another pre-existing database of stolen passwords. “Finding yourself in this data set unfortunately doesn’t give you much insight into where your email address was obtained from nor what you can actually do about it,” Hunt says. “I have no idea how this service got mine, but even for me with all the data I see doing what I do, there was still a moment where I went ‘ah, this helps explain all the spam I get’.” The leak is not the only major breach announced today. Video games reseller CEX notified customers that an online security breach may have leaked as many as 2m accounts, including full names, addresses, email addresses and phone numbers. Card information was also contained in the breach “in a small number of instances”, but the newest financial data dates to 2009, meaning it has likely expired for those users. “We take the protection of customer data extremely seriously and have always had a robust security programme in place which we continually reviewed and updated to meet the latest online threats,” the company said in a statement. “Clearly however, additional measures were required to prevent such a sophisticated breach occurring and we have therefore employed a cybersecurity specialist to review our processes. Together we have implemented additional advanced measures of security to prevent this from happening again.” Game of Thrones stars’ personal details leaked as HBO hackers demand ransom Stolen nude photos and hacked defibrillators: is this the future of ransomware?"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2017/aug/30/using-him-exclusively-as-a-hatstand","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-30T16:36:01Z","webTitle":"Using him exclusively as a hatstand","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/aug/30/using-him-exclusively-as-a-hatstand","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/aug/30/using-him-exclusively-as-a-hatstand","fields":{"headline":"Using him exclusively as a hatstand","bodyText":"NO LATE SERGE At the time of writing the Fiver, which was three Tins before whatever time it is now, Tottenham Hotspur had not confirmed the signing of Serge Aurier from Paris Saint-Germain. It’s not that they’re ashamed, it’s just that Daniel Levy has a reputation to uphold and wouldn’t like word to get out that he has completed another deal before 22:59 on transfer deadline day, which is not even until tomorrow. The Aurier negotiations had promised to be pleasingly complex for Levy. Firstly, there was the issue of how to stifle the giggles that overwhelmed everyone at White Hart Lane this week when Levy blagged £18m out of Stoke for Kevin Wimmer after signing the defender for less than a quarter of that amount a year ago and using him since then exclusively as a hatstand. Secondly and most excitingly for Levy, there was the prospect of a tense standoff with the Home Office, who barred Aurier from entering the UK in 2016 after he was sentenced to two months in Le Jug following an altercation with a French policeman. But, as it turned out, Levy never got to lock horns with the government over that one because it transpires that French authorities have downgraded Aurier’s punishment from serving chokey time to just paying a fine. So with that legal bother out of the way, Spurs got themselves a readymade upgrade on Kyle Walker with disappointingly little fuss. Someone is going to have to pay and it’ll probably be whoever tries to do a deal with Levy on deadline day. None of which means, of course, that Aurier’s arrival in Blighty will remain uneventful. As Danny Rose may be able to tell you without visiting Google, the 24-year-old is a swashbuckling player who has had a singular career so far, with highlights including getting banned for insulting a referee on social media disgrace Twitter and getting banned for insulting his manager and team-mates on social media disgrace Periscope. At around £23m, Aurier could prove terrific value for Spurs. And for the Fiver. QUOTE OF THE DAY “Not only was I one of the smallest at the academy, I was also the slowest. That might come as a surprise to anyone who watched me on the wing at Old Trafford but I had never done athletics. I was told I had to improve my jumping so in the evenings, when nobody was looking, I would sneak out into a forest by the training pitches and practise jumping up and down on one leg, bringing my knee up to my chest. It was an exercise they called in Russian Blokha or ‘the Flea’. I would do it a hundred times and then I would swap legs and do it a hundred more. I would do it every evening for three years” – Andrei Kanchelskis reveals all this and more in this extract from his autobiography.

FIVER LETTERS “Yes, you don’t often get a ‘My Sharona’ reference in the headline of a Proper Journalist David Conn piece [yesterday’s Still Want Mores] but the Fiver does usually report on at lease one daily mention of The Knack” – Mike Wrall. “I know that Fiver Letters is not really the place for serious issues to be discussed but I have to take exception to Marten Allen’s exuberant but entirely wrong-headed defence of Raheem Sterling’s antics over the weekend [yesterday’s Fiver letters]. Firstly can we be clear that he was not sent-off for going into the crowd. He was cautioned for that. He was sent off because he did it subsequent to having been sufficiently impish to have obtained a previous yellow card in the game. Secondly can we be clear that the caution was for inciting the crowd to a display of bad manners involving struggles with stewards, policemen, and players to the not inconsiderable peril of all concerned not simply for strolling over to say ‘What a good boy am I?’ to anyone who cared to listen. Where are we going? To a safe environment in which it’s no longer necessary to keep fans behind fences to prevent them getting at the players. It would be a shame if we now had to bring the fences back to protect the fans from bone-headed players who are apparently incapable of keeping their passions on the pitch as they have been expected to since the very first laws of the game were drawn up. It is a cautionable offence to leave the pitch without the referee’s permission. There is nothing new about this and referees already show considerable restraint in not punishing the frequent abuses of the law during the ridiculous hysteria that follows a goal, the main effect of which is to make the scorers more vulnerable to conceding immediately afterward anyway. If players want to stretch this restraint to its limits by taking the proverbial as Sterling did then frankly a yellow card is not nearly enough retribution. Passion does not necessitate loss of control nor does it mitigate negligence. It is, I would suggest, vastly overrated” – Barry Etheridge “Amen to Marten Allen’s sentiments in today’s Fiver” – Rod Marshall [It’s a game of opinions – Fiver Ed]. “I’m with Marten Allen 100%, and as I’m 60 now, I’m allowed to be a grumpy old so-and-so, hence I feel entitled (yes) to share my own curiously double-edged (i.e. contradictory) pet peeve re- goal celebrations. Having seen first Ronaldo, then Raheem Sterling recently double-yellowed and sent off for what I’d call legitimate and wholly football-centric celebrations, can’t we just bin this ridiculous rule right now. I would if I could. Let the lads celebrate, FFS. On the other hand, can we also mandatory red card any footballers (single or in-groups - yes the whole lot of them!) who perform their ‘signature’ rehearsed celebrations, even if it follows a knee-wonk, toe-poke, someone else’s own goal, or an accidental deflection in an offside goalmouth scramble in a 7-0 win?

The topic of mainstay Andy Butler’s relapse into drug addiction and his recovery hangs over Omnion. It should be a tough subject for an album thick with four-to-the-floor beats to address – who wants to be reminded of the downside of hedonism while lost on the dancefloor? – but Butler has form in hitching difficult topics to dance music. The gorgeous 2014 track I Try to Talk to You featured John Grant singing about his HIV-positive status. Here, on My Curse and Cure and Wild Child, the lyrical remorse chafes intriguingly against the musical euphoria, while the title track sets Sharon Van Etten’s affecting vocals against swooning electronics. Elsewhere, Butler’s ability to co-opt unlikely voices to his musical world is as impressive as ever, from the Lebanese indie band Mashrou’ Leila to the Horrors’ frontman Faris Badwan.

Matthew Goodman, who served as White House coordinator for Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec) and the East Asia Summit in the previous administration, told Guardian Australia he believed the Trump administration had given Australia licence to “just keep the seat warm for the United States”. “I have no hard evidence of this, but I’ve heard senior Trump administration officials have acknowledged Japan and Australia’s interests in moving forward [with the TPP] and haven’t expressed any objections to that,” Goodman said. He said Japan had been “rattled” when Donald Trump confirmed the US wouldn’t proceed with the controversial regional trade pact. “[Japan] approached the Trump administration and got their tacit approval to drive this forward”. Goodman, who now holds the William E Simon chair in political economy at the respected Washington thinktank, the Centre for Strategic and International Studies, said the US in the Trump era had to look for “workarounds” given it had enduring interests, both economic and strategic, in this region. He said the US would look to Australia to keep issues of mutual interest ticking over. “We have to coordinate with allies like Australia to be, in a sense, our proxy, during this period where we are not leading on these issues”. Lead negotiators from the 11 remaining TPP countries met in Sydney in an effort to keep the trade deal alive after the Trump withdrawal. The deal pursued by the Obama administration secured agreement from Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore and Vietnam. Goodman said Trump’s decision to exit the trade pact was “a mistake”, and had set back America’s strategic interests in the region. “I am critical of the administration on these issues – this was not helpful to our interests out here, to withdraw from the TPP.” He said the TPP was the economic expression of US influence and connectedness in the region, and he insisted an economic strategy was required in Asia, not just a military presence. “We have to work at being here, because we are a Pacific power but not an Asian country,” Goodman said. He acknowledged that the TPP was controversial with the public, but he said the trade pact had become a scapegoat of a lot of anxieties, and “an easy target”. Goodman said there was a big challenge ahead for supporters of trade liberalisation given there was an underlying set of economic anxieties in developed economies which gave rise to populism, and to Trump. He said the benefits of trade liberalisation were not always obvious to Americans, but the specific transitional costs were front of mind for many people. “We have to have real answers to those questions,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2017/aug/30/football-transfer-rumours-riyad-mahrez-chelsea-manchester-united","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-30T07:53:56Z","webTitle":"Football transfer rumours: Chelsea and Manchester United tussle over Mahrez?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/aug/30/football-transfer-rumours-riyad-mahrez-chelsea-manchester-united","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/aug/30/football-transfer-rumours-riyad-mahrez-chelsea-manchester-united","fields":{"headline":"Football transfer rumours: Chelsea and Manchester United tussle over Mahrez?","bodyText":"As the old saying goes, all good things come to those who kick up a mighty stink. So Antonio Conte’s summer of strops and sulks looks set to yield a happy conclusion for the Italian, and also for N’Golo Kanté, who is poised to be reunited with not one but two old Leicester City chums, Danny Drinkwater and Riyad Mahrez. There could be a snag in the Mahrez deal, however: because there are murmurs that José Mourinho wants to hijack it and bring the Algerian to Manchester United. What is more, there’s talk that Liverpool want to muscle in on Chelsea’s plans to sign Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, and that Oxlade-Chamberlain wouldn’t mind if they did. So rage on a little longer, Antonio, rage on. Someone is going to feel the wrath of Leicester, too. West Brom, for starters, because the loss of Drinkwater has persuaded the Foxes to spoil the Baggies’ big coup and snaffle PSG’s Grzegorz Krychowiak instead. And Crystal Palace can also expect clog: because Leicester are going after their main defensive target, Liverpool’s Mamadou Sakho. But Leicester may not be too bothered about keeping Islam Slimani, although Marseille will have to raise their offer to get him. And Leicester certainly aren’t bothered about keeping Nampalys Mendy. The midfielder has turned down a chance to return to France with Rennes but, on the other hand, is open to the possibility of heading back to Nice. Rennes may land another of their targets, however, as West Ham may let Diafra Sakho go. Noises from Liverpool suggest the club may finally agree to sell Philippe Coutinho to Barcelona for around £140m. That’s some quality haggling and no mistake. And it’ll make for a dandy summer if Liverpool manage to round things off by spending that windfall on Thomas Lemar and Virgil Van Dijk, which they hope to do. Meanwhile, Serge Aurier is hopeful that his move to Tottenham will be waved through on Wednesday. The PSG full-back has agreed terms with the club but is awaiting approval of his work permit and hopes the legal snafu he had a few years back won’t be held against him. The wait is beginning to irritate him. So now he knows how PSG felt against Lorient last season when, after Thomas Meunier had to depart injured, it took Aurier eight minutes to get dressed and come on as a substitute, with the application of socks proving particularly troublesome for the grown man. The former Liverpool manager Roy Hodgson would like to be known henceforth as the future manager of Crystal Palace. Hodgson knows a lame duck gaffer when he smells one and there’s no denying that Frank De Boer is giving off a strong anatine whiff right now. If it’s the Ajax way that Palace want, then Hodgson can do that no problem. Or how about a bit of Brazil 1970? Dukla Prague 1964? Hodgson is happy to take requests and 100% satisfaction is guaranteed or your money back*. Elsewhere, it turns out that Monaco are not going to break the bank to relieve Stoke City of Gianelli Imbula. They’re not even going to take him on loan. But Toulouse are keen for some reason. Stoke, meanwhile, are also willing to listen to offers for Bojan Krkic.

Once, long ago, this place served as a way-station on the underground railroad, providing shelter for runaway slaves en route to Canada. Now the church is preserved as a pretty antique, a clapboard white elephant propped up by a Christian conglomerate called Abundant Life and bankrolled by a billionaire industrialist who pollutes the environment. Its planned reconsecration is just a ghastly charade. An outside bet for the Venice Golden Lion, Paul Schrader’s new drama blows into town like Jesus at the temple. It’s here to call out the hypocrites, railing at the way in which Christianity is deployed as a convenient fig leaf by the resurgent American right, or perhaps as a bizarre form of carbon offsetting whereby a historic church makes amends for a toxic river. First Reformed is a deeply felt, deeply thought picture; impressive in its seriousness and often gripping in the way it frames itself as a debate and a sermon. It is also, crucially, a flawed portrait of a flawed man, at war with its baser instincts and in danger of backsliding. And when Schrader’s hero begins to overheat, his film can’t help but follow suit. Ethan Hawke stars as Reverend Toller, the haunted whisky priest, unable to prevent the suicide of a local eco-activist and toiling to get the organ fixed ahead of First Reformed’s birthday celebrations. “There won’t be any political talk, will there?” barks Ed Balq (Michael Gaston), the event’s plutocrat saviour, and this rankles with Toller, who is growing worryingly close to the activist’s widow. Is it worth pointing out that the widow is with child and that her name is Mary? Either way, she is played by Amanda Seyfried, who, beyond looking becomingly tragic, is not given a whole lot to do. The fact that Toller keeps a journal in which he gives voice to his thoughts and quotes the Book of Revelations, makes it tempting to view the film as Schrader’s homage to The Diary of a Country Priest, directed in 1951 by his hero Robert Bresson. The apple never falls too far from the tree, after all, and Toller soon emerges as your classic Schrader surrogate. He’s zealous and wonky, God’s lonesome samurai, cut from the same holy cloth as Yukio Mishima or Travis Bickle. In trying to do the right thing, he risks raining hellfire on us all. The organ is fixed; the reconsecration is scheduled. First Reformed is poised to celebrate its 250th birthday. By this point, however, the film has taken on a faintly hysterical air, its early rigour and poise a fading memory. Inside his sterile home, Toller splashes Pepto-Bismol in his scotch to calm his stomach pains. He’s desperately Googling news about climate change. He is thrilling to apocalyptic visions of ruined forests and rubbish tips, levitating from the floor in a trance to more efficiently tour the whole blighted planet. And if Schrader can’t find a way to bring his film safely home, what chance does he have of rescuing Toller as well? Has the priest taken leave of his senses, or is he embarking on some mysterious holy mission? On the morning of the service, his hour come around, he slouches towards the pulpit, weighing up a possible rebirth.

The storm is expected to weaken and continue to the north. Harvey is forecast to drop substantial amounts of rain across the state before moving on to Arkansas, Tennessee and parts of Missouri, which could also see flooding. Texas is still reeling from the devastating rains of the last five days. Latest forecasts suggest Houston will see less than an inch of rain on Wednesday. Earlier fears that two reservoirs could overspill, threatening surrounding communities with more flooding, seem to be receding. An update on Tuesday evening from the US Army Corps of Engineers said water levels in the Addicks and Baker reservoirs are now not expected to rise as high as had been forecast. Harvey now holds the US record for most rainfall from a tropical system. The casualties At least 18 people are confirmed to have died in the storm as it ravaged Texas, including police sergeant Steve Perez; Ruben Jordan, a retired high school coach; 83-year-old Ola Mae Crooks; andAlexander Kwoksum Sung, who was 64. On Tuesday night, the Harris county institute of forensic sciences said it had identified three more victims: Agnes Stanley, 89, who was found in floodwater in a home; Travis Lynn Callihan, 45, who died after leaving his vehicle in high waters; and an unnamed 76-year-old woman, who died in waters around her vehicle. Beaumont police said they had recovered the body of a woman from floodwaters. Her young daughter, who was clinging to her mother, is being treated in hospital. Six members of the Saldivar family are believed to have died when their vehicle became trapped in flooding, although their bodies have not yet been found. The relief efforts New shelters have been opened after the George R Brown convention center, set up with a capacity of 5,000, took in 10,000 evacuees. New arrivals are now being directed to a large hub at the NRG center, which can hold an additional 10,000 people, with smaller numbers sent to the Toyota Center, usually home to the NBA’s Houston Rockets. Following stinging criticism, televangelist Joel Osteen’s Lakewood Church – a Houston megachurch with capacity for 16,000 people –has reversed its decision not to house people seeking shelter. More than 13,000 people have now been rescued by local and federal agencies in the Houston area and across southeastern Texas. It is not known how many people remain in their homes. Houston mayor Sylvester Turner has imposed a citywide curfew from midnight to 5am to curb “potential criminal acts” against abandoned properties. The response Donald Trump will return to Texas on Saturday, the White House confirmed, following a trip with first lady Melania Trump on Tuesday at which the president met local residents with the greeting: “What a crowd, what a turnout.” After criticism from some that Trump had failed to express empathy for those affected by the storm, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said the president had been moved by images from the disaster zone: The number one thing after talking to him just a little bit ago that he wanted to reenforce from today was that this is all about people, making sure that we are taking care of the people of Texas– that is his number one priority. One-fifth of US oil refineries have been shut down as a result of Harvey. On Tuesday night, Motiva Enterprises’ plant in Port Arthur, Texas, the largest in the US, was closing due to flooding. The plant produces 603,000 barrels a day. Gasoline prices have spiked to their highest point since July 2015, prompting fears of a fuel shortage.

Here is the verdict from our readers. ‘Noel Fielding is great and he seems kinder than Mel or Sue’ Rating 4 out of 5 from Alison Williams, 49, Cardiff I thought they kept the best bits from the BBC and brought that to Channel 4. It’s the same old nice, fun and lighthearted show. I really like Noel Fielding and Prue Leith so I was pleased when I heard they would be presenting. Noel is great and seemed very genuine. He is still finding his feet, but he brings a bit of quirk and makes it a bit different from the BBC Bake Off. He seems kinder than Mel or Sue. Sometimes I find Sandi Toksvig a bit patronising and sneering but she was good in this; she reined that in. I love Paul Hollywood anyway – my husband is scouse and went to the same school as him so I’m a fan. My favourite bit from last night was the interchange between Paul and the scouse grandmother Flo. When he said “I love you Flo” and she said she loved him back, that was really cute. ‘If the BBC puts on something better, I doubt I will keep watching’ Rating 3 out of 5 from Mark Tennent, south-east England It was a valiant effort, but I think the show should have stayed where it was. The Channel 4 version lacked a spark; Noel and Sandi are no Mel and Sue and won’t ever be as they aren’t that sort of entertainers. I’m not sure the chemistry is quite right between the two of them. I felt none of the contestants had any oomph to them. Normally there’s one you feel a warmth towards but that wasn’t the case, except maybe for the grandmother who made the melon cake. The format is stale. The ad breaks are irritating and intrusive. If the BBC puts up some competition, I doubt I’ll watch any more Bake Off. ‘I have always loved the Bake Off and which channel owns the rights is of no importance to me’ 5 out of 5 from Emma Hendry, 46, Elgin, Scotland You hardly noticed a change in personnel. Noel and Sandi were a surprisingly good combo: he was kind and funny and she was warm and witty. Prue could be Mary’s slightly younger long-lost sister, and Paul continues to be the one the bakers all want to impress. The bakers themselves showed a wonderful array of skills. The fruit cake challenge proved quite tricky to perfect, however the bonfire cake looked beautiful and Flo’s cake was apparently delicious. It certainly looked wonderful. The technical mini rolls were fiddly, but the real highlight was the showstopper. Jan’s ramen noodles cake looked amazing, and the loaf and sandwich cake was so realistic – he is a true artist. The champagne bottle with ice cubes was also stunning. I could go on. It did not bother me in the slightest that it was going to Channel 4. I have always loved the Bake Off, but which channel owns the rights is of no importance to me. ‘The big loss for me was Mary Berry. It made the show colder’ Rating 4 out of 5 from Mark Bays, 48, London The loss of Mary changed the show and made it colder. The presenters did not make too much difference really. Mel and Sue have been replaced with as close copies as practically possible. Sandi Toksvig immediately fell into the role. Noel Fielding will take time to get there, but the first outing was a good start. Prue Leith is no doubt knowledgeable and experienced, but no one has the warmth and comfort of Mary Berry. Nothing, though, lasts forever and Prue will make the show different. I want to see her baking, to see her love for the job and to really make her part of the team. ‘No one stood out as having much personality’ Rating 3 out of 5 from Anna Gibson, 29, London I was surprised by how similar the show was to the BBC version; it felt like they had tried to create the same format, but there was something a bit fake about it. I felt like no one really stood out as having much personality. In terms of the new presenters, I liked Noel, Sandi and Prue, especially Prue. She seemed to offer the same insightful feedback as Mary Berry. The only thing that jarred a bit for me was Noel Fielding’s voiceover when he talked about the cakes – his voice was a bit distracting. The ad breaks were the real downside. Overall it was OK, but I am waiting to see what happens next and will be following the series more before passing too much judgment."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/aug/31/rehab-waiting-lists-not-checked-in-welfare-drug-test-sites-australian-senate-inquiry-told","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-30T18:00:08Z","webTitle":"Rehab waiting lists not checked in welfare drug test sites, Australian Senate inquiry told","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/aug/31/rehab-waiting-lists-not-checked-in-welfare-drug-test-sites-australian-senate-inquiry-told","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/aug/31/rehab-waiting-lists-not-checked-in-welfare-drug-test-sites-australian-senate-inquiry-told","fields":{"headline":"Rehab waiting lists not checked in welfare drug test sites, Australian Senate inquiry told","bodyText":"The federal government did not know the length of waiting lists for local drug treatment services when it chose three trial sites to drug test welfare recipients, an inquiry has been told. Drug experts have warned the lack of drug and alcohol treatment services poses a significant challenge to the government’s plan, and say a $10m boost their capability is a “drop in the ocean”. Drug policy researcher Alison Ritter told Guardian Australia earlier this month that already stretched drug treatment services would not be able to meet the added demand. “Our current estimate is that we’re currently meeting about 50% of the demand,” Ritter said. “So we would need to double the treatment places in order to meet current demand. And that … 50% is a conservative estimate.” The government plans to drug test 5,000 welfare recipients in Logan, Queensland, Bankstown-Canterbury in Sydney, and Mandurah in Western Australia. Welfare recipients will be referred for treatment after two failed tests, and risk having their welfare cut off if they fail to engage with drug services. A Senate inquiry into the government’s welfare reforms heard on Wednesday the department did not have specific data on waiting lists for drug treatment services in the three trial sites before they were chosen. Department of Social Services payment policy group manager, Cath Halbert, said the government did have knowledge of the number of services operating in each location, but not the extent of their waiting lists. “I don’t have the information, but we’re certainly talking to the state health departments about, if there are waiting lists, how long they are,” Halbert said. Labor senator Murray Watt asked: “Was the length of the waiting list in each of those locations established prior to the decision being made?” Halbert replied: “We don’t, and the Department of Health doesn’t, as I understand it, have access to that information directly. We need to get it from the state governments. “We know what services have been funded, and health has an idea of what was expected – the number of people to be serviced etc – from the services they fund, but at a given point of time, we didn’t have information of, on that day, how many people were waiting for that particular service, but we’re gathering that information now.” She said the department was confident that treatment places would be available to meet the added demand. The policy also ensures that those who are waiting for treatment aren’t penalised, as long as they have committed to accessing help. Halbert said the numbers involved in the trial were relatively small, meaning the added demand would not be significant. She also cautioned against only looking at residential rehabilitation bed availability, saying not everyone in the trial would be referred for that level of treatment. “We’re talking about relatively low numbers … 5,000 being tested across the three trial sites, we’re expecting around 420-450 to test positive once, and then about 100-120 go through to a medical assessment,” Halbert said. “So about 120 people might go through to the medical assessment, we don’t expect all of those to require treatment, but that would be the maximum, and that’s spread across three trial sites,” she said. Halbert said welfare recipients could also travel for treatment. Greens senator, Rachel Siewert, described the lack of knowledge on waiting lists as “astounding”. “We know there is enormous unmet need for drug and alcohol treatment broadly in Australia and that sort of detail should have been essential when considering the trial sites,” Siewert said. “It is becoming increasingly clear that the government has not done its due diligence when it comes to consultation, evidence and information gathering on a measure that is going to make life harder for vulnerable people struggling with addiction.” Earlier in the inquiry, Ritter, who works for the National Drug and Alcohol Research Centre, told the committee that the government had resisted requests for the release of detailed data showing the extent of unmet demand in each state and territory. Ritter said she had asked the government to release the data. It had not been released."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2017/aug/30/iain-duncan-smith-warns-government-over-cuts-to-relationship-counselling","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-30T08:41:01Z","webTitle":"Iain Duncan Smith warns government over cuts to relationship counselling","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/aug/30/iain-duncan-smith-warns-government-over-cuts-to-relationship-counselling","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/aug/30/iain-duncan-smith-warns-government-over-cuts-to-relationship-counselling","fields":{"headline":"Iain Duncan Smith warns government over cuts to relationship counselling","bodyText":"The former Conservative cabinet minister Iain Duncan Smith has warned that the government plans to cut support for marriage and relationship counselling. In an article for Conservative Home, the former work and pensions secretary said his former officials had told him they had been asked to draw up plans to scrap the £10m available to help prevent couples from splitting up. Duncan Smith warned this would be a “retrograde step” that would worsen the “damaging effects of family breakdown”. He argued that the move was a false economy as the cost of family breakdown has been estimated to be £48bn a year. He said: “The government’s own evaluation shows that every £1 spent on relationship support saves the state £11, not to mention the improvement in life chances for those involved.” The issue was something of a personal crusade of Duncan Smith during his time in the coalition government that he has continued in his role as founder of the Centre for Social Justice thinktank. He pointed out that in 2015 David Cameron agreed to double support for relationship counselling to £70m. In 2014, Duncan Smith proposed free relationship counselling for new parents in order to reduce instances of family breakdown. In his article, he said he was worried that the government was about to “head in the wrong direction” on the issue by planning cuts. He ended with a plea to ministers: “I urge my colleagues that instead of looking to reduce such investment in this budget, we should look to increase the reach of such services, for the wellbeing not just of those families directly affected but of the whole country.” Chris Sherwood, chief executive of the the relationship counselling charity Relate tweeted, that Duncan Smith’s intervention was the first sign of a Tory rebellion on the cuts. Sherwood added: “We are aware that this is an important time in the Department for Work and Pensions’ decision-making process and we urge them to continue to fund relationship support, counselling, information and education. “It’s all too easy to overlook the value of relationships to individuals and society, but they play a critical role in our health and wellbeing and in ensuring that children get a good start in life.” A DWP spokeswoman said: “Mounting evidence shows the damaging effect parental conflict has on children, which is why we remain committed to supporting parents, whether separated or not, to work together.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2017/aug/30/mayweather-mcgregors-uneasy-legacy-the-triumph-of-entertainment-over-sport","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-30T09:00:26Z","webTitle":"Why Mayweather-McGregor won't usher in an era of superfights","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/aug/30/mayweather-mcgregors-uneasy-legacy-the-triumph-of-entertainment-over-sport","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/aug/30/mayweather-mcgregors-uneasy-legacy-the-triumph-of-entertainment-over-sport","fields":{"headline":"Why Mayweather-McGregor won't usher in an era of superfights","bodyText":"Regardless of where combat sports meander following the mash-up boxing bout between Floyd Mayweather and UFC’s Conor McGregor, the 26 August spectacle doesn’t signal the start of a new fistic trend. Beyond being a billion-dollar fight, it won’t be important enough to inspire a lasting legacy. I declare this a little more than a year after my book was released on the forgotten and misunderstood clash between Muhammad Ali and Japanese pro wrestling icon Antonio Inoki, which in several ways led to the creation of modern MMA. It was panned and dismissed before, during and after it took place in 1976. Several decades were required to provide enough space to extract the true impact of what it meant for the world to watch Ali, the most famous boxer of all time, step into a mixed-rules arena. So why am I so sure that Mayweather-McGregor won’t rebound into a moment in time that disrupts boxing and MMA? Two generations from now, couldn’t this boxing match similarly shift and shape the fighting landscape into something none of us ever envisioned? As difficult as it was to picture McGregor upending Mayweather, the same is true trying to imagine a meaningful effect of what they did together. Rather than an evolutionary jumping-off point, Saturday night seems much more an ode to rationalism. The thing that was supposed to happen did, and Las Vegas wasn’t brought down by an Irish earthquake. Rest assured: Even as Mayweather-McGregor falls in line with the fight-sport lineage that from time to time aligns boxing with mixed-rules contests, it was its own self-contained thing. This was an event predicated on one simple tease by two giant personalities who convinced millions of people that for $100 they could participate in the novelty of 49-0 versus 0-0, and that the payoff wouldn’t reside in the resoundingly likely outcome, but in the potentially shocking what if. Very little was accomplished beyond sating the most casual fight watchers who felt burned by the long-overdue contest between Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao in 2015. The big-money Mayweather and McGregor bout was not an event that revolved around the familiar intrigue of clashing styles (the rules guaranteed that), nor unanswered questions (we’ve seen this before), nor a must-watch competitive clash that must remain the predominant reason why any of these things matter. This was a sports event that eschewed sport because it didn’t want it. Focusing on competitive aspects of the spectacle was the promotion’s biggest stretch. Rather than honest-to-goodness analysis that was rooted in more than McGregor’s so-called mysticism – after all, he did sound like he believed he would win – the media inundated the internet and air waves with tales of gambling hauls, and celebrity sightings and faux tension built off sparring sessions featuring out-of-shape former champions. Almost all of the media about the fight wasn’t about the fight, which is a clear indication of what this was. If fight fans are suddenly swamped with a spate of similar contests between boxers and mixed-fighters, boxers and pro wrestlers, judokas and karate stylists, baseball players and football players, policeman and firemen, swimmers and sharks, swimmers and fighters, or any intersport/interspecies variation, they will signify what they always have: promoters and television networks go where the eyeballs are. It’s a well established rule that there’s money to be made by selling events to the public that they can get provincial about, wager on, and snookered into. More than 40 years after Ali went to Tokyo to tangle with Inoki, mixed fighting has become as stylized as boxing. Boxing remains so specific and layered that competitors must focus on it as a single discipline from their earliest days to reach the top. MMA is so general and varied that competitors must focus on multiple disciplines as early as they can to keep up with the growth curve. Boxing is sport because it demands accountability about wins and losses, and when its done well it is incredibly compelling. MMA, too, registers importance from results, though nowhere near the degree that boxing does. This is the professional wrestling aspect of MMA that makes it appealing enough for people who would not otherwise watch sports to watch a night of cage fights. The competitors themselves are mere cogs in the violence machine. There is nothing redemptive about that attitude for the fans or fighters. Mayweather-McGregor had little to do with styles, or the precedent established by those styles. It offered little regarding fighters of divergent abilities meeting to prove a point. It was simply a moment when one famous fighter harangued a more famous pugilist into a unique match and payday. Their confrontation was unnecessary for the purpose of highlighting truths, which the emergence of the UFC in 1993 reconfirmed after thousands of years of fights illustrated that fact to anyone who paid attention. Why would anyone now be excited by the potential of a McGregor (0-1) clash in the boxing ring against a currently “retired” Paulie Malignaggi? Because, what, the fighters went at in the gym and in the press? Because they generate good quotes and the public chimes in on Twitter? If the MayMac Effect turns out to be establishing a new low bar for promoters and fighters to step over knowing they can generate massive public interest, it further confirms the match wasn’t about sport. Trading in entertainment is an outcome that favors no one but the carnival barkers, and that is a legacy no one should wish for."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"uk-news/2017/aug/30/william-harry-remember-princess-diana-memorial-garden-kensington-palace","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-30T09:43:02Z","webTitle":"William and Harry pay tribute to mother Diana at new memorial garden","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/aug/30/william-harry-remember-princess-diana-memorial-garden-kensington-palace","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2017/aug/30/william-harry-remember-princess-diana-memorial-garden-kensington-palace","fields":{"headline":"William and Harry pay tribute to mother Diana at new memorial garden","bodyText":"The Duke of Cambridge and Prince Harry have paid tribute to their mother on the eve of the 20th anniversary of her death, amid scented roses and other favourite flowers in a memorial White Garden at Kensington Palace, planted earlier this year for the landmark milestone. Alongside the Duchess of Cambridge, the two princes sheltered under umbrellas as they toured the garden designed in memory of Diana, Princess of Wales, for about an hour. Examining the floral tributes, photographs and candles left on the gates of Kensington Palace, her former home and the scene of a sea of bouquets immediately following her death, they read messages left by well-wishers. Harry told representatives from charities supported by the late princess: “All of us lost somebody.” Kensington Palace said the visit allowed the princes “to pay tribute to the life and work of their mother the day before the 20th anniversary of her death”. In contrast to 10 years ago, when a memorial service was attended by the Queen, senior royals and 500 others at the Guards’ Chapel at Wellington barracks near Buckingham Palace, Wednesday’s tribute to Diana, Princess of Wales, was simple and personal. There was no public event as her sons chose a small private service to mark her birth, not her death – on 1 July – to rededicate her grave, which is on a private island in an ornamental lake at the Spencer family’s ancestral home at Althorp House, Northamptonshire. It was attended by the Spencer family, William, Kate and Harry and the Cambridges’ children, George and Charlotte. It was officiated by the archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby. Nothing else about the 20th anniversary has been understated, however. Recent weeks have seen daily newspaper headlines, old controversies raked over, and many TV tributes as “Dianamania” once more sweeps the country. Diana, as the royal biographer Sarah Bradford accurately predicted two decades ago, has haunted the royals “more inescapably, perhaps, in death than if she had lived happily ever after”. The 20th anniversary has seen key figures caught up in the tumultuous moment in history speaking in often painful detail for the first time. Crucially, these have included William and Harry, who decided 20 years on was an appropriate time to bare their emotional souls. “They said to me they had never spoken about it before, they’re asked about it all the time, and they wanted to speak about it once and once only,” said the US film-maker Henry Singer, whose Diana, 7 Days was broadcast on BBC1 on Sunday, and saw the princes articulate the grief, shock and bewilderment they experienced at the time with extraordinary candour. Of the significance of the 20th anniversary, Singer said: “Ten years feels a little raw.” Certainly Diana’s sister Lady Sarah McCorquodale and Lord Jay, British ambassador in Paris when Diana died in the car crash on 31 August 1997, would not have spoken sooner, he believed. “People like that, if approached after 10 years, my guess is they would have said no.” Alison Kirkham, controller of BBC factual commissioning, who approached Kensington Palace about the princes’ involvement, said: “We very strongly got the sense that what was important for [the princes] now was to protect her memory, and her legacy, and lay it down for history and preserve it for history.” She thought the princes felt “after 20 years, enough time had elapsed for them to be able to talk about it with some perspective” and then not have to talk about it again. This was the moment, because something would either be “lost to history or committed to history” and for some of those who agreed to speak, it was a question of “if we don’t speak now, when will we speak?” Kirkham, executive producer of the film, said. The White Garden and the commissioning of a new statue of their mother are the two main memorials chosen by William and Harry. The garden, inspired by memories of her life, style and image, such as her white “Elvis” Catherine Walker dress, features white roses, lilies, gladioli and cosmos around the existing Sunken Garden at her former home, of which the princess was particularly fond. Open since spring, it will continue into September. Reminiscing about the avalanche of tributes that stretched from the gates of Kensington Palace in 1997, William pointed the difference out to Harry, saying: “Last time it was all the way down.” They talked to some of the several hundred well-wishers who braved Wednesday’s rain bringing their own floral tributes, and placed them for the fans alongside others already laid. Earlier, the brothers and the Duchess of Cambridge met with representatives from charities supported by Diana, including the Royal Marsden and Great Ormond Street hospitals, the National Aids Trust, the Centrepoint youth homelessness charity and the Leprosy Mission. The statue, commissioned by the princes, will be erected in the grounds of Kensington Palace at some date in the future. Announcing the artwork in January, William and Harry said: “It has been 20 years since our mother’s death and the time is right to recognise her positive impact in the UK and around the world with a permanent statue. “Our mother touched so many lives. We hope the statue will help all those who visit Kensington Palace to reflect on her life and her legacy.” McCorquodale is a member of the six-strong committee which has been tasked with commissioning and privately raising funds for the creation of the statue."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2017/aug/30/we-aint-doing-no-damn-good-volunteer-rescuers-struggle-in-houston","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-30T08:42:27Z","webTitle":"'We ain’t doing no damn good': volunteer rescuers struggle in Houston","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/aug/30/we-aint-doing-no-damn-good-volunteer-rescuers-struggle-in-houston","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/aug/30/we-aint-doing-no-damn-good-volunteer-rescuers-struggle-in-houston","fields":{"headline":"'We ain’t doing no damn good': volunteer rescuers struggle in Houston","bodyText":"The three men drove through the night from Louisiana hauling three boats, ready for whatever the storm would throw at them. Brad Johns and his dad Wayne, and their friend John Utesch, helped save lives during Hurricane Katrina and planned to do the same in Houston as part of a volunteer rescue force, paying their own way. The challenge was immense. Tropical storm Harvey was breaking records for rain and flooding, a once-in-a-thousand-year event by some measures. Countless people were trapped and tens of thousands were displaced. “You gotta do something,” said Wayne, 71, a retired oil worker. His son Brad, 39, who works in home improvement, agreed. “It seems like the thing to do.” Utesch, 64, a furniture restorer, nodded. “If it was us, we’d appreciate the help.” They had a ski boat, a skiff and a canoe plus fuel, food, water and an app, HoustonHarveyRescue.com, which pinpointed people in need. It showed dozens of locations in Cypress, an inundated northern suburb. “Hopefully we can do some good,” said Brad. Television footage has shown dramatic rescues: people plucked from rooftops, vehicles and foaming torrents, heroism and survival, played out again and again. But for the three Louisianians, part of the so-called Cajun navy, there was just the messy, confusing, unpredictable dynamics of catastrophe in a sprawling city. The app, for starters, did not work well. Locations which seemed close turned out to be far. Or the people needing rescuing turned out to have already been rescued. The three criss-crossed waterlogged highways and byways seeking a place to launch a mission. Dozens of other vehicles towing dinghies, kayaks, airboats, jet skis and motorised fishing boats were doing the same thing. Their drivers stopped at gas stations and parking lots to confer in the rain, exchanging tips and rumours, before resuming the quest. During one stop the Johns and Utesch acquired a local guide, Karl Juergen, a semi-retired electrical worker, who offered to navigate. They found an emergency response command post – a fire station bristling with military vehicles – only to receive apologetic shrugs. The uniforms didn’t know where to send them. An hour later the would-be rescuers joined a convoy which splashed to a halt on North Eldridge Parkway. The road ahead was waist-high in water, beyond it marooned housing estates. Finally, action. Except for one problem. Boats had already gone up there and returned empty. Residents didn’t want to leave despite warnings the water would rise another 1.2 metres (4ft). The Louisianians hesitated. Launch, or try elsewhere? “I’ve got a real winning personality,” grinned Brad. “I’ll persuade them to leave.” Wayne and Juergen stayed behind to move the trucks to higher ground while Brad piloted the skiff and Utesch the canoe, skimming through brown, fast-flowing murk. Traffic hydrants could be glimpsed below. Brad rehearsed his spiel: “We’ve come all the way from Louisiana to help you, man.” Utesch planned a blunter pitch: get out before it was too late. They turned into an estate called Twin Lakes: big, fancy houses in mock Tudor and plantation styles. A privileged place to live but for the floodwaters lapping through doorways. The boatmen glided in silence up Tropicana Drive. Some homes still had electricity – the lights were on – but nothing stirred. Some residents had fled before the storm and those that remained were hunkered down. They had no interest in greeting waterborne visitors, let alone hitching a ride. Utesch moored at a porch on a cul-de-sac called Sweet Surrender Court and called out. An elderly woman opened the door a crack and politely shooed him away. When he said the water would rise another 4ft she considered this a moment, then shut the door. “They don’t believe us. They just don’t want to come out,” said Utesch, shaking his head. On Summer Snow Drive Brad encountered a middle-aged couple standing in their garage, monitoring the water level. They too declined help, saying they had moved all essentials to their second floor. The would-be rescuers were crestfallen. “We ain’t doing no damn good right here,” said Utesch. Brad wondered if the homeowners suspected they were looters. They passed other boaters with similar experiences. The few homeowners who were evacuating from this corner of Houston preferred to do so in the back of huge trucks. Back on the highway the two men found Wayne and Juergen and loaded their boats back on to the pickup. “Well, we tried,” said Brad, dejected. “The effort and desire were there, the results weren’t,” said Utesch. The three visitors, 380 miles (611km) from home, had planned on eating cold sandwiches and sleeping in their trucks. Juergen, born and bred Texan, insisted they dine and stay at his home. “It would be my privilege to host you.” The radio spoke of the need for blood donations. Brad perked up. “I’ll do that tonight. I’ll feel like I did something.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/aug/30/anglican-archbishop-supports-marriage-equality-but-will-not-challenge-church","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-30T06:24:45Z","webTitle":"Anglican archbishop of Perth supports marriage equality but will not challenge church","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/aug/30/anglican-archbishop-supports-marriage-equality-but-will-not-challenge-church","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/aug/30/anglican-archbishop-supports-marriage-equality-but-will-not-challenge-church","fields":{"headline":"Anglican archbishop of Perth supports marriage equality but will not challenge church","bodyText":"The newly appointed Anglican archbishop of Perth says she has an “inclusive” approach to marriage equality but will not challenge the stated position of the church. Kay Goldsworthy was among the first group of women ordained to the Anglican priesthood in Australia in 1992, became the first female bishop in 2008, and this week became the first woman elected to the position of archbishop. The appointment was announced on Tuesday and she will officially take up the role on 10 February 2018. She told Guardian Australia she knew what it was like to be at the centre of a debate about the traditions of the church and said that experience could make people “a little more open” to others trapped by those same traditions. But she said everyone within the church, from clergy to parishioners, would have to examine their own beliefs and come to their own conclusions. “The Anglican church’s position is that in Australia marriage is between a man and a woman,” she said. “One man and one woman, to the exclusion of all others, for life. “The more personal kind of position that I might have around these matters is one that is open to a more inclusive position, but that’s not the whole church.” Anglican leaders have been divided in their support for both a plebiscite and the concept of marriage equality. The Sydney archdiocese is one of 80 organisations that formed the Coalition for Marriage, the main plank of the ‘no’ campaign, but the head of the Anglican church in Australia, Melbourne archbishop Philip Freier, said last year the church “must accept” the result of the vote. Goldsworthy said the issue of women joining the clergy was very different to the debate around marriage equality, but equally challenging. “If you have been in one part of these debates perhaps you will be a little more open to others, although that’s not the case for everybody,” she said. “It’s not an easy place for us as a church.” Her progressive stance on marriage equality could reignite tensions with conservative wings of the church, the same quarters that opposed the decision to allow Goldsworthy and other women to become bishops. Both the archdiocese of Sydney and the diocese of north west Australia opposed the introduction of female bishops. Goldsworthy spent 22 years with the church in Perth before being appointed bishop of Gippsland, based in Sale in Victoria’s south-east, in 2014. She was ordained as bishop by her predecessor, Roger Herft, who retired early from his post as archbishop of Perth in December last year after admitting to a hearing of the royal commission into institutional responses to child sex abuse that he had failed child sex abuse victims. Hereft told the commission he was “deeply fooled” by alleged paedophile priest Peter Rushton and failed the victim of another alleged offender “miserably” by allowing the suspect priest to be legally represented by the diocese deputy chancellor and failing to provide pastoral care. Goldsworthy said the church had to work to regain the trust of people disillusioned by its past failures, but that Perth had strong processes in place to ensure transparency. “All of this needs to be very clear and there needs to be a process so that people understand that the church can be a very safe and welcoming place for the small and vulnerable,” she said. “For most of us that is what the church has always been, but that does not take away from what it has not been to others.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2017/aug/31/states-powering-ahead-on-climate-targets-despite-federal-inaction-report-shows","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-30T18:00:08Z","webTitle":"States powering ahead on climate targets despite federal inaction, report shows","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/aug/31/states-powering-ahead-on-climate-targets-despite-federal-inaction-report-shows","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/aug/31/states-powering-ahead-on-climate-targets-despite-federal-inaction-report-shows","fields":{"headline":"States powering ahead on climate targets despite federal inaction, report shows","bodyText":"Australian states and territories are powering ahead, developing policies that will meet the federal government’s internationally agreed greenhouse gas emission targets, with South Australia, the ACT and Tasmania leading the race. Despite being chastised by the federal government for unilateral action, South Australia is leading the race, with the ACT and Tasmania not far behind, according to a report by the Climate Council. Compared on a series of measures including penetration of renewable energy, the percentage of households with solar, as well as emissions and renewable energy targets, the Northern Territory, Western Australia and New South Wales are at the back of the pack, with Victoria and Queensland in the middle. Australia’s greenhouse gas emissions have been rising ever since the Coalition government repealed the carbon tax in 2014. The federal government’s own projections show their policies will cause emissions to continue to rise for decades to come. But in the midst of the ongoing federal policy vacuum, every state and territory besides Western Australia has “gone it alone” and developed strong renewable energy and emissions reduction policies. South Australia leads the country with 47% of its electricity sourced from renewable sources, followed by the ACT at 22%. Tasmania sourced 92% of its electricity from renewable sources, but that was dominated by large-scale hydro electricity. The Northern Territory sourced just 2% of its electricity from renewable sources, sitting behind Western Australia and Queensland at 7%. Victoria sourced 12% from renewables while NSW sat at 17%. Queensland led the country when it comes to solar households, with 32% of homes having solar panels. That just pipped South Australia, which had 31%. While both Western Australia and the Northern Territory scored poorly on most measures, there appeared to be grassroots momentum there for solar rooftops, with the biggest increases in solar penetration over the past year happening in those states. Western Australia jumped almost three percentage points to more than 25% penetration, and the Northern Territory jumped 2.7 percentage points to 11.4% – a figure that was still the lowest in the country. The ACT and Tasmania had the strongest renewable energy targets, with the former aiming to implement a 100% target by 2020 and the latter by 2022. The ACT’s aggressive and bipartisan renewable energy policies delivered the lowest energy costs in the country for consumers. Every state except Western Australia and the Northern Territory had targets to reduce net greenhouse gas emissions to zero by 2050. Those policies, combined with a surge in grassroots activity and market-driven closure of coal power plants, look set to easily cut Australia’s emissions by more 28% below 2005 levels, as Australia committed to following the Paris Agreement in 2015. That was the conclusion of a report by Frontier Economics earlier in the year, which concluded: “The commonwealth government will receive credit for state renewable policies that contribute to meeting the 2030 emissions target, while admonishing them for any energy security issues that may result. “Every state and territory, with the exception of Western Australia, is taking energy and climate policy into their own hands, with strong renewable energy targets or net zero emissions targets in place,” said Climate Council councillor and energy expert Andrew Stock. “States and territories previously lagging (NT, NSW and WA), are now stepping up the pace, joining the enormous progress we’re seeing across the nation,” he said. Climate Council member and former president of BP Australasia, Greg Bourne, said Australians are embracing solar energy in droves, with more than 5.6GW generated on the rooftops of 1.7 million homes. “Australia is one of the sunniest countries in the world, so it’s no surprise we’ve already rolled out enough solar to power the lights at the MCG every day for 20,000 years,” he said. States leading the way without federal coordination was described as a “a messy dog’s breakfast” by the Grattan Institute’s Tony Wood, who went on to say the unilateral state action was “understandable with federal climate change inaction”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/aug/30/george-williams-coalition-uphill-battle-high-court-citizenship-postal-vote","type":"article","sectionId":"law","sectionName":"Law","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-30T05:31:36Z","webTitle":"Coalition warned it has 'uphill battle' in high court over citizenship and postal vote","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/aug/30/george-williams-coalition-uphill-battle-high-court-citizenship-postal-vote","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/aug/30/george-williams-coalition-uphill-battle-high-court-citizenship-postal-vote","fields":{"headline":"Coalition warned it has 'uphill battle' in high court over citizenship and postal vote","bodyText":"The government faces an “uphill battle” in major high court cases dealing with the same-sex marriage postal survey and the eligibility of seven parliamentarians on the current reading of the law, George Williams has warned. In a speech to the National Press Club on Wednesday, the constitutional law expert and University of NSW professor accused the government of “a surprising constitutional adventurism” in testing the limits of its power and relying on a “creative, quite liberal and generous reading of those powers” by the court. In October the high court will hear the cases challenging the eligibility of the deputy prime minister, Barnaby Joyce, the Nationals senator Matt Canavan, the resigned Greens senators Scott Ludlam and Larissa Waters, and the One Nation senator Malcolm Roberts. Nick Xenophon and Fiona Nash will also be referred. Williams said that “on the current law it is difficult to see ... that any of the seven parliamentarians who will face the high court are likely to survive that challenge”. “It is hard to see any of them have taken the reasonable steps that the high court requires to divest themselves of foreign citizenship.” Williams suggested Labor’s Katy Gallagher could also be in difficulty, depending on the high court ruling, and likened citizenship by descent to a “Pandora’s box” that could claim up to “20 or more parliamentarians”. Section 44 of the constitution disqualifies anyone who “is a subject or a citizen or entitled to the rights or privileges of a subject or a citizen of a foreign power” from sitting in parliament. The Turnbull government insists it has strong legal advice from the solicitor general that the better view of the law is that some element of intention or acquiescence to foreign citizenship is required. Williams warned that view was based on William Dean’s dissent in the case of Sykes v Cleary and it was “exceedingly rare” for a later court to adopt a dissenting view. Another possible reading – to exclude only those members who have foreign citizenship by birth – had no support in the constitution, he said. Williams said Joyce’s and the Greens’ eligibility problems “speak less of a constitutional problem ... and more of complacency and poor vetting” by political parties. He cited a simple check he had performed online to confirm a person in Joyce’s situation was a New Zealand citizen by descent. “In this case it is hard to see why the high court would fashion an exemption when candidates have been warned of this problem and when the information is very easy to obtain through a simple check on the internet.” Williams described Malcolm Turnbull’s confidence that the high court will find Joyce eligible as “misplaced”. Williams said section 44 was out of date, arguing it was “hardly consistent with our sovereignty, our stability as a democracy” to allow eligibility for parliament to be determined by other countries’ laws. On the same-sex marriage postal ballot, Williams said the government was pursuing a non-binding, non-compulsory survey “against the normal understanding of our systems, [and] the clear wishes of parliament”. The high court will hear two challenges to the postal survey next week that will both argue the government cannot appropriate $122m for the postal survey. Williams noted the finance minister does have the power to make an advance “where there is an urgent need for expenditure and because the expenditure was unforeseen”. “Now both of those things are hard, I think, to make out here. Urgency perhaps but urgency because of the government’s own political priorities but not for other reasons. Unforeseen? We have been debating this for some time.” Williams said the government faced “an uphill battle on the state of the law as it currently stands”. He said it was “unlikely the court will permit the government a back door” to the clear line of authority in the chaplains program cases that the federal government requires parliamentary approval to spend taxpayer money “in almost all circumstances”. Williams said he did not have definitive answers or claim he could predict the high court outcomes, but said in both cases the government was “running clearly against the grain of high court authority”. Williams’ speech comes after the education minister, Simon Birmingham, dismissed the central claim of the first no campaign advertisement – that it would affect gender education of children – as a “furphy”. The Coalition for Marriage ad has already been attacked by Bill Shorten and on Wednesday Fairfax Media reported the principal of the school of one of the mothers contradicted her personal account given in the ad. The report revealed the mother warning claiming her son’s schools had told him “he could wear a dress to school next year if he wanted” is Cella White, an outspoken critic of the Safe Schools anti-bullying program. But the principal of her son’s school, Frankston High, John Albiston, reportedly said he had checked with teachers and the incident “never happened”. “I have never had any complaints that we advised the boys they could wear dresses. We didn’t offer them that option.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/aug/30/pro-marriage-equality-christians-attack-tv-ad-pushing-no-campaign","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-30T06:07:49Z","webTitle":"Pro-marriage equality Christians attack TV ad pushing no campaign","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/aug/30/pro-marriage-equality-christians-attack-tv-ad-pushing-no-campaign","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/aug/30/pro-marriage-equality-christians-attack-tv-ad-pushing-no-campaign","fields":{"headline":"Pro-marriage equality Christians attack TV ad pushing no campaign","bodyText":"A group of pro-equality Christians have attacked a new anti same-sex marriage advertisement as irresponsible, while distancing themselves from the Australian Christian Lobby and Lyle Shelton, who they say “doesn’t speak for most Christians”. The Australian Christians for Marriage Equality launched its same-sex marriage campaign on Wednesday, bringing together Catholics, Anglicans, members of the Uniting Church and others. The group describes itself as a voice for grassroots Christians, the majority of whom support same-sex marriage, according to polling by the Equality Campaign. They launched their campaign in Paddington Uniting Church on Oxford Street in Sydney, expressing frustration at the intransigence of church leaders. Speaking at the launch, an Anglican minister, Reverend Keith Mascord, said people like Shelton did not speak for the Christian majority. “He speaks for some but he doesn’t speak for us,” Mascord said. “He doesn’t speak for most Christians, he doesn’t speak for the demographic that said yes – 65% of Roman Catholics – so he’s not speaking for people of faith.” Mascord was joined at the launch by Australian Catholics for Equality member Benjamin Oh, Uniting Church minister Ben Gilmour and the commentator and activist Julie McCrossin. They condemned the anti same-sex marriage ad aired nationally on Tuesday night, which linked marriage equality with a Melbourne school supposedly telling a boy he could wear a dress. The ad was commissioned by the ACL-led Coalition for Marriage group. Its suggestion of widespread changes in schools have been rubbished as “patently ridiculous” by the education minister, Simon Birmingham, while the story about the boy and the dress has been disputed by the school principal involved, according to Fairfax Media. Oh said his group was focused on engaging in a respectful debate and trying to promote the Christian values of equality, love and compassion. “Then we have groups like that. They’re powerful, with lots of money to spend on this big flashy ad,” Oh said. “We don’t have that. But we have the people with us, the people of God, the Christians, the majority, who are voting yes.” Mascord, whose ministry licence has not be renewed by the Anglican church, also condemned the ad, saying the group abhorred it. “To put out an ad that links same-sex marriage, or marriage equality, with the Safe Schools program is for me, I think, an admission of failure,” he said. “Not looking at the substance of the debate but fear-mongering. It’s irresponsible and wrong.” The group dismissed any notion that freedom of religion would be impinged by the change to the Marriage Act – concerns that have been expressed by the former prime minister Tony Abbott and others in the Coalition. Oh described the freedom of religion issue as a “red herring”. “We’re talking about the Marriage Act. The fact that you’re pulling in all these other issues, it’s a red herring, it’s trying to scare,” he said. “We’re asking for a simple question to be answered – should same-sex couple be allowed to be married?”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2017/aug/30/terry-pratchett-unfinished-novels-destroyed-streamroller","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-30T05:01:19Z","webTitle":"Terry Pratchett's unfinished novels destroyed by steamroller","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/aug/30/terry-pratchett-unfinished-novels-destroyed-streamroller","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2017/aug/30/terry-pratchett-unfinished-novels-destroyed-streamroller","fields":{"headline":"Terry Pratchett's unfinished novels destroyed by steamroller","bodyText":"The unfinished books of Sir Terry Pratchett have been destroyed by a steamroller, following the late fantasy novelist’s wishes. Pratchett’s hard drive was crushed by a vintage John Fowler &amp; Co steamroller named Lord Jericho at the Great Dorset Steam Fair, ahead of the opening of a new exhibition about the author’s life and work. Pratchett, famous for his colourful and satirical Discworld series, died in March 2015 after a long battle with Alzheimer’s disease. After his death, fellow fantasy author Neil Gaiman, Pratchett’s close friend and collaborator , told the Times that Pratchett had wanted “whatever he was working on at the time of his death to be taken out along with his computers, to be put in the middle of a road and for a steamroller to steamroll over them all”. On Friday, Rob Wilkins, who manages the Pratchett estate, tweeted from an official Twitter account that he was “about to fulfil my obligation to Terry” along with a picture of an intact computer hard drive – following up with a tweet that showed the hard drive in pieces. The symbolism of the moment, which captured something of Pratchett’s unique sense of humour, was not lost on fans, who responded on Twitter with a wry melancholy, though some people expressed surprise that the author – who had previously discussed churning through computer hardware at a rapid rate – would have stored his unfinished work on an apparently older model of hard drive. The hard drive will go on display as part of a major exhibition about the author’s life and work, Terry Pratchett: HisWorld, which opens at the Salisbury museum in September. The author of over 70 novels, Pratchett was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease in 2007. He became an advocate for assisted dying, giving a moving lecture on the subject, Shaking Hands With Death, in 2010, and presenting a documentary for the BBC called Terry Pratchett: Choosing to Die. He continued to write and publish, increasingly with the assistance of others, until his death in 2015. Two novels were published posthumously: The Long Utopia (a collaboration with Stephen Baxter) and The Shepherd’s Crown, the final Discworld novel. The Salisbury museum exhibition will run from 16 September until 13 January 2018."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"membership/2017/sep/02/celebrating-wildlife-week-in-pictures","type":"article","sectionId":"membership","sectionName":"Membership","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-02T10:25:38Z","webTitle":"Celebrating wildlife in pictures","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/membership/2017/sep/02/celebrating-wildlife-week-in-pictures","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/membership/2017/sep/02/celebrating-wildlife-week-in-pictures","fields":{"headline":"Celebrating wildlife in pictures","bodyText":"Every week the Guardian’s environment desk publishes the week in wildlife on theguardian.com. This picture gallery, featuring the best flora and fauna shots from around the world, has a loyal readership, garnering tens of thousands of views every week. Here, we chat to Eric Hilaire, the Guardian picture editor who has compiled the gallery since it launched eight years ago. How did you become the editor of the week in wildlife gallery? When I joined the Guardian 17 years ago, I worked mainly on The Editor, a weekly media digest that we printed in the paper. Back then, it was still the first generation of the web, so galleries were quite complex to build and great images hard to find. With my background in digital photography, I helped launch a daily gallery on news-related images called “24 hours in pictures”, and combined this with work as a picture editor on the science desk. So when, nine years later, the newly-established environment section was looking for someone to take on pictures, I was perhaps a natural choice. How did the week in wildlife come about? I still recall the conversation in which the editors came up with the concept. It was to be launched alongside and as part of the new environment section, and it had a few basic rules: 1) It must contain images from the last week unless referencing a news story about an event that occurred previous to that; 2) It must contain a selection of sharp, high quality images; 3) Those images should be a celebration of wildlife, so no domesticated animals or animals in captivity. The title “the week in wildlife” has always amused me because wildlife doesn’t adhere to a weekly schedule at all. A week just doesn’t exist in nature! And the idea of imposing that measure of time on animals or plants is quite ludicrous, but I suppose it makes it easier for those of us more accustomed to working in weekly cycles. Where do you find the images each week? In terms of finding the selection of photos that match this criteria every week, that’s often an interesting challenge. When the week in wildlife first started, we would often use amateur photographers, but we moved to using professionals who are paid for their work. So lots of the great amateur shots are now sent to GuardianWitness instead, and these days we source a lot of images from press agencies scientific journals, and receive several hundred submissions from NGOs such as Greenpeace, charities such as the Zoological society, and conservation societies such as the National Trust, in addition to a handful of ad hoc submissions from individual photographers. Which animal crops up most frequently? Surprisingly, the animal who crops up time and time again in my inbox is the panda — a creature not only endangered, but almost never found in the wild outside of a single province of China. I have a theory about this. When the WWF was set up in the 60s, they chose the panda on their logo, and it quickly became a symbol of the conservation movement. Simultaneously, China stood up and took action against the destruction of bamboo forests and put huge resources into protection projects. Soon, an animal who had for so long feared for its habitat became the symbol of new China. In the fight to save wildlife, a picture can have a very real impact – it’s just a pity more hasn’t been done for other endangered species. Why do you think readers respond to the week in wildlife? The week in wildlife has enjoyed a warm, vocal and very loyal readership since its genesis. And if you don’t get the species or location right in a picture caption, they’re always on hand to make sure you find out quickly! The comments we get from our readers are testament to how much they love it. This gallery is a sanctuary from the rest of the news cycle – here the drama is mainly only to be found in the subject’s beauty. There’s something about wildlife photography that brings out the personality behind the lens as well as in front of it. Often the photographer will have waited hours or days to be able to get a great shot, and they’re delighted when the payoff is worth it. And no two images are the same. That enthusiasm and precision really shines through. What about flowers and plantlife? There is often flora to complement the fauna – the discovery of a new plant species, a plant captured growing against all odds in the middle of a desert, a plant suffering at the hands of pollution – but the animals still take centre stage. We also see shots of insects. More and more, we see images taken with remotely-operated camera traps, drones or specialised underwater cameras, so the scope for subject matter is expanding all the time, but the animals are still what seem to capture readers’ imaginations. Do you enjoy editing the gallery? The subject is an endless mine of beauty and intrigue, so it’s a joy for me and my colleagues to compile each week. Indeed, the hardest part of my job is being selective – it can be really heartbreaking to exclude an image from that week’s gallery, but it’s often necessary in order to achieve variety and create a visual narrative that works. I’d love to see more images with a positive story to tell – more happy orangutans and images of vaquitas (a very rare species of porpoise), for example. So many news stories have one defining image that tells the story, but that just isn’t the case with wildlife – the truth is rich and complex and ongoing – and communicating that is part of our motive. I’m always pleased to see action shots rather than straightforward portraits and, where possible, images with a message. After all, with trafficking, deforestation, pollution and poaching showing no signs of slowing down, animals have never faced such numerous threats as they do today, and part of celebrating their existence is also acknowledging their fragility.

Most people agree with that principle, and that’s why the Federal Communications Commission passed the incredibly popular net neutrality rules in 2015. The Trump administration’s political appointees are attempting to roll these protections back. You’ve got less than 24 hours left to make your voice heard. Net neutrality is the general principle that all content and information on the internet should be treated equally by internet service providers (ISPs) such as Comcast or Verizon. Once you pay for access to the internet, ISPs should not be able to block or throttle traffic to particular websites, or allow for “paid prioritization” that speeds up websites at the expense of others. For example, Comcast – which is owned by NBCUniversal – shouldn’t be able to decide one day to slow down your connection to Netflix to benefit a competing streaming service like Hulu. Net neutrality promotes innovation and competition, protects free speech and prevents censorship. Under current FCC policy, there are strong protections in place that ensure exactly that. Thanks to a strong grassroots movement, buoyed by dozens of civil society groups and a now famous segment by John Oliver that implored citizens to contact the FCC, the agency received millions of comments in 2014 in of support of creating net neutrality rules to protect the rights of internet users to access all content in a free and open manner. Despite initial worries that the Obama administration would cave to pressure from the telecom giants, the FCC instead issued a landmark ruling, re-classifying ISPs under what is known as “title II” authority, which gave the FCC the power to treat ISPs like public utilities and prevent them from prioritizing their own content or throttling internet speeds of certain websites over others. There are few government regulations that are more popular than the FCC’s net neutrality rules. A poll conducted just last week showed that 60% of the public supported the FCC’s net neutrality rules, while only 17% opposed them. And as the Hill noted, that support is strong across the political spectrum: “61% of voters who identify as Democrats are either strongly or somewhat in favor of the rules,” they wrote, “and among Republicans that number is 59%.” But the popularity of strong rights on the internet has never stopped Republicans from dismantling them in the past. It was just a few months ago that the entire congressional Republican party voted to give ISPs the power to sell internet users’ browsing history, which virtually no one in the entire country wanted except for powerful corporations like AT&amp;T. The same scenario may play out at the FCC if Trump appointee and new agency chairman Ajit Pai has his way. Pai has dubbed the FCC’s new proposal to roll back the Obama-era net neutrality rules the Restoring Internet Freedom Act, ostensibly trying to confuse consumers into supporting a proposal that certainly will leave corporations with vastly more power to control how we consume information online. Fight for the Future, one of the advocacy organizations leading the fight to submit millions more comments to the FCC this time around, has even plastered billboards up in at least nine in congressional districts across the country calling out congressmen who support the FCC’s plan. But given the Republican control of the FCC and Congress, it remains an uphill fight. Right now there’s less than 24 hours left to let your feelings be known to the FCC. Quartz wrote up a handy guide for how to submit a comment. The FCC closes its comment process at midnight eastern time on Wednesday night, so make sure to submit your comment today."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"us-news/2017/aug/30/rightwing-alliance-unions-defund-defang","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-30T09:00:26Z","webTitle":"Rightwing alliance plots assault to 'defund and defang' America's unions","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/aug/30/rightwing-alliance-unions-defund-defang","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/aug/30/rightwing-alliance-unions-defund-defang","fields":{"headline":"Rightwing alliance plots assault to 'defund and defang' America's unions","bodyText":"Rightwing activists across the US have launched a nationwide campaign to undermine progressive politicians by depriving them of a major source of support and funding – public sector unions. A network of conservative thinktanks with outposts in all 50 states has embarked on a “breakthrough” campaign designed to strike a “mortal blow” against the American left. The aim is to “defund and defang” unions representing government employees as the first step towards ensuring the permanent collapse of progressive politics. The campaign carries a powerful echo of the populist creed espoused by Donald Trump. The president was propelled into the White House last November after unexpected victories in several previously Democratic rust belt states including Michigan and Wisconsin, both of which have endured withering attacks on trade unions in recent years. The new assault is being spearheaded by the State Policy Network (SPN), an alliance of 66 state-based thinktanks, or “ideas factories” as it calls them, with a combined annual budget of $80m. As suggested by its slogan – “State solutions. National impact” – the group outlines an aim to construct a rightwing hegemony throughout the US, working from the bottom up. To do that, it first has to sweep aside the public sector unions and their historic ties to Democratic and progressive politicians. In a 10-page fundraising letter, part of a set of documents obtained by the Center for Media and Democracy and published by the Guardian today for the first time, SPN sets out its mission in frank language that does not disguise its partisan ambitions. The author of the letter, SPN’s president and CEO Tracie Sharp,describes the $8m “breakthrough” campaign as a “once-in-a-lifetime chance to reverse the failed policies of the American left … We are primed, right now, to deliver the mortal blow to permanently break its stranglehold on our society.” Sharp pitches the battle against unions as the start of a war on progressive politics, with the ultimate goal of winning elections for rightwing candidates. “Big government unions are the biggest sources of funding and political muscle for the left – and a major obstacle to the ability of voters to reclaim control of American government. To win the battle for freedom, we must take the fight to the unions, state by state.” The target of such union-bashing, she openly admits, is to “defund and defang one of our freedom movement’s most powerful opponents, the government unions”. The long-term objective is to “deal a major blow to the left’s ability to control government at the state and national levels. I’m talking about permanently depriving the left from access to millions of dollars in dues extracted from unwilling union members every election cycle” (emphasis in original). SPN will be discussing its anti-union and anti-left agenda on Wednesday at its annual meeting in San Antonio, Texas. Its morning session will look at how “labor reform” can be pursued with renewed vigor under the Trump administration. The discussion will feature some of the key architects of SPN’s political strategy, including Vincent Vernuccio who pioneered anti-union legislation in Michigan, and Tom McCabe of the Freedom Foundation, who has sent his foot soldiers on an aggressive offensive against collective bargaining in the US north-west. Mary Bottari, deputy director of the Center for Media and Democracy (CMD) which tracks the rise of rightwing groups in America, said the fundraising letter and other SPN documents published by the Guardian cast light on the conservative game plan. “It’s very rare to catch conservative thinktanks talking so openly and blatantly about their long-term political aims. These documents reveal to us that SPN’s goals are entirely political – they have no concern for workers or union members, their only goal is winning elections to advance rightwing causes.” Bottari added: “An $80m campaign to ‘defund and defang’ public sector unions is remarkable, both in its size and in its ambition.” Public sector unions have come under growing fire from conservatives in recent years. While unions operating in private companies have been diminished since the 1980s – their membership plummeting from about 17% of the workforce in 1983 to just 6% today – their equivalents in the public sector such as teacher, local government, police and fire officer unions have remained relatively stable, at around 35%. But in 2010, Scott Walker, the newly elected governor of Wisconsin, opened a new front in America’s partisan war when he passed Act 10, stripping public sector unions of the power to bargain collectively and forcing them to re-certify themselves every year with electoral backing from more than 50% of all workers, not just those voting. The move has spawned a rash of imitations across Republican-controlled states, with Iowa and Indiana passing similar laws, and a further 15 states introducing legislation – encouraged by SPN, which has framed a model bill to make it easier for Republican legislators to adopt the changes. A total of 28 states have also passed “right to work” laws that allow workers in private companies to refuse to join unions despite enjoying the fruits of collective bargaining. Though the long-term consequences of such union restrictions have yet to be fully understood, there are early indications that the impact could be profound even at presidential level. Since Act 10 came into effect in Wisconsin, public sector union membership has slumped by 40%, or about 136,000 people. Trump won Wisconsin last November by just 23,000 votes. A similar pattern can be seen in Michigan where unions have shrunk steadily since a right-to-work law came into effect in 2013, with a loss of at least 30,000 members. Trump took Michigan, to the shock of Hillary Clinton and her supporters, by just 11,000 votes. When asked whether anti-union laws in Michigan and Wisconsin had affected the outcome of the presidential race, Matt Patterson of the conservative group Americans for Tax Reform said: “No question in my mind. Hard to fight when your bazooka’s been replaced by a squirt gun.” Carrie Conko, SPN’s vice president of communications, said that the network does not involve itself in political campaigns. “Labor reform is an issue where SPN has been clearly on the side of workers who are against forced unionization and the use of their hard-earned wages to support causes they don’t believe in. If workers choose to support their unions agenda that is fine – but, right now, in many states they don’t have a choice or a voice.” Conko’s statement echoed the language used in an SPN “toolkit”, also published here for the first time, that advises Republican policymakers on how to campaign for anti-union legislation. “Be pro-worker, not anti-union,” the pamphlet says. “Frame union reform from the point of view of the members and how the reform helps them have a greater voice in their union. Don’t rant against unions. We’ve all been frustrated by the actions of public sector unions to block pro-freedom reforms, but publicly venting these feelings is counterproductive.” SPN’s disclosure of its political and partisan objectives in the new documents could arouse the interest of investigators from the Internal Revenue Service. The group is constituted as a 501(c)(3) organisation, which renders it exempt as a charity from taxation. Marc Owens, a partner with Loeb &amp; Loeb who worked as an IRS lawyer specializing in charitable tax exemptions, said that the provision was designed for charitable purposes, not for lobbying against public sector unions or for activities to influence the outcome of elections. “A charity that does those things is not engaging in charitable activities and that puts its tax exempt status in jeopardy,” he said. Conko told the Guardian that SPN takes “great care to be fully in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2017/aug/30/health-implications-texas-floods-hurrican-harvey","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-30T10:00:14Z","webTitle":"Sewage, debris, mosquitoes: flood waters increase health risk for Harvey victims","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/aug/30/health-implications-texas-floods-hurrican-harvey","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/aug/30/health-implications-texas-floods-hurrican-harvey","fields":{"headline":"Sewage, debris, mosquitoes: flood waters increase health risk for Harvey victims","bodyText":"Tropical storm Harvey continues to threaten lives in Houston, where officials are focused on evacuating hospitals and securing life-saving emergency transportation, knowing they face long-term health threats. “Our number one priority now,” said Chris Van Deusen, a clearly frayed spokesperson for the Texas Department of State Health Services, is “to make sure hospital patients and those with medical needs are taken care of.” Flood water – a nasty cocktail of chemicals, heavy metals, sewage, debris and wildlife – was still pouring into people’s homes on Tuesday. Social media overflowed with images of people being rescued via jet ski, canoe and fishing boat. Twelve hospitals in the Houston area were evacuated by Tuesday. Some emergency medical services were coming back online in Corpus Christi and Victoria. “Aside from just the general public health functions, we also help coordinate medical transportation, assisting and coordinating and evacuating hospitals,” said Van Deusen. “We have been moving ambulances, ambulance buses, and we’re staging some helicopters,” he said. Public health researchers who focus on long-range impacts watched the catastrophe with disbelief. Before the flood, Houston already had problems. Flood waters seemed to only exacerbate potential dangers. “Words just can’t describe it,” said Garrett Sansom, an environmental health scientist at Texas A&amp;M University. “We’ve been trying to wrap our heads around a unified response as researchers, but also the communities we work with have been hit the hardest.” Houston was already affected by inequality and healthcare disparities. The Manchester neighborhood in Houston is what Samson described as a “classic environmental justice” area – a Latino neighborhood on the Houston shipping channel where petrochemical plants surround houses and most people speak Spanish. “Barium is ubiquitous in the area because of refineries, as well as arsenic and mercury,” said Sansom. “All of that is going to be in potential of coming into contact with humans. There’s sort of the complex chemical mixture.” Wildlife can also become a sudden danger. Standing water left after the flood recedes will leave an ideal breeding ground for mosquitoes – which were already a pest in Houston. “I can’t emphasize the vector-borne disease issue,” said Dr Gerald Parker, as associate dean at Texas A&amp;M who served for 36 years in disaster response for the federal government. Mosquito-borne diseases, he said, are “just something I’m really concerned about”. Zika captures the most headlines of any mosquito-spread diseases, but it’s far from the only one. The same Houston-endemic mosquitoes transmit dengue and chikungunya, infections characterized by fever. Other mosquito species spread West Nile virus, which can be dangerous for the elderly and health compromised. Flood waters have also delivered fire ants to front doors, and Sansom warned flooded houses can become a home for venomous snakes such as water moccasins. Water-borne and person-to-person infections can also easily spread after a disaster. Overwhelmed sewer systems bring people into contact with disease-spreading bacteria. Stomach illnesses are common following floods, public health officials said. “The main thing that people have to watch out for is gastrointestinal infections,” said Dr Rick Watkins, an infectious disease doctor who studied waterborne diseases following Hurricane Katrina. “Those are going to be because of the disruption of the sewage systems and, unfortunately, the drinking water is going to be contaminated.” About 300 public water systems were in the path of tropical storm Harvey, according to the US Environmental Protection Agency. Texas environmental protection officials said it is still unclear which systems might be contaminated. “We do not have that information yet,” said a secretary at the Texas commission on environmental quality, before hanging up. Close quarters in shelters can also create an ideal environment for the spread of illnesses such as norovirus, a stomach bug that causes severe diarrhea. Because of poor sanitary conditions, hepatitis A and hepatitis E have the potential to spread. “It’s really unprecedented the flooding and the people displaced,” said Parker. “We still don’t have a number on that yet.” The most important, and perhaps most difficult recommendation from Sansom, was to avoid the flood water. “Everything, unfortunately, is contaminated and has been exposed,” he said. “Returning to the home, you really need to exercise a lot precautions.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/aug/29/north-korea-missiles-fire-fury-japan-delegitimise-kim-jong-un","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-29T18:27:15Z","webTitle":"North Korea’s missiles can be stopped – but not by ‘fire and fury’ | John Nilsson-Wright","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/aug/29/north-korea-missiles-fire-fury-japan-delegitimise-kim-jong-un","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/aug/29/north-korea-missiles-fire-fury-japan-delegitimise-kim-jong-un","fields":{"headline":"North Korea’s missiles can be stopped – but not by ‘fire and fury’","bodyText":"North Korea’s provocative launch of a missile over Japanese territory is a brutal reminder of Japan’s strategic vulnerability and the limited options for its prime minister, Shinzo Abe, in combating the growing nuclear and ballistic threat from Pyongyang. Abe’s characterisation of the launch as an “unprecedentedly grave and serious threat” captures both the tension of the situation and the intense irritation and frustration of the Japanese government. For the Japanese public, who have only twice before (in 1998 and 2009) had to confront the deeply unsettling experience of North Korean missiles overflying their territory, the latest threat ratchets up the sense of anxiety. In recent weeks, the Abe administration has warned of missiles carrying chemical weapons striking Japanese cities, and issued civil defence and evacuation guidelines to local authorities. To ordinary Japanese, North Korea represents a clear and present danger and an implacable and unpredictable adversary – a threat underlined not only by its expanding WMD capability but also by Pyongyang’s role in the 1970s and 80s in abducting scores of Japanese civilians and then refusing to reveal their fate. Fear of the North will intensify the pressure on Abe as he faces a sharp slump in his domestic approval ratings following a series of damaging corruption scandals. Yet there are limits to what he can do. Japan is a staunch backer of the new round of tougher UN sanctions, and only in the past few days has unveiled its own expanded sanctions – targeting secondary trade between Chinese and Namibian organisations and the North. But it is doubtful that these sanctions will deter Pyongyang from continuing with its missile tests, and at best they may end up imposing pain on ordinary North Koreans rather than its military. Military options for Tokyo are also of questionable value. Japan’s Patriot weapons system is designed to stop missiles aimed at Japanese cities in their final descent, rather than flying over the country – perhaps a reason why no decision was taken to shoot down today’s missile. Even if Tokyo had the weapons, a failure to bring down the target would undermine the country’s limited deterrent capability – further emboldening the North Koreans. Some Japanese politicians and defence planners have recently argued that Japan should acquire cruise missiles and the satellite technology to strike at the North’s missile launchers, either pre-emptively or in the early stages of a potential attack. However, such a move is at best a long-term solution, taking years, requiring substantial financial investment, and of questionable constitutional legitimacy. This leaves Abe with the diplomatic route – probably the most promising. Japan of course has been here before. In 2002 and 2004, prime minister Junichiro Koizumi took the bold step of visiting Pyongyang for direct talks with North Korea’s leader Kim Jong-il, the father of Kim Jong-un. The 2002 Pyongyang Declaration offered the prospect of a normalised relationship, with Japan offering substantial economic aid in return for the resolution of the abduction issue and an end to the North’s missile testing. In the aftermath of today’s test, Abe has made it clear that there is no room for dialogue with the North (a recognition of the political realities both in Japan and in other capitals). Ultimately, however, talking will need to be part of any long-term solution, perhaps once the North feels secure in its nuclear deterrent capabilities – the insurance card that will guarantee its long-term survival, and the most obvious reason for its single-minded determination to keep testing. At this point, Kim may believe that his secondary goal of promoting economic development can be achieved by trading a missile testing moratorium for a relaxation of international sanctions. There are then some carrots that could be offered to the North (both by Japan and potentially other nations) to encourage it to change course. The problem for now is that the sticks that are being deployed, whether economic sanctions or Donald Trump’s rhetorical threat of “fire and fury” (apparently discounted by Kim, who has shown himself willing to call the US president’s bluff), are not working. Military brinkmanship and Trump’s attempt to draw strategic “red lines” over US territory, such as Guam, are not stopping the North from improving its missile and nuclear capabilities. Japan will need to work closely with the US and South Korea to explore new options for dealing with the North: reiterating the economic benefits to the North from diplomatic normalisation, but also stressing the increased isolation that will arise from further provocations – perhaps via efforts by the international community to delegitimise Kim’s leadership and the sovereignty and independent status of the North Korea state. It may prove unsuccessful, but threatening the long-term survival of the Kim dynasty may be the best last-course option to force Pyongyang’s leadership to rethink. • Dr John Nilsson-Wright is a senior research fellow for the Asia Programme at Chatham House and senior lecturer in Japanese politics and international relations at the University of Cambridge"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"football/2017/aug/29/tottenham-hotspur-serge-aurier-psg-transfer-deadline","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-29T21:22:29Z","webTitle":"Tottenham move for PSG full-back Serge Aurier held up by work permit issue","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/aug/29/tottenham-hotspur-serge-aurier-psg-transfer-deadline","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/aug/29/tottenham-hotspur-serge-aurier-psg-transfer-deadline","fields":{"headline":"Tottenham move for PSG full-back Serge Aurier held up by work permit issue","bodyText":"Mauricio Pochettino is primed to complete an £8m move for the Estudiantes central defender Juan Foyth but he has been left waiting over Tottenham Hotspur’s work permit application for another defensive target – the Paris Saint-Germain right-back Serge Aurier. Tottenham have agreed a fee of €25m (£23m) for Aurier and personal terms with the player but the deal hinges on resolving the issues that relate to the criminal conviction he received in France last year. The 24-year-old Ivory Coast international was given a suspended two-month prison sentence for the assault of a police officer outside a Paris nightclub. The sentence was “convertible” which means that, in such cases, the offender is more likely to do community service and pay a heavier fine. Aurier protested his innocence and he appealed – the outcome of which remains unknown. Spurs have applied to the Home Office for the clearance Aurier needs to enter the United Kingdom and they have still to hear the decision. The Home Office says each such case is dealt with on an individual basis. Aurier missed a Champions League game at Arsenal last season after he was denied permission to enter the country because of his conviction. Pochettino has tracked the 19-year-old Foyth during the summer but it had appeared PSG were in the driving seat to sign him. But Pochettino made a personal intervention to convince his fellow Argentinian to sign for Tottenham. Pochettino has moved Kevin Wimmer out to Stoke City for £18m and loaned 19-year-old Cameron Carter-Vickers to Sheffield United. But Foyth will compete with the club record signing, Davinson Sánchez, in central defence – together with Toby Alderweireld and Jan Vertonghen while Eric Dier can also play in the position."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2017/sep/05/donald-trump-why-do-evangelicals-support-him","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-05T07:00:35Z","webTitle":"Donald Trump is no saint, but I know why evangelicals love him","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/sep/05/donald-trump-why-do-evangelicals-support-him","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/sep/05/donald-trump-why-do-evangelicals-support-him","fields":{"headline":"Donald Trump is no saint, but I know why evangelicals love him","bodyText":"As a recovering Christaholic, 12 years sober from God, I’ve been asked before to explain why evangelicals stick with Donald Trump. After all, his attempts at appearing Christian are hopelessly pretentious, he’s bragged about his sins, and has built a career on casinos and half-naked women. Then Trump’s infamous “many sides” remark about the violence at the Charlottesville, Virginia, rally brought denunciations from former supporters and business leaders, leading to two of his business advisory councils disbanding. But his evangelical advisory board remained intact. So the questions of why come again. The easy answer is: Evangelicals know he’s not a real Christian, but they’re pragmatic about overturning Roe v Wade, and generally agree with his economic plan of deregulation, lowering taxes, and keeping undocumented immigrants out. “I don’t think that he’s a believer, but he cares about evangelicals,” said Jay Eike, an evangelical Christian and Trump supporter from Broomfield, Colorado, who was gracious enough to give a rare interview to the untrustworthy media – me. “The tweeting drives me crazy. But evangelicals think his policies are more important [than his behavior].” Evangelicals knew that Reagan wasn’t really one of them, but he still became their political Moses. George W Bush had possibly lived an even more debauched life than Trump, but those revelations only helped cement his image as a prodigal son who got sober and raised a family. But beyond the pragmatism and the eagerness to forgive things like “locker-room talk”, I believe that evangelicals recognize a fellow outsider in Trump, someone not only unafraid to shake things up and offend people, but actively goes out of his way to do it. “One of the reasons I support him is he doesn’t say what’s politically correct,” Jerry Falwell Jr, Liberty University president and today’s face of political evangelicalism, said on ABC This Week, when commenting on Trump’s outrage-inspiring response to the white supremacist rally in Charlottesville. To evangelicals, pissing off liberals and defending unpopular opinions makes Trump appear more like one of them. Getting a negative reaction from liberals When I was a young evangelical Christian, I was eager to be oppressed for my faith. The Bible and my pastors had warned me to avoid “worldly” people – celebrities, intellectuals, scientists, the media and liberals. Those were the ones who forbid us from praying in school while indoctrinating us with communism and evolution. Jesus once said: “Blessed are you when they revile and persecute you, and say all kinds of evil against you falsely for My sake. Rejoice and be exceedingly glad, for great is your reward in heaven.” So I went out of my way to piss people off – telling the goth kids they were prisoners of Satan’s lies, handing anti-abortion literature to the “loose” girls, and forcing science class to run late while I debated evolution with the teacher. My entire identity became wrapped up in being disliked by a specific group of people, and they were happy to accommodate me. Trump has had no problem arousing hatred from those same “worldly people”, creating what appears to some like an imploding presidency, while others see a heroic martyr against liberalism. “I never used to watch [political news] much, but when he started campaigning I was watching it,” Eike said. “I’ve been thoroughly angry at the media. I was pleased to see him put them in their place. It was refreshing.” You can hear the frustration in Eike’s voice when he brings up the sports announcer Robert Lee, whom ESPN removed from a Virginia football game over the similarity of his name to the Confederate general. It’s the sound of the disdain for political correctness, shared by white evangelicals from coast to coast, that Trump taps into every time he outrages liberals on their behalf. After nearly eight months in office, it’s becoming clear that many of Trump’s actions are not ideologically based, but designed to inspire maximum outrage from climate-scientists, academics, feminists, LGBTQ rights activists – pretty much every demographic that evangelicals hate. Whether he’s banning transgender soldiers from serving in the military, pardoning a vigilante sheriff, or refusing to properly distance himself from white supremacists, it’s not about the act itself, it’s about the negative reaction he gets from liberals. A sense of persecution You’ll never get anything done in government with this approach, but that’s not the point. Just as the point of my witnessing to the lost souls of my public high school wasn’t to convert them to Christianity, it was to see how persecuted I could be. Which is a remarkably addictive sensation, one that became a competitive game for me and my fellow young believers. My youth-group friends and I would share stories of being punched, spit on, or called “the biggest loser in school” the way other kids would brag about sports or sexual conquests. Just as Morrissey fans discovered loneliness to be a fashionable accessory, we wanted to emulate the sociopathy of our messiah, who said in the book of John: “If the world hates you, know that it hated Me before it hated you.” Justified or not, white evangelical Christians increasingly believe they are the most persecuted demographic in the US today. But I don’t believe that evangelicals are interested in rectifying their status as a hated demographic, and would never protest for better treatment (or consciously demonize any racial minority the way the white supremacists do). For them, being despised by the world is a badge of honor that will ensure them a heavenly reward. And Trump’s sinking approval numbers only endears him to them all the more. They’re angling for an agenda to be passed, but in the meantime, all the Meryl Streep speeches, New Yorker cover drawings and Hillary Clinton memoirs are only going to make evangelical voters dig their heels in deeper come 2020. “I believe we’re on the right side of history,” Eike said. “Trump came into this opposed to the whole Washington establishment. They have bogged him down and are trying to destroy him. But he’s holding them back. The crybabies.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2017/aug/29/lancashire-liam-livingstone-double-century-warwickshire","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-29T19:22:53Z","webTitle":"Lancashire’s Liam Livingstone hits double century against Warwickshire","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/aug/29/lancashire-liam-livingstone-double-century-warwickshire","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/aug/29/lancashire-liam-livingstone-double-century-warwickshire","fields":{"headline":"Lancashire’s Liam Livingstone hits double century against Warwickshire","bodyText":"The sense that Liam Livingstone is a rare talent who will end up playing all three formats for England was emphatically strengthened by his brilliant maiden double-century for Lancashire against Warwickshire at Old Trafford. Livingstone’s unbeaten 215 (from 318 balls with 25 fours and three sixes, one of which – a pull off Olly Stone – brought up his century) leaves Lancashire 284 runs ahead with four first-innings wickets in hand at the game’s halfway stage. A golden opportunity awaits to close the gap on the Division One leaders Essex before their visit to Old Trafford next week. Lancashire will go into that game second, and look the team best placed to haul Essex down. Livingstone was joined in stands of 85 with the nightwatchman Stephen Parry (43), 211 with Shiv Chanderpaul (95) and 82 with Jos Buttler (49, his highest score of the summer) as Warwickshire were ground down. England view the 24-year-old as a Test prospect but do not see him as a No3 – his position for this innings – and have even requested to Lancashire that he bat at four or five. Essex had a much stronger day against Somerset before bad weather intervened – as the forecast suggests it will once more on the third day at Chelmsford. The leaders have the top two wicket‑takers in the division and it was them, Jamie Porter – who took five for 40 – and Simon Harmer, who cleaned up the tail to hit 50 wickets for the season, who ensured they conceded a first‑innings deficit of five, despite scoring just 159 themselves. Mohammad Amir, who will be replaced by Neil Wagner for the final three games of the season, got the ball rolling with two wickets in the day’s opening over. Despite falling to eight for two, Nick Browne’s gritty unbeaten 66 meant Essex were three down with a lead of 112 at stumps. Surrey and Middlesex are more worried about relegation than titles, and their tussle at The Oval descended into an arm-wrestle, despite being briefly brightened by sprightly seventies from Jason Roy and Ben Foakes. However their dismissals, coming as they did at vital times – Roy just before tea, Foakes just before the new ball – prevented Surrey from posting the handsome lead their stand of 125 appeared to promise. The last six wickets fell for 49, and the eventual lead was just 33, which by stumps had been reduced to 18 by Middlesex’s openers. Roy came to the crease at the end of a grind of a morning session. The nightwatchman Stuart Meaker and Scott Borthwick had battled hard, before Steven Finn dismissed the pair either side of lunch. Roy settled before plonking Ollie Rayner into the Pavilion with consecutive balls, then getting after Finn’s short stuff. Eventually, though, he tried a shot too many and found mid-off off Adam Voges’s part‑time left-arm spin. The rest of Surrey’s batting duly followed, with the job finished by the new ball, Tim Murtagh and Toby Roland-Jones, who took four for 66. Two old stagers helped Durham dominate Derbyshire. Paul Collingwood made 177 in Durham’s 480 for nine declared, before Graham Onions, on his return from injury, took four for 44, including his 600th first-class wicket, to bowl Derbyshire out for 164. Onions is out of contract at season’s end and wants to play all formats, but Durham have only offered him a deal for Championship cricket. Other counties have expressed an interest in signing him. A staggering 79-ball 107 (with 14 fours and four sixes) from Riki Wessels helped Nottinghamshire hammer home their advantage against Northamptonshire. Wessels warmed up for Finals Day by scoring his second 50 in 21 balls as Notts racked up 317 for eight in their second innings. They lead by 389 runs, and Samit Patel earlier made 64 from 59 balls. R Ashwin took three for 94 on his Worcestershire debut against Gloucestershire, as they were bowled out for 258. The Worcestershire openers reached stumps on 10 without loss, a lead of 115. At Colwyn Bay, Glamorgan are 126 for six in their second innings, leading Sussex by 152. Ben Brown was last man out for 77 as Sussex posted 268 in their first innings. At Canterbury, 97 from Sam Northeast helped Kent fight back after Leicestershire posted 350. Leicestershire’s last wicket stand of 122 between Lewis Hill (85*) and Callum Parkinson (75) was eventually ended by Darren Stevens – who else? – who finished with eight for 75. Kent have one second innings wicket in hand, and are 37 behind."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"us-news/2017/aug/29/hurricane-harvey-relief-effort-houston-texas","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-29T21:11:17Z","webTitle":"What we know about Harvey relief efforts in Texas so far","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/aug/29/hurricane-harvey-relief-effort-houston-texas","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/aug/29/hurricane-harvey-relief-effort-houston-texas","fields":{"headline":"What we know about Harvey relief efforts in Texas so far","bodyText":"Normal life and regular services in the Houston area remain crippled by the effects of the storm and continued rising floodwaters, worsened by more appalling weather on Tuesday. The authorities are warning Texans to expect the immediate disruption to continue for weeks and perhaps months to come. Transportation at a standstill The road system in and around Houston was still inundated on Tuesday with no signs of abatement in the flooding. Maps on a regional website operated by a partnership of local, county and state representatives recorded 442 locations around the metropolitan areas where road closures had been forced by high water. Major arteries such as I-10 running east-west to the north of downtown Houston, I-69 dissecting it north-south and the I-610 loop around the city are badly affected, with large sections closed. Floodwaters are still rising as the rain continues, and the emergency planning services are having to release water from several reservoirs to prevent uncontrolled overflow and worse flooding, putting the transportation system under further strain for many days to come. The weather forecast for the weekend is good, but floodwaters will not have begun subsiding by then, making access to most flooded areas still extremely problematic. Both of Houston’s two major airports remained closed on Tuesday, having suspended flights since early Sunday. The Federal Aviation Administration’s website states that Houston’s Hobby airport is expected to reopen on Wednesday morning at 8am local time and George Bush intercontinental airport is expected to be operational again on Thursday at noon local time, although as the driving rain continues, operational plans are subject to change. Jack Brooks regional airport in Beaumont was also closed Tuesday, although flights in and out of Corpus Christi resumed and flights were operating out of Galveston. Flight disruptions are expected to continue across the region for the rest of the week and the poor weather is likely to begin affecting operations in Louisiana and, later, Mississippi. Evacuations and the struggle to reach safety The American Red Cross reported that 17,000 people affected by the flooding were in emergency shelters in southern Texas by Tuesday afternoon, but that number was expected to rise. The majority of people are in shelters on safe ground within the Houston area, with the city’s George Brown convention center hosting almost 10,000 evacuees already. After an influx of people there between Monday and Tuesday, the center is operating with only half the number of cots needed and many people are sleeping on the floor with pillows and blankets, the Red Cross said. An additional shelter is likely to be opened nearby later on Tuesday. “This storm is beyond catastrophic. But anyone who is seeking refuge can reach out to the Red Cross. Anyone who is stranded is urged to call 911 or the US Coast Guard even though those services are very busy,” Red Cross spokesman Anthony Tornetta told the Guardian. Reports are coming in that volunteers from across the country are loading up emergency vehicles with food, clothing and cleaning materials and heading to Houston, from as far away as California, Pennsylvania, Virginia, New York and the Midwest, Tornetta said. Houston mayor Sylvester Turner said city officials were looking for more shelter space. Meanwhile Dallas, 240 miles north-west of Houston, has opened its Kay Bailey Hutchison convention center to accommodate 5,000 flood refugees, and the city has been asked to prepare to receive many thousands more, according to Dallas mayor Mike Rawlings. Evacuees have been flown in from Galveston, where the airport is open, and are expected to arrive in fleets of buses once interstate route I-45, which connects the two mega-cities, is passable. It was under water at the Houston end on Tuesday. Dallas’s neighbor city of Forth Worth has opened five emergency shelters to house 1,000 people fleeing the floods. Mass rescues under way Houston police have rescued more than 3,400 people from the floodwaters, police chief Art Acevedo said in a tweet on Tuesday. “Every passing hour, more boats are getting into the water,” he said. Emergency services and ordinary members of the public have deployed various kinds of craft, from formal rescue boats to kayaks, to enter the flooded streets of Houston and the region. Soaked families and individuals who had to flee from their homes or vehicles, often clutching soaking wet babies or pets in the pelting rain, struggled to safety, with small boats often being buffeted by strong currents in flooded streams and coastal surges. Texas has deployed all of its National Guard troops, numbering around 12,000, and units are in action from other states, as far afield as Alaska, according to the defense department. Arizona and New York are among a number of states that have sent military aircraft, including helicopters, transport and reconnaissance planes, making up a fleet of around 60 military aircraft now deployed from Corpus Christi to Houston in search, rescue and supply efforts. “Continuing rainfall from the hurricane is expected to cause devastating and life-threatening flooding throughout this week,” Army Col Robert Manning warned in a media briefing on Monday. High winds had hampered air rescue efforts over the weekend but on Monday and Tuesday the US Coast Guard had 20 helicopters operating in the Houston area, with air and ground teams rescuing stranded people and taking in supplies. ‘Very little sleep’ for medical workers Approximately 20 hospitals and 20 nursing homes in south-east Texas have been evacuated because of the flooding, around half of those in the Houston area, and a further 25 hospitals are experiencing difficulties with power, supplies or access for ambulances. The Ben Taub County Hospital in Houston was preparing on Tuesday to evacuate its 300 patients, with ambulances waiting to take them to other area hospitals. At least 40 hospitals in the Houston area are safe from flood effects and were operating normally on Tuesday, according to Darrell Pile, chief executive of the Southeast Texas Regional Advisory Council, which overseas medical services in the region under the joint umbrellas of state health services and federal disaster preparedness authorities. “There is very little sleep being had among emergency planners, and staff who are working are not able to be replaced because other staff cannot get into work. The efforts of hospital staff, nursing home staff and first responders has been incredibly good in the circumstances,” Pile told the Guardian on Tuesday. The West Houston Medical Center was on Tuesday in the process of deciding whether to evacuate, because of power problems. Many hospitals which are operational have scaled back routine surgeries or other non-essential work in order to conserve supplies and prepare for any influx of patients being evacuated from elsewhere, Pile said. No end in sight Services, businesses and homes that have been affected by the storm are not expected to go back to normal quickly.

Top stories Donald Trump has said “all options are on the table” after North Korea launched a missile designed to carry a nuclear payload over Japan, and vowed that the US and Tokyo were committed to increasing pressure on Pyongyang. The mid-range missile was one of the most provocative launches yet by North Korea and sent a clear message to Washington just weeks after Kim Jong-un threatened to target the US Pacific territory of Guam with similar weaponry. Officials in South Korea said the missile may have flown further than any other tested by North Korea. “The world has received North Korea’s latest message loud and clear,” the US president said in a written statement. “This regime has signalled its contempt for its neighbours, for all members of the United Nations, and for minimum standards of acceptable international behaviour.” The Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe, said: “This outrageous act of firing a missile over our country is an unprecedented, serious and grave threat.” The Guardian’s diplomatic editor, Patrick Wintour, has considered how world leaders can respond to Pyongyang. With China and the UN reluctant to ban the export of energy to North Korea, the “era of good options is rapidly coming to an end”. Trump has travelled to Texas to witness the floods that have devastated large parts of the state and are now threatening Louisiana in the wake of ex-hurricane Harvey. After landing in Corpus Christi with the first lady, Melania Trump, the president told reporters: “We want to do it better than ever before. We want to be looked at in five years and in 10 years from now as this is the way to do it. This was of epic proportion, no one has ever seen anything like this.” In Houston, a dam that protects the central city began overspilling on Tuesday, and officials said the rainfall from Harvey is so unprecedented they do not know what the impact on surrounding communities will be. The clean energy target recommended by chief scientist, Alan Finkel, won’t deliver Australia’s obligations under the Paris agreement and will only transfer pressure to other sectors of the economy to reduce their emissions, according to new analysis. The research comes as the Coalition’s difficult internal deliberations over the Finkel review are set to resume, with a report due from the Australian Energy Market Operator about the dispatchable power requirements of the electricity grid after the closure of two ageing coal-fired power stations and as Malcolm Turnbull is set to meet meet with Australia’s major energy retailers for a second time. Churches across Australia will offer sanctuary to any refugees and asylum seekers left homeless and destitute by changes to the government’s visa regime. Peter Catt, the Anglican dean of Brisbane and chair of the Australian Churches Refugee Taskforce, said a network of churches, aid agencies, community groups and refugee advocacy organisations would offer housing, financial support, food, clothing, medicines and other necessities to assist refugees and asylum seekers who have lost the right to government financial support and housing. A man born in Britain, and whose relatives are all British, has been told he must leave the UK because his mother was born in Australia on a family holiday. His parents never married. Shane Ridge, from Lancashire, describes himself as “as British as they come”. Under UK law, if a child was born before July 2006 the father’s British nationality will usually only automatically pass to the child if he was married to the mother at the time of birth. Ridge said he applied for a British passport last year to go on holiday and his application was declined, but he then successfully applied for and holds an Australian passport. He said he was told he would be able to travel and safely return to the UK after his holiday and until now had no indication of any problems. Sport David Warner has given Australia the chance to pull off a miracle win over Bangladesh in the first Test in Dhaka. Set 265 for victory, the opener scored an unbeaten 75 to lift the visitors to 109-2 at stumps on day three. The skipper, Steve Smith, who survived a tight stumping decision from his first ball, is on 25 not out. With the Ashes just around the corner, there was further encouragement for Australia as England lost a thrilling home Test against the unfancied West Indies. England declared shortly before the close on the fourth day, but on the final day Shai Hope became the first batsman in history to score two centuries in the same match at Headingley to steer West Indies to 322 for the loss of five wickets. At the US Open in New York, last year’s champion Angelique Kerber is out, defeated by Naomi Osaka 6-3, 6-1. The 19-year-old Japanese player offered a stunning exhibition of her glittering potential and secured her first win over a top-10 player. For the German former world No 1, the defeat reflected a wretched year that has now plumbed new depths. Follow the action – including Rafael Nadal and Nick Kyrgios’s ties – in our live blog. Thinking time After her childhood in a secretive religious cult founded by her grandfather, New Zealand woman Lilia Tarawa risked hellfire and damnation to escape. In an extract from her new book extract, she shares a slice of her childhood at Gloriavale Christian Community, where subservience to authority figures and ritual violence were commonplace. “Grandad was very fond of bragging that we had the biggest families in New Zealand. He liked to show visitors a photo he’d taken of all the children who were number three or more in birth order, saying, ‘None of these children would be here if their parents practised birth control and didn’t have a faith in God.’ … He’d say, ‘Guess where the most dangerous place in the world is? It’s not on the road in cars. It’s not flying through the air in planes. It’s in the womb of an ungodly woman.’” In 1973 a young Aboriginal legal service worker called Sam Watson was on a work trip in the Atherton Tablelands when he drove past a road sign bearing the name Nigger Creek. Watson stopped the car, and stole the sign. He half-wished a police officer would catch him in the act. “I just got a couple of tools out of the boot and liberated the sign. I thought, this is a blot on the landscape,” the now Brisbane-based activist says. Some 44 years later, Queensland authorities have caught up, wiping the name off the map of the tablelands and in six other places around the state.

Media roundup The Australian Financial Review says Murdoch University in Western Australia has won the right to remove union restrictions on redundancies from the Fair Work Commission in a landmark ruling that is set to rock the university sector. Fairfax’s Mark Kenny says the furore caused by suggested amendments to colonial statues shows how “Australia is a nation scared … nervous of even bringing into the daylight a more complete account of its own creation”. Failure to address the problem would expose politicians’ commitment to constitutional recognition of the Indigenous population as “tissue thin”.

West Indies brilliantly cruised past their victory target of 322, set by Joe Root on Monday, with five wickets and 28 balls to spare. Their helmsman was Shai Hope, who with his fellow Bajan, Kraigg Brathwaite, forged the critical partnership, just as they had done in the first innings of a magnificent Test match. Hope struck his second century of the game, a feat that had never been achieved at Headingley in 533 first-class matches. In itself this was remarkable but of far greater importance for the West Indies camp was a performance and a result that gives joy and hope to the legions of cricket lovers in the Caribbean. West Indies had not won in England since the Edgbaston Test of 2000 and no one outside their dressing room had given them much chance here on Tuesday morning. But Hope and Brathwaite reunited with the same composure they had demonstrated on Saturday. This victory was more stunning than the last successful West Indian run chase on English soil. Roddy Estwick, the bowling coach, made reference to Lord’s in 1984 on Monday night, when Clive Lloyd’s side knocked off 344 in 66 overs, but that team contained a catalogue of proven world-class batsmen. That has never been the perception of the 2017 tourists, though the estimations of Shai Hope, in particular, have rocketed in the last week. Meanwhile Root joins a select band of England captains after this result. Norman Yardley, David Gower, Kevin Pietersen and Root are now the quartet who have declared in the third innings of a Test match and subsequently lost it. Root is unlikely to be widely criticised for his declaration – after all, England were not playing Australia – but his side must be chastened after this topsy-turvy contest. The first sign this might not be a straightforward day for England was when Alastair Cook dropped a relatively simple catch at slip when Brathwaite was on four. Stuart Broad, bowling, was not amused but after a bright opening partnership of 46 he just about broke into a smile when he dismissed Kieran Powell for 23. This time Ben Stokes obliged in the slip cordon. The next catch to be dropped was by Broad himself yet this would still prove a source of some celebration. Brathwaite drove hard: Broad, following through, could not grasp the ball but instead it ricocheted from his fingertips into the stumps leaving Kyle Hope stranded. There were smiles all round the England camp, though on reflection they might have preferred Brathwaite’s wicket since the opener was always going to be more of a danger. This was England’s last success for 40 overs and their exasperation mounted. After Broad had given away a boundary he was minded to kick the turf like Angus Fraser used to do, but he seemed to get his foot stuck in the soil and might have stubbed his toe. Jimmy Anderson could edge no nearer the magic 500 while Chris Woakes struggled to find a consistent line. The ball spun for Moeen Ali but he was unable to apply much pressure by keeping a batsman trapped at his end. Brathwaite belied his blocker’s reputation not with any extravagances but by moving positively into the ball and driving firmly. Occasionally he lofted an off-break to the boundary. Meanwhile Shai Hope, his self-belief soaring after the first innings, was sharp, stylish and composed. His drives were sweetly timed yet measured. Then just before tea England finally took a wicket. Brathwaite was within five runs of that remarkable Headingley record himself when he drove at a wide ball from Moeen. Stokes snaffled the catch at slip. After the break, with West Indies needing 123 from 35 overs, Root was reluctant to put too much faith in Moeen. Instead, with the situation deteriorating, he turned to his senior citizens, Broad and Anderson. This pair was determined to squeeze West Indies by bowling straight to a defensive field and they imposed some pressure by delivering three maidens in succession. Hope, now joined by Roston Chase, was prepared to bide his time. Eventually Root recalled Woakes and Chase decided this was the time to attack. He swung hard at Woakes’s first ball, which sped to mid-on. There was Mason Crane, the Hampshire leg-spinner, who had just come on as a substitute for Broad. He took off to his left like a goalkeeper and grabbed the ball in two hands, a moment that might have changed the game as well as enhancing the good impression he has made within the England camp. Out came Jermaine Blackwood and he was skittish from the start. Moeen was briefly recalled and Blackwood cracked a drive over mid-wicket; then he danced around the crease to Woakes as if this was a T20 match. Root took the new ball as soon as it became available. By then 56 runs were needed from 16 overs and the tourists still had six wickets in hand. If anything this last throw of the dice from England heightened Blackwood’s audacity. He gave himself room to pummel Anderson’s second delivery back over his head for six. Meanwhile Hope remained calm and secure, reaching three figures and delighting the statisticians with a scrambled single. But on 106, with 37 still needed, he launched off the back foot against Broad and the edge flew towards first slip. In the diminishing light Cook could not hold on. There was not much anyone could say. Soon Blackwood took the precaution of removing his helmet for the victory parade and was promptly stumped with two runs required. It was more appropriate that Hope should hit the winning runs of a famous victory."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"music/2017/sep/03/trio-da-kali-and-kronos-quartet-ladilikan-review-spellbinding","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-03T07:00:37Z","webTitle":"Trio da Kali and Kronos Quartet: Ladilikan review – spellbinding","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/sep/03/trio-da-kali-and-kronos-quartet-ladilikan-review-spellbinding","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2017/sep/03/trio-da-kali-and-kronos-quartet-ladilikan-review-spellbinding","fields":{"headline":"Trio da Kali and Kronos Quartet: Ladilikan review – spellbinding","bodyText":"Not every project by inveterate collaborators Kronos Quartet emerges a triumph – their recent Folk Songs album is a case in point.

She plays proper jazz piano, too, and her excellent band has the settled-in sound of a regular working unit.

As hardly ever happens, none of them died, and they all said yes. I first met Jerry in Las Vegas, where we rehearsed. Walking through the crowded gambling floor of a Vegas casino with Jerry, the reactions ranged from hysteria to the shock that comes with seeing a ghost. He’s alive! Very much alive. (In fact, he was a very sprightly 69.) From the outset, he was generous. There was only one alarm bell: he made a show of presenting me with a signed copy of his book, The Total Film-Maker. It threw me, humbled me. It reminded me I was directing a director. Was the book an instruction manual on how I should proceed? I kept expecting him to be difficult; to pull rank. He never did. If he was ever difficult, it was in ways that never bled on to the set. No room at Blackpool’s Imperial hotel was big enough for him. In the end, it was one room for him and one for his belongings. Locks had to be changed. And I had to hide the fact that I had the biggest room, the Gigi suite – something I also had to hide from Leslie Caron for obvious reasons to anybody familiar with her filmography. But he embraced it all. The fish, the chips – all of it. The world of my home town, Blackpool, as it appeared in my childhood. The film is full of non-professional actors, from many different walks of life. The crew called the film “the mad, sad, uninsurable world of Peter Chelsom”. In particular, there were a lot of comedians. For me, there’s a very thin line between a talent for being funny and being a great actor. Jerry Lewis epitomised that. And that’s the thing about him – he really was a fine actor. He played it very truthfully. He understood the zone he was in: real characters in absurd situations. In Funny Bones, there’s comedy and there’s acting, but there’s no “comedy acting”. You don’t act absurd; it’s a by-product. He got that. There is a scene where he visits his son (Oliver Platt) in his dressing room before going on to stage. He asked me how I saw it. I told him I just wanted him to “own” the room, to stay loose. I didn’t want to give him moves. I was rolling two cameras, and I would catch whatever he wanted to do – I knew he would direct himself. He knew what worked. I just wanted to watch. Take one is in the movie. He told me he loved what the film had to say, about comedy, about our lives. He related to the polarity, the limits, the dark side of it all: this was a film where a comedian (Lee Evans) is fuelled by applause to almost murder someone on stage. Jerry embodied the term “funny bones”: a way of differentiating between comedians who tell funny and those who are funny. He was definitive casting. I had been obsessed with the essence of comedy from the age of seven. Jerry used to ask me: “How do you know all this without coming from a show business family?” Then one day, I pointed out Butlin’s in the distance. “You see Butlin’s, Jerry? My grandmother won the glamorous grandmother competition there five years in a row. And I’ve got all the cups to prove it.” He smiled, spread his arms and said: “So you do come from a show business family!”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/aug/29/the-guardian-view-on-killer-robots-on-the-loose","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-29T18:40:43Z","webTitle":"The Guardian view on killer robots: on the loose | Editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/aug/29/the-guardian-view-on-killer-robots-on-the-loose","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/aug/29/the-guardian-view-on-killer-robots-on-the-loose","fields":{"headline":"The Guardian view on killer robots: on the loose","bodyText":"The first meeting of the UN-backed group of experts, intended to start work on getting a ban on lethal autonomous weapons, was supposed to wrap up at the end of last week. But only days before it was due to start it was cancelled: funding shortfalls were blamed. A lack of will feels the more likely explanation. Alarmed by the delay the day it was due to begin, more than 100 of those most closely involved in developing the artificial intelligence on which such weapons would rely, led by Tesla’s Elon Musk and Alphabet’s Mustafa Suleyman, wrote a public letter of bleak warning: killer robots amount to a third revolution in warfare, the sequel to gunpowder and nuclear weapons. They are right. The only thing more frightening than a machine that can’t decide for itself who to kill is one that can. But the technology is out there, within reach of scientists backed by billions of dollars poured into the development of AI by the Pentagon’s Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, or Darpa, and certainly matched in other less transparent regimes. Some semi-autonomous weaponry is already available, like the border guarding system on the ceasefire line between North and South Korea. The process of what its critics, such as the campaigning group Article 36, call “bureaucratising” weapons, where targets are defined according to an explicit hierarchy, is under way. Scientific discovery and technological advance are never unmade; the history of asking states and their generals to abandon military advantage and behave morally, while not futile – there have been international laws of war for more than a century and in parts of the world for very much longer – has only limited success when applied to specific weapons, in certain times. For example, for the first half of the 20th century, the US banned unrestricted submarine warfare. It lasted less than 24 hours after Pearl Harbour. Yet the morality of merely distancing human involvement from conflict has been anxiously debated at least since the invention of cannon; after the Austrians sent up balloons laden with bombs with timed fuses against forces defending Venice in 1849 (the wind changed, to Austrian disadvantage) balloon bombing was outlawed at the first Hague Peace Conference in 1899. It was one of the earliest such bans, but like the later prohibition on the use of chemical weapons – a rare success for the League of Nations in the Geneva Protocol of 1925 – the ban was the easier to negotiate for never having battle-winning potential. In contrast, attempts at a universal prohibition on bombing from planes, which had been used against military targets since the early years of the 20th century, never made progress despite lip service being paid to the idea in the 1930s by both Stanley Baldwin and Hitler. And even when bans were in place, as there was against chemical weapons, the US used napalm in Korea and Vietnam before ratifying the beefed up UN biological weapons convention that outlaws production, stockpiling and use in 1975. In the early years of debate on the development of autonomous weapons, the Pentagon argued that technology must be servant not master of the soldier. Not any more. Yet the weight of public opinion – even when it is not a majority view – can stiffen governments against the demands of military expediency and strategic choice. CND protests from the Aldermaston marches of the 1950s to the Greenham Common peace camp in the 1980s played their part in building a climate that made arms control a diplomatic objective. But for all the progress in controlling nuclear weapons that has been made since the first test ban treaty was signed in 1963, no nuclear power has ever given up their capacity to launch a nuclear attack. But the fact of removing human intervention from the decision to kill raises the most profound questions – both of international law and ethics and, as the next issue of the International Institute of Strategic Studies journal Survival argues, wider issues of global peace and strategic stability. Campaigners believe that through the UN they can build a coalition, a platform for a sustained campaign to control autonomous weapons. They are heartened by the backing of scientists who know most intimately how AI could be developed, and maybe learn to develop itself. By exploiting the power of stigma, they have won campaigns against anti-personnel mines and cluster bombs. The global order is more fragile than at any time since 1945; a hard place to build consensus. But theirs is an argument that must be made."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"fashion/2017/sep/15/rhythm-method-mermaid-tails-week-fashion-trends-hot-not","type":"article","sectionId":"fashion","sectionName":"Fashion","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-15T11:00:05Z","webTitle":"From the Rhythm Method to mermaid tails: this week’s fashion trends","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2017/sep/15/rhythm-method-mermaid-tails-week-fashion-trends-hot-not","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/fashion/2017/sep/15/rhythm-method-mermaid-tails-week-fashion-trends-hot-not","fields":{"headline":"From the Rhythm Method to mermaid tails: this week’s fashion trends","bodyText":"Going up Faces on our clothes From T-shirts by Spanish brand Paloma Wool to merino wool turtlenecks at Victoria Beckham, we’re into clothes that have something of the Modigliani about them.

But there are ways to set ourselves free","bodyText":"Next time you have an appointment cancelled at hospital, or a headteacher tells you their school will be losing staff because of budget cuts, ask how much PFI debt they have – the answer may surprise you. My hospital trust, in north-east London, spends nearly £150m a year repaying its PFI debt – nearly half of which is on interest payments. If Theresa May is serious about taking on the unacceptable face of capitalism, she could save Britain a fortune if she goes after the legal loan sharks of the public sector. New research from the Centre for Health and the Public Interest (CHPI) shows just how much these debts are hurting our NHS. Over the next five years, almost £1bn of taxpayer funds will go to PFI companies in the form of pre-tax profits. That’s 22% of the extra £4.5bn given to the Department of Health in the 2015 spending review, and money that would otherwise have been available for patient care. The company that holds the contract for University College London hospital has made pre-tax profits of £190m over the past decade, out of the £725m the NHS has paid out. This alone could have built a whole new hospital as 80% of PFI hospitals cost less than this to construct. This is not just about poor financial control in the NHS – UK PFI debt now stands at over £300bn for projects with an original capital cost of £55bn. Private finance initiatives are like hire-purchase agreements – superficially a cheap way to buy something, but the costs quickly add up, and before you know it the debt is crippling. For decades, governments of both main parties have used them for the simple but ultimately short-sighted view that it keeps borrowing off the books – helping reduce the amount of debt the country appears to have, but at great longer-term expense. Its now painfully clear that the intended benefits of private sector skills to help manage projects have been subsumed in the one-sided nature of these contracts, to devastating effect on budgets. No political party can claim the moral high ground. The Tories conveniently ignore the fact that these contracts started under the John Major government – and are expanding again under Theresa May, with the PF2 scheme. Labour veers between defensive rhetoric that PFI was the best way to fund the investment our public sector so desperately needed during its last government, and angrily demanding such contracts be cancelled outright, wilfully ignoring what damage this would do to any government’s ability to ever borrow again. It’s time to grasp the nettle and get Britain a better line of credit. That requires both tough action on the existing contracts to protect taxpayers’ interests, and getting a better deal on future borrowing. Some have already bought out contracts – Northumbria council took out a loan to buy out Hexham hospital’s PFI, and in doing so saved £3.5m every year over the remaining 19-year term. But as the National Audit Office has shown, gains from renegotiating individual contracts are likely to be minimal – what is saved in costs is paid out in fees to arrange. However, the CHPI research also shows up another interesting facet of PFI. Just eight companies own or appear to have equity stakes in 92% of all the PFI companies in the NHS. Renegotiating not the individual deals done for hospitals or schools, but across the portfolios of the companies themselves could realise substantial gains. Innisfree, which manages my local hospital’s PFI and others across the country and has just 25 staff, stands to make £18bn alone over the coming years. If these companies are resistant to consolidating these loans into a more realistic cost, then it’s time to look again at their tax reliefs, or – given the evidence of excessive profits in this industry that shareholders have received – resurrect one of New Labour’s early hits with a windfall tax on the returns made. Longer term, we need to ensure there is much more competition for the business of the state. Despite interest rates being low for over a decade, these loans have stayed stubbornly expensive. The lack of viable alternatives – whether public borrowing or bonds – gives these companies a captive market. If the government wants better rates, it needs to ensure there are more options to choose between, whether by allowing local authorities to issue bonds, or reforming Treasury rules that penalise public sector borrowing in the first place. As our public services struggle under the pressure of PFI, Labour must lead this debate to show how we can not only learn from our past, but also provide answers for the future too. The government has already spent £100bn buying the debt of banks through quantitative easing. With Brexit expected not only to add £60bn to our country’s debt but also affect our access to European central bank funds, taking on our expensive creditors is a battle no prime minister can ignore in the fight to stop Britain going bust. • Stella Creasy is the Labour and Co-operative MP for Walthamstow, in north London.

Cracks had by then begun to show in Fleming’s marriage to Ann Charteris. Ann was ashamed of her husband’s success as a thriller writer (the Bond novels were “pornography”, she told friends), and had begun to stay away from their Jamaican home, Goldeneye. Blackwell’s friendship with Fleming intensified when Ann began an affair with the politician Hugh Gaitskell. Ann became suspicious of “Ian’s Jamaican wife” after Anthony Eden’s wife, Clarissa, mentioned how helpful Blackwell had been at Goldeneye when the prime minister recuperated there in 1956 after the debacle of Suez. In an attempt to make Goldeneye more welcoming for the Edens, Blackwell had planted the garden with flowers; Ann later tore them out and threw them over the cliff. Fleming wrote all 13 of his 007 novels in Jamaica, though only three (Dr No, Live and Let Die, The Man with the Golden Gun) were set partly on the island. Noël Coward, another neighbour, dubbed Fleming’s home “Goldeneye, nose and throat” for its lack of creature comforts. It was in this Spartan retreat that Fleming immersed himself in a Bond-like life of tropical oblivion fuelled by vodka and cigarettes (like 007, Fleming smoked 70 a day). Impishly, he included sketches of his friends (and enemies) in his fiction. Blackwell was supposedly a model for Pussy Galore, the trapeze artist turned leader of a team of lesbian cat burglars who passes herself off as an air stewardess in his novel Goldfinger; for the film, she is a pilot and martial arts expert. In Dr No, the guano-collecting ship was named the Blanche. Blackwell claimed not to have read any of the books, though: “I don’t like violence.” Daughter of Hilda (nee Lindo) and Percy Lindo, cousins who married, she was born into a wealthy Jamaican family, descended from Sephardic Jews from western Europe who had settled in Kingston in the mid-18th century and came to control much of the island’s commerce. Her father had helped to consolidate the family fortune in Costa Rica – where Blanche was born, in San José – before returning to Jamaica, where he owned property and produced rum. In 1936, in London, Blanche married Joseph Blackwell, a captain in the Irish Guards and heir to the Crosse &amp; Blackwell foods fortune. Together they ran the family estates in Jamaica and owned a string of racehorses. In 1937 their son Christopher was born. Blanche was not happy in the marriage, however. The actor Errol Flynn (“a gorgeous god,” Blackwell called him) became one of her admirers. By the time she and Joseph divorced in 1949, she had moved to Jamaica’s north coast, to a house equidistant between Coward’s and Fleming’s. “Noël became a special pal of mine,” Blackwell told me during an interview in 2007, and Coward was said to have based his play Volcano on island life, and one of its central characters, Adela, on Blackwell. Fleming adored “Birdie” Blackwell and her darting, kingfisher mind. And Blackwell, in her turn, considered Fleming a “charming, handsome, gifted man”, but one plagued by self-doubt and self-hate. “Ian was an angel”, she told me. “Errol was another … Both lovely men – both exceptionally gifted and definitely not for domesticating.” When Fleming died of a heart attack in 1964, Blanche was invited neither to the funeral nor the memorial service. For years, she kept watch over Goldeneye for Fleming’s son Caspar; and after Caspar’s death in 1975 the house was bought first by Bob Marley, and then by her son, Chris, the founder in 1959 of Island Records, who had “discovered” Marley. Tough and good-humoured, in later life Blackwell wore her white hair bobbed round an animated, heart-shaped face. Her life, until she decamped in 2003 to a flat in Knightsbridge, London, had been one of island entertainments and literary friendships. Now, looked after by three Jamaican maids, Blackwell became an unlikely devotee of bingo. Each week her chauffeur took her to the Cricklewood Mecca to play. In Kingston, she had liked to bet on the horses, but London bingo was not without its thrills. “Cricklewood might seem a little dull to you,” she said. “It isn’t really. I could sit for hours in the Mecca. The tension as your number comes up. Bing-bing-bingo!” She is survived by her son. • Blanche Blackwell, born 9 December 1912; died 8 August 2017 This article was amended on 13 September 2017.

The song, the 27-year-old singer’s first since 2014, was released on 24 August with an accompanying lyric video which received 19m views in its first day, breaking the previous record held by the Chainsmokers and Coldplay. On the following day, it racked up 8m streams in Spotify, another record; and after the video was released during the VMAs on Sunday it achieved almost 30m views in 24 hours. This gave Swift her third record, beating Adele’s Hello, which achieved 27.7m views. The video currently has over 53m views. While the song has been popular with fans, it has received mixed reviews from critics. The Guardian’s Maura Johnston called it “a skeletal bit of electropop”, while Pitchfork’s Meaghan Garvey referred to it as “a half-rapped, half-assed airing of grievances”. It arrived within weeks of Swift’s civil trial against DJ David Mueller, who the singer had accused of groping her during a pre-concert photo. The jury ruled in favor of Swift. “My hope is to help those whose voices should also be heard,” she said in a statement. “Therefore, I will be making donations in the near future to multiple organizations that help sexual assault victims defend themselves.” Look What You Made Me Do is the first song taken from Swift’s new album, Reputation, which will be released in November.

You asked Google – here’s the answer","bodyText":"When it comes to speed records, one animal beats all others on both land and a Google search. But the cheetah has now been usurped by the not-so-humble raven. This is thanks to a particularly fantastical bit of editing in the penultimate episode of season seven of Game of Thrones. No spoilers here. All I’ll say is that it left the audience wondering just what kind of flight speed the daddy of the crow family can muster if it were to have travelled such long distances in what appeared, at least on screen, to be such little time. (My favourite meme featured a raven with jet engines under its wings.) If, like me, you’re a fan of animal record breakers, you’ll know the fastest flight recorded is the stoop of a peregrine falcon – over 200mph. That’s vertical though, plunging down toward prey, so it’s working with gravity not against it. Flying horizontally takes more effort so we can expect speeds to be lower. Various adaptations give different bird species a speed boost – from the powerful wing muscles of the migrating eider duck, to the streamlined shape of a hunting falcon. The Guinness Book of Records touts the grey-headed albatross as the fastest bird in level flight with an estimated ground speed of 78.9mph recorded for one bird. While albatrosses have an impressive gliding adaptation that keeps them aloft with little effort, this one was probably also helped by strong storm winds in the Antarctic. Ravens (Corvus corax) are the largest of the corvids – a notoriously brainy bird family that includes crows, jays and magpies. While much has been written about their intelligence, there are fewer studies on their flying habits. Ravens are skilled aerobatic flyers, seemingly enjoying being on the wing in blustery conditions. Their long, pointed wings allow them to manoeuvre rapidly, and with a wingspan of over a metre, they can also soar – using thermals to travel longer distances with little energy expenditure, much like eagles and other large birds of prey. Matthias-Claudio Loretto of the University of Vienna, Austria, has recently conducted the first studies to track the movements of ravens using GPS. “They are definitely good flyers, but also not real champions,” he tells me. “Other species are perfectly adapted to fast long-distance migration which is not the case in ravens. They are in most areas – except for the Arctic region – non-migratory and move rather opportunistically.” Matthias and his team found that ravens in the Eastern Alps flew relatively short distances. The maximum distance in a day was around 100 miles (164 km) but he describes this as “exceptional”. The fastest bird in the study clocked in at close to 25mph. So wild ravens generally don’t need to get anywhere in a hurry. Of course, the ravens behind the Westeros postal system are all trained by the maesters, so we need to consider habituated animals for a fair comparison. Bird trainer Lloyd Buck loves nothing more than to feature the talents of his feathered friends in exhilarating film work. This includes a YouTube video for BBC Earth that puts Lloyd’s raven through its paces alongside a peregrine falcon. The raven in the video, called Bran, (no connection to House Stark, although its no coincidence since it’s the Welsh word for raven) successfully kept up with Lloyd as he was driven along an airfield at 48mph. Bran’s average speed was recorded at 40mph. Interestingly, this wasn’t for a food reward – as it was for the peregrine – but to be close to Lloyd; the raven considers his trainer to be his life partner. Unlike the sullen soothsayer of Westeros, Bran is a very sociable bird (with the standard two eyes). Lloyd tells me one of his favourite activities at this time of year is to go foraging: “He loves to go out blackberrying with me, and flies ahead and waits by the bushes. Then I lift him up within reach on my arm, and he picks the ripe ones, and likes me to pick them for him as well. I think he sees this as a real pair-bonding thing to do.” In summary then, at average speeds (up to 25mph) a wild raven can cover up to 100 miles in a day. Yet the bird’s performance can be enhanced through co-operation with a human. A trained raven’s top recorded speed is around 48mph. Is your disbelief suitably suspended? Add in the rumoured use of ravens for espionage during the cold war and the mythical role of the birds as harbingers, and perhaps the Game of Thrones team weren’t winging it after all. The answer to how fast a dragon can fly will take a lot more explaining."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2017/aug/30/share-your-reviews-of-the-great-british-bake-offs-return","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-30T06:00:22Z","webTitle":"Share your reviews of the Great British Bake Off's return","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/aug/30/share-your-reviews-of-the-great-british-bake-offs-return","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2017/aug/30/share-your-reviews-of-the-great-british-bake-offs-return","fields":{"headline":"Share your reviews of the Great British Bake Off's return","bodyText":"After much excitement, chatter and controversy, the Great British Bake Off is finally back on our screens – in its new home on Channel 4.

He had been in the water for six days, by a frequented, paved path. Stones in his pocket (as my mother much later told me) meant my grandfather intended his body to stay gone for ever – but postmortem gas brought it back to the world he wanted to leave. The death record was terse: “SALTER or KNOPP Kenneth Leonard Vernon of 12 West Street Colchester, who was last seen alive on 28 January 1958 and whose dead body was found 4 February 1958 … Effects £805 8s.” There were a couple of superficial reasons why Kenneth Salter/Knopp should have committed something that, in his earlier Victorian days, was called the crime of “self-murder”. His wife, Daisy, had gone into hospital. It was not terminal – she would outlive him by eight years. But he was alone in the house. His last recorded words were, as he watched the traffic: “Everybody drives nowadays.” Not him. After his death, the mystery about Salter/Knopp thickened. Although he had worked as a manual labourer for 40 years, he owned a couple of houses elsewhere in the country. Boxes stuffed with cash were found in his shed – much of it ancient notes. The cash and property were discreetly laundered. Daisy modernised her house and lived her last years comfortably off – comfort denied her for all her small life. The reason Kenneth chose the death that he did was, I believe, to escape from what he was. He was born outside of marriage (probably) and he was Jewish (most probably). I knew him closely for two years of my childhood. I was, from the age of 10 to 12, mad on fishing. He was formidably knowledgeable about the rivers. He could catch fish in a rain puddle. Two particular favourites, in our fishing expeditions, were the Stratford and Dedham mills. These old sites, in 1949, were virtually unchanged since Constable painted them. However, we never fished around Middle Mill pond. A friend, he said, had drowned there. He said little. His equipment was 30 or more years old. As was his bicycle. Those Saturdays were among the happiest of my life. Until relatively recently, Knopp was a name wholly unknown to me. My mother, the smartest of his children, dropped occasional remarks, in passing, that her father was Jewish. No details. I couldn’t start to make sense of it until a friend (acknowledged below) did a “Who do you think you are?” for me. Kenneth’s mother, Alice Knopp, was born in 1866 in Frating, Essex, a few miles from Colchester. Most Jewish communities clustered in London but a number gravitated to Essex. Alice went into domestic service aged 14. Her life thereafter is obscure. The next recorded fact is Alice giving birth to Kenneth Vernon Leonard in 1887, in Hackney, east London. On the birth certificate, she put her name as Alice Wheatley (nee Knopp), although she was not, in fact, married. She gave the father’s name as Arthur Wheatley, carman (ie cart driver). My hunch is Arthur never existed. It was a legitimation ruse. For the next four years, Kenneth was “Wheatley”. Four years later, this resourceful woman, whose contempt for official documentation was incorrigible, renamed herself Lillie Knopp, spinster (exit the invisible Wheatley), and married Frederick Salter, in Camberwell, south London. Salter was a soldier. He had joined the army after being convicted of mugging – better khaki than bars. He was 13 years older than Alice. But he had seen the world, smelled powder, and cut a manly figure. He had been stationed in Colchester about the time Kenneth was conceived. Kenneth Knopp/Wheatley now became Kenneth Salter – the name he used for the rest of his life. Frederick died five years later, in 1896. The widowed Lillie is recorded in 1901 living with her son (Frederick is now registered as his father) in Colchester. Colchester is a garrison town, and in 1903 she enticed George West, a sergeant in the Suffolk regiment, into marriage. She clearly had a love of men in uniform and they for her. There is a vitality about what little one knows about her that is warming. Kenneth, her only child, was now 15. He became a trouser presser, a skilled business in Edwardian England. He was a virtuoso with his irons and spray. There were queues of Colcestrian dandies at his door at weekends. At 22, he married 17-year-old Daisy Agnes Hamilton. She was heavily pregnant. Witnesses were William Knopp, Kenneth’s uncle, and his mother Alice West. Daisy was pretty, diminutive, and (that valued thing) “dainty”. She was also a good seamstress; capable of mending trousers and, when required, good with the irons (I saw her using them dashingly, heated on gas rings not the hob, as late as 1950). The couple lived in a handsome house (how did Kenneth buy it?) in Colchester, with a growing family. Kenneth was 27 when war broke out. His army service, insofar as one can surmise, was brief, and ignominious. “Salter K” enlisted on 12 January 1917 and was discharged from the Royal Engineers on 19 July 1917. The reason given is “sickness”. It was the year England almost lost the war, and men were desperately needed. But not Private Salter. The sickness was, I suspect, mental. He did, however, have an injured, wholly whitened eye which – I assumed – was a war wound. He may have seen action and fallen apart. Whatever, he came back a difficult man. His eldest daughter, Daisy, got pregnant and was shuffled off to Australia. His son, Arthur, on his death bed, in 2004, told me that Kenneth had beaten him savagely as a child and that he was convinced that he was not his father. He added that, after the war, Kenneth was drunken and brutal to his wife. Daisy’s brothers would come round and punch him into better behaviour. Kenneth’s pressing skills were unwanted in the 20s, and he sank to being what his death certificate calls a “general labourer”. But mysteriously, he still had money enough to buy another nice terraced house. The wherewithal was money left by his mother, Alice, who may have got it from family connections in London. The dates of the notes found after his death indicate he began boxing up money in the late 30s (when, I guess, Alice died) and did not splash it around. Doing that would have meant drawing attention to himself. An “illegitimate” Jewish Knopp. Loneliness closed in. To establish his sole claim to Alice’s money, however, he had had to identify himself as Knopp – hence the surname oddly popping up on his death notice. It is feasible he was not Jewish, or half-Jewish. But I think my mother was right. I see the self-chosen end of Kenneth Leonard Vernon Wheatley/Knopp/Salter as the last, conscious move in a long flight from the personal history embedded in those three surnames. Kenneth’s bleak funeral was attended only by two daughters. I was instructed to keep away. His wife chose not to go. She said she was glad the cold February sun had briefly shone: “He didn’t get much in his lifetime.” He had not left her any note, nor – apparently – thought of softening the impact of his death. I think a lot of Kenneth’s last hours, before his lungs filled. The image has haunted me for weeks now. And, to escape that, I think of those other, happier mill ponds we fished in. • The genealogical research was supplied by Susan Walker, to whom I am profoundly grateful • In the UK, the Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 (calls are free).

The UN security council will meet on Tuesday, unified in its condemnation of Pyongyang, but China has already voted to strengthen economic sanctions to the maximum point that the UN collectively, and China specifically, would find politically tolerable. In August, in response to North Korean intercontinental ballistic missile tests, China allowed the UN to ban North Korean exports of coal, iron, iron ore, lead, lead ore and seafood. It also prohibited countries from increasing the number of North Korean labourers working abroad, as well as bans on new joint-ventures with North Korea. Nine individuals and four entities were added to a UN blacklist, including North Korea’s primary foreign exchange bank. These measures may yet have “a very big financial impact”, as Donald Trump tweeted at the time. But it takes a lot longer than the time it takes to send a tweet for sanctions to freeze up a nation’s economy, let alone change a dictatorial leader’s political calculus. North Korea has been under some form of sanctions since 2006 and it has found ways to work around many measures. But the August package, already implemented by China, is slated to cut North Korea’s $3bn (£2.3bn) annual export revenue by a third. The only further serious collective economic measure on the agenda is a ban on the export of energy to North Korea, a measure China has always opposed, saying it will destabilise the North Korean regime in unpredictably dangerous ways, as well as create a humanitarian catastrophe, sending tens of thousands of refugees pouring over the border into China. Beijing has long said that the collapse of the North Korean regime, likely leading to the enforced reunification of Korean peninsula, is off the agenda. But that will not stop further pressure being placed on China to do more. Regional leaders such as Malcolm Turnbull, the Australian prime minister, demanded China “ratchet up the pressure” in response to the latest missile launch. “They have condemned these missiles tests like everyone else but with unique leverage comes unique responsibility,” he said. China does not agree, arguing that alongside sanctions there has to be some diplomacy. In the absence of unified further sanctions, the US and other nation states can continue to impose individual targeted sanctions. For instance, in August the US treasury announced it would target 10 entities and six individuals, mainly Russians and Chinese, adjudged to be helping North Koreans already under sanctions. The measures were greeted with a furious response in China, and as an invasion of its sovereignty. The US Republican leader of the House foreign affairs committee, Ed Royce, speaking from South Korea this week, said the US had to take more unilateral steps, arguing the goal was to offer international banks that do business with North Korea a straight choice between bankruptcy and freezing North Korean accounts. But the firing of the missile over Japan also brings military options further forward. One option is to fly a Tomahawk cruise missile over North Korea and directly over Pyongyang to illustrate that two can make threatening gestures. South Korea’s opposition party now supports nuclear weapons in the south. In London, the deputy director general of RUSI, Malcolm Chalmers, is urging Theresa May to take more seriously the threat of a Trump preventive strike in North Korea, and what the British response should be. “The time pressures now being created by North Korean technical advances, together with Trump’s volatile and impulsive personality, is a dangerous mix,” he warned in a paper this month. Above all, the US’s partners, including the UK, will be seeking more consistent messaging from the Trump administration. Trump made solving the North Korea issue one of the defining issues on his presidential agenda, but has no discernible plan for achieving that goal. The appointment of an ambassador to Seoul would be a start. Threats of fire and fury one day by Trump, followed by an offer of talks by the US secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, the next leave both China and North Korea bewildered, and prone to miscalculation. Only last week, Tillerson said the recent lack of North Korean missile tests may be the signal he had been looking for. Now an offer of talks would look like a reward for the intimidation of Japan. A former US diplomat responsible for North Korea, Joseph DeThomas, said what is needed from the Trump administration is a “very clear deterrence policy – not this kind of fly-off-the-handle and say something one day, and then say something the opposite the next day”. He said North Korea ultimately values its own power and its own survival the most. At some point, it came to the conclusion that the only way that would be guaranteed is if it had nuclear weapons with which it could strike American targets. The other analysis – largely supported by Russia and China – is that North Korea knows it cannot win a nuclear arms race, and the repeated test firing of missiles is designed to restart peace talks. North Korea has no intention of firing nuclear missiles first. But after five nuclear tests and two successful launches of intercontinental ballistic missiles, most experts believe the opportunity to prevent North Korea from developing a nuclear weapon that could hit the US may be over. In short, the era of good options is rapidly coming to an end."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/sep/03/the-evening-jude-law-saved-my-bacon","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-03T05:00:35Z","webTitle":"The evening Jude Law saved my bacon","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/sep/03/the-evening-jude-law-saved-my-bacon","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/sep/03/the-evening-jude-law-saved-my-bacon","fields":{"headline":"The evening Jude Law saved my bacon","bodyText":"It was a good few years since I’d been ice-skating, but when the invitation came in the run-up to Christmas 2003 to attend the evening inauguration of the rink in the courtyard at Somerset House, I was pretty sure it would all come flooding back. Children were welcome, it said, so I took my seven-year-old son along. Because I didn’t want to keep him up late, I booked into the first batch of skaters as did, it turned out, several celebrities, also bringing children, who were lined up for the cameras. The good news was that my son proved remarkably adept on ice. I’d say chip off the old block, but, as I quickly discovered, I’d lost the knack. Convinced it would click back into place eventually, out we wobbled into the middle for an ungainly circuit. A couple of times I had to grab my boy to avoid stumbling but, unnoticed by me, he had started going faster. The next time I reached out in crisis, he wasn’t there. In his absence, I broke my fall by clinging on to a fellow skater. As I pulled myself back up to standing using this ice-rink Samaritan’s arms, shoulders and even donkey jacket like a climbing wall, I came face-to-face with Jude Law. Not that he looked like himself as my eyes fell at first on his famously dimpled chin. It was only when I got on level terms that I realised who he was. And he couldn’t have been more charming as, dad-to-dad, we bemoaned the fact that your kids were never there when you needed them. Off we went, me to the side to cling on and hail my treacherous offspring, and he for several more elegant spins. Producers of Dancing on Ice take note, should his film career ever go into a tailspin. Later my son and I did manage a couple of pretty competent laps before he wanted a break. Even without my Torvill, I was sure I could still be Dean, but quickly came a cropper. As my arms flayed out, someone was there to grab me. Jude Law. What are the chances, I said once upright, trying to make light of the coincidence. If he had had a bell to call security, I’m sure he would have used it, for he clearly had me down as a stalker. Instead he made tracks as quickly as the talented Mr Ripley after he’d bumped off Dickie Greenleaf. The next day, among the pictures in the press, I spotted a shot of a grumpy-looking Jude Law with his kids leaving Somerset House early. It was just too crowded out there, he complained.

A touch of self-deprecation and a sense of humour also help. John O’Farrell has these qualities in spades. And as he would be the first to concede, you can’t get much further down the political pecking order than O’Farrell. After decades as a humble footsoldier in the army of Labour, his political career peaked as a candidate in a long forgotten byelection where he came in fourth, behind Ukip. Oh yes, and he once stood for Labour against Theresa May in Maidenhead, his hometown, where he was also duly smashed. Yet, for all that, he is better known than many who have sat in Labour cabinets. He has dined with the prime minister at Chequers, has been invited to drinks in Downing Street, and top politicians have sought his advice on content of key speeches. O’Farrell was propelled into the political limelight by his first book, Things Can Only Get Better, a very amusing memoir of life as a lowly Labour activist during the dark days of the Thatcher supremacy, which in 1998 spent weeks at the top of the non-fiction bestseller list. Since then his books have been translated into 25 languages, while he has written for comedy programmes such as Spitting Image and Have I Got News for You and even co-authored a Broadway musical. Things Can Only Get Worse? (note the question mark this time) is the sequel, offering our hero’s experience of the rollercoaster ride during the 20 years from the glorious night of the 1997 Labour landslide to the EU referendum and the election of Trump, concluding with the glimmer of hope afforded by the surprising outcome of the recent general election. First, however, like many who spent the 80s and early 90s engaged in the politics of protest, he had to come to terms with the compromises and disappointments of office. As he says, “satire is easier under the Tories”. He writes: “One of the secrets of the right is that they are more comfortable with power; being in control comes to Tories as naturally as inconsiderate parking or talking too loudly in restaurants. But from the moment Labour came to power it became clear to me that there is a significant section of the left who … would rather snipe from the sidelines than do the difficult bit of actually effecting change themselves.” He also had to learn to take responsibility. For years, O’Farrell led a campaign for a new secondary school in Lambeth. No sooner was his wish granted than the difficulties began. The government would make the money available only if the new school was an academy – and a Christian one at that. O’Farrell found himself grappling not only with irate residents who didn’t want any kind of school in their backyard but also fellow campaigners who would rather no school than one with a religious ethos. Once the new school was up and running, he was asked to be chair of governors. It wasn’t all plain sailing, but he remained in office for 12 years, steering the school through several crises and playing a leading role in a project that has transformed the life chances of some of Lambeth’s poorest children. A substantial achievement. The author is no longer just a serial protester and piss-taker. He is a man who gets things done. Even so, he can’t resist a lost cause. In 2001, he decides to run for parliament in the Tory stronghold of Maidenhead, the town in which his parents still live. “There are many ways to have a mid-life crisis,” he writes. “Mine was to go back to my home town and then be rejected en masse by the people I grew up with.” Actually, it was great fun. His dad turned up to every public meeting and asked embarrassing questions. The BBC made him the subject of a documentary in which he was depicted canvassing on the Thames in an ugly little dinghy, handing out Labour leaflets to people on £100,000 yachts with names like Just a Whim. No one is more surprised than he when his Tory opponent, Theresa May (“competent”, “polite”, “diligent” – “I could picture her as headmistress of a small independent girls’ school in Surrey”), ends up prime minister. O’Farrell is not a Corbynista. Of Corbyn’s ascent he writes: “I was really depressed. I didn’t dislike Corbyn personally or disrespect him or think he was insincere, it just felt like my student daughter had married a very unsuitable older man … all I could do is hope I was completely wrong.” As it turned out he was wrong (like many of us), although in the long term the jury is still out. In the 2017 election campaign O’Farrell, an ardent pro-remainer, had another little dilemma to grapple with. He had the bad luck to be living in the constituency of Kate Hoey, one of only a handful of Labour MPs who were Brexiters. Through his letter box each week came Lib-Dem leaflets depicting Hoey cosying up to Nigel Farage. What to do? Does he follow the example of his wife and tear up his Labour party card or does he soldier on? In the end, he sticks with Labour. “I am married to the Labour party for better or worse, in sickness and health, in Kinnock and in Blair. And sometimes they drive me mad, and I feel embarrassed and ashamed, but much more often I feel proud.” As for Hoey, “she’s that auntie in Kettering who got crossed off the Christmas card list; she’s my nutty cousin who got drunk at the wedding and took a swing at the vicar, but she is still related (twice removed, maybe)”. Sequels often disappoint, but O’Farrell hasn’t lost his touch. There are laughs as well as large doses of common sense. How could it be otherwise from the man who, in the words of Alan Johnson (another political figure with a light touch), is “Maidenhead’s finest political brain”? • Chris Mullin’s memoir Hinterland is published by Profile.

So naturally I had it in for UltraBoost Uncaged Parley, Adidas trainers that claim to make peace with the ocean. The shoe’s upper is created from plastic waste retrieved from a clean-up operation in the Maldives, and recycled polyester. But Adidas has committed to producing a million pairs of these ocean waste running shoes, and a swimwear line. Meanwhile, Spanish clothing company Ecoalf works with 2,000 Spanish fishermen who collect 4-5kg of deep-sea plastic waste alongside their daily catch, to be spun into new yarn. And we can look forward to seeing the fabric Econyl on labels in the future (regenerated from fishing nets and second-hand carpets) in Italy, as it becomes mainstream. New Zealand flip-flops company Subs grinds up plastic waste from beach cleans, but also upcycles old shoes so that materials can be sustained indefinitely. Every pair of flip-flops removes 0.52kg of plastic from the sea. That is, it has to be said, a very small dent on the 12.7m tonnes of plastic entering the ocean each year. I also worry about the effectiveness of scooping ocean waste from the surface, given that average ocean depth is 1.2km. But a recent report analysing all mass-produced plastics has reassured me. It tells us that almost all plastic ever created still exists in some form. So most of the ideas we’ve had to get rid of it have failed, spectacularly. Innovation with huge global appeal is therefore pretty critical. The level of innovation here is also impressive: regenerating marine debris degraded by the sun and wind and ocean currents is no mean feat. Nor is taking a resource of no value and turning it into something so desired that fishing fleets could use it to supplement their income. The big picture: navigating the Arctic melting pot It was the record nobody wanted: Finnish icebreaker MSV Nordica took just 24 days to travel 6,215 miles from Alaska to Greenland, sailing through the Northwest Passage to arrive on 29 July, earlier than ever before. The timings of the voyage were made possible by the fact that Arctic ice melts earlier each year. The voyage and the great melt were experienced and documented by a crew of scientific researchers. Well dressed: wear a polar bear for WWF It turns out that singer Ellie Goulding is a bit of a science nerd. ‘I loved geography at school,’ she confessed during a recent visit to meet climate scientists from the British Antarctic Survey in Cambridge, where she also came face to face with a giant coldwater starfish (one of the creatures that is currently under threat from climate change). But it was the polar bear (also famously under threat from climate change) that has made it on to Goulding’s climate change bracelet collection, designed by the singer with jewellery brand Daisy of London, to raise funds for WWF’s climate work. ‘We aim not only to raise awareness of the effects of climate change but to encourage this conversation,’ says Goulding, ‘for those who wear [the bracelet], it will show they really care.’ Email Lucy at lucy.siegle@observer.co.uk or follow her on Twitter @lucysiegle"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/aug/29/whats-the-mood-like-in-japan-after-north-korea-missile-launch","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-29T13:07:58Z","webTitle":"What's the mood like in Japan after North Korea's missile launch?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/aug/29/whats-the-mood-like-in-japan-after-north-korea-missile-launch","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/aug/29/whats-the-mood-like-in-japan-after-north-korea-missile-launch","fields":{"headline":"What's the mood like in Japan after North Korea's missile launch?","bodyText":"Early on Tuesday morning, millions of people in northern Japan woke to the news that a North Korean missile was passing overhead.

A larky, cheerfully trashy vampire romp, it was clearly made with a budget of next to nowt and a packet of crisps for the catering table. But it has the wisdom not to take itself seriously in the slightest, and there are moments when it rustles up a few properly amusing gags and well-turned one-liners. It helps that the cast clearly enjoy sinking their prosthetic teeth into the silliness of playing a cadre of ancient, bickering undead having an away-day meeting at a remote farmhouse when a military unit tracks them to their lair. Annette Crosbie is a particular hoot as a cuddly grandvamp who nobly lays down her knitting to hold off the invaders with a submachine gun and a Zimmer frame.

Those who think a trip to Malta holds no fear for England goalkeepers have clearly not thought back as far as the friendly on 4 June 2000, when Richard Wright made his international bow and promptly conceded two penalties. Wright saved the second of them, making sure of a 2-1 win, but the damage was done and it is never a good sign when as sanguine a soul as Kevin Keegan says your debut “wasn’t as bad as it could have been”. Malta are unlikely to cause too many flutters this time around and if a goalkeeper makes headlines again it would probably be on account of Gareth Southgate shaking things up. He has kept faith in Joe Hart so far but the West Ham loanee has not had the happiest of starts to the season and has not kept a clean sheet in his last 23 club games; it would be a big statement to drop him but this might not be the worst stage on which to remind Tom Heaton or, more likely, Jack Butland that they hold credible claims to the position. At some point England will need to make the change and it would surely do little harm to divide out some of the labour in advance. As long as the video nasty of Wright’s performance is saved until afterwards, it could be a useful confidence boost for either keeper. 2) McGoldrick could give Ireland the spark they need The Republic of Ireland have Georgia on their minds in a week that will probably be decisive to their hopes of winning Group D. Expectations are high: they have taken maximum points from both their previous visits to Tbilisi, a venue where others have suffered bloody noses in the past, and have won all eight of their previous matches against the Caucasian state. After Saturday’s match is navigated they wait three days to face leaders Serbia at home; it could well be a showdown for automatic qualification, with Wales and Austria currently lagging four points behind the top two, but there is still a sense that Martin O’Neill’s side have to work exceptionally hard for every result and a little spark around the attacking third would go a long way in both games. To that end the presence of David McGoldrick is a welcome boost; the Ipswich forward has won only five caps since making his international debut three years ago, but that owes much to some rotten fortune with injuries and the good news is that he now looks sharper than at any time since. This time in 2014 McGoldrick seemed set for an £8m move to Leicester before Ipswich held firm; there are few more naturally gifted forwards at his level and an Ireland team with scant offensive variety could benefit richly from his renaissance. 3) Scotland seek to exploit chink of light in Lithuania How different Scotland’s prospects would look if, having turned their match with England in June right around, they could have kept their heads for a couple of minutes. Harry Kane’s last-gasp goal at Hampden Park may well prove to have been a fatal wound but there is enough about the makeup of Group F to suggest all is not quite lost. It would be a remarkable feat for Gordon Strachan to bring them back from the brink – the atmosphere inside Hampden was toxic as recently as two games ago before Chris Martin’s dramatic winner against Slovenia – yet suddenly a play-off spot does not seen an outrageous demand. At least one of Slovenia and Slovakia, the teams they must overhaul, will drop points when they play in Trnava on Friday and Scotland ought to have few problems against Malta next Monday. All well and good – provided they can negotiate a tricky tie in Lithuania first. Lithuania have only lost at home once to the Scots and drew at Hampden last October; the match will be played on an artificial pitch in Vilnius and Gordon Strachan has been quick to play that down as a factor. He says that, whatever the surface, his team feel more confident after their recent upturn. If that is borne out in results then they might save their skin – and their manager’s, too. 4) Ukraine give Fifa cause for discomfort Ukraine lie a lowly fourth in Group I and, though they would never admit it, you cannot imagine Fifa would want it any other way. The crisis with neighbouring Russia shows no sign of being resolved in time for next year so, with the countries’ clubs already barred from facing one another in European competition, just how big would the logistical nightmare be if Ukraine qualified for the World Cup? It is far more of a possibility than the standings suggest; only two points separate them from the top two, Croatia and Iceland, and if they overcome third-placed Turkey in Kharkiv on Saturday the alarm bells may become louder than ever. A trip to Reykjavik follows quickly afterwards and you wonder exactly what plans are being drawn up in case Andriy Shevchenko, whose team have improved since their poor Euro 2016 showing and certainly have the firepower to win both games, leads Ukraine through the group. It remains hypothetical, but football’s governing body would be faced with one of the biggest headaches they have ever been dealt. 5) Can Asensio or Belotti break the deadlock in Madrid? The Bernabéu will feel like a World Cup final venue on Saturday and with good reason. One of Spain and Italy will have to fight out qualification through the play-offs and, after a year of shadow boxing in an otherwise insipid Group G, it effectively comes down to this. The pair are tied on points, although Spain’s goal difference is four better and their remaining fixtures look a marginally preferable bet to improve on that front, and if either side can edge clear they are unlikely to be pulled back. They played each other three times last year and are familiar foes, but each team has an extra x-factor this time around. Marco Asensio and Andrea Belotti could both start, the former on his home ground; they have enjoyed spectacular starts to the season with Real Madrid and Torino, and breathe a fresh element of unpredictability into one of Europe’s most storied rivalries. If Italy could claim an edge after their excellent 2-0 win at Euro 2016, a dominant performance by Spain in Turin last October – when La Roja were unlucky to draw 1-1 – removed it to some extent. It should be an unmissable occasion and would set up either side’s presence at the World Cup nicely if one of their newer stars had the decisive say. 6) Messi and Argentina look for a lifeline in Uruguay If Lionel Messi fancied some sanctuary from Barcelona’s troubled summer he would probably have picked quieter surroundings than a Thursday night in Montevideo. But into the fire he goes, and Argentina need him as much as they ever have. Messi missed an immensely damaging 2-0 defeat in Bolivia five months ago after being given a four-game international ban, the rest of which was lifted on appeal. He returns with Argentina fifth in the Conmebol qualifying group, a point behind Uruguay and Chile; they have four games left and defeat against the Uruguayans, in one of the world’s most hotly-contested derbies, would leave them scrambling. If they finish fifth they will require the hurdle of an intercontinental play-off against New Zealand or the Solomon Islands; that might not seem a big deal but it could even be a best-case scenario if today’s opponents, who have won six out of seven at home, hit form again. Uruguay in fact have their own problems; they have lost their last five games, including friendlies, and have let a commanding position slip. It might be a good time for Argentina, playing a competitive fixture under Jorge Sampaoli for the first time, to face their old rivals – and the stakes could not be a lot higher. A home meeting with Venezuela follows five days later but this is not the time to rely on the weaker teams as insurance. 7) France hope to avoid deadline distractions A crucial qualifier on transfer deadline day is not, in the current climate, a perfect scenario for France. Kylian Mbappé’s future should, at least, have been resolved before they kick off against Holland and presumably Thomas Lemar will know where he is spending his season too. Didier Deschamps will need maximum focus from his team in what has become a potentially decisive fixture and to that end it is slightly ironic that the player he left out of the squad as a result of transfer speculation, Ousmane Dembélé, is the one of his young tyros whose future has since been rubber-stamped. The pressure is, at least, on a disappointing Holland team that sits three points adrift of France and Sweden. They cannot afford to lose if they are to have serious designs on Russia 2018; France, meanwhile, hope six points from this match and Tuesday’s game with Luxembourg will cause leaders Sweden, who have slippery assignments in Bulgaria and Belarus, to crack. As long as their players’ minds are on the job, you would fancy their chances. 8) DR Congo and Burkina Faso eye surprises in Africa Five double-headers form the pivot of Africa’s short, sharp group stage and the possibilities are mouthwatering. Nigeria’s back-to-back games with Cameroon in Group B are the obvious attraction although the Africa Cup of Nations champions, who are four points behind the Super Eagles, will need at least a win and a draw to hold realistic hope of a place in Russia. Algeria stand to fall short in that quartet too and the bunching up of those three powers increases the chances of an unfamiliar name emerging from the other groups. The most appealing story for the romantic would probably be progression for DR Congo, whose 1974 World Cup finals appearance as Zaire remains notorious; they lead a patchy Tunisia on goal difference and play them twice in the next week. Instinct says they have a great chance but if they fall short there is always Burkina Faso, perhaps Africa’s most attractive footballing side of the last half-decade, who lead Group D by a whisker and must face off against Senegal. Egypt, for their part, will almost certainly be home and dry – at Ghana’s expense – for their first finals since 1990 if they do not slip up on either occasion against Uganda. The picture will be far clearer in five days’ time but it would be the proverbial breath of fresh air if some less familiar names made it through. 9) Australia see path to Russia open up Australia’s qualifying campaign has hardly sent pulses racing but suddenly Group B of the Asian competition has opened up for them. Today’s match in Saitama would have had a life-or-death look to it had Saudi Arabia, second in the group, not let a lead slip against United Arab Emirates on Tuesday and lost 2-1. It means any kind of result will put Ange Postecoglou’s side into the top two – both of whom progress to Russia automatically – and a win would see them leapfrog Japan in pole position with an appealing home fixture against Thailand, on Tuesday, to come. They can take part from an encouraging Confederations Cup campaign that, although it ended winless, brought some enterprising football against good sides – particularly in their 1-1 draw against Chile. Some questioned whether their performance in Moscow that night, which saw Tom Rogic and Aaron Mooy left out of the starting lineup, came via accident or design but it set a standard for how Australia need to set about top-class opposition and a similar level of application in Japan could make their road to the World Cup easier than they might have imagined. 10) US hope to lay Costa Rica ghosts to rest It was a rotten night in Costa Rica that sent Jürgen Klinsmann past the point of no return, but revenge against the same opponents would create a halo effect around Bruce Arena. The US are unbeaten in a marathon 14-game streak since Arena began his second spell in charge last November; their victory in the Concacaf Gold Cup boded well and it did little harm that the Costa Ricans, who humbled them 4-0 10 months ago, were the team they defeated in the last four. Friday’s match at Red Bull Arena – the first World Cup qualifier to take place at the stadium – is of far more consequence in the broader picture and a win should give them a significant advantage over fourth-placed Panama, who travel to Mexico. Arena’s squad has defensive issues, with John Brooks and DeAndre Yedlin both injured, but the progress of Christian Pulisic continues delight and a similar performance to the two-goal haul he produced against Trinidad &amp; Tobago in their last home qualifier might lay the ghosts of last year to rest for good."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"crosswords/cryptic/27296","type":"crossword","sectionId":"crosswords","sectionName":"Crosswords","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-06T23:00:44Z","webTitle":"Cryptic crossword No 27,296","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/cryptic/27296","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/crosswords/cryptic/27296","fields":{"headline":"Cryptic crossword No 27,296","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"sport/2017/aug/30/school-ban-washington-nfl-native-americans-redskins","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-30T14:58:47Z","webTitle":"Maryland school bans pupils from wearing Washington 'Redskins' clothing","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/aug/30/school-ban-washington-nfl-native-americans-redskins","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/aug/30/school-ban-washington-nfl-native-americans-redskins","fields":{"headline":"Maryland school bans pupils from wearing Washington 'Redskins' clothing","bodyText":"A Maryland private school has banned pupils from wearing clothing with the name of their local NFL team, the Washington Redskins. Washington’s nickname has been the topic of years of debate: many say it is derogatory towards Native Americans. The staff and management of Green Acres school concur, and have decided to make a stand. “The term ‘Redskin’ is a racial slur,” wrote Green Acres’ head of school, Neal Brown, in a letter to parents. “Its use, whether intentional or not, can be deeply insulting and offensive. It is a term that demeans a group of people. Similarly, the team’s logo also can reasonably be viewed as racially demeaning. At best, the image is an ethnic stereotype that promotes cultural misunderstanding; at worst, it is intensely derogatory. “As such, having students or staff members on campus wearing clothing with this name and/or this team logo feels profoundly at odds with our community’s mission and values.” Brown said there had been dissent from some parents and he did not want to make children feel guilty for supporting Washington. “We want to approach this with children in a very age-appropriate and sensitive way,” he told Bethseda magazine. “We’re in no way trying to vilify anyone for rooting for the local football team because, in truth, I root for the local football team.” Barack Obama is among the figures who say Washington should consider changing its nickname. The team’s owner, Dan Snyder, is adamant that won’t happen, saying the name shows “respect and pride” towards Native Americans. A poll in the Washington Post last year found that nine out of 10 Native Americans are not offended by the team nickname. However, Ray Halbritter and Jackie Pata, two figures in the name-change movement, pointed to the impact imagery in sports can have on young Native Americans. “Social science research and first-hand experience has told us that this kind of denigration has both visible and unseen consequences for Native Americans in this country,” they said in a statement at the time. “This is especially the case for children, who were not polled and who are in a particularly vulnerable position to be bullied by the NFL. It is the 21st century – it is long overdue for Native Americans to be treated not as mascots or targets of slurs, but instead as equals.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"us-news/2017/aug/31/felix-sater-trump-russia-investigation","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-31T10:49:00Z","webTitle":"Felix Sater: the enigmatic businessman at the heart of the Trump-Russia inquiry","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/aug/31/felix-sater-trump-russia-investigation","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/aug/31/felix-sater-trump-russia-investigation","fields":{"headline":"Felix Sater: the enigmatic businessman at the heart of the Trump-Russia inquiry","bodyText":"Felix Sater, a Moscow-born businessman now at the centre of the Trump-Russia affair, says he lives by a simple code: “Screw me once, shame on you; screw me twice, shame on me for letting it happen.” As the Trump presidency finds itself increasingly hemmed in by an investigation into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin, and as key protagonists hire their own lawyers and reportedly make their own arrangements with prosecutors, they are words likely to become ever more relevant to those caught in the whirlpool. Sater – a former Trump associate who the president has in recent years had trouble recalling – repeated the motto more than once in exchanges with the Guardian, while asking for fair coverage of his past. He insists it has sustained him through a convoluted and colourful life that led him from Moscow to Wall Street to prison to the freewheeling world of international real estate deals, secret arrangements with US law enforcement and intelligence agencies – and ultimately, to Trump Tower. Whatever the truth of Donald Trump’s relationship with the Kremlin and Vladimir Putin, Sater is likely to end up being part of the story. He surfaced this week in leaked emails that he sent in 2015 to Trump’s lawyer, claiming he could engineer Putin’s support for a Trump Tower in Moscow and thus, somehow, a victory in the US presidential election. “Our boy can become president of the USA and we can engineer it,” Sater said, according to one of the emails, leaked to the New York Times. “I will get all of Putin’s team to buy in on this, I will manage this process.” The real estate deal never happened, but Sater’s predictions of a world-changing political triumph proved to be prescient. Quite what that triumph had to do with Putin is now under scrutiny by a special counsel in Washington and a handful of congressional committees. Sater’s links to Trump’s circle can be traced back to not long after he came to the US as a child. His father, Mikhail Sheferovsky (who changed the family name after arriving in New York) became a local crime boss in Brighton Beach and Sater grew up on that side of Brooklyn, where he got to know another teenager in the neighbourhood, Michael Cohen, a Long Island boy who would go on to become Trump’s personal lawyer and vice-president of the Trump Organization. Three decades later, it was Cohen whom Sater contacted when he thought he could win Putin’s backing for a Moscow real estate deal and Trump’s presidential run. Sater first came directly into Trump’s orbit when he teamed up with one of his neighbours, another Soviet-born striver, Tevfik Arif, a Kazakh developer who set up the Bayrock real estate firm in 2001 with offices in Trump Tower. Sater rose to become managing director, and Bayrock went into partnership with Trump to build the Trump Soho hotel. Trump, Arif and Sater were masters of ceremonies at the official opening in Manhattan in September 2007, and pictures of the event show them basking together in the glow of the publicity. Sater was forced out of the limelight not long after, when details of his criminal record appeared. His first career as a stockbroker had come to a sudden end when he was jailed for slashing a man with the stem of a shattered margarita glass.When he emerged from a year of prison (“the worst time in my life”, he told Talking Points Memo), he got involved in a mob-run stock exchange scam, persuading gullible customers to buy worthless shares. He was caught again but this time he did not go to jail. Instead, he and two other defendants struck a deal with the US government, offering his services in return for leniency. The extent of what he did for government agencies is not exactly clear. According to a book co-authored by another defendant in the case, Salvatore Lauria, Sater used his contacts in the Russian underworld to help the CIA buy back Stinger missiles that had fallen into the hands of Afghan jihadists, although the buy-back scheme failed. Sater has claimed that his secret work in Russia for the CIA started before the stock fraud was exposed. However, according to an unsealed transcript of a New York hearing in 2011 in which the justice department sought to keep Sater’s deal secret, Sater’s cooperation went much further than counter-terrorism. The government’s lawyer Todd Kaminsky told a court that Sater, referred to throughout the proceedings as John Doe, had provided cooperation that “was of an extraordinary depth and breadth, almost unseen, at least in this United States attorney’s office”. Kaminsky added that “unlike some cooperators who cooperate within one type of organized crime family or over one type of crime, Mr Doe’s cooperation runs a gamut that is seldom seen”. “It involves violent organizations such as al-Qaida, it involves foreign governments, it involves Russian organized crime. And, most particularly, it involves various families of La Cosa Nostra. By that, specifically, I mean an individual on the ruling board of the Genovese crime family, a captain in the Bonanno crime family, a soldier in the Gambino crime family, the list goes on and on.” Kaminsky continued: “Now, at the time of the sealing in 1998 and through the beginning of 2008, Mr Doe worked in a proactive capacity actively aiding grand jury investigations that involved surreptitious recordings of individuals as well as other undercover actions.” Sater disputed this version of events, however, insisting all of his work for the government was abroad. “I have never been a mafia informant ever in my life,” he told the Guardian in an email. “I was a cooperating witness on my 1998 Wall street case as where 15 other defendants [sic], that case basically ended in 2000. My work with various US government agencies both before the 1998 case as well as for over [two] decades after was in the area of National Security and did not include any mafia members of any kind.” Sater added: “That work went into high gear after September 11, when America was attacked.” His government service ended in 2009, when he was finally sentenced for the securities fraud charges more than a decade earlier, paying a $25,000 fine and spending no time in jail. By now, however, his criminal past had been exposed. But there was still one Manhattan high-roller willing to make use of Sater’s particular skills. Sater told New York magazine: “I stopped up to say hello to Donald, and he says, ‘You gotta come here.’” The Trump Organization has insisted that Sater was never an employee but he worked out of Trump Tower and carried a now infamous business card identifying him as “senior advisor” to Trump. “Donald wanted me to bring deals to him. Because he saw how many I put on the table at Bayrock,” Sater said. “I know you’re gonna be able to spin it as ‘He doesn’t care and will do business even with gangsters,’” Sater told New York magazine. “Wouldn’t it also show extreme flexibility, the ability not to hold a grudge, the ability to think outside the box, and it’s okay to be enemies one day and friends the next?” What Sater did for Trump from that time on is part of the puzzle that entwines Trump with Moscow. What is known is that he was involved in the abortive attempt to secure Trump a slice of the Moscow real estate market and that he took part in an effort, also involving Michael Cohen, to promote a Moscow-backed peace plan in Ukraine that would have left Crimea in Russian hands on a long-term lease, and potentially to the removal of the Ukrainian president, Petro Poroshenko. The plan was delivered to the White House before being leaked and ditched amid international outrage. Among the many unknowns is the question of whether he returned to his collaboration with the FBI. The Financial Times has reported he is cooperating with an international investigation into Kazakh money-laundering, but he has not said whether he is talking to Robert Mueller, the special counsel looking into possible Trump-Kremlin collusion. As Sater predicted in an email to the Guardian: “[T]here are many additional stories that will be coming out about me in the future, much more timely and important than 20 year old stock cases.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2017/sep/06/missy-elliott-10-of-the-best","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-06T15:00:34Z","webTitle":"Missy Elliott – 10 of the best","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/sep/06/missy-elliott-10-of-the-best","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2017/sep/06/missy-elliott-10-of-the-best","fields":{"headline":"Missy Elliott – 10 of the best","bodyText":"1. Sock It 2 Me (ft Da Brat) In the early 90s, New York was home to an R&amp;B collective, the Swing Mob, comparable in talent and influence to the city’s 70s folk scene. Missy Elliott would become its Bob Dylan, a breakout star with a brain full of fireworks, shooting out blazing innovations too fast for her audience to keep up, let alone her rivals. Initially as part of the group Sista, then in partnership with Tim “Timbaland” Mosley, she honed the skills as a singer, rapper, writer, producer and performer that made her own shot at the big time, Supa Dupa Fly, such a commercial and critical success. Yet the album’s most memorable track was one of its least sonically representative: a jaunty, tuneful paean to sex, a subject Elliott has always rejoiced in addressing directly. Constructed around a sample from a Delfonics song, Ready Or Not Here I Come (Can’t Hide from Love) – already the basis for a Fugees hit the previous year – Sock It 2 Me was a huge hit in turn, helped along by a characteristically dazzling video by Hype Williams that defied industry expectations by exaggerating rather than playing down Elliott’s body shape. Had this been Missy Elliott’s first single and not her second, it would surely rank among the greatest debuts of all time. 2. Hot Boyz (Remix ft Lil Mo, Nas, Eve and Q-Tip) Excellent though much of it is, Supa Dupa Fly explored where R&amp;B had recently been – echoing the work Elliott and Timbaland had crafted for Jodeci, SWV and Aaliyah – rather than sounding new or alien. It was her second album, Da Real World, that sounded as though it was beamed in from the future – shiny, synapse-popping, crackling with ingenuity and mischief on such tunes as Beat Biters, Stickin’ Chickens, and the screw-you reclamation of She’s a Bitch. From the start, Elliott had two major subjects: Missy Elliott’s brilliance, and Missy Elliott’s libido – and there was plenty of both to go around. It’s the latter that drives this taut and simmering celebration of female lust, reflecting the gaze of oglers back at them to see if they come up to scratch. 3. Get Ur Freak On Talent borrows, runs the aphorism, and genius steals. Like most great innovators (David Bowie being a prime example), Elliot has an instinct for exactly what to steal and when. Her third album, Miss E… So Addictive (the E was circled, like an embossed pill, to leave no doubt as to what she was getting at), followed Madonna on to the electronica dancefloor. Yet it remained unmistakably an R&amp;B record – and a masterpiece, the high-point of a run that mirrored and defined a golden age for mainstream R&amp;B. It was fashionable at the time for mainstream music to borrow from bhangra; typically Elliott did it best, if not first, on this absurdly catchy and danceable track. 4. One Minute Man (ft. Ludacris) Peak modernist Missy: a knowing, witty, filthy, whip-tight tune, all coiled energy and single-entendres, that doesn’t so much turn the tables on attitudes to women in rap and R&amp;B as simply refuse to acknowledge them in the first place. In Elliott’s world, she’s in charge, men are there to serve her purposes, and she’s equally happy to serve theirs if it gets her what she wants. A rap from her old pal Ludacris inevitably recalls the Dominoes’ splendid and saucy 1951 novelty hit, Sixty Minute Man. 5. 4 My People (Basement Jaxx Radio Edit) The most club-oriented number in Elliott’s catalogue, and one of her biggest European hits, thanks to a first-rate reworking from Basement Jaxx, who at that time were turning everything they touched to gold. Elliott’s salute to hedonism, set to a speed garage beat, is eccentric and wonderful; there isn’t another record quite like it. 6. Work It A stone-cold classic. Elliott’s fourth album, Under Construction, is an amazing record. It harks back to old school hip-hop while incorporating the southern rap styles from Florida and Georgia then dominating the game (Elliott is from Virginia). It features half a dozen tracks which might have made this list – but none reach the heights of Work It, which manages somehow to be retro and thoroughly novel, with its pattering, housey percussion (sampled from Blondie’s Heart of Glass), comic sound effects, lascivious slang (“badonkadonk”, “chocha”) virtuoso rhyming, crafty backmasking, and glorious chorus: “I put my thing down, flip it and reverse it.” Lewd, joyous and irrepressible, a Tex Avery cartoon made music, this is the essence of Missy Elliott in five inspired minutes. 7. Tweet: Oops (Oh My) (ft Missy Elliott) A ringer, technically, but as Elliott’s work for others merits a run-down of its own (see also: the superb Rockwilder remix of Bootylicious by Destiny’s Child), it would be a shame to leave it out. She co-wrote this delectable number with her protege and Swing Mob associate Tweet, and Timbaland produced it. A different voice allows for a sinuous, leisurely sensuality distinct from Elliott’s own hyper-harged sexual assertiveness. It’s one of pop’s outstanding tributes to women pleasing themselves; no surprise that Elliott should, let’s say, have a hand in it. 8. Let Me Fix My Weave Elliott was unhappy with her fifth album, the raucous, aggressive, crunk-influenced This Is Not a Test!, feeling she had been pressured into rushing it out. It had no standout hit, yet did not lack for remarkable tracks. Perhaps the most emblematic of them is this hilarious stomper, in which once again Elliott proves more than a match for any male rapper’s preening vanity and lecherous braggadocio, undercut as ever with a sly self-awareness of which few of her counterparts showed any sign. 9. Irresistible Delicious (ft. Slick Rick) One notable exception, however, was Slick Rick, who here delivers a wry, drawling turn on this droll and languid tall tale of collaboration leading to fornication. It appears on The Cookbook; at 12 years old, Elliott’s most recent album, and also her most underrated. It has quality, range and maturity, and just as Under Construction did, it showcases her flair for breathing new life into old sounds. 10. Mommy Elliott has a knack for producing songs that sound rather like another, specific number, but not quite enough to be considered a knock-off. In her case, it’s more likely to be her claiming back what had been borrowed in the first place. Her most recent single, I’m Better (2017), for instance, has a definite hint of Formation by Beyoncé, who has benefited a great deal, directly and indirectly, from Elliott’s inventiveness. Fair exchange is no robbery. Arriving soon after the Pussycat Dolls’ 2005 hit Don’t Cha, the similar sounding Mommy works as that song’s serendipitous counterpoint. It’s an overtly feminist polemic casting “Mommy” (“The definition of mommy is not a chick with kids / Mommy means the boss, the money-maker”) as a figure invested with power, allure, autonomy and fleshly abundance – like an ancient earth goddess channelled through a hip-hop track. Which stands as a neat enough summary of Elliott’s presence, stature and achievements."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2017/sep/01/best-tv-this-week-doctor-foster-suranne-jones-american-horror-story-mitchell-webb","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-01T11:00:42Z","webTitle":"The best TV this week: Doctor Foster is back on the roster","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/sep/01/best-tv-this-week-doctor-foster-suranne-jones-american-horror-story-mitchell-webb","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2017/sep/01/best-tv-this-week-doctor-foster-suranne-jones-american-horror-story-mitchell-webb","fields":{"headline":"The best TV this week: Doctor Foster is back on the roster","bodyText":"Doctor Foster Expect more secrets and lies as the second season of the hit drama begins this week.

Using 3D modelling of a prehistoric tooth dug out of the rocks near Torquay on Victoria’s southern coastline in 2016 and comparing it to similar modelling of modern predators, a team of scientists based at Museums Victoria found that rather than being shaped as a precursor to filter-feeding, the teeth of ancestral whales were surprisingly sharp. “Their teeth really optimised in shape for slicing through flesh,” senior curator of vertebrate paleontology Dr Erich Fitzgerald told Guardian Australia. “The whale teeth are really much more like the slicing blades of big cat and wild dog teeth.” The tooth belonged to a Janjucetus, a species of whale that co-existed with the forerunners of modern baleen whales off the Victorian coastline about 25 million years ago. It is part of the ancestral pool of species that led to modern baleen whales, like blue whales, humpbacks and right whales. “The teeth of Janjucetus were virtually as sharp as those of the living African lion, which we were absolutely surprised to find,” Fitzgerald said. The finding debunks a long-held theory that the teeth of prehistoric whales were shaped to allow water to sieve through them, like the teeth of modern leopard and crabeater seals, and that the filter function drove a linear evolution between teeth and baleen. It is a theory explored by Darwin, who posited in On the Origin of Species that the baleen of the bowhead whale, which he called the Greenland whale, could have evolved “by finely graduated steps, each of service to its possessor” from a mouth that resembled the ridged beak of a duck. It was a hypothetical suggestion to illustrate his theory of evolution but the “neat linear story” of how whales developed baleen persisted, Fitzgerald said. The new research published in Biology Letters on Wednesday supports an alternate theory that whales were ruthless predators that lost their teeth before evolving baleen. “They start off as killers, they then become suckers and eventually become sievers,” Fitzgerald said. “They never used their teeth as a stepping stone between biting fish and then sieving out krill.” The “suckers” phase is not as odd as it sounds: many sea creatures, including dolphins and sperm whales, effectively use suction to catch their prey, opening their mouths to create a vacuum that sucks in smaller creatures. “We think it is as simple as whales being predators and then starting to suck in their prey and as time went on, the hundreds and thousands and millions of years, the teeth reduced in size,” he said. “During that process some of the gum tissues in the roof of the mouth over time evolved into what we now know as baleen.” About the same time that whales began to develop baleen, about 30 million years ago, they began to grow in size. Truly gigantic species, such as the blue whale, did not reach their immense size until three million years ago. Janjucetus was only three metres long. “These earliest baleen whales, despite the fact that their living representatives are some of the largest animals that have ever lived, they really have relatively humble and quite ferocious beginnings,” Fitzgerald said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/world-on-a-plate/2017/aug/29/is-hearing-loss-in-farmed-fish-a-price-worth-paying-for-aquacultures-meteoric-rise","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-29T09:27:10Z","webTitle":"Is hearing loss in farmed fish a price worth paying for aquaculture’s meteoric rise?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/world-on-a-plate/2017/aug/29/is-hearing-loss-in-farmed-fish-a-price-worth-paying-for-aquacultures-meteoric-rise","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/world-on-a-plate/2017/aug/29/is-hearing-loss-in-farmed-fish-a-price-worth-paying-for-aquacultures-meteoric-rise","fields":{"headline":"Is hearing loss in farmed fish a price worth paying for aquaculture’s meteoric rise?","bodyText":"To grasp the wide-ranging impacts of our industrial food systems, take a peek inside a salmon’s ear. That’s what marine biologist Tormey Reimer did when, in 2013 at the University of Melbourne, she began to investigate deformities that were developing on the structures that salmon use to hear. Bony fish species have structures called otoliths in their ears, small crystals that they use to detect sound. Biologists have for decades relied on otoliths to age fish, using them like rings on a tree. But what Reimer saw was an altogether larger, lighter, and more transparent crystal called a vaterite, growing into the otolith and obstructing the fish’s ability to hear. “I did a bit of digging and found it was much more common in farmed salmon than wild,” she says. And, she began to suspect it had something to do with the accelerated growth rates in fish farms. Now, in a recent paper, she’s confirmed that hunch. By surveying groups of farmed salmon, Reimer discovered that the biggest feature underpinning a salmon’s likelihood of developing vaterites – beyond diet, and genetics – was their growth speed. “The fastest-growing fish were three times more likely to have vaterites than the slow-growing fish,” Reimer says. Farmed fish typically get high-nutrient feed, and are exposed to longer light conditions than they would experience in the wild. Because salmon will eat whenever it’s light, this system creates constantly guzzling fish that grow faster and more efficiently. Reimer still doesn’t know precisely why faster growth leads to vaterite formation; one theory is that it might have something to do with rapid skeletal growth, which could usurp resources intended for the proper development of otoliths. But she does know that fish afflicted with vaterites will have impaired hearing for life. “I see this as one of many puzzle pieces in animal welfare,” she says. “What’s surprising is that we’ve known about most of the issues in aquaculture for a really long time, but this is a brand new one that’s just popped up.” Aquaculture has reached such a scale and degree of efficiency that hearing-impaired fish have simply become an artefact of its success. Crowded conditions and disease outbreaks are already problems that the industry has to tackle; adding a human-caused disability to that list takes the concern to a new high. And it’s only likely to intensify. Aquaculture is now the fastest-growing sector of food production. Roughly half –probably more – of the fish we produce worldwide comes from farms. All this is set against a backdrop of globally dwindling and stagnating wild fisheries, which also increases aquaculture’s desirability on a global stage. What does this mean for the industry’s future, and the welfare of the farmed fish we’ll come to rely on more and more? “There’s only so much wild fish you can pull from the ocean, and it’s not going to grow. We need more fish and it’s going to come from aquaculture,” says Rebecca Gentry, a marine ecologist at the University of California, Santa Barbara. She’s the author on another recent study that explored a different concern in aquaculture: productivity. In the research she found that every coastal country on the planet technically could meet its seafood needs – and do so sustainably – via offshore fish farming in only a small portion of its coastal waters. By identifying only the most suitable habitat for aquaculture globally – areas of ocean with the right depth for fish farms, and which exist outside marine protected areas and busy shipping lanes – Gentry proved that we could produce 100 times our current seafood needs. Crucially, she showed that in countries whose populations experience serious food insecurity, aquaculture can provide a cheap and reliable source of protein. The limits on the success of marine aquaculture aren’t space, which is in abundance, the study concluded. Instead, it’s economics, and governance, that will determine aquaculture’s future. Another major limitation is aquaculture’s poor reputation, marred by problems like the persistent outbreaks of viral disease, which spread rapidly in the close quarters and often beyond the farm enclosures to infect wild fish. The antibiotics and pesticides used to control these outbreaks in turn often pollute the surrounding waters. But as Gentry’s study shows, aquaculture also has the power to solve some of our most pressing food security concerns, because by creating an abundant supply of farmed fish, it lessens the pressure on overfished stocks. “It’s not black and white. Aquaculture has, and hasn’t, done really well. I mean, mowing down mangroves for shrimp farms – that’s so red hot, sustainably,” Gentry says. “We need to step back and think, what is sustainable aquaculture?” And, how does the welfare of of salmon – and other fish – slot into that goal? The problem is big enough to consider seriously. In another previous study, Reimer was part of a team that sampled Norwegian hatchery-raised salmon, and discovered that almost all of the fish in the sample were afflicted with vaterites. When she compared the results with studies on other farmed fish, she found that the rate was similarly high. “Vaterite has been found in other farmed fish species: in carp, eel, red drum. So I do believe that really any fish that has an otolith and is farmed in a way that maximises growth rate, should be looked at to see if this is affecting them,” Reimer says. At such a scale, this should push us to examine the ethics of fish farming as we expand aquaculture, the same way we might do for cattle, poultry, and pigs. “It may not seem like a big deal to say that many farmed fish are hearing impaired. But if you were to say to someone that a high proportion of the cows you eat are blind in the field, there would be an uproar,” Reimer says. It’s true that fish hardly inspire the same degree of affection as the mammals we farm. But it’s more than a question of emotion; it’s also a practical issue that aquaculture companies can’t ignore. Many countries, including the UK, demand the “Five Freedoms” for all farmed animals, including fish. One of these requires that animals be capable of expressing normal behaviours. That’s a freedom that Reimer and colleagues assume that hearing-impaired salmon do not enjoy. None of this is intended to undermine aquaculture, she says. “Farmers want to grow fish as quickly as possible and get them to market. I wouldn’t expect aquaculture companies to reduce growth rates.” Instead Reimer hopes for further research to illuminate what’s really going on, perhaps hitting on a way to reduce the risk of vaterites, maybe via diet, while still keeping growth rates intact. “It’s a good opportunity to put the resources into that research and to get it solved as quickly as possible. Through ignorance, we have let it go on for quite some time.” Certainly, as aquaculture continues its global spread, we’ll need to find creative and varied solutions to the challenges that will inevitably arise. The case of the deafened salmon is omen-like, crystallising some of the biggest concerns about aquaculture’s future growth. It brings to our plates an uncomfortable awareness about the huge scope of damage that our food systems can create. And yet, if we do it well, aquaculture could also become an invaluable tool for fixing some of the damage we’ve wrought through our traditional fisheries. Pragmatically, Reimer says: “While they’re both doing terrible things to the environment, one can be improved. The other cannot.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/aug/30/simon-birmingham-says-universities-will-have-to-learn-to-live-with-cuts-and-fee-increases","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-29T18:01:03Z","webTitle":"Simon Birmingham says universities will have to learn to live with cuts and fee increases","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/aug/30/simon-birmingham-says-universities-will-have-to-learn-to-live-with-cuts-and-fee-increases","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/aug/30/simon-birmingham-says-universities-will-have-to-learn-to-live-with-cuts-and-fee-increases","fields":{"headline":"Simon Birmingham says universities will have to learn to live with cuts and fee increases","bodyText":"The education minister, Simon Birmingham, has defended the government’s package of university cuts, arguing that vice-chancellors would manage to find savings and noting that they also supported fee increases until recently. In a speech to the Australian Financial Review’s higher education conference to be delivered on Wednesday, Birmingham says the government’s “credible plan back to surplus ... requires higher education to make a contribution”. Before the May budget the Turnbull government revealed its plan to cut the university sector by $2.8bn through a two-year efficiency dividend and a 7.5% cumulative fee increase by 2021. The package, which includes lowering the Help debt repayment threshold to $42,000, does not yet have sufficient Senate crossbench support to pass. In the speech, seen by Guardian Australia, Birmingham accuses Bill Shorten of “political opportunism” for opposing university cuts when the Gillard government proposed $6bn in savings from the sector in the 2013 budget. “I’m confident that university leaders, including many intelligent people in this room, can manage the proposed 2.5% efficiency dividend on [commonwealth grants] funding to be levied in 2018 and 2019,” he says. Birmingham suggests universities consider economies of scale, efficiencies from new technology and modernising work and teaching practices, accusing “some in the sector” of behaving as if “the basic laws of business and economics” don’t apply to universities. Despite the cut, funding of universities from all government sources is set to increase by 23% from 2017 to 2021, he says. Birmingham will say the proposed fee increase is the first in a decade. “I note that some vice-chancellors have expressed concern at these modest fee increases, yet all but one VC supported full fee-deregulation as part of the previous package.” Birmingham says that if the government funded the university sector at the rates it did in 1989, with no Help loans to students, they would receive $4,300 less than they currently do per student place. “So, my challenge to those prophets of doom is to answer this question … What world would you prefer?” On Tuesday the Universities Australia chair, Margaret Gardner, queried why the government did not start the reform discussion by asking “what is necessary for the continuation or acceleration” of Australian universities’ success. She said higher education had made a “nation-building contribution” to Australia, citing the fact international education is the nation’s third-largest export. “I see little understanding of where, in universities, the efficiencies have been made, the innovations seeded and implanted, the risks taken and those risks that still need to be taken.” Gardner said that while innovations created by universities were lauded the “real test of government policy intention can be seen in its legislation”, citing cuts including that “funding per student will be cut and students asked to pay more for a less well-resourced education”. She warned that cuts would leave “a number of institutions in higher and vocational education ... at greater risk, creating uncertainty for their staff and students, the communities they serve and the markets in which they operate”. On Monday the Australian Financial Review reported that Birmingham was considering an alternative package of cuts if the Senate attempted to block the government’s plan. Denying the substance of the story, Birmingham said he was “focused on legislating what was announced in the budget, which is the best way of achieving sustainability in higher education”. Senator Nick Xenophon reportedly said that, while he and his colleagues had not made a final decision, they had “serious concerns” with the package."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/live/2017/aug/30/bangladesh-v-australia-first-test-day-four-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-30T07:52:42Z","webTitle":"Bangladesh beat Australia on day four of first Test – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2017/aug/30/bangladesh-v-australia-first-test-day-four-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/live/2017/aug/30/bangladesh-v-australia-first-test-day-four-live","fields":{"headline":"Bangladesh beat Australia on day four of first Test – as it happened","bodyText":"On that note, I must run. Steve Smith is about to start his media conference. Thanks for your wonderful company this week. We’ve had a classic. Can’t wait to do it all again in Chittagong on the 4th. Here’s an initial match report: The captains at the presentation. The Prime Minister is there. She was in for the final bit. Nice touch. Right, Steve Smith first. “It was a great Test March Credit to Bangladesh the way they plaeyd. The fist innings the parntership between Shakib and Tamim set up the game for them.” “We let ourselves down a bit in the fist innings with the bat. It was quite difficult batting in the second inning here and I thought we did quite well getting 240 in the end.” “I thought the tail did a terrific job for us, they helped the batters out alot in this Test Match. It’s upon the batters to go out, especially in the first innings, to go and get a big score. That was probably the difference in the end.” “No excuse for us, we prepared really well and the practice wickets were fantastic.” “It spun from day one, and today was there as more variable bounce than the first innings, but we let ouerselves down in teh first innings.” The presentation. About to start on the field. Stand by for what Steve Smith and Mushfiqur Rahim have to say. Plenty, I suspect. The spinners. All ten wickets between them in the second dig, expertly rotated by Mushfiqur when it mattered most. Shakib the mainstay, bowling all day from one end. Mehedi’s return brought a wicket inside two balls, the penultimate required, and Taijul got the winner within moments of his. Shakib’s 50th Test finishes the way it deserves for a champion of this game, five wickets in each innings to go with a vital 84 on day one, the highest score for Bangladesh in either innings. He’s the top-billed all-rounder on the planet for a reason, and he’s shown it at Mirpur. England, Sri Lanka, Australia. Bangladesh have knocked off each of them for the first time inside ten months. Back to back victories at their home of cricket Dhaka, quickly becoming a fortress. Cummins resistance would powerful and most worthy, taking Australia again to the brink, but a familiar collapse either side of the lunch interval meant the damage was done. Coming the day after West Indies mounted the least likely series comeback in modern memory, this is proof positive that Test cricket is alive and well. Make no mistake about it. The bowling change has worked, Taijul goes around the wicket to Hazlewood and beats his stoic defence, trapping the left-hander plum in front. Bangladesh have beaten Australia for the first time. It is a glorious scene, the press box erupts, the stands go wild. What a moment. What a Test Match. 70th over: Australia 244-9 (Cummins 33, Hazlewood 0) 21 to win as the over begins. Shakib into his 28th over. Cummins respectful of the man who has five and nine for the match. Watching despite all the men out and only one in close alongside the slip. Two balls to go but the field isn’t brought up. Sloppy captaincy? Does he wait until the sixth? He does. Defends again. Field in now? No. Five men remain out. Bold from Mushfiqur. But beautifully done by Shakib, ensuring Cummins has to pat it back. A maiden. Deep breath, Australia. 69th over: Australia 244-9 (Cummins 33, Hazlewood 0) Standing tall, Cummins goes BIG to Mehedi’s first ball here, over the square leg boundary. Not for nothing given three men are already out there. A fourth now joins them. He goes for it regardless, albeit without making contact, gloving over the ‘keeper. And again: lashing the off-spin behind square leg with force for two, a nice diving stop by one of the various sweepers. It prompts a mid-over chat between captain Mushfiqur and his bowler. The batsmen conference as well. Cummins defends a slightly shorter ball. Intrigue. Up comes midwicket with two balls to go. HE GOES AGAIN! SIX OVER SQUARE LEG! This has gone further again! 22 to win! Last ball - single, hacking. Matters not: strike retained. BLOODY HELL! 15 from it. Ladies and gents, you are witnessing a classic. 68th over: Australia 229-9 (Cummins 18, Hazlewood 0) Only one man catching for Cummins, the field spread to encourage him to turn the strike to Hazlewood. He does precisely that with a drive down the ground off Shakib’s penultimate delivery. He defends. 67th over: Australia 228-9 (Cummins 17 Hazlewood 0) Hazlewood the last man. On his way home tomorrow, what will his final act before the injury lay off deliver? We’ve seen him bat very competently at no. 11, including a vital 40-odd in Dominica a couple of years back to help Adam Voges to the most unlikely of tons on debut. But mostly, he can stick around. He does that well enough here, well forward to the remainder of Mehedi’s over. A wicket maiden. Fantastic bowling change. Mehedi is back, at last, and second ball he’s broken this nagging partnership up! Lyon keeps on sweeping, but this doesn’t turn as he might expect, collecting a glove before going straight up, Soumya having enough time to race around behind the captain Mushfiqur to complete the dismissal. One wicket to go for Bangladesh. 66th over: Australia 228-8 (Cummins 17, Lyon 12) Was it 42 to win as well when McDermott and May came together in Adelaide 1993? Around that. Sorry. SORRY. I’ll be quiet. Lyon kicks a leg bye. Cummins turn leans into a delightful cover drive, splitting the gap expertly. On the up and everything. Shot of the day. Taking Australia inside 40 now. Tick. They’ve put on 29. Martin Gillam has a correction to the Tom Morris tweet I shared before: “Sorry to correct Tom Morris, but Shakib is NOT the first to make 80 plus ten wickets -- Alan Davidson scored 80 and took eleven wickets in the 1960 tied test at the Gabba.” 65th over: Australia 223-8 (Cummins 13, Lyon 12) Taijul. I still think Mehedi to finish it. Who knows. Cummins does: back over his head, down to long on for a boundary. Didn’t get absolutely all of it, but plenty for it to reach the rope. That takes us inside the First/Centurary Test 45-run margin, which I predicted pre-play as the Bangladesh winning margin. Knocks it on the head to finish off. I learned today there is nothing more highly regarded in Bangladesh cricket than a batsmen who defends the ball after hitting a six. A bit like the preoccupation in Jamaica with twin tons (they will love Shai Hope right now). 64th over: Australia 218-8 (Cummins 9, Lyon 12) Another missed Lyon sweep. He’s definitely just playing his natural game, as they say. I’ve said this a million times, but he hit 90 off 50 balls in a 2010 game when we played at the same club before the whole journey began for him. Anyway, I’ll shut up. Sweeps again, for one. Cummins fine when defending. 63rd over: Australia 217-8 (Cummins 9, Lyon 11) Another shout for lbw with Lyon sweeping! Again given not out. It was hitting, TV shows afterwards, but not in line. No reviews. Cummins does enough up the other end to get through another quality Taijul over. 62nd over: Australia 216-8 (Cummins 9, Lyon 10) Couple to Cummins off an inside edge down to fine leg to begin. They’ll take them however they can get them. Later on, a much better shot, cutting Shakib hard through the gap at point to the rope. Crowd momentarily silenced. Three around the bat. And a chance to one of them! Soumya drops Cummins! It bounced and turned and he went with one hand high. We’ve been saying up here all week that he’s standing too close for the spinners and that looks the case again here. 61st over: Australia 210-8 (Cummins 3, Lyon 10) Taijul to Lyon. Hits Lyon second ball on the pad when he’s trying to score to the legside. Turned down. No reviews. Lyon sweeps hard and well for a second boundary. In the air but effective. He tries again, but misses. Back in defence to end the over. 55 now to win. Bangladesh fan Shammi Huda wrote to me at lunch speaking of a “sinking feeling” about their prospects. Not so sure about that! But that’s been the case all week from the local journos too. They want to see it happen before they will believe. Could that pervade the thinking of the players out there as well? It needn’t. 60th over: Australia 206-8 (Cummins 3, Lyon 6) Shakib stays around the wicket as well. Cummins gets a long way forward with those big legs of his. Carbon copies, one ball after the next. A silly point, short leg, leg slip and conventional slip the catching men. Some extra flight gets the same response. Last ball holds up with some bounce, hitting the pad, but high. Only half an appeal. Maiden. Lyon’s turn. 59th over: Australia 206-8 (Cummins 3, Lyon 6) Every ball is met with a roar. Lyon flirts with danger, an underedge onto his pad when sweeping another that shoots. He makes contact with the next attempt, a sweeper out there to defend against the stroke. They’ve done their homework. Tweaks to the field for Cummins, a catching cover alongside three men in close. Taijul penetratating from around the wicket with his left-arm spin. Cummins uses soft hands to deflect one out past backward point to keep the strike next over. 58th over: Australia 204-8 (Cummins 2, Lyon 5) Lyon the tenth Australian in, ahead of Hazlewood. He gets off the mark with the shot he plays best: the sweep. He’s struck it beautifully too, to the rope to bring up Australia’s 200 for what that is worth at this stage. A single in that direction too. Four men around the bat to Cummins, two either side. Huge shout for LBW! Turned down by Aleem. So much pressure on the officials now with no DRS referrals left. It is missing leg, good decision. 61 to win. Goodness me! First ball after the break! FIRST BALL! Maxwell goes back to a Shakib delivery, makes room on the legside to try and take him through the off, but it doesn’t turn and keeps a fraction low. He misses, the masterful all-rounder hits. He has five. Bangladesh are all but home at Dhaka. And the crowd meet them with a wild reception in the top deck to our right. Here we go. 57th over: Australia 199-7 (Maxwell 14, Cummins 2) The review precludes another over being taken by Bangladesh before the break, the clock striking midday as the last Taijul ball is bowled. It’s a ripper, beating Cummins outside the edge again. That is lunch. What can you say about that? A frenetic session living up to every expectation. Australia lost five wickets, the bulk of which came in the second hour. Until then, they remained in cruise control with Warner and Smith, the former bringing up his 19th Test ton along the way - a mighty one. But it was always going to be the case that one Australian wicket would expose a middle order known for collapsing in exactly these circumstances. When Smith fell shortly after Shahib nabbing both of the visiting leaders, it was very much game on. Handscomb edged when cutting, Wade was Shakib’s ninth for the match when missing a straight one, Agar returned a catch to Taijul, his second for the session. Maxwell remained and didn’t do a thing wrong, but will need to keep doing plenty right with only Cummins, an injured Hazlewood and Lyon left. Cummins, of course, was there for the winning runs on debut. He’ll need to pull of an innings of similar strenght to repeat the dose. Maxwell has the chance to steer a famous come from behind win. He’ll have to if it is to happen. See you in about half an hour for what promises to be a pulsating final stanza. NOT OUT! Straightened nicely, but not hitting, not overturned. All the reviews are gone and they won’t be going for 80 overs at this rate, so that’s it for DRS in this Test. HAS TAIJUL TRAPPED CUMMINS? Umpire Llong said no. They waited a long time to go upstairs. But here we are. 56th over: Australia 198-7 (Maxwell 13, Cummins 2) Full faith in his number nine, and fair enough too, Maxwell takes one to cover from the second ball. Generous amount of sweepers in play when he is on strike. Cummins defends, even a full toss, showing his plan to lunch at least. Must be there at lunch to stall this wave of momentum. The ground is heaving. Shakib misses with his last one though, Cummins getting enough on it down the legside for a couple. Two overs to the break, it’ll be. It’s not a good way to go for Ashton Agar, returning a catch to Taijul trying to force the pace down the ground and misjudging the trajectory, not getting enough of it to beat the bowler in his follow through. So much for that, then! Just when he looked like he was fitting right in out there. Maxwell now in a tough spot. When does he launch? Not before lunch, obviously. Eight minutes to that break. But there might come a time when MaxwellBall becomes the best way through. 55th over: Australia 195-7 (Maxwell 12, Cummins 0) 54th over: Australia 195-6 (Maxwell 12, Agar 2) Shakib to Agar. Looks alright. Three singles taken to end the over, in a relatively risk-free fashion out to sweepers, to keep it ticking over. Calm enough, considering. Oh dear, the Wade verdict is brutal on the world wide web. Not least on your emails to me. The game is frantic, so I won’t dwell. But from Scott Lowe: “I feel bad for Wade but he is clearly out of his depth in Asia and continues to fail. If you cant trust him, why include him?” And Jonathan Israel: “Can you do your best to justify why Matthew Wade has managed to hold his place in this side? In his last 20 test innings, he’s averaged below 20, scored one 50, and his keeping has arguably not been up to scratch relative to the competition. What are your thoughts on Carey, Whiteman, Nevill taking his place?” I just reckon he was brought back for the wrong reasons. Plenty of time to explore that after this is all over, one way or another. 53rd over: Australia 192-6 (Maxwell 11, Agar 0) Taijul again. Mehedi gotta be back in at some point. Sure, he bowled poorly earlier. But that was Smith and Warner doing as they pleased. Different world now. Class rises, etc etc. Anyway, Maxwell sticking true to his pre-series words that he would be relentlessly defence first over here, as he was at Ranchi. No consideration of a scoring shot here. It’s the right decision. He could lead Australia to victory here and do himself no end of good. Throws it away, no one will forgive him. Not easy being The Big Show sometimes. 52nd over: Australia 192-6 (Maxwell 11, Agar 0) Agar gets through the first couple, not before another shout to end the Shakib set. Look, to be perfectly honest, Agar was always a better bet in this situation than Wade. Showed in the first dig he has the tekkers for this continent. And Maxwell will keep it ticking over. No need for either to panic. Having said that, I’m sure one of them will do something stupid to make me look daft. But for now, not the worst pair to back in. There, I’ve said it. But a looooong way to go. Couldn’t leave Lyon and (injured) Hazlewood many with spin of this quality and a track with these demons. 20 minutes to lunch. It isn’t a good review, hitting in line and definitely hitting the middle stump. Wade just caught on the crease, missing on the inside edge for the second time in this match. Not much more to it than that. Have to feel for him after the torrid time he had yesterday sticking it out behind the stumps, but his batting again fails an important test. It leaves Australia in a very difficult position to win from here, the crowd (and press box!) going wild. 73 needed. IS WADE LBW? UMPIRE DAR SAYS SHAKIB HAS GOT HIM. Wade goes upstairs! Drama! 51st over: Australia 192-5 (Maxwell 11, Wade 4) Singles to each to begin, Wade timing well to midwicket, Maxwell pushing out to cover with ease. Wade also gets one with a glance. Okay, progress. 50th over: Australia 189-5 (Maxwell 10, Wade 2) 32 minutes to lunch. Many of the local journos are watching this from their feet. You can’t begrudge them riding this home, many have seen the bulk of the 101 Tests they have played since earning full-member status in 2000, for only nine wins. On the field, Wade sweeps and nearly is bowled via a deflection from the edge! Hands on head from Shakib, who’s marathon continues. Wade gets off strike to the penultimate ball, meaning his examination will continue. Mehedi might be worth another shout here, he ran through England in very similar circumstances last October. But it will be Taijul for now, who creating chances too. “I need to be in front of a television! This is marvellous stuff. I’d give Bangladesh the edge now but have been wrong before.” Phil Withall is right. A joy to be here to witness a truly great Test. Couple more twists coming, surely. 49th over: Australia 188-5 (Maxwell 10, Wade 1) How’s the pressure on Matt Wade? One half-century in his ninth Test since coming back into the team. 30 byes in the game. Out as soon as he arrived in the first dig. Hanging by a thread in this team by any measure. Coming in with a lot of work to do, make no mistake, with Australia losing three wickets in quick succession. After him, the bowlers. Albeit a couple of very sensible ones with bat in hand in Agar and Cummins. There with Maxwell, who he had a publc stoush with last November. Hooley dooley. Off the mark first ball off his pads. Maxwell ferocious in defence to see it out from there. Handscomb cuts, edges, gone! In keeping with the theme of this Test, every time you think you can pick the trend, something happens. It’s high on the bat but flying to slip, Soumya - who has had a difficult old Test back there - juggles but eventually takes the chance. Five wickets to get, 77 required. What. A. Test. Match. 48th over: Australia 187-4 (Handscomb 15, Maxwell 10) I want to give some context: Australia needed 87 to win six wickets in hand in Bangalore back in March, only to lose by 75 runs. Sure, there’s no Ashwin to bring on a 6-for-11 collapse today, but still. Handscomb was out there through most of that as well, the penultimate wicket to fall if I recall correctly (and I do, let’s be real). But forget about that, for this is a HUGE OVER for Australia against the flow of play. 93 to win becomes 78, moving through the 80s at a quicker pace than Elton John did. Handscomb: dancing, over cover. Then Maxwell: sweeping, expertly. Him again: a fat edge, but no real danger. A couple more tucked away to end it. Where did that come from? 47th over: Australia 172-4 (Handscomb 10, Maxwell 0) Taijul to Handscomb. Beats his edge first up! That’s where he needs to be, forcing him to worry about his stumps. This misses everything, but only just. The Australian works into the over thereafter, making solid contact in defence. Grabs one around the corner to keep the strike. 46th over: Australia 171-4 (Handscomb 9, Maxwell 0) Shakib has had a marvellous 50th Test, the world’s number one ranked all-rounder top scoring with 84, then picking up a 5-fer, and has three of four the wickets to fall in this second dig as well. While bowling unchanged from the far end throughout this morning session as well. Maxwell is the new man, the Victorian duo having plenty left to do. They are both in their baggy greens, looking the part. The first and only ball he has to see off this over seen off easily enough with three men surrounding his bat. There is it! Double breakthrough for Bangladesh, and it’s the skipper who is feathering Shakib into the gloves of the captain off the back foot. A relatively inoccuous delivery that he’s tried to steer, perhaps a bit close to his body. All over. With 94 to get, we have a ball game again! 45th over: Australia 170-3 (Smith 37, Handscomb 8) Edge from Smith to begin the Taijul over, but nowhere near a catcher, well wide of the catchers. Profits by four. That’ll frustrate Bangladesh. Smith keeps plugging away in the last over before drinks, marking his guard viciously after every ball. Taijul generating plenty of spin, but more often than not from balls alread pitching outside the off-stump. So when Smith is beaten he’s able to withdraw the blade and play inside the line. There’s an appeal for lbw too from the one that doesn’t spin, but they are wise not to go upstairs as it is all inside edge, no pad. Initially at least. Right, that’s drinks. Breathe. 44th over: Australia 166-3 (Smith 33, Handscomb 8) Shakib again, so it stays with two left-arm finger spin operators. No seam seem today. Still reckon Mustafiz worth a blast. Anyway, Handscomb is coming down the track then going back to where he is more comfortable early in an innings. One spins huge, but he doesn’t follow it with his gloves. Good batting. Even batting: the sweep he nails to finish the over, racing away to beat the sweeper, who is slow on it. Australia need 99 to win. A nice mental hurdle to clear in any chase. 43rd over: Australia 162-3 (Smith 33, Handscomb 4) Taijul returns after a brief Mehedi stint. And immediately hitting the Victorian’s pad and up! But not going enough from around the wicket. Play on. He’s clipping the best way he knows how, from the deep in the crease, for a couple. Then again for one, later in the set. He showed at the Rancho Relaxo in March that he has the skillz for this very environment deep into a Test. 42nd over: Australia 159-3 (Smith 33, Handscomb 1) The new man Handscomb off the mark first ball behind square, the only he needs to negotiate from the Shakib over, so he’ll retain the strike. “Do you think Warner has changed his technique, or simply changed his mental approach?,” says Frank Kelloway, who adds nice things about the OBO. Thank you, Frank. “As a Geelong Cats supporter, I think I remember you as a the man who used to carry the life-sized cardboard cut-out of Jason Dunstall.” Blimey. The things you get known for in this world. That is, indeed, me. No regrets. He is! Attempting to pull across the line from a ball that’s keeping a fraction low. Immediately given by Aleem Dar, and quickly confirmed as three red lights by third ump Gould, no edge on the way through to save him either. The end of a quite magnificent hand from Warner, taking Australia to 107 of victory. But still, it is an opening for the hosts. The precious incision they have waited 51 mintutes for today. Can they capitalise? IS WARNER LBW TO SHAKIB? We’ll find out. Bangladesh upstairs. 41st over: Australia 152-2 (Warner 106, Smith 33) Good news I can report from the CA camp: back home Mitchell Starc has started bowling again. A good morning to England readers. But let’s ignore Ashes while this is in front of us. Mehedi is back. Doesn’t change Warner’s approach, an easy single to the deep. Smith dropped! Out to mid-on, not snaffled, down to the rope. Both feet off the ground when it went down, but even so. Half/quarter chances need to be taken by the hosts from here. Some SOK chat on the email. “None of these blokes would be there if they were sanctioned for getting pissed and mouthing off,” writes Graham Crouch. “Do we want to win Test matches or be courteous and responsible citizens? Not to condone SOK’s behaviour of course.” I’ll take that as a comment. Complex, isn’t it? Murray Henman, too: “Without knowing the details of what happened at the dinner, it’s hard to make a judgement call. I’m all for forgiveness as long as the offender shows genuine contrition, but he has history in being a wanker.” There are reports of what he did, which I won’t rehash. I believe his contrition, though, for what little that is worth. 40th over: Australia 147-2 (Warner 104, Smith 29) Bit of a conference between overs with the umpires. Perhaps ball related? Anyway, they get on with it, Shakib to go again. Warner doing it easy now, in complete ODI mode, a single to long-on first ball of the set. Smith down the business end, cops a beauty from the left-armer who has changed approach to go around the wicket to the skipper now in order to open up the angle. But as we saw in Pune when he was beaten outside the line by Jadeja time and again with huge turners, it doesn’t much bother him. Back to solid defence to see it out. Mark Allsop on the email enjoying the work of the Australian leadership axis. “It is refreshing to see an Australian Captain and Vice-Captain honour their roles by batting in the requisite manner. The final session yesterday was as entertaining cricket as there has been for a while with the leaders leading from the front.” Too right. A fair bit of scrutiny about the importance of these two compared to the rest, but they are revered for a reason. 39th over: Australia 146-2 (Warner 104, Smith 29) Second in Asia, second in 2017. And what a mighty hand it has been. Two out to extra cover to the first ball of the new over gets him the required runs, a huge jump in the air follows in that familiar form. An equally effusive hug with his skipper. These two have put on over 100 now, and have Australia in the box seat for an excellent come-from-behind win. “I think this will go down as one of his finest,” says BJ on the telly. I tend to agree. Adam Gilchrist said the 144 he made in Fattulah with Australia in the hole there was one of the best of his famous career, and there are comparisons to be made without a doubt. 19 centuries in 65 Tests is a wonderful clip as well, on track to reach 20 quicker than all but a handful. Three further runs from the Taijul over. Time to shake it up, Mushfiqur. 119 left to get. 38th over: Australia 141-2 (Warner 99, Smith 29) After the DRS stress, Warner takes his 99th run down the long-on. A long-on when he’s on 99? Come on Mushfiqur! He had four sweepers in the penultimate over last night. Amusing moment on the review before where Gould accientally told Dar to change his decision, detailed below by Pete Lalor watching at home. Smith sees out the remainder of the over. Warner a run to get for a ton at the start of the next. NOT OUT! No glove, no spike, no breakthrough for Bangladesh. Aleem Dar vindicated by third umpire Gunner Gould. Relief for Warner. HAS WARNER GOT AN EDGE DOWN THE LEGSIDE? Given not out, sent upstairs! Out for 98? We will see! 37th over: Australia 139-2 (Warner 98, Smith 28) Warner is rapidly taking the game away from Bangladesh, three glorious boundaries from the opener, taking him into the 90s and then some, all of a sudden two short of a century! He slayed a sweep with perfect placement, came down to lash Taijul through cover, then repeats that stroke to end a significant over in the context of this fourth and final day. 125 required from here. 36th over: Australia 127-2 (Warner 86, Smith 28) A maiden from Shakib, who isn’t messing around out there. Making Smith play, eitiher with bat or pad, sticking over the wicket. Wonder whether they’ll give Mustafizur a quick blast here from that end just to shake it up a bit? Golden rule of captaincy when you need a wicket pronto: keep throwing the ball around. 35th over: Australia 127-2 (Warner 86, Smith 28) Taijul on. Didn’t expect that. Thought Mehedi would be set-and-forget from the commentary end all day. But he hasn’t started well, Warner on him. Gosh! The first delivery from the left-arm ortho has nearly taken his head off! Four byes, no chance. Could have hit anything. Massive bounce for a spinner. It warrants David Warner putting away his baggy green and calling for a helmet. A single to point follows, and one from Smith around off his hip as well. A shout for LBW ends the set, but it’s pretty ambitious. Pad well outside the line. Nah. No review. “SOK being called up is a joke,” growls @Beeso on the twitter. “I don’t understand how Oz selectors get away with this crap.” Well, there’s clearly a decision making framework that has been adjusted. They didn’t think they needed O’Keefe, on the available evidence on the track here, now they are convinced they do. Have the workaround of the sanction being issued by Cricket NSW, not CA. On pure cricketing terms, there’s no doubting he’s worthy of being here. It’s whether what happened on the tonk at the awards dinner warrants him being discarded. Any other strong views out there? 34th over: Australia 121-2 (Warner 85, Smith 27) How about Sokka getting the call up to replace Josh Hazlewood? Suspended by NSW, but not by Australia, evidently. Australia to go in with three spinners at Chittagong for the first time since 2006 in the corresponding fixture? Has to be a big chance. After being told his career was over, so it has been reported. Not quite a comeback of Tony Lockett proportions (and hopefully a more successful one), but not for nothing either. Right, back to the here and now, Shakib to Warner for the first time today. And they’re taking singles with relative ease. Nothing explosive about it, but bad early signs for Bangladesh. Down the ground, out to midwicket, through square leg. Smith tries to keep the strike tucking around the corner, but can’t beat the man on the 45. 12 runs in four overs. Steady. 33rd over: Australia 118-2 (Warner 83, Smith 26) Warner again on top of Mehedi, the only player in this match to really go after the teenage senation. The length isn’t quite on to begin, two cut out to deep point. Better still the quick-ish single taken to mid-off. That’s white-ball running from the pair, once again transferring keeping the pressure on. Around the wicket to Smith to end the over, as he is to both men now. 32nd over: Australia 115-2 (Warner 80, Smith 26) Shakib to begin from the other end. We’ve been here six days and never worked out what it was called. Way to go. He’s on the mark from the start, making Smith play. And the Australian captain is very lucky there, the last ball just about rolling on the ground! Fortunate for the fact that it pitched comfortably outside the leg stump when hitting his pad. Ominous if the spinners can get into Australia’s back half. But that remains an if with these two. 31st over: Australia 115-2 (Warner 80, Smith 26) Exactly the start Australia wanted and needed. Warner and Smith immediately away with singles, before the opener leans back and wallops a long-hop from Mehedi. One way to put the pressure back onto the home side straight away. He’s into the 80s. Australia an even 150 to go from here. Let’s converse. In the best OBO traditions. You know the drill by now: email for the best, twitter for the questionable. Astonishing finish at Headingley last night too. Test Match cricket: wouldn’t want it any other way. Read Andy Bull on that. Graeme Swann was in the BBC commentary box when the winning runs were hit - great stuff. I mention him as Nathan Lyon went past the England great’s 255 Test wickets yesterday with his sixth, making nine for the match. Handy week, after going beyond Benaud on the opening day, joining the 250 Club as well. I had a bit of a stats binge on Nath last night in a piece that starts with the time he met the great Electrified Tarantula early in his career. Lyon is the reason Australia are in this match, make no mistake. The Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium is the place to be this morning. School is out for Eid festival this Saturday and tickets are a premium, all of a sudden. Because their national side has the chance today to win their tenth Test in 17 years, the first ever against Australia. But that will require eight Australian wickets, with 156 runs to play with. Breaking that down further, it means they must strike early and get rid of either Warner or Smith. The former, on 75 overnight, was having a wordly out there yesterday. Aside from a sharp chance he gave to slip, it was a man we’ve seldom seen in Test cricket in this part of the world. As for Smith, who resumes on 25, he’s Smith. Nearly stumped first ball, and also giving a brisk chance - his to short leg - he was a model of calm through to the close. The perfect foil to Warner, who played his shots and saw local skipper Mushfiqur placing four men on the rope through the last half hour. But we all know can happen when the softer underbelly is exposed in this side on turning tracks, with two world-class spinners in Shakib and Mehedi probing away. One wicket, and they’re into this. And they know it. As for the weather, another lovely - albeit bloody hot - morning in Dhaka. I’ve sweated through my shirt on the way up to the box again. Classy. But I don’t care, because we have coming the grandstand finish that has felt destined all week. All the preconditions are there. You wouldn’t want to miss a moment, and that we won’t on the mighty OBO. Ride it out with me here through to the very end. Adam will be here shortly. In the meantime, here’s how day three – a good one for Australia – panned out:"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/aug/30/a-blot-on-the-landscape-queensland-calls-time-on-racist-place-names","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-29T18:00:03Z","webTitle":"'A blot on the landscape': Queensland calls time on racist place names","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/aug/30/a-blot-on-the-landscape-queensland-calls-time-on-racist-place-names","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/aug/30/a-blot-on-the-landscape-queensland-calls-time-on-racist-place-names","fields":{"headline":"'A blot on the landscape': Queensland calls time on racist place names","bodyText":"In 1973, a young Aboriginal legal service worker called Sam Watson was on a work trip in the Atherton Tablelands when he drove past a road sign bearing the name Nigger Creek. Watson stopped the car, and stole the sign. He half-wished a police officer would catch him in the act. “I just got a couple of tools out of the boot and liberated the sign. I thought, this is a blot on the landscape,” the now Brisbane-based activist says. Some 44 years later, Queensland authorities have caught up, wiping the name off the map of the Tablelands and in six other places around the state. On 14 August, the state’s Department of Natural Resources and Mines scrapped these and two other similar racist place names, Fairfax reported on Monday. It followed the department’s removal of another similar name from a north Queensland location in May. Complaints prompted the department to search its databases for other places bearing a “similarly offensive term”. Watson was instrumental in halting a bid earlier this year to change the name of Brisbane’s Boundary St in order to preserve a historical marker of the city’s past practice of racial segregation. But place names such as Nigger Creek are different, in that “those words are just placed on those creeks and other geographical features as an insult to Aboriginal people”, he says. “With those names, there was a certain [odour] associated with those places and Aboriginal people would certainly be encouraged not to go near those places. “There’s nothing to be gained by leaving those names be. “The word nigger is a word that doesn’t even belong in Australian culture, it’s a bastardisation of the word negro.” And it’s next to impossible to conceive of any place in contemporary America bearing the word, Watson adds. Another jarring vestige of American racism is thought have been the origin for one of two further Queensland place names which the department will soon be asked to erase. Mount Jim Crow, near Rockhampton, is most likely a reference to the US laws of black segregation of the same name, departmental officials have told Keppel MP Brittany Lauga and local Darumbal traditional owners. The department has no record of when or why the mountain - long known by traditional owners the Darumbal people as Bargar - was so named. What is known is that American soldiers in the second world war established a camp near the mountain at a place now called Artillery Road. “As far as we understand it’s directly related to the Jim Crow laws in the US, which of course were the black segregation laws, so the local Indigenous people are really quite ashamed of calling it Mount Jim Crow,” Lauga says. The mountain is a “local icon”, along with another sacred Darumbal place, Mount Wheeler, which elders will also apply to rename in a move Lauga plans to back to the hilt. There is a question over whether Mount Wheeler was named for “a local police sergeant who headed up the massacre of hundreds, if not thousands, of local Indigenous people” at the site or a local gold prospector, she says. “My argument is it’s a really sacred place for the Darumbal people and should be renamed regardless of whether it was a heinous police sergeant or a local gold prospector.” Traditional owner Sally Vea Vea said the Darumbal people, who obtained native title in June 2016, had applied to have Jim Crow renamed Bargar and Wheeler (traditionally knowns as Gawula) renamed Gaiee. Vea Vea has told Lauga that in one Darumbal dreamtime story, Bargar and Gawula were star-crossed lovers that the rainbow serpent banned from being together because their bloodlines were too close to marry. When they refused, the rainbow serpent punished them by making them mountains placed far enough apart that they could see each other but not touch. The Queensland government’s moves to wipe the most obviously offensive names from its map predated recent strife in the US over statues commemorating figures from the slave-owning secessionist confederacy of the south. However, the history wars have reignited in Australia, where the prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, likened vandalism of Sydney monuments of James Cook and Lachlan Macquarie to “Stalinist purges”, amid a debate about shifting Australia Day from the date of British colonisation. In Queensland, there are calls for memorials to paint the unvarnished historical context around men who had two of northern Australia’s largest cities named after them: Robert Towns and John Mackay, who were enmeshed in “blackbird” slave labour schemes exploiting the Pacific-born ancestors of contemporary Queenslanders. Place names such as Townsville and Mackay “commemorate particular individuals or particular events that are still quite open wounds”, Watson says. The question of whether there is merit in changing place names such as Murdering Creek, Skull Hole and The Leap – references to frontier violence against Aboriginal people – is one for consultation with local traditional owners, he says. Watson says he had the right, as a south Brisbane man associated with the local traditional owner community, to have his say on Boundary Street, where it was “not so much the name but the history of the place that needs to be preserved”. Lauga applauds a recently-announced push by the Northern Territory government to elevate the use of traditional Indigenous place names. “I think that it should be considered even where there isn’t a noxious place name currently,” she says. “Aboriginal culture is the longest ongoing culture in the world, so why not actually pay respect to that by renaming some of the traditional places back to what they were known for so much longer than their European names?” Watson says the changing of place names in Australia in respect for Indigenous people is “the first step”. “But surely, nationally, before anyone talks about reconciliation or treaty or whatever, Australia owes Aboriginal people an apology for the deaths and the suffering of thousands of Aboriginal people since 1788,” he says. “America has apologised to African-Americans for the slavery period. Germany had apologised to the Jewish people for the holocaust. “But the two great nations that have perpetrated genocide in the 20th century – Turkey with the Armenians with 1915, and Australia with the Aboriginal people – have never ever apologised for those horrific events.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/aug/30/as-cancer-progresses-some-patients-weep-some-get-angry-and-others-are-bewildered","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-30T02:14:29Z","webTitle":"As cancer progresses some patients weep, some get angry and others are bewildered | Ranjana Srivastava","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/aug/30/as-cancer-progresses-some-patients-weep-some-get-angry-and-others-are-bewildered","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/aug/30/as-cancer-progresses-some-patients-weep-some-get-angry-and-others-are-bewildered","fields":{"headline":"As cancer progresses some patients weep, some get angry and others are bewildered","bodyText":"“How do you keep calm when you see such terrible things?” my host quizzes me at a social event and I’m relieved that the tumult in my mind is not reflected on my face. Today was gut-wrenchingly difficult, I want to tell her. The seven years, spent in the shadow of a cancer diagnosis, have been broadly kind to my patient – the dark shadows on her scans visible but quiet, forcing me to find explanations she can relate to. With novel therapies, more and more patients like her find themselves inhabiting a twilight zone of feeling well but living with permanent uncertainty. “I feel fine,” she often says, puzzled. “I’m so pleased. Remember, not all cancers cause problems.” “Will it ever go away?” “Not completely.” Numerous such exchanges have lulled us into a sense of security, which no one interrogates as being true or false. For it is what it is – the beneficiary a wife and a mother who is grateful for the reprieve granted her at every visit. Why begrudge her the time in which she has seen her children grow? Why cloud their holidays with dire predictions that may come true next month or next year? She is the good news story no one wants to end. It turns out her doctor had arranged a scan to be helpful and now, she hands over the films. Silently, I line up the prints, having learnt long ago how much patients dislike small talk during this ritual. Suddenly, my heart quickens at the sight of unexpected new disease staring back at me. Looking closely doesn’t make it go away. The changes are small but they involve her vital organs and are a harbinger of the troubles that lie ahead. The floor shifts under me. “All good, doctor?” In the split second before I turn, I think of the knowledge in my hands that will irretrievably change her life. From here on, things will never be the same. Gone will be the relaxed appointments and the easy banter, in their place a revolving door of fears and concerns. A literal pronouncement that her cancer has spread will shatter her hopes and convince her that she is imminently dying. Bland advice to wait and see would be deceptive. I tense with the task of arranging my words and expression with extra care. “Actually, there are some new changes in the liver,” I begin with a calm I don’t feel. Her face falls but I continue, “They represent cancer.” This feels like a needless assault but it’s even more unbearable when patients sigh, “Thank god they’re only spots, not cancer.” Every oncologist learns this the hard way. “I know this is disappointing but it’s very small progression and there are many promising drugs.” I stop there, knowing the rest will go unheard. At the inevitable progression of their cancer, some patients weep, others are bewildered and yet others express anger. She sits absolutely still and much as I would like to stifle the silence with noisy plans of my own, I follow her cue. As much as I hate the silence, it is an appropriate homage to a lull that will never return. She asks to see her scans and I comply. She asks if she needs to start the new drug today and I say no. She asks if despite my disappointment, I will still be her doctor and my reserve gives way. “I am not disappointed in you,” I protest, tears now stinging the back of my eyes. “I am sorry it came back.” Her phone rings and she switches it off apologetically. “That’s mum, she always checks in.” “My mind feels wobbly,” she says. “I will ensure that you have access to the best available options and will look after you closely.” She leaves with a polite smile but my turmoil stays. Did she cry in the car or drive straight home? Did she call her mother back or spare her the sorrow? Did her husband take the day off or save up precious sick leave? And what did she do that night – feign normality at the dinner table or tell her children the truth? I calculate the dose of her next chemotherapy, thinking of the countless calculations she will inflict on herself about how long she has got. These worries used to discompose me but I have since realised that they are common to oncologists whose work knits close bonds with their patients. Our day is crowded with painful encounters but we can’t help it when our imagination is sometimes held captive by one. So I vex over drugs, trials and the literature. In between, I dread meeting her elderly mother and shudder at the thought of spotting her children in the waiting room. My mind runs ahead of itself and pictures her in hospice. I hastily rewind it and imagine still undiscovered drugs keeping her well indefinitely. And even as all these sentiments quarrel for attention, I remind myself that I have been here before and will be here again. These occurrences are an oncologist’s burden and privilege. It is why some doctors say they could never do this job and others couldn’t imagine doing anything else. The final consult of the day is with the son of a patient who bursts into tears. “I promised myself I wouldn’t cry but then I saw you.” “That’s my job,” I say half-despondently, but it makes him laugh. His card, which I open later, thanks me for an odd thing: “for worrying about Dad but not always in front of him”. It also credits the team for “showing compassion when we all knew you couldn’t save him”. His words prove like raindrops to parched earth. They remind me that to measure the entire doctor-patient relationship by a patient’s longevity is unfair to everyone and they console me that preserving one’s equanimity in front of patients is a good thing provided it doesn’t lead to a loss of empathy. When dealing with the challenges of the dying, the antidote to our own vulnerability lies in discovering meaningful ways to keep helping them. “I often wonder how you keep it together,” my host muses, clearly waiting for an answer. Lacking an erudite answer, I simply tell the truth. “It can be hard,” I reply, “until you remember how much harder it is for the patient.” He stops to ponder this, giving me just enough opportunity to slip away.

West Yorkshire police said they were taking the threats “extremely seriously” and had increased patrols in Hanover Square, a mainly Muslim inner-city area where at least two residents received the letters last week. The literature shows an image of a sword and the St George’s flag with the words: “Kill scum Muslims”. It questions why Muslim women wear burqas then states: “We are now going to do acid attacks on anyone who wears the funny black masks around your square &amp; Bradford &amp; other places.” It alleges that “three of ur male pigs” were grooming four white girls, then states: “We know who the three male pigs are they are walking dead pigs.” Police carried out extra patrols over the bank holiday weekend on Hanover Square, in the Manningham area of Bradford near the city centre. Naz Shah, the Bradford West MP, said she had reported the letters to police on Saturday. Mohammed Qayd, 27, one of the recipients of the letter, said his mother was afraid that she would be targeted and that the threats had come “completely out of the blue”. “I was shocked. My mum wears a burqa and she goes to town regularly so I was concerned for her. When I explained it to her she realised the severity of it and was afraid. You start wondering whether it’s safe to go out on their own.” Qayd said the letter was delivered by second-class post and had a Lancashire postmark, but that he believed it had been sent by someone who knows Hanover Square and its residents. Another recipient, who did not want to be identified beyond his first name, Shoab, said the letter could raise tensions before a planned English Defence League (EDL) march in Bradford on Saturday, which coincides with Eid celebrations. He said: “The police mentioned the EDL will be marching. It can worry you if you really think about it – what if they’re something to do with it? But the EDL have come and gone before, sometimes something tends to happen. It could erupt, you see. “Eid could be Friday or Saturday – a lot of times we’ll all be out to families, people go out to restaurants in the town centre. There’s always that chance something could happen.” Outside the Masjid Nimrah mosque, which broadcast a call for prayer on Monday lunchtime, Masood Ahmad, 43, said the threats had concerned residents. “Everybody’s shocked. There’s a lot of women in the street wearing the burqa,” he said. “I didn’t know about the EDL [march] but if this spreads out it might create a problem. It might be chaos here.” The letters follow a sharp rise in Islamophobic hate crime after the terror attacks on Westminster, Manchester and London Bridge. The spike in anti-Muslim incidents is thought to have fallen to normal levels following a surge of 500% in Greater Manchester in the month after the arena bombing. A West Yorkshire police spokeswoman said: “A thorough investigation has been launched and officers are working with the local community and partners to identify and prosecute those responsible for this despicable crime. “We understand the impact hate crime and hate incidents can have on our communities and on individuals, and crimes of this nature will not be tolerated.” Nadeem Murtuja, the chair of advocacy group Just Yorkshire, which was set up to restore race relations after the Bradford riots in 2001, said he was extremely concerned that Muslims were having to shave their beards or remove hijabs as a result of Islamaphobic threats. “This is a time for calm heads and people in positions of power, locally and nationally, need to become more visible in their stance towards protecting the human rights of all communities, including the Muslim community.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2017/aug/30/hank-williams-10-of-the-best","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-30T11:32:02Z","webTitle":"Hank Williams – 10 of the best","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/aug/30/hank-williams-10-of-the-best","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2017/aug/30/hank-williams-10-of-the-best","fields":{"headline":"Hank Williams – 10 of the best","bodyText":"1. I Saw the Light One of the most important artists in the history of recorded music, Hank Williams seemed to arrive fully formed into the post-second world war country-music landscape. But the Alabama native had spent years honing his craft. By the time he made his first records, for the Sterling label in 1947, Williams had extensively toured the south yet those releases failed to garner much attention. One song, Honky Tonkin’, had given Sterling’s A&amp;R consultant, Fred Rose, a sense that Williams had something special: Rose had just set up a music-publishing company with his friend, Nashville stalwart Roy Acuff, and, after signing Williams to the Acuff-Rose roster, brokered a deal for the singer-songwriter with a new label established by film studio MGM. The first MGM session didn’t bring Williams his breakthrough hit, but with Move It On Over he laid down a valuable marker, hinting at how country, when mixed with blues, would soon evolve into rock’n’roll. That day’s work also yielded I Saw the Light. In an era where pop songwriters were still for the most part reporters, standing at a distance from their subject and describing it for the listener, Williams took the lessons he’d learned as a child from a black street musician, Rufus “Tee-Tot” Payne, back home in Montgomery, and wrote a very personal piece of blues-infused gospel music. The idea for the song came from a late-night ride back from a gig, with the driver – his domineering mother, Lillie – shouting to wake him because she’d seen the light at the nearby airfield, so knew they were just about home. 2. Lovesick Blues Infamously recorded against Fred Rose’s wishes, something of a mystery to the players who performed on the session, and the subject of a lawsuit after it emerged that what Williams had led Rose to believe was an original song turned out to be a 1920s show tune, Lovesick Blues had an inauspicious birth. But it was the making of Hank Williams, its weird structure – the verses are choruses, there’s more than one middle-eight, the intro was copped from another song entirely – and his Jimmie Rodgers-like yodelling turning it from a novelty to a classic that topped charts for months after its release. Williams had been diagnosed in childhood with a spinal deformity, and a horse-riding accident in his teens left him in constant pain. Alcohol became his primary medicine, and those long drives in cramped cars through pre-interstate America, added to crippling shyness and stage fright, compounded the problem. Long before he hit the big time, Williams was a full-blown alcoholic. His reputation preceded him, to the degree that the Grand Ole Opry – the Nashville-based radio show that effectively determined who became a country star, and how long they remained at the top – had refused to book him. On 18 June 1949, Williams played the song on stage at the show’s Ryman Auditorium venue, and the raw promise Rose had seen just months earlier was transformed overnight into the stuff of legend. 3. Lost Highway Williams’ reputation today rests, in part, on his status as the artist who cemented the notion that the singer and the song had to be indivisible if the effect on the listener was to have sufficient resonance and depth. Yet Williams was also a fine interpreter of others’ songs, so much so that Lost Highway, written by Leon “I Love You Because” Payne, is often mistaken for a Williams original. The song’s protagonist seems to have ambled straight out of the dustbowl, an everyman doomed by luckless love to roam, rootless and alone, in constant search of redemptive purpose. Williams’ own struggle to reconcile the sacred and the profane certainly helped him wear Payne’s song as if it were one of Nudie Cohn’s trademark suits, but it’s his voice – cracked, careworn but never tired – that makes this the definitive reading of an all-time classic, and a high point in a career that had more than its share. 4. I’m So Lonesome I Could Cry Williams has been hailed as the “Hillbilly Shakespeare”, and the epithet fits in more ways than one. The idea of a largely self-taught, working-class genius clearly was to prove so unsettling to certain cultural gatekeepers that conspiracies of hidden helpers powering the art along are advanced as the only rational explanation. Even in as singular a body of work as Williams’s, I’m So Lonesome... is a shock. The idea of narrative is abandoned for a series of bleak visions of desperate, aching loneliness, almost all involving sights from nature – a train passes through, but the only human soul we sense in this desolate landscape is the writer. It isn’t until the penultimate line that we know for certain that this is a song about missing a particular person, rather than an examination of loneliness and isolation in the round: and even then it’s never made clear who that might be (a lover, presumably; but it could be a parent, a sibling, a child, a friend), nor why they’ve gone, nor whether there’s a realistic expectation that they’ll ever come back. Yet, more than anything in the lyric, Williams’ taut, resilient performance compels because you can hear the efforts he’s making to keep alive the faintest hope that the situation might yet be resolved. 5. Why Don’t You Love Me More than anyone who came before him – and in a way that would become de rigueur for every singer-songwriter worth their salt in the decades to follow – Williams was adept at mining his real-life travails to unearth the raw material he would carve into masterpieces. His tempestuous relationship with Audrey Sheppard began in 1943: the couple were married a year later, in a petrol station, just days after Audrey’s divorce from her first marriage came through. She became his manager and brokered Williams’ first meeting with Fred Rose: but her insistence on appearing on stage and on record with her husband caused tensions which his dependence on alcohol only worsened. Among the many songs that lay bare the pain and heartbreak of a love that’s falling apart, Williams also wrote just as vividly about the kinds of domestic storms that most folks could manage to weather. Why Don’t You Love Me is firmly in the latter camp, the tone playful, the song written from the perspective of the husband attempting to use jocularity to dig himself out of an argument he knows he was wrong to pick to start with (“My hair’s still curly and my eyes are still blue / Why don’t you love me like you used to do?”). There is a real power here – a sense that a determination to find something to laugh about, even in the midst of crisis, can help keep two people from tearing each other to pieces. Williams is rightly lauded for his bleak songs of irreparable heartbreak and irretrievable loss, but he was just as brilliant when writing about the times where the darkness hadn’t yet completely edged out the light. The 1950 session is also notable for marking the first time on record that Williams was able to record with the majority of his regular touring group, the Drifting Cowboys: hitherto, he’d been paired with session musicians on his records. Fred Rose often encouraged the Drifting Cowboys’ steel-guitar player, Don Helms, to play the highest notes possible, partly to help the records cut through the AM radio static and compensate for the limited fidelity most listeners would get from their radio sets. Helms’s high, lonesome playing, and to an only slightly lesser extent Jerry Rivers’ fiddle, became as defining features of the remainder of Williams’ output as their leader’s voice and writing. 6. Everything’s Okay With his records selling by the bucketload, Williams had the power to call his own shots, and he embarked on a series of recordings of talking blues, cautionary tales and verse-form morality plays set to music. MGM, wary of damaging the powerful Williams brand, agreed to release them as long as they were billed to an alias, so that jukebox owners and those putting their cents in the slot on expectation of hearing the next Williams hit wouldn’t end up getting an unexpected three-minute browbeating of their dissolute ways. Williams would sometimes refer to Luke the Drifter as “my half brother”, and there was no real secret about his real-life identity: after his early radio stints in Alabama, his residency on the Louisiana Hayride, and the expanded exposure brought by the Grand Ole Opry, Williams’ speaking voice was as familiar and distinctive as his singing voice. But the sermonising and the finger-wagging had selective appeal: for every record Luke the Drifter sold, Williams shifted dozens. Everything’s Okay shows that Williams was on to something with Luke, even if the numbers didn’t back him up. There is considerable humour in the song and Williams’ deadpan delivery milks the material for every last chuckle and wry smile. But the song’s real intentions are to offer something deeper and far more substantial. True, some of the things Uncle Bill is facing are in there as jokes – “my ma-in-law just moved in to stay”; “the preacher’s comin’ Sunday, to spend the day” – but they are heavily outnumbered by the biting problems many of Williams’ rural fan base would know all too well: “The weevils got the corn and the rain rotted the hay”; “the mortgage is due, and I can’t pay”; “we’re gonna have a new baby ’bout the first of May.” In the hands of an outsider, it would have come across as the songwriter laughing at the poor and their delusions. But Williams knew his people, and understood their lives: in his gentle, perceptive care, this story – made-up, yet consisting entirely of truths – becomes a hymn to the heroic stoicism of those able to do nothing but keep on keeping on. 7. Cold, Cold Heart The dualities embodied in Williams are perhaps nowhere more inextricably intertwined than in Cold, Cold Heart. Audrey was in hospital: the couple had been rowing, each suspecting the other of infidelity, Williams’ drinking turning every conversation into a potential battleground. He visited with gifts to try to make amends, and she threw them – and him – out. It requires courage, and perhaps a degree of clinical detachment, to turn an episode like that into a song – not to mention a particular mentality to describe it as among his favourite pieces of his own work. Tony Bennett covered it, to considerable commercial success, within weeks of its release: bandmates recall Williams delightedly playing that version any time they found it on the juke box in a diner or bar. However, what’s better than the original version is what appears to be its first public performance, recorded in January 1951, and available on a box set released in 2009 called Hank Williams Revealed. Williams and the Drifting Cowboys were under contract to perform every weekday during 1951 on a 15-minute breakfast show broadcast by the radio station WSM, and sponsored by the Mother’s Best flour company. When the band were on the road, pre-recorded shows were broadcast: a cache of 16-inch acetates containing 72 of these shows came to light when WSM was clearing out its archives and, after a legal battle, were released in the 2000s. The clarity of the recordings is often better than on Williams’ MGM releases, and the relaxed and informal nature of the sessions allows for some startling moments. 8. I Can’t Help It (If I’m Still In Love With You) The truth and the tragedy of Williams and Audrey’s relationship was that they loved each other despite the traits each possessed which prevented them from being able to sustain their happiness. Lycrecia, Audrey’s daughter from her first marriage, but who bridles at the term stepdaughter – “By law that’s what I am,” she said in a 2008 interview, “I realise that. But not really. He was my father in every sense of the word.” – doubts that the details in songs Williams is supposed to have written about himself and Audrey were real. But, as so often, the broader truths are unmistakable. The song grew from the opening line: “Today I passed you on the street / And my heart fell at your feet.” Even from a writer as sparing and economical as Williams, it’s a marvel: the subject is the briefest of moments, as former lovers brush against one another while walking in different directions. Whether or not that encounter happened as it is portrayed couldn’t matter any less: what’s clear is that the emotions the song describes are undoubtedly the ones Williams felt for Audrey. 9. Ramblin’ Man For all that his catalogue is full up to that Stetson brim with sad songs, Williams only released one record written entirely in a minor key. On its own, that might have been enough to make Ramblin’ Man stand out – but there is an otherworldly weirdness to the track that ensures it delivers and retains a unique power and potency. Originally recorded and released as a Luke the Drifter track, it was reissued posthumously as a Hank Williams single – the only time that happened. It is easy to hear why, as Ramblin’ Man fits better in Williams’ evocative discography than the Luke the Drifter canon. In some ways it’s a companion piece to Lost Highway – a tale of a man compelled to stalk the margins by powers outwith his control, or even perhaps his comprehension. The narrator of the song clearly wants to find peace and a place to call home, but a force he can’t resist compels him to keep moving on. The final stanza, which imagines a response to the character’s inevitable death, certainly acquired more power once Williams had passed away: but this would still sound spooked and unsettling even if he was still alive today. 10. Your Cheatin’ Heart1951 had seen Williams become country’s first superstar, but his success was achieved at unsustainable personal cost. Records are incomplete but it appears he played around 100 gigs, in addition to his weekly commitment to appear in Nashville for the Grand Ole Opry most Saturdays, and the daily Mother’s Best breakfast shows on WSM. Six recording sessions produced 21 tracks; he and Audrey opened a shop in Nashville; he signed a film deal (though never made any films), and in June was honoured by his home town with a Montgomery Hank Williams Homecoming Day. In November, he had an accident while hunting with Jerry Rivers that further aggravated his back: in December he underwent surgery. Unable to fulfil commitments for dates around new year, he recorded an apology that Audrey was to play to audiences. Knowing he was at home, likely had been drinking, and therefore keen to avoid him, Audrey slipped in to the house to pick up some clothes on her way to the shows: Williams had a gun, and fired four times. Audrey would later say she did not think he had fired at her, but it proved the final straw. The couple had gone through divorce proceedings in 1948, but made up; this time, Audrey had had enough. The divorce was finalised on 10 July: the following day he recorded the caustic, resigned, bitter You Win Again. By the middle of 1952, Williams had ended a relationship with a woman who would bear a daughter, Jett, he would not live to see; and begun another with Billie Jean Eshliman. He would marry her in the October, perhaps – friends have since suggested – less because of his feelings for her than to send a message to Audrey. (In what must have been a deliberate echo of his 1949 hit, Wedding Bells, he invited Audrey to the ceremony: she did not attend.) The Opry sacked him after repeated no-shows and drunkenness; the attentions of a bogus doctor precipitated further decline. Your Cheatin’ Heart – perhaps the song that best defines the Hank Williams sound and style, and a piece of writing right up there with the greatest in-song evocations of love, loss, betrayal and heartbreak – was apparently the result of a conversation between Williams and Billie Jean during a car ride from Nashville to Shreveport, where the couple were going to announce their marriage plans to her parents. He was lying on the floor, racked with pain; she had asked about his previous marriage: he described Audrey as “a cheatin’ heart”, quickly realised the writerly potential in the idea, and dictated the song to Billie Jean – one of 14 songs that she says poured out of him that day while the car sped along. According to Helms, after a quick rehearsal of the introduction, the band recorded the song in a single take – the one and only time it was ever performed by them. Helms never saw Williams again. Williams died in the back seat of a car, on his way from Knoxville to Ohio, for a gig scheduled to take place on 1 January 1953, aged only 29. His earliest records are now 70 years old: his legacy and legend will last as long as recorded music."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"us-news/2017/aug/29/trump-to-visit-texas-as-flood-levels-from-harvey-forecast-to-rise","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-29T08:30:42Z","webTitle":"Trump to visit inundated Texas as flood levels from Harvey continue to rise","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/aug/29/trump-to-visit-texas-as-flood-levels-from-harvey-forecast-to-rise","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/aug/29/trump-to-visit-texas-as-flood-levels-from-harvey-forecast-to-rise","fields":{"headline":"Trump to visit inundated Texas as flood levels from Harvey continue to rise","bodyText":"Donald Trump is to visit Texas on Tuesday, where catastrophic floods that have already killed nine people are forecast to worsen over the next 48 hours. Responding to the first natural disaster to test his presidency, Trump said on Monday that the cost of recovering from tropical storm Harvey would be “very expensive”, but pledged that “the federal government stands ready, willing and able to support that effort”. The White House said he would visit Corpus Christi and Austin, but not the worst hit area – Houston – over fears that the trip could hamper relief efforts. Tens of thousands of homes in and around Houston, the nation’s fourth-largest city, are semi-submerged and major roads resemble rivers after an unprecedented 30 inches (75cm) of rain fell on the city since Friday. Overall, the storm has dumped 9tn gallons on the region – as much in two days as it normally receives in a year. Authorities have warned that 30,000 people will be forced to seek shelter. A further 20 inches of rain is forecast to fall by the end of the week, prompting a warning that flood levels will not peak in south-east Texas until Wednesday and Thursday. “We are not out of the woods yet, not by a long shot,” said Elaine Duke, the acting US homeland security secretary. Concern was also mounting about destructive flooding in neighbouring Louisiana, where the storm is heading. Trump issued a federal state of emergency for the the state. The National Hurricane Center warned of “ongoing catastrophic and life-threatening flooding” spreading from Texas to Louisiana, with total rainfall of 50 inches (1.27 metres) in some parts. At least nine people were reported to have been killed in the storm, including six members of the same family whose van was swept away in the flood water and a man in his 60s who was presumed drowned after trying to swim to safety. It is feared that the death toll could rise substantially once the arduous clean-up operation gets under way. Art Acevedo, the Houston police chief, told reporters that 2,000 people had been rescued from flooding in the city, with 185 distress calls still waiting for help. At least 7,000 people were seeking shelter at Houston’s George R Brown convention centre, which has been turned into a makeshift shelter with space for only 5,000 beds. The authorities have called for a community effort to help deal with the disaster, including a police call for boat owners to help rescue those stranded in their homes. “There’s water everywhere. Please help. I’m scared,” one resident of downtown Houston, Aisha Nelson, told ABC News from atop her two-storey building. Houston’s mayor, Sylvester Turner, was facing questions about why he chose not to order an evacuation of the city’s 2.3 million residents in advance of Harvey. Turner said an evacuation of so many people in so concentrated an urban area would merely have compounded the crisis. “If you think the situation right now is bad, and you give an order to evacuate, you are creating a nightmare,” he said. The Brazos river that runs through Fort Bend could reach 59ft by Thursday, 4ft above the previous record set last year, forcing thousands more locals to flee under a mandatory evacuation order. Further misery was added to the picture by the decision to release water from two major reservoirs, Addicks and Barker, into the Buffalo bayou that runs through Houston. When Hurricane Harvey made landfall late on Friday it was the most powerful hurricane to strike the US in 13 years. It morphed into a tropical storm and lingered over Houston, bombarding the city with vast quantities of rain. The Houston Chronicle summed up the human tragedy with a list of numbers: 18 US Coast Guard helicopters used for rooftop rescues; 56,000 calls to 911 just in the first 15 hours. Images on social media conveyed the agony; above all, a photograph of a group of six older people and their cat sitting in the communal room of La Vita Bella assisted-living home in Dickinson, green-grey water lapping at their waists. All the residents were rescued by National Guard troops. On Monday, the Texas governor, Greg Abbott, activated all 12,000 such troops in the state."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/live/2017/aug/29/markets-jittery-after-north-korea-fires-missile-over-japan-business-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-29T13:42:54Z","webTitle":"Markets slide after North Korea fires missile over Japan – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2017/aug/29/markets-jittery-after-north-korea-fires-missile-over-japan-business-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/live/2017/aug/29/markets-jittery-after-north-korea-fires-missile-over-japan-business-live","fields":{"headline":"Markets slide after North Korea fires missile over Japan – as it happened","bodyText":"News that North Korea had launched a missile over Japan unnerved investors and sent them scurrying out of shares and into safer assets. Just when some of the belligerence and rhetoric between North Korea and the US seemed to have faded, this latest action ratcheted up the tensions again. President Trump announced “all options are on the table” following the missile launch. So European markets fell back with the FTSE 100 hitting a 16 week low and the European Stoxx 600 at a six month low. The Vix volatility index moved sharply higher, reflecting the uncertainty among traders. Gold was in demand as investors sought havens for their cash, as were Swiss francs and the yen. On the currency markets it was a mixed day for the pound. It fell against the euro, both on Brexit worries and thanks to the continuing strength of the euro itself. But Capital Economics believes the current weakness of the pound against the single currency may not last. Against the dollar the pound moved higher, benefiting from the US currency’s weakness on talk another interest rate rise may not be imminent. There were also concerns about the effect of tropical storm Harvey on the US economy. Harvey, formerly designated a hurricane, has seen oil prices slip on uncertainty over the damage it is causing to refineries. On the economic front, France’s GDP grew by 0.5% in the second quarter as expected, while German consumer confidence edged higher. In the UK there were some weak housing market figures. At the moment the FTSE 100 has lost just over 1%, Germany’s Dax is down 1.9%. and France’s Cac has fallen 1.37%. On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.47%. Gold is up $5 an ounce at $1322, while Brent crude is own 0.15% at $51.81 a barrel. On that note, it’s time to close up for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we’ll be back tomorrow. In common with the European markets, Wall Street has dropped sharply in the wake of the renewed tensions following North Korea’s launch of a missile over Japan. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 127 points or 0.58% while the S&amp;P 500 opened 0.64% lower and the Nasdaq Composite has lost 0.84%. More house price data from the US, and it is pretty much in line with expectations: US stock markets look set to open lower when the bells ring in New York this morning. Both the S&amp;P and Dow futures are down ahead of the business day, driven down by fears over North Korea. Economists seem unfazed by the likely impact of Hurricane Harvey, even though gas prices are rising and the region supplies 20% of the US’s total crude oil supply. The US has bounced back quickly from similar disasters and investors are clearly betting the same will be true this time. Pyongyang’s latest moves, however, are another story. Harvey may no longer be a hurricane but a tropical storm, but it is likely to be causing considerable financial damage. Julia Kollewe reports: With the catastrophic Texas floods triggered by Hurricane Harvey set to worsen, early estimates suggest the financial damage it has inflicted has already run into tens of billions of dollars, and one forecaster has predicted the final bill could be as high as $100bn (£77bn). The tropical storm continues to batter south-eastern Texas, where it has so far claimed at least nine lives, and is expected to reach southern Louisiana. Thousands of homes have been flooded forcing residents to seek emergency shelter. US authorities estimate 30,000 people will need shelter. So far predictions of the final cost of the damage vary widely. Some insurance analysts are putting the likely damage at $30 to $50bn – but point out that not all of this sum will be covered by insurance. However, David Havens, an insurance analyst at Imperial Capital in New York, told Bloomberg News the final bill could reach as much as $100bn. This compares with damage of $120bn caused by hurricane Katrina in 2005, which included $80bn of insured losses, and the $75bn economic losses caused by hurricane Sandy in 2012. As homeowners’ personal insurance policies tend to exclude flood cover, most of the flood-related claims will be borne by the US National Flood Insurance Programme. However, many people in eastern Texas have failed to buy coverage from NFIP or have let their policies lapse, the New York Times reported. It said many never had to buy flood insurance because their property was not listed as being on a 100-year floodplain. Charles Watson of data analytics firm Enki estimates the damage to homes alone could total $30bn. The full story is here: The pound’s current weakness against the euro may not last, says Capital Economics: The White House has issued a response to the North Korea missile launch: Back with Germany, and consumer confidence continues to grow. Released earlier, the GfK consumer consumer confidence survey came in at 10.9, its highest level since October 2001 and up from 10.8 the previous month. Analysts had expected an unchanged reading. GFK said: Consumers in Germany see the domestic economy continuing on a very good path. Evidence of this is provided by the new increases in income expectation and propensity to buy. It has been possible for both to again improve in their high levels. Economic expectation, on the other hand, has suffered a setback. Yet its current level still suggests that consumers nevertheless see the German economy continuing on a course for growth. Oil prices have slipped back, on uncertainty over the damage being caused in Texas by Hurricane Harvey, now a tropical storm. Brent crude is down 0.79% at $51.48 a barrel while West Texas Intermediate is 0.09% lower at $46.53. The move in Brent in particular is putting more pressure on markets which are already suffering from the renewed tensions after North Korea launched its missile over Japan. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: North Korea’s provocative missile launch over Japan remained the main market-driver this Tuesday, with the European indices only widening their losses as the morning went on. There were a variety of different reasons, on top of the macro-fears surrounding Kim Jong Un’s itchy trigger figure, driving the European markets lower. In the UK the FTSE’s 1.2% fall – leaving it only handful of points above 7300 – was exacerbated by Brent Crude’s own 1% drop, taking the black stuff back below $51.50 per barrel. The commodity is being dragged lower by news that Hurricane Harvey hit several refineries along the US Gulf Coast, and has in turn weighed on the likes of BP and Shell. The DAX and CAC saw their losses increase to 1.9% and 1.5% respectively as the euro went on its latest romp. Against the dollar – which has myriad problems to deal with both internationally and domestically – the euro surged half a percent to a $1.205-nearing 2 and a half year high, while against the pound it rose 0.4% to send sterling stumbling towards €1.075. Germany’s forthcoming federal elections will have little impact on the country’s credit rating over the next four years whatever the outcome, according to a report from Moody’s. Colin Ellis, a managing director at the ratings agency and co-author of the study, said: “Although the German elections could result in a number of different potential coalitions, we don’t expect any plausible combination to have a material impact on the credit profiles of the country’s rated debt issuers.” The Moody’s report stated: Germany’s sovereign credit quality is resilient to any plausible election outcome given the country’s very high economic, institutional and fiscal strength. However, growth and debt levels will be influenced by policymakers’ response to rising demographic pressures and their approach to labour market flexibility. At the European level, the government’s stance on issues such as debt pooling or fiscal transfers among European Union countries will be an important factor. Given the main parties’ differing views on these and other important policy areas, the composition of the next coalition will, at the margins at least, influence how Germany’s sovereign credit profile evolves. As the market slide accelerates – the FTSE 100 is down 1.36%, Germany’s Dax has lost 1.96% and France’s Cac is 1.58% lower – the so-called fear index is on the rise. The Vix volatility index has jumped 25% to 14.16 since the North Korea missile launch, though this is below the year high of 17.28 on 11 August after President Trump made his “fire and fury” comments against Kim Jong-un. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said: After weeks of quiet, renewed geopolitical tensions and a soaring euro are combining to cause some impressive moves across markets this morning. We have seen triple-digit losses on the FTSE 100, while in Europe the surge in the euro past $1.20 has resulted in brutal morning for European equities. North Korea’s dramatic escalation last night prompted some impressive risk-off moves in Asia, with the European session naturally following suit. US futures are under pressure, although everyone is waiting for the first tweet on the subject from the Commander-in-Chief before hitting the sell button too hard. Hurricane Harvey is hitting insurers hard, as investors try to price in the potential costs of the devastation in Texas, while a drop in US Treasury yields is prompting a mini-rout in bank stocks. Much of what we are seeing in equities this morning is also a reflection of the moves in the foreign exchange space; Jackson Hole duly delivered in terms of lack of news, and the reflex action has kicked in, with investors buying the euro, driving it to a 3-year high, and resuming their selling of the US dollar. We have a few weeks to go until the next Fed meeting, when the bank will get the chance to put a more dollar-positive view forward. Until then, we should expect further euro strength, and thus more downside for European stock markets. Ahead of the open, we expect the Dow to start at 21,666, 142 points lower from Monday’s close. Self explanatory: Sterling is having a tough day against the single currency, thanks to continuing concerns about the outcome of Brexit talks as well as the strength of the euro. The pound is currently down 0.4% at €1.0751. Investors are nervous about the lack of progress in the Brexit discussions and an uninspiring performance from the UK economy – it showed the slowest growth of any G7 country in the second quarter. Former MPC member Andrew Sentance tweeted: However the strength of the euro is also a factor. ECB president Mario Draghi’s speech at the Jackson Hole gathering of central bankers at the end of last week revealed nothing much about future monetary policy; but that did little to dispel the idea the central bank would soon set out plans to cut back its economic stimulus measures, including easing its bond-buying programme. ING Bank said: The euro continues to march higher despite ECB President Mario Draghi staying tight-lipped over future policy plans at Jackson Hole (as we expected). The focus now turns to the crucial 7 September ECB meeting: out economists note that the demand for an ECB game plan on tapering is getting stronger by the day; indeed the key arguments in favour of tapering are the successful defeat of the deflation risk, the strong economic recovery and bond scarcity. However, we note that the ECB’s preference will be for a cautious tapering, with a very gradual withdrawal of some monetary stimulus that ideally doesn’t cause any tightening of financial conditions. If the pound is weak against the euro, then it is a different story regarding the dollar. The US currency has been under pressure on concerns about the continuing uncertainty in the White House, while Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen gave it little support in her own speech at Jackson Hole. Meanwhile the revival of tensions with North Korea in the wake of the missile launch over Japan and worries about the costs of Hurricane Harvey - and its effect on US economic growth - has also had an impact. So against the dollar, the pound is currently up 0.22% at $1.2960. Meanwhile the euro is at an 18 month high of around $1.20 against the dollar. Unsurprisingly, US markets are expected to open lower, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average future indicating a 118-point decline amid the North Korea tensions and Hurricane Harvey. Gold is up $4 an ounce at $1321 on fears about where the tensions between the US and North Korea will lead. In a sign of demand for the precious metal, investment firm the Pure Gold Company said it had seen a sharp increase in people buying physical gold. Its chief executive, Josh Saul, said: We have been taking orders since 5am this morning from clients citing fears that tensions between the US and North Korea will escalate after North Korea’s latest missile test over Japan. President Trump has [previously] vowed to respond with “fire and fury” and many of our clients believe this will make the situation considerably worse, increasing the unpredictability of the geopolitical situation. We’ve seen a 78% increase in financial professions investing in physical gold on the expectation that the equity markets and the dollar will continue to slip while the gold price rallies. Physical gold investment from first time purchasers has increased by 87% as they worry about market uncertainty in the face of such volatile world leaders. The rise of gold through the $1,300 an ounce barrier – which had proved resistant for some while – is likely to lead to continued support for the precious metal, analysts believe. Hussein Sayed, chief market strategist at FXTM, said: Gold seems to have benefited from the tensions [following the North Korea missile launch], currently trading at a nine-month high. However, most of the gains in the precious metal occurred before the missile launch, meaning that there are different factors supporting prices. U.S. 10-year Treasury bond yields have been falling since 10 July, with total declines of 10.8%. This partially explains gold’s 8.6% surge since then, and investors are still not buying Trump’s tax reforms. Yields should be much higher than current levels, especially since the Fed didn’t seem to back off on raising rates. Gary Cohn, head of Trump’s National Economic Council, has a high probability of replacing Janet Yellen when her term ends by January 2018. Cohn is not only expected to back financial sector deregulation, but also to keep interest rates low in order to support the implementation of Trump’s pro-growth economic policies. This provides another valid reason to purchase the yellow metal. With ongoing geopolitical tensions, the looming debt ceiling, threats to scrap Nafta, and a low yield environment, gold prices are likely to remain well supported. $1,300 has been a critical resistance level since the beginning of the year, with four failing attempts to break through; after yesterday’s surge however, $1,300 will likely turn into support. Back with the UK economy, and some weak housing market figures. My colleague Julia Kollewe has the details: UK house prices dipped this month, dragging down the annual growth rate, in further evidence of a cooling market. The average price of a home fell 0.1% between July and August to £210,495, according to Nationwide, Britain’s biggest building society. Prices rose in July and June but fell between March and May, the first time this had happened since the financial crisis. The latest monthly price drop took the annual growth rate back down to 2.1%, a level last seen in May, which was the lowest rate in four years, from 2.9% in July. Robert Gardner, Nationwide’s chief economist, said: “The slowdown in house price growth to the 2-3% range in recent months from the 4-5% prevailing in 2016 is consistent with signs of cooling in the housing market and the wider economy.” He noted that economic growth had halved from last year to about 0.3% per quarter in the first half of this year and that the number of mortgages approved for house purchase hit a nine-month low in June, while surveyors had reported softening in the number of new buyer inquiries. He said in some respects the slowdown in the housing market was surprising, given the strength of the labour market, while mortgage rates have remained close to all-time lows. But household finances are under mounting pressure, with the cost of living rising steadily as the weak pound bites, and wage growth stagnating. The full report is here: With the costs of Hurricane Harvey estimated by some reports to be as much as $100bn when the final tally comes in, insurers have come under pressure. Lancashire Holdings is down more than 2%, Beazley has fallen 1.6% and Hiscox is 1% lower. Amid concerns about North Korea firing a missile over Japan, Europe’s stock markets are sliding in early trading. The FTSE 100 has fallen by 1%, Germany’s Dax and France’s Cac are down 0.9% and Italy’s FTSE MIB has fallen 0.5%. The European Stoxx 600 has hit a six-month low. France’s economy grew by 0.5% in the three months to June, in line with the initial estimates and analyst forecasts. This is the third quarter in a row that the country’s GDP has increased by that amount. Exports bounced back, imports slowed significantly and domestic demand held firm, said statistics agency Insee. But corporate investment decelerated sharply, up by 0.7% after a previous rise of 1.3%. Of course the US president has other things on his plate too. There is his tax overhaul speech on Wednesday, but there is also the problem of the debt ceiling and Trump’s threat last week to shut down the government if he does get funds for his Mexican border wall. The arrival of Hurricane Harvey and the cost of repairing the damage will only put more pressure on the country’s finances, and will not help Trump’s attempts to fund his pet project. CMC’s David Madden says: Traders are looking ahead to Donald Trump’s speech on Wednesday, where he is going to talk about bringing in tax reform, and investors are certainly in favour of the President’s pro-business policies, but will the plans get introduced. Mr Trump failed to overhaul the healthcare system, and it wasn’t just the Democrats who scuppered his plans, members of his own party opposed it too. What benefits the President, is that tax reform is the sort of policy that you could imagine support coming from both parties. Keeping with US politics, the debt ceiling is looming and Mr Trump has already warned the US government that it risks being shut down if it can’t find the funds to build the wall along the Mexican border. The timing of Hurricane Harvey is adding to the problems as Washington will have to deal with those costs too. Investors are nervous about the potential political gridlock in the US. President Trump’s response so far to the latest North Korean missile has been fairly measured but investors will be watching what he says or does next. Konstantinos Anthis at ADS Securities says: Stock traders are concerned that if the situation escalates even further then the markets will look for risk-off assets taking bets off the equities. The US futures are also pointing towards a bearish opening and the important question now is what President Trump’s response is going to be: if the US President opts for a tempered response then stock traders will breathe a sigh of relief but on the opposite case a sharp sell-off can drive the equity indices down to their recent lows. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the latest news from the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. News that North Korea had fired a missile over Japan has rattled stock markets, after a calmer period when it looked as though the belligerent words and actions from Kim Jong-un had petered out. Japanese prime minister Shinzō Abe called the missile launch an “unprecedented and grave threat” to the country’s security, and both he and US president Donald Trump have vowed to ramp up the pressure on North Korea. But after the initial reaction, traders recovered some of their nerves. The Nikkei 225 is down 0.47%, while the Hang Seng is 0.27% lower. European markets are forecast to be a bit worse off at the open: David Madden,analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: Tensions have been running high for a number of weeks now in relation to North Korea, and this move has sent traders running for cover. The situation surrounding North Korea has become more serious now, and we are seeing a risk-off strategy being adopted by traders. There was a knee-jerk reaction to the missile being launched, but after a while traders nerves settled, and we saw a bounce back in equity markets – which are off the lows of the session. As usual in these circumstances, traders were looking for havens and the yen, ironically, the Swiss franc and gold were in demand. Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior market analyst at London Capital Group, said: Investors rushed to the safe haven assets on Tuesday … the Japanese 10-year yield fell to the lowest level in more than four months. The USDJPY traded at a fresh August low (108.34). Data-wise, the Japanese household spending unexpectedly contracted by 0.2% year-on-year in June. The latest data is bad news for inflation and could have revived the Bank of Japan doves, however the safe haven inflows overshadowed the yen-bears today. As for gold, it climbed to its highest level for nine months, at $1317 an ounce. Elsewhere, crude recovered some of its recent losses as Hurricane Harvey continues to do its damage to Texas and the oil production sites located there. Brent is up 0.44% at $52.12, but again the move was less than might have been expected. Ozkardeskaya said: The re-energized Hurricane Harvey continues devastating the Texas-Louisiana border and companies including Exxon Mobil and Motiva are expected to pause their operations, which should be reflected in US oil inventories over the coming weeks and support a minor recovery in oil prices. Gasoline prices are up for the sixth consecutive session. Our live coverage of the hurricane is here: There are also some nerves in the market before Trump’s speech on Wednesday when he is due to announce tax reform plans. These have been one of the key reasons for the market giving the president some leeway despite all the controversy, but there is still doubt as to whether he will be able to push his proposals through Congress.

The Australian Tax Office has published estimates of the amount of unpaid super in Australia for the first time. The data broadly confirm figures published by Phil Gallagher, a former director of Treasury’s retirement income modelling taskforce between 1993 and 2013, who issued repeated warnings about workers being short-changed on their compulsory super entitlements. Gallagher released his own estimates this year, revealing the average super underpayment is worth $2,025 a person each year in Australia, with more than 2.7m workers affected. The ATO data estimate Australia’s employers failed to pay $17bn in super to their employees between 2009-10 and 2014-15. That $17bn “super-guarantee gap” is the difference between the theoretical amount payable by employers to be fully compliant with their super-guarantee obligations, and actual contributions received by funds. The ATO says it has successfully detected and clawed back $3bn of that money, leaving employees’ super savings $14bn out of pocket since 2009. “While this analysis shows that 95% of the estimated superannuation guarantee (SG) is paid to employees, the gap exists because some employers appear not to be meeting their super-guarantee obligations either by not paying enough or not paying it at all,” ATO deputy commissioner James O’Halloran said. “Superannuation has a vital role in providing for people’s retirement, and any non-payment is of concern.” Matt Linden, from Industry Super Australia, says the new data from the ATO show why the Turnbull government needs to urgently reconsider the 25-year-old laws that allow employers to use employees’ super for business cash flows and ultimately not pay the money at all. “The ATO is to be commended for finally releasing this data, knowing full well questions would be asked as to why so much money is not being paid without detection,” Linden said on Tuesday. “With a compliance regime that is highly dependent on employee complaints and employer self-reporting, it is no surprise billions in unpaid super is going unchecked”. The ATO has used a different methodology to Gallagher for its estimations, and has got smaller figures as a consequence. Gallagher warned last year that without action from the government and the ATO, unpaid super could amount to over $66bn by 2024, including lost earnings. Last year a report from the commonwealth auditor general found the ATO’s internal risk assessment indicated that 11% to 20% of employers could be non-compliant with their super guarantee contributions, and that non-compliance was “endemic”. The ATO said it now meets on a quarterly basis with the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority, Australian Securities and Investment Commission and the Fair Work Ombudsman to monitor the operation of the superannuation guarantee system. “In addition to following up all reports of unpaid SG, we are increasing our proactive SG casework by one third this financial year,” O’Halloran said. “While business insolvency remains a reason that 50% of unpaid SG is not able to be collected by the ATO, we aim to find ways to increase the collection of outstanding superannuation guarantee debt. “The payment of superannuation guarantee is an important obligation on employers and should be paid quarterly.” The ATO said the introduction of single-touch payroll would improve visibility on reporting and simplify tax and super interactions for employers, allowing tax authorities better identify non-compliance over time."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2017/aug/29/it-is-beautiful-volunteer-army-fans-out-to-help-communities-flooded-by-harvey","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-29T11:00:10Z","webTitle":"'It is beautiful': volunteer army fans out to help communities flooded by Harvey","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/aug/29/it-is-beautiful-volunteer-army-fans-out-to-help-communities-flooded-by-harvey","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/aug/29/it-is-beautiful-volunteer-army-fans-out-to-help-communities-flooded-by-harvey","fields":{"headline":"'It is beautiful': volunteer army fans out to help communities flooded by Harvey","bodyText":"John Brown brought his fishing boat, a battered 16ft skiff, and piloted it around submerged streets and avenues, seeking strangers to rescue. Dale Montalban brought his wetsuit and waded into the churning murk, escorting people to the boats and hauling their bags. Cassandra Luna bought a $9.95 life vest from Walmart and brought it in case someone, anyone, might need it. All three were among the throngs of volunteers who fanned across flooded areas in and around Houston on Monday. They vowed to do so all week. No one sent them and no one paid them – yet for the sake of people they had never met, they exposed themselves to pelting rain and ominous warnings that Hurricane Harvey, now a tropical storm, would unleash fresh mayhem. “I think it’s beautiful, everybody coming together to do this,” said Brown, 41, a metalworker. He spoke amid a grim scene: flood waters surged through Woodlands, a community just north of Houston, marooning hundreds of families in their homes. The affluent High Oaks neighbourhood was especially badly hit, turning leafy streets and avenues into waist-high bayous. Yet Brown had left his own home 30 miles away, itself partially submerged, and driven through torrents to offer his boat and expertise to people in need. Montalban felt the same compulsion and laboured for hours amid rising waters to deliver families, property and pets to relatively dry land, where vehicles shuttled took them to shelters. Luna, 25, turned up with her offering of an orange life vest, still with its price tag. “I was imagining there wasn’t going to be any help. But there are so many people here.” Here was the America of the ideal: one nation, indivisible. A republic of citizens looking out for each other. No politics or polarisation. No fake news or social media bubbles. A crisis all could see, and a response all wanted to be part of. How long would it last? Donald Trump was due in Texas on Tuesday so perhaps the clock was ticking. But for one day at least, there was unity among the rescuers and rescued, a coalition of races and income groups. And there was, remarkably, calm. The storm continued to rage with eight confirmed dead, 120,000 without power and much of the landscape unrecognisable. But the rescue operation in High Oaks unfolded with composure and flashes of humour. It was all the more impressive because just two of the seven boats that plucked residents to safety belonged to the fire department. The rest were owned and operated by private individuals. “The private response has been tremendous,” said David Polnick, a lieutenant with the Woodlands fire department. “I’ve even had to turn help away because there’s been so much. Everything’s going good so far. About a hundred people have come out.” He did not know how many residents remained. Most of the volunteers appeared to be Texan but they reflected the spirit of Louisiana’s Cajun Navy, a volunteer rescue force that responds after natural disasters. In two isolated cases in Houston one group nearly had a boat stolen and another group was shot at when it did not pick up a group of stranded people. “Why do I do this?” Brown mused as he directed his skiff past a lamppost and some fallen trees. “Well, why not?” He had picked up more than 50 people by early afternoon and intended to continue till after dark. On one run he wheeled off Sawmill Road, docked on some mud and sloshed up South Summer Star Court seeking an elderly couple reportedly in need of evacuation. He found them but they refused to leave. Brown ended up taking another couple, a French man and Japanese woman, and directed a family of four, the Caetanos, to another boat. They thanked him and waved goodbye. A few miles away a Cinemark theatre was screening another, bloodier evacuation with its own feelgood ending: Christopher Nolan’s Dunkirk. One boat returned with an elderly couple, Dora and Ted Perez, the latter in a wheelchair. Another came laden with dogs. Mario Aguirre used an inflatable pool to transport food and kitchenware. Claire Torres, 29, clambered out of a boat cradling an infant. She was smiling. “It’s all good. We have a place to stay.” A grandmother from the Anderson family arrived in a later boat with a gurgling newborn, Alexia, in a blanket. “I hear you, pumpkin,” she said. Samaritans worked across the city. A family in a black SUV got stuck in a torrent on the I45 and risked being swept away until spotted and extracted by Nick and Jeremy Hicks, brothers who own a tow-truck business. Nick anticipated doing more rescues. “You bet. It feels good, man.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2017/aug/29/before-and-after-images-show-how-hurricane-harvey-swamped-houston","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-29T06:11:36Z","webTitle":"Before and after: images show how Hurricane Harvey swamped Houston","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/aug/29/before-and-after-images-show-how-hurricane-harvey-swamped-houston","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/aug/29/before-and-after-images-show-how-hurricane-harvey-swamped-houston","fields":{"headline":"Before and after: images show how Hurricane Harvey swamped Houston","bodyText":"Hurricane Harvey has dumped record amounts of rain onto the Texas city of Houston, leaving at least eight dead and thousands stranded and prompting an unprecedented rescue effort.

The Very Rev Peter Catt, Anglican dean of Brisbane and chair of the Australian Churches Refugee Taskforce, said a network of churches, aid agencies, community groups and refugee advocacy organisations would offer housing, financial support, food, clothing, medicines and other necessities to assist refugees and asylum seekers who have lost the right to government financial support and housing. “Yesterday over 40 men and women went into an appointment with immigration, emerging penniless, without housing, and terrified of returning to harm on Manus and Nauru. Among them were pregnant women and women that came to Australia for treatment after being sexually assaulted on Nauru,” Catt said. “We will not stand by and allow them to be made destitute and forced back to danger on Nauru. When this government is cruel, the community will be kind.” Leaked government fact sheets outline a plan for asylum seekers and refugees living in Australia to be given a new “final departure bridging visa”, which would see them lose government financial assistance – currently $300 a fortnight – and evicted from government-supplied housing. So far, 100 single men and women in Australia have been instructed to meet with the immigration department and told they will be subject to the new regime. The 100 are among about 400 refugees and asylum seekers – known as the “Let Them Stay” cohort – who have been brought to Australia from Manus and Nauru for medical treatment, including complex surgery and long-term mental health treatment, or to give birth. Some have been victims of rape and assault offshore. The 400 also include 116 children, many enrolled in Australian schools, and 37 babies born in Australia to asylum seeker and refugee parents. Those children, while born in Australia (and, in many cases, having never left the country) are regarded as “illegal maritime arrivals” by the government. Last year, a network of Australian churches publicly offered sanctuary to asylum seekers and refugees facing return to Nauru and Manus Island. There is a long tradition of churches acting as physical places of sanctuary. The right of churches to provide sanctuary, in which fugitives were immune to arrest, was recognised by English law from the fourth to the 17th century. It no longer has any legal force but is rather observed out of tradition or as a metaphorical safe haven. The right does not exist in Australian law. Catt said the government’s latest visa changes were politically motivated, and were “really an attempt to get refugees and asylum seekers to go back out of desperation, to starve them into it”. “Today’s announcement is really to remind people that if the government does try to remove people by force, then sanctuary still exists, we’ve got aid agencies ready to assist.” Catt urged the Australian public to support agencies who had pledged to assist affected asylum seekers and refugees. The immigration minister, Peter Dutton, enlarged upon the visa changes this week, saying that asylum seekers and refugees had been exploiting the system in Australia, and that “the con is up”. He told News Corp, “they were brought to Australia on the premise that once their medical needs were met they would return to Nauru or Manus”. “The medical care has been provided and through tricky legal moves they are now prevented from being returned to their country of origin, Manus or Nauru.” The minister said, “in some cases, this con has been going on for years, costing the Australian taxpayer tens of thousands of dollars for each individual”. It costs $573,000 a year to house a single asylum seeker or refugee in offshore detention for a year, according to the government’s own audit. The auditor says it costs about $40,000 to have someone supported in Australia on a bridging visa. Australia now attempts not to allow refugees and asylum seekers to be transferred to Australia for required advanced medical care. In internal documents, the government says it tries to prevent medical transfers because of refugees’ “propensity” to exercise their rights in the courts and seek injunctions preventing their return to the Australian-run offshore islands. More than 50 people are on the Overseas Medical Referral list in Nauru. They have been recommended for overseas transfer for medical treatment unavailable on Nauru, but have been refused or not even considered. At least 60 men have been transferred from the Manus Island facility to the PNG capital, Port Moresby, ostensibly for medical treatment. Many, however, have been held in the capital – in a hotel paid for by Australia – for months and do not expect to return to Manus. In June, the government agreed to pay $70m in compensation to the Manus Island detainees, who sought damages in the Victorian supreme court for illegally detaining them in dangerous and harmful conditions."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2017/aug/29/game-of-thrones-hbo-cato-institute-politics","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-29T16:51:56Z","webTitle":"Ice and fire: what Game of Thrones can teach us about power politics","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/aug/29/game-of-thrones-hbo-cato-institute-politics","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2017/aug/29/game-of-thrones-hbo-cato-institute-politics","fields":{"headline":"Ice and fire: what Game of Thrones can teach us about power politics","bodyText":"As the latest season of Game of Thrones comes to an end, it’s clear that the HBO juggernaut – which tells the story of feuding families in a fictionalised medieval Europe – has gone the way of The Wire before it and moved off the screen and into weightier arenas. A two-day academic conference about the fantasy epic will be held at the University of Hertfordshire in the UK next month, following on the heels of a similar Ohio State University event a couple of years ago. And on Monday night, the libertarian Cato Institute in Washington drew together panelists from thinktanks and the media to delve into the complexities and ambiguities of the show’s politics. The panelists eased themselves in by giving their verdicts on the latest season, which, despite record viewing figures, was criticised for its breakneck pacing. “It’s been much faster, much more plot-driven and much more cinematic,” said Peter Suderman of the libertarian Reason magazine. “At the same time I think it lacks some of the nuanced, methodical character-driven pacing of previous seasons.” Pop culture writer Alyssa Rosenberg of the Washington Post, a keen reader of the sprawling novels by George RR Martin the show is based on, said: “It made me feel foolish for having taken the texts seriously – most importantly for having taken seriously the idea that there was an underlying magical set of rules and structures that was supposed to be emerging over the course of the novels that would perhaps be surprising but would make the world of the show make sense.” But the panel wasn’t there for TV criticism, and moderator Caleb Watney of the free-market R Street Institute quickly steered them on to the thorny question of why Westeros, the imaginary continent where the show takes place, has seemingly endured 8,000 years of economic stagnation. “The last major economic development that we’re aware of us is the invention of steel when the Andals invaded about 6,000 years ago,” he said. “In the meantime [in the real world] we’ve invented driverless cars, 2,000 years after the invention of steel.” Why? “Westeros does have several factors that economic theorists and historians point to as slowing down growth,” said Ilya Somin of the Cato Institute. “One is actually longstanding political unity. For hundreds or thousands of years the Targaryens dominated Westeros with a single unified state, and historically, competition between states, like in early modern Europe, for example, has been important to economic development.” Referring to the cadre of stuffy, aged scholars in the show, he added: “The institution of the maesters probably is a problem. They monopolise intellectual development and scientific thought.” But Matt Yglesias of Vox felt the answer could be found in one of Martin’s most distinctive and memorable images – the unpredictable seasons that can last many years and inspire the fatalistic warning of the first episode: “Winter is coming.” “Probably a huge amount of the savings and planning that exists is very narrowly focused on trying to preserve food for the winters,” said Yglesias. “It’s hard to develop the kind of agricultural surpluses that would let you have cities and specialisation of labour when you not only need to grow enough food to feed people but you need to grow enough food to feed people through an unknown, no-harvest, three, four, six, I mean we don’t even know how long these winters last. You can imagine that would be really devastating to urban life.” Somin did point out that not every aspect of Westerosi life had stagnated. Recounting some of the most-mocked plot points in the recent episodes, he said there had been “an unanticipated burst of technological development, such as ravens that fly at the speed of light, or Euron mass-producing a thousand ships within a few months, or armies moving at the speed of world war two Panzer divisions”. The second world war came up again when Watney asked whether Daenerys Targaryen, the “dragon queen” who has spent most of the series plotting to reclaim her crown, should have used her fearsome beasts to destroy the capital King’s Landing and instantly end the war, a potential strategy Watney likened to the US’s use of nuclear bombs against Japan. Suderman said he was leaning towards no. “So much of the show is not just concerned with the taking of power but with establishing that it is legitimate,” he said. “Part of the reason why she hesitates, a big part, is because she wants to establish herself as a legitimate ruler who is accepted by the people of this world, and if you go and use dragon-fire to destroy even a small part of King’s Landing that’s something that people are going to remember and it’s going to make it much harder to rule in the aftermath.” Somin disagreed, noting that the dragons gave Daenerys an enormous advantage over her enemies and could in fact be used with some precision. “This is a sufficiently obvious strategy that a competent military or political strategist should have just suggested it to Daenerys and she should have readily agreed,” he said. “The only reason why they adopt Tyrion’s over-complicated plan [instead] is that that’s one of the only ways to make this part of the plot interesting.” But, he mused, perhaps there was a “hidden feminist message” here. Daenerys had been forced to leave behind her lover and “best military strategist”, Daario. “He said, ‘Why are you leaving me behind? A king would have no problem bringing a mistress with him, so why shouldn’t a queen have the same rights?’ She’s like, ‘No, I can’t afford to do this. The nobility of Westeros wouldn’t like it. I have to leave open the possibility of a political marriage.’ “So because there’s this sexist double-standard that Daenerys has to accommodate herself to, many, many lives are lost.” During the 75-minute debate, the panelists seemed to coalesce around the idea that the real problem in Westeros was that there was too much focus on personalities, and not enough on political institutions. “There’s a lot of talk about breaking the wheel but there’s really little analysis of what the wheel is made of, what it would take to break it, and what you build in its place,” said Rosenberg. Somin agreed. “It seems like Daenerys’s thinking about what that system will be like hasn’t progressed beyond: ‘I will be on the throne and I will not be a bad person like my father was, like Cersei is, like these other people are.’” But he felt that our own world was not immune to that sort of thinking. “You can see it even today in liberal-democratic societies where candidates promise us things like ‘I will bring change you can believe in,’ or ‘You give me power, I only can do it, I’ll solve your problems.’ That’s a better and easier campaign strategy than ‘I will build some good institutions’ ... That doesn’t fit into your 30-second ad very well.” Nevertheless, the show has long led viewers to expect a conclusion where one of the lead characters ends up sitting on the Iron Throne, the royal seat of power forged from melted swords. So who most deserved to sit on that uncomfortable-looking chair? Yglesias made the case for the Night King, the show’s icy arch-villain, the leader of an implacable army of zombies that some have claimed is a metaphor for climate change. “It’s possible that the Night King is going to come down to King’s Landing, he’s going to raise a lot of the points that we have here,” said Yglesias. “‘You know, you guys need to really think about the structure of your society.’ He seems to have things pretty well together, as far as we can tell, up north.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/aug/29/the-maths-of-marriage-equality-inside-the-yes-campaigns-plan-to-win-55m-votes","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-29T03:05:57Z","webTitle":"The maths of marriage equality: how the yes campaign plans to win 5.5m votes","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/aug/29/the-maths-of-marriage-equality-inside-the-yes-campaigns-plan-to-win-55m-votes","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/aug/29/the-maths-of-marriage-equality-inside-the-yes-campaigns-plan-to-win-55m-votes","fields":{"headline":"The maths of marriage equality: how the yes campaign plans to win 5.5m votes","bodyText":"Supporters of marriage equality will have just 20 days to make half a million phone calls and win at least 5.5m votes in the same-sex marriage postal survey, according to yes campaign advocates. The campaign blueprint was revealed at an organising meeting in Sydney on Monday by the executive director of the Equality Campaign, Tiernan Brady, and Sally Rugg, the marriage equality director of the progressive campaign group GetUp. Rugg and the Labor NSW upper house MP Penny Sharpe also revealed that campaign groups will use voter identification to reach “outside the [inner city] bubble” to encourage soft yes voters to return ballots. Brady told volunteers that the campaign “had to ramp up incredibly quickly” because research from similar voluntary ballots overseas suggests that 80-90% of votes will be cast in the first 72 hours. “Twenty days is what everybody in this room has to make sure we win Sydney and we win New South Wales,” he said. If the survey survives a high court challenge the Australian Bureau of Statistics will begin the postal vote by mailing out survey forms from 12 September with the aim of reaching all Australians by 22 September. Rugg told the meeting the yes campaign estimated that 55-60% of the 16m enrolled Australians would participate in the survey. “If you assume about 60% support marriage equality – we’re probably higher [than that] but it’s going to come down lower over the campaign,” she said. “When you crunch all those numbers we need to ensure there’s over 5.5m ballots returned [for yes], which is a lot of ballots.” On Friday GetUp and the Equality Campaign launched the yes.org.au website, which will allow supporters to organise phone-banking events and coordinate campaign calls. In its first five days the website has registered 69 events, with 319 members registered to attend and 4,336 attempted calls so far. Rugg said the campaign “is not a persuasion campaign, it’s a get out the vote campaign ... We need to focus our energy on making sure yes supporters send their ballots back”. The yes campaign has consulted with campaign teams for the Irish referendum, Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton in designing a voluntary vote campaign. It aims to make 500,000 calls in the next 20 days, Rugg said. “This effort cannot be centralised with GetUp or the Equality Campaign. It’s going to take people and organisations across the country to step up. “We’re not asking you to join a phone bank, we’re asking you to host a phone bank.” GetUp data analyst Ben Raue told Guardian Australia:“We’ve been conducting polling to ask voters how they intend to vote, and how likely they are to vote, and we are breaking down those results by demographics, including age, gender and geographic location. “Using that information, yes.org.au allows volunteers making calls for the yes campaign can talk to those yes voters who are not yet committed to turning out to vote.” The yes.org.au website, which will be used by unions, other groups and individual supporters, coordinates outbound calls to avoid duplication. Organisations involved in the campaign will not receive data on targeted voters, but callers who use the tool to phone bank will be patched through to yes voters. Asked how the campaign would target voters “outside the bubble” of inner city areas with a high yes vote, Sharpe told the meeting that a range of organisations were using voter identification. “So you can assume that if you pull up a list [at a phone bank], that you will be provided with people that are not the people in this room ... You’ll be calling people outside this room.” The national director of Libs &amp; Nats for Yes, Andrew Bragg, said that while a high proportion of Labor and Greens voters will vote yes, many Coalition voters were undecided. He said the campaign would target them through TV, radio and press appearances, as well as advertising using “the strong liberal and conservative case for same-sex marriage that hasn’t been made yet”. Brady said the campaign would be “about real people we know, getting people to see their lives, and the value of fairness and equality”. Volunteers would be directed to tell everyone they know – relatives, neighbours and work colleagues – to return a ballot. “We are incredibly conscious the [inner-city] bubble is not what Australia looks like.” Brady said the Equality Campaign had held about 80 town hall forums all over Australia, including in Armidale and Coffs Harbour, and “some of them were absolutely packed”. “We’re not without support in every one of those towns, [the campaign] is about switching them on.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/aug/29/hemp-growers-fight-for-right-to-supply-cosmetics-and-pet-food-industries","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-29T06:10:00Z","webTitle":"Australian hemp growers fight for right to supply cosmetics and pet food industries","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/aug/29/hemp-growers-fight-for-right-to-supply-cosmetics-and-pet-food-industries","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/aug/29/hemp-growers-fight-for-right-to-supply-cosmetics-and-pet-food-industries","fields":{"headline":"Australian hemp growers fight for right to supply cosmetics and pet food industries","bodyText":"Australian hemp growers and sellers are fighting a federal government decision to reverse a long-standing exemption allowing them to supply industrial hemp for pet food and cosmetics. In May last year, the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) decided to end an exemption that the industrial hemp sector had used to supply hemp for cosmetic products and pet food products. Hemp had previously been allowed for use in external products, those not for human consumption, so long as the tetrahydrocannabinols (THC) content was 50 milligrams per kilogram or less. The federal government argued that the exemption conflicted with narcotics laws and the United Nations’s single convention on narcotics drugs. The decision also placed tighter restrictions on hemp oil products, which the industry fears will require it to test levels for more than 100 types of cannabinoids. Fearing a significant impact on their businesses, a number of growers and industrial hemp associations launched a federal court case against the federal health department. The case, heard on Monday in Sydney, was launched by the Australian Industrial Hemp Alliance, Eve Hemp Oil, OzHemp and others. Barrister Jeremy Kirk SC said the loss of the exemption effectively extended political concerns about illegal drugs into the operation of the TGA’s legislation, which ought to be primarily focused on public health and safety. “The TGA act is not a federal drugs act, it’s about public health and safety,” Kirk said. The federal court is expected to hand down its judgment on Friday. The industry was boosted significantly by a decision earlier this year to allow hemp to be used in food products. The decision allowed low THC concentration food products to be consumed legally. But Australian Industrial Hemp Allowance vice president, James Vosper, said the introduction of other “restrictive” and narrow regulations was deterring investment in the sector. Vosper said the cultivation of industrial hemp would help spur investment in regional Australia. “Really, what we want is, we want of thousands of hectares under cultivation for industrial hemp, and we want to see jobs for areas that are depressed, and areas with high Indigenous populations,” he said. He said Australia was in a unique position to supply industrial hemp to Asia. But he said the industry was still dealing with a stigma associated with the recreational use of illicit drugs. “We have an enormous opportunity for hemp and that goes for hemp seed, fibre … It’s potential is huge and especially in areas which are, quite frankly, economically depressed,” he said. “That’s why we make ourselves distinct from that. We’re not activists, we’re not about the recreational use of marijuana, we’re about hemp for all the good things it can do. “It should be distinct. Unfortunately it looks the same, it smells the same and we’ve had to deal with the same stigma throughout the years.” The health department declined to comment while the federal court proceedings were ongoing."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/sep/03/we-die-or-they-die-rohingya-insurgency-sparks-fresh-violence-in-myanmar","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-02T23:57:29Z","webTitle":"'We die or they die': Rohingya insurgency sparks fresh violence in Myanmar","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/sep/03/we-die-or-they-die-rohingya-insurgency-sparks-fresh-violence-in-myanmar","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/sep/03/we-die-or-they-die-rohingya-insurgency-sparks-fresh-violence-in-myanmar","fields":{"headline":"'We die or they die': Rohingya insurgency sparks fresh violence in Myanmar","bodyText":"The voice crackles down the phone line. Hashem, a Rohingya Muslim fighter, is getting anxious. “Nah, nah, nah, nah,” he says. His group does abduct informers, but it doesn’t kill them, he claims. “Yes, it is right that sometimes we kidnap them and keep them with us for some days,” he says, from a refugee camp in Bangladesh. “We are motivating them.” Hashem, who is 26, says he belongs to the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (Arsa), a military organisation waging war in Myanmar’s Rakhine state. The region is under lockdown, making access to reliable information extremely difficult. But interviews with a dozen analysts, aid workers and diplomats in Myanmar and Bangladesh, build a picture of a diaspora-led movement that over several years has penetrated the northern part of Rakhine state, harnessing the desperation of persecuted residents and using intimidation to sustain control. On 25 August, the government said hundreds of fighters armed with guns, sticks and improvised explosives launched coordinated attacks on police posts across the north of the state, killing 12 members of the security forces. The death toll from the clashes has since risen to more than 100, mostly alleged Rohingya fighters. Since then, tens of thousands of Rohingya have attempted to cross the border into Bangladesh, even as eyewitness reports show Myanmar troops have opened fire on them and hundreds have been turned back. “Some militants won’t let the men go, they only let the women pass,” a Rohingya man in central Maungdaw Township told the NGO Fortify Rights. “They threaten people and say that if they try to cross the border, they will kill them.” Rohingya refugees have described a brutal army response, accusing soldiers of burning villages and shooting indiscriminately. Government officials insist they are fighting back legally. “For the security situation, there is not enough local police and border guard forces, that’s why the army has been helping them with security,” Win Myat Aye, the social welfare minister, told the Guardian. Meanwhile, some Rohingya in Bangladeshi refugee camps have slipped across the border in the opposite direction to take up arms for Arsa, according to local news reports and a western official who spoke on condition of anonymity. Aung San Suu Kyi’s government has dubbed the group “extremist Bengali terrorists”, implying they are illegal immigrants from Bangladesh, and accused them of slaughtering civilians. A government spokesperson could not be reached for comment. The militants insist they are freedom fighters and, claiming the attack via Twitter, hailed it as a “legitimate step” to restore the rights of Rohingya, a minority excluded from citizenship in Myanmar. Rohingya are considered the largest group of stateless people in the world, according to the recent commission report by former United Nations head Kofi Annan. Reviled by many in Myanmar as illegal immigrants, they are denied the ability to move freely. Hundreds of thousands have been confined to internal displacement camps since clashes with Buddhists in 2012. Neighbouring Bangladesh views them as a security threat and is reluctant to take in more refugees. ‘The single biggest threat to stability in Rakhine’ Friday’s attacks came hours after the Annan commission released a series of recommendations for easing entrenched tensions. “Just by the virtue of their existence and activities and antagonism towards the military they for the last nine months have been the single biggest threat to stability in Rakhine,” says Gabrielle Aron, a Myanmar-based consultant who has lived and worked in northern Rakhine. Analysts and aid workers say recruitment in the villages of northern Rakhine and the camps in Bangladesh surged after October 2016, when hundreds of fighters attacked border posts in Maungdaw township, prompting a massive army crackdown, with troops accused of rape and indiscriminate killings. The group’s leader, a Rohingya named Ataullah Abu Ammar Jununi, who has appeared in videos, is described as extremely charismatic. “I’ve had very educated and moderate Rohingya saying … ‘I start crying when I watch his videos’,” says a staffer at an international nongovernmental organisation who works in Rakhine and was not authorised to speak to media. Hashem says he joined Arsa at the urging of “senior people” in his village in Maungdaw. “It was a secret matter in Arakan,” he says, using an alternative name for the region. “Sometimes we had meetings, sometimes we communicated through mobile phone but it was difficult to get together.” “The senior person told me: ‘[Rakine is] our country. We should take care of it. It’s our nation,’” he says. While many, like Hashem, appear to have joined the group willingly, there have been reports of communities coming under immense pressure to join the group, Aron says. “There’s two groups: ones who really want to join on their own volition and others – educated moderates – who are really really scared for themselves and their families, they don’t want to be a part of anything like this,” says an NGO staffer who spoke anonymously. The product of decades of oppression, the Rohingya diaspora numbers around one million, according to aid agencies, with more than 500,000 in Pakistan and Saudi Arabia. A report published last year by the International Crisis Group says Arsa is directed by Rohingya based in Mecca and Medina, with some on the ground in Rakhine. But Rohingya rebellions – which have a history dating back to the 1940s – have a history of factionalism and analysts believe Arsa may have splintered or spawned offshoots. It is a viewpoint supported by Hashem, who talks of “many leaders” and multiple groups. ‘We are not dead and we are not alive’ In recent months, the group has been accused by the government of murdering scores of Rohingya leaders suspected of informing to the authorities or opposing the violent struggle, and kidnapping others. The Guardian has seen video of masked men making death threats in the name of the group. Another video shows a teenage boy being threatened with a long knife by men identified as being part of the armed group. While Myanmar authorities portray them as Islamist radicals, there is little evidence that religion has served as a motivating factor for recruits. But the campaign has had religious overtones. The Crisis Group report, which was based on interviews with members of the group as well as sources in the area and the diaspora, found Islamic clerics had blessed training camps and issued fatwas legitimising the group. “Indonesian and Malaysian extremists have been chomping at the bit to go help their brothers in Myanmar,” says Sidney Jones, director of the Jakarta-based Institute for Policy Analysis of Conflict. “Decades of persecution have led to this,” says Matthew Smith, CEO and founder of Fortify Rights. For years, Rohingya have told human rights advocates and journalists that their lives, confined to villages and displacement camps, are not worth living. “Now we are not dead and we are not alive, so we need to do something,” says Hashem. “We want our rights. If it is not happening, either we die or they die.” Additional reporting by Cape Win Diamond"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2017/aug/29/theatre-in-memphis-pulls-racially-insensitive-gone-with-the-wind","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-29T00:27:13Z","webTitle":"Theatre in Memphis pulls 'racially insensitive' Gone With the Wind","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/aug/29/theatre-in-memphis-pulls-racially-insensitive-gone-with-the-wind","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2017/aug/29/theatre-in-memphis-pulls-racially-insensitive-gone-with-the-wind","fields":{"headline":"Theatre in Memphis pulls 'racially insensitive' Gone With the Wind","bodyText":"A Tennessee theatre has cancelled a long-running screening of Gone With the Wind over complaints that it is racially insensitive. Officials at the Orpheum Theatre in Memphis have announced the film will not be shown during their summer movie series in 2018. Theatre president Brett Batterson said in a statement that “as an organisation whose stated mission is to entertain, educate and enlighten the communities it serves, the Orpheum cannot show a film that is insensitive to a large segment of its local population”. The cinema’s management told Entertainment Weekly it had made the decision “in response to specific inquiries from patrons”. The move comes after the film was shown at the Orpheum on 11 August, prompting “numerous comments”. This is the 34th straight year it has screened at the theatre. The classic 1939 film, adapted from Margaret Mitchell’s Pulitzer prize-winning 1936 novel, tells the story of the daughter of a Georgia plantation owner during and after the civil war. The film has long been felt to be one of America’s finest, but has also been criticised for romanticising slavery. Batterson told the Memphis Commercial Appeal that a “social media storm” played a role in the decision to pull the film. However, following the move, the Orpheum’s Facebook page was inundated with angry posts. Michael Bly wrote: “We cannot rewrite nor erase films, art or novels of the past. In order to move past we must understand the times in which art was made and those who made it. We are a nation that is constantly growing but to deny showing this as a victory of ‘not-offending’ in a ‘free society’ is absolutely irresponsible.” But some people on the page supported the move to stop screening the film. Erin Maher posted: “Agree with this decision. This is no time to be romanticizing the Confederacy and slave-owners. People who want to watch it can still watch it. They’re not burning the only print.” Gone With The Wind, which starred Vivien Leigh as leading lady Scarlett O’Hara, won eight Oscars, including best supporting actress for Hattie McDaniel, who became the first African-American to receive an Academy award."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"sport/live/2017/aug/29/county-cricket-surrey-v-middlesex-essex-v-somerset-and-more-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-29T17:40:00Z","webTitle":"County cricket: Surrey v Middlesex, Essex v Somerset and more – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2017/aug/29/county-cricket-surrey-v-middlesex-essex-v-somerset-and-more-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/live/2017/aug/29/county-cricket-surrey-v-middlesex-essex-v-somerset-and-more-live","fields":{"headline":"County cricket: Surrey v Middlesex, Essex v Somerset and more – as it happened","bodyText":"Time for CC - live! to sign off for the night! Been another enthralling day, but expecting a frustrating one tomorrow. Do join me for the rain! This is where we are: Division One: Middlesex 247 &amp; 15-0 v Surrey 280 Essex 159 &amp; 117-3 v Somerset 164 Lancashire 484-6 v Warwickshire 200 Division Two: Derbyshire 164ao v Durham 480-9d Glamorgan 294 &amp; 126-6 v Sussex 268 Worcestershire 363 &amp; 10-0 v Gloucestershire 258 Kent 313-9 v Leicestershire 350 Notts 213 &amp; 317-8 v Northants 141 Night all. Stumps at New Road! Worcestershire are 10 for none and lead by 115 against Gloucestershire. Just two games left. Kent have just brought up a third batting point at Canterbury, while Worcestershire’s openers have nine balls to negotiate at New Road. You’re all thinking about the Test match, aren’t you? News from New Road. Close of play at the Oval. Forecast is no good for tomorrow. We will resume with Middlesex 18 behind, with all 10 second innings wickets in hand. Derbyshire all out for 164! Rushworth returns to get the last. Trail by 316. Will Colly enforce? Surely? I see Sam Northeast fell for 97 for Kent. Boo. They are 287 for nine, 63 behind Leicestershire. With nine overs left to bowl at the Oval, it looks like we are going off for bad light. Lights have been on since tea but you can see players’ shadows – not the worst call I’ve ever seen. Middlesex 15 for none, trailing by 18. Probably us for the day. Stumps at Rhos-on-sea - Glamorgan lead by 152 with four wickets in hand. Off for bad light at Old Trafford! You’d think that’s that and that they will lose seven overs there. Lancs are 484 for six, 284 in front, and Livingstone had 215. That’s stumps at Chelmsford. Essex are 117 for three, leading by 112. Browne 66 not out. And they are off for bad light at Trent Bridge as well. Notts 389 in front, two wickets in hand. Bad light’s stopped play in north Wales, with Glamorgan 152 ahead with four second innings wickets in hand. Here come the criggiters at the Oval. 15 overs in the day, Middlesex 33 behind. Robson and Compo at the crease. My hunch is they’d settle for none down and parity overnight. Nothing adventurous. Buttler goes for 49... Lead is 258. Bosh DOUBLE TON FOR LIAM LIVINGSTONE If you say his surname as Living-stun, that rhymes. What a class act this lad is. 200 off 302 balls with 24 fours and three sixes. Lancs lead by 254, and Jos is with him on 48. Don’t think they will be mucking about. That’s a lead of 33, but not as many as they would have wanted. They lost their last six wickets for 49 runs, starting with the fall of Roy. The last four went to the new ball. Rojo got the last, Virdi clean bowled, and finished with four for 66. Paul Frame has seen a dog at Chelmsford. And another! Pope gone now. He’s been given lbw to Murtagh. He’s ambled down to Batty as if to ask about review it. Looked a bit of ropey call. 279 for nine. Lead is still 32.... Wicket! Rojo strikes. Pope edged him through the cordon earlier in the over and now Clarke tried to drive him over cover. Problem was, Steven Finn is quite difficult to drive over. Gone. 279 for eight, lead is 32, and Batty is in. Jos on to 40 off 45. He’s letting Livi chill out in the 180s by the looks of things. You’d think Lancashire might want a little bowl tonight. Their lead is 234, and there are 18 overs in the day. I wonder what Ashwin makes of Noema-Barnett. News from Chelmsford... Ouchy. That looks like that for the day at Chelmsford, then. A wicket for Keaton Jennings! Alex Hughes gone. Derbyshire 118 for six and the follow on very much on the cards. Wicket! New ball does it. Scurran plays away from his body to Murtagh and is caught well at second slip by Rayner. Catching. 266 for seven, lead 19. New ball taken. Surrey 265 for six and lead by 18. Scurran got off the mark with a truly lovely backfoot drive. Full batting points for Lancs! Livingstone has 181... The lead is also more than 200. Might as well tee off, tbh. Glamorgan are skating on thin ice. They are 77 for four and lead by just 103. I feel like Essex will end up winning this game. That said, it’s due to wang it down tomorrow. haha I see Jos has already hit a six. Lancs 391 for five. Livi on 174. Wicket! Just before the new ball, Middlesex get the big one! Foakes is gone lbw to Franklin. They are still in this. Scurran joins fellow 19 year old Ollie Pope, with Surrey six down and leading by 10... Foakes made 73. How exciting! Warwickshire have a wicket! Chanderpaul gone for 95, first ball after tea to Chris Wright. Buttler in with Livi, who has 169.... The lead is 176. Wessels goes 6, 4, 6 to move to a ludicrous ton. 77 balls, and he’s so far got 14 fours and four sixes. As ever tea comes at all sorts of funny time around all sorts of funny grounds, but here’s a selection of scores. Division One: Surrey 244-5 v Middlesex 247 Essex 159 &amp; 85-3 v Somerset 164 (they are back on there) Lancashire 371-4 v Warwickshire 200 Division Two: Derbyshire 97-5 v Durham 480-9d Glamorgan 294 &amp; 60-1v Sussex 212-8 v Gloucestershire 149-5 v Worcestershire 363 Kent 180-5 v Leicestershire 350 Notts 213 &amp; 292-8 v Northants 141 (not tea yet, with Notts scoring rapidly) Enjoy a cuppa, why don’t you? Empty Wessels is going mad! He has 91 off 75 and Notts lead by 364 with two wickets in hand. Foakes took Voges for a couple of nice boundaries there, and takes tea on 69. Looks in great touch. 244 for five are Surrey, just three behind and with power to add in Scurran and Clarke. Tea at Durham: Rushworth gets Critchley just before the break and Derbyshire are 97 for five and millions of miles behind. Tea at Old Trafford: Livi has a career-best 169, Shiv has 93. Lancs lead by 171. Warks in strife. Glamorgan 60 for one at tea against Sussex. Their lead is 86. Wicket! The Voges trick has worked! How on earth has the Voges trick worked?! Roy has tried to get after him and been well caught by RoJo (he doesn’t drop many) at mid-off high above his head. Roy gone for 79, and Surrey are 231 for five, just 16 behind. Pope in on dayboo. Tea at Chelmsford! Essex are 84 for three, and lead by 79. Browne has a half-century. Adam Voges is bowling, which says a bit about where Middlesex are. Four men out, and Foakes moves to 50 off his first ball. Too easy. 221 for four. A wicket for Ashwin! Livi has 168, which equals his highest first-class score. Shiv approaching a ton too, with Buttler still to come. Lancs 359 for four... Well, Surrey are really kicking on here. Roy has 76, and Foakes has started to tuck in to Finn. Rojo back to try stem the flow. With six overs to go before tea, it’s 219 for four, and they are just 32 behind. How good is this?! 50 for Roy! There with a sneaky nudge into the offside. 56 balls, three fours and a pair of sixes. Surrey 163 for four. Paul Coughlin has Durham’s third wicket. Derbyshire 53 for three... Gritty period... then Roy. Surrey are just 89 behind. Jason Roy has just nailed Rayner for successive sixes down the ground and, all of a sudden, has 48 from 50. Looks in good order. Surrey 157 for four. Notts are five down. They lead Northants by 258, so can probably declare now. Alex Hales made a rapid 25, Samit a rapid 64, and Che Pujara a slow 34. Empty Wessels about to have some fun, I suspect. So Sussex are all out. They made 268. Ben Brown made 77, Jofra 27 and they put on 43. They trail Glamorgan by 26. Essex’s lead is 34, but they are three down and have lost Ravi. He’s been stumped off Jack Leach.... Rushworth gets Godleman, Derbyshire 32 for two... A wicket at the Riverside! Graham Onions, back from injury and very much out of the contract at the end of the season, gets Luis Reece. Derby 28 for one in reply to lots. Kent are 79 for three as Billings joins Northeast. Leics, don’t forget, made 350... Here we go. Sussex are nine down, 60-odd behind, but Jofra is in at No11, so... The Glosters have lost their first to the Woosters. Tongue gets Dent and it’s 38 for one. Wicket! Meaker is gone! The nightwatchman had done very nicely, but he’s had a waft outside off to Finn, and Surrey are 106 for four. He made a very fine 42. Roy looks like he fancies it at the other end. Foakes in ahead of Pope, the debutant. Away we go for the afternoon session then. Should be good. Rojo and Finn bowling, Roy batting... 96 for three.. Here’s what’s going on around the grounds. Division One: Surrey 95-3 v Middlesex 247 Essex 159 &amp; 8-2 v Somerset 164 Lancashire 239-4 v Warwickshire 200 Division Two: Derbyshire 12-0 v Durham 480-9d Sussex 212-8 v Glamorgan 294 Gloucestershire 5-0 v Worcestershire 363 Kent 70-2 v Leicestershire 350 Notts 213 &amp; 131-2 v Northants 141 Enjoy your sarnies! A ton for Livi! What a guy. Gets there with a six in the over before lunch. Lancs 239 for four. Lunch at the Oval, and probably Surrey’s session, but the loss of Borthwick and addition of just 70-odd means it’s a close run thing. Bit of a grind, and it’s 95 for three. Wicket at Chelmsford, and that game could be over today! Dan Lawrence has a pair, Craig Overton has two and Essex are effectively 3 for 2. Wicket! It’s taken an hour and 50 mins, but Middlesex have a wicket. Steven Finn the bowler, his tight line doing for Borthwick who was tempted into driving and caught behind. 89 for three, and Roy in. Essex are 8 for one! Coverton gets Chopra. The lead is three... Lancashire lead! They move to 201 for four, with Livi on 86. Durham declare! Colly is gone for 177! Durham are 479 for eight, but no declaration yet... Kent are two down, as DBD goes. Northeast joins Denly. 40 for two in response to Leicestershire’s 350. Would be a hammer blow to their promotion hopes if Kent lose this. Quality, quality operator. Somerset all out for 164. That’s a lead of five. Groenwald goes, Somerset 164 for nine. One innings match incoming... Somerset lead! They are 161 for eight, with Dom Bess on 21. Sussex are having a very poor morning in Wales and are 158 for seven, looking at a hefty first innings deficit. Glam made 296. Wicket at OT! The first of the morning, and it’s the nightwatchman Parry. Jeetan gets the wicket, ending a stand of 85 with Livi, who has 66. Shiv hits his first ball for four and Lancs are four down, trailing by 31. Well that was a frustrating first hour from Middlesex. Murtagh replacing Rojo. Surrey 70 for two with Meaker on 34 and looking good. Off for rain at New Road! Oh no. Glos 5-0. Colly has 150 now... So Kent got that pesky final wicket, but not before Leicestershire got four batting points. Stevens with his eighth (for 75). Parkinson the man to go, also for 75, a career best. Lewis Hill 85 not out. Kent 11 for none in response. Their batting looks strong, with Zak Crawley, who everyone raves about, down to come in at 6 or 7 on dayboo. Streams! Watch county cricket. But keep this window open. Essex v Somerset here. Surrey v Middlesex here. Well, with Surrey ambling along to 62 for two, on comes the great man Ollie Rayner. This is his ground. The people’s cricketer at the people’s ground. Morning Stuie! Good start to the day from the Glosters. Can they back it up with the bat? Worcestershire all out for 363! They’ve lost three for not many this morning, but that’ll do. Meaker’s getting after TRJ! He top edges a pull then backfoot drives, both for four. It’s 55 for two. Durham have maximum batting points! There goes Davies... Smart work from Foster. Oh no, Steve Davies is out now and Somerset are 133 for eight and very much looking at a first innings deficit. They are still 26 behind. Porter has five, again... I love Steven Davies so much. Early wickets in Div 2, then. Libby went to Azharullah at Trent Bridge, and Notts are 29 for one, leading by 101. Gus Robson gone to Ruaridh Smith up in north Wales - Sussex 103 for four, with the old stagers Nash and Wright together. And Livi has a 50! Somerset are seven down. Coverton, who was deemed good enough to have a nightwatchman last night, is gone, for 0 off 4. Amir again. Bess and Davies trying to get up to parity. 128 for seven. Very pleased to report that three consecutive members of Middlesex’s cordon: Rayner (second slip), Robson (third) and Eskinazi (fourth) are wearing floppy hats. All paired with long sleeves, too. Well, we are underway here at the Oval. A Rojo maiden, and now Finn from the Pavilion End. Lovely shot from Meaker down the ground. And early action at Chelmsford! The rather confusing nightwatchman, Jack Leach, goes second ball of the day to Amir! 118 for six. Could Essex burgle a first innings lead? They’ve just said on the PA that we could get a shower later on! Sorry, what? I’m wearing shorts and flip flops. Middlesex’s huddle has found cause for applause. No idea what about, and can’t quite think what it would be for. But they are getting close to their game of foorball! So are Surrey. How exciting. While we wait for meaningful action or, as it’s otherwise known, cricket, why not read Gary Naylor’s ever-thoughtful county cricket talking points? Ah the wonderful Tanya Aldred has written this week’s Spin. Just excellent news. Tanya wrote my all-time favourite line about cricket, and I suspect a few of yours too, about Tim Bresnan who, she wrote, “has the air of a man with an emergency cheese sandwich in his back pocket”. Magic. Good morning! It’s Tuesday, but doesn’t it just feel like a Monday right now? Weird, eh. It’s cos there was a Bank Holiday yesterday, and not just any old Bank Holiday but a ripper, a scorcher, a sweat-patch-creator. And it wasn’t it just lovely? It produced some great cricket, at ‘Edinglee, and in eight games around the county grounds, too. I’m Will Macpherson and I’m at the Oval to guide you through the next 96 overs of action in the game here, and the seven others, too. So, this game, then. Surrey’s rather thrown-together side, containing four 19-year-olds, did really well to bowl Middlesex out for 247 on a pitch that is doing a bit but not much. But then Toby Roland-Jones bowled a beaut of a spell from the Vauxhall End and might just have made it Middlesex’s day. Who knows, really, but they felt like a pair of decisive blows. Much rests on the shoulders of Messrs Borthwick, Roy and Foakes. Elsewhere, the action was every bit as enthralling. Somerset had Essex on the ropes, but Jamie Porter has kept the leaders right in it. Runs on the board, long tail (Jack Leach is in as a nightwatchman for Craig Overton, which I don’t quite understand) and all that. At Old Trafford, Lancashire look in a strong position against Warwickshire. Would be a treat to see Liam Livingstone kick on. Division Two was nice and spicy. Stevo took seven, but Leicestershire might just be on top because their last pair have so far put on 98. 20 wickets fell at Trent Bridge, but by all accounts it’s no minefield. And Colly scored a ton! Another one! Ashwin’s playing for Worcestershire (who had a good day), while it looks to me like honours even between Sussex and Glamorgan. This is where we are at: Division One: Surrey 26-2 v Middlesex 247 Somerset 118-5 v Essex 159 Lancashire 112-3 v Warwickshire 200 Division Two: Durham 376-7 v Derbyshire Sussex 79-3 v Glamorgan 294 Worcestershire 338-7 v Gloucestershire Leicestershire 326-9 v Kent Notts 213 &amp; 19-0 v Northants 141 And here’s yesterday’s report and roundup. These are words you really have to read. And comment on. Please do that with haste. I am contactable! There are three ways you can contact me. They are these: Below The Line (play nicely) In my inbox: will.macpherson.freelance@theguardian.com On the Twitters: @willis_macp I look forward to hearing from each and every one of you.

While it was too early to compare Houston’s recovery challenges to the ominous examples of New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina and New York City after Hurricane Sandy, officials said, images of a drowned city made the scope of those challenges plain. High on the list of lessons from the Katrina recovery effort is the need to pay attention to vulnerable communities in the Houston area, said Gavin Smith, director of the Department of Homeland Security’s Coastal Resilience Center of Excellence at the University of North Carolina. “If you think of a storm striking an area of modest means, low- and moderate-income individuals, their capacity to recover is very different from those that have flood insurance, that have the economic means to recover on their own,” Smith said. “So that’s going to be something to watch over time, to see the impacts of the flooding in these different areas, low-wealth communities versus middle- and upper-income communities.” There was no suggestion that Houston faces a human catastrophe on the scale of Katrina, which was responsible for at least 971 deaths in Louisiana and 2,000 regionally in 2005, and attracted at least $71bn in federal relief funds. Sandy, in 2012, which brought a storm surge higher than 9ft to lower Manhattan and was responsible for the deaths of 43 people, likewise posed unique challenges, given the city’s submerged transportation infrastructure and population density. A potential point of comparison could be drawn between Houston and New Orleans, however, said Smith, who was dispatched to the Gulf Coast after Katrina as a Fema adviser and became director of the Mississippi governor’s office of recovery and renewal. “Houston, in some ways, is somewhat similar to New Orleans, in that it’s a major metropolitan area that was inundated by a major flood,” Smith said. “It just so happens that in New Orleans the levees broke. They thought after the storm passed, they thought everything was OK. And then the levees broke. “The idea of massive urban flooding is different than a storm surge-induced event.” While recovery is different for every city after every storm, a combination of official experience and analytical research has identified typical post-disaster stages: emergency, restoration, reconstruction and mitigation of future disasters. (“Restoration” refers to repairing salvageable infrastructure, while “reconstruction” means building anew.) The phase of immediate recovery, still unfolding in Houston, includes search-and-rescue and providing temporary shelters. Texas’s governor, Greg Abbott, activated all 12,000 of the state’s national guard members on Monday to assist in the rescue effort, with dozens of requests pending. As of Monday evening, the number of completes rescues was more than 2,000 and it was expected that 30,000 would need shelter. Immediately after a large-scale disaster, infrastructure known to engineers as “lifeline systems” – power, transit and communications – must be restored, the sociologist Eric Klinenberg wrote in a report on the aftermath of Sandy. In Houston, as many as 100,000 were without power late on Monday, and all service was suspended on the local public transit system, Metro Houston. Major roadways, including those running through two reservoirs, were “underwater and will remain impassable for several weeks to several months”, the Harris County flood control district said. Also among the near-term challenges are securing critical facilities and bringing them back online, including fire and police stations, hospitals, nursing homes and schools. Water and sewer systems and debris clearance are next on the list, Smith said, followed by “issues of physical reconstruction, and reconstituting local and regional economies”. One insurance analyst suggests the financial damage has inflicted could eventually be as high as $100bn (£77bn). “An event of this scale can very well take years, and in some cases it may take more than 10 years to actually fully recover from this event,” he said. Not the first time Houston faced a big recovery challenge less than a decade ago in the aftermath of Hurricane Ike, which hit the city on 13 September 2008, killing dozens in Texas, knocking out power to 2.6m homes and causing an estimated $29.5bn in damage. After that storm, it took the city 10 days to restore power to 75% of its customers and another week to restore full service. Since Ike, Houston has invested hundreds of millions of dollars in a so-called smart grid, which self-signals when it goes down (instead of someone without power having to call). The city has cut down tens of thousands of trees to decrease risks to power lines. It has also upgraded its drainage infrastructure in the form of ditches and improvements to the reservoir system. The city faces unique vulnerabilities, however: its port, one of the world’s busiest, is ringed by oil and gas facilities, which would represent a contamination threat if breached. Unchecked urban sprawl, with pavement spreading for miles over a former wetlands coastal plain, has further increased the risk of flooding. As for Houston’s likely recover timeline, a National Academy of Sciences study of disaster recovery going back to the San Francisco earthquake and fire of 1906 found that reconstruction typically takes 10 times as long as the initial emergency period. A four-week emergency would mean a 40-week reconstruction, not counting mitigation efforts. The exception, according to the authors of the study, was Katrina. The emergency period of more than six weeks in New Orleans after the storm “appears to be longer in duration than any other of the studied disasters and can be readily explained by the evident failures in the initial evacuation and response,” the study said. The last emergency shelter used in the storm did not close until 14 weeks after the event. Another challenge is “human recovery”, defined by a 2009 Rand Corporation paper as the “long process of restoring individual and community functioning”. “Human recovery goes beyond infrastructure recovery to include restoring the social and daily routines and support networks that foster physical and mental health and promote well-being,” the Rand study said. “The hurricanes of 2005 [Katrina and Rita], along with Hurricane Ike, showed that nongovernmental organizations (NGOs, including community- and faith-based organizations) are instrumental contributors to human recovery.” “One thing that does cut across all these elements, whether it’s response or long-term recovery, is the critical importance of governance,” said Smith. “People may or may not use that term, but in essence – how do you get the public actors, federal, state and local, working in coordination? How do you get the nonprofit community working in coordination with those players? How do you get the private sector working together with all of those players? “Managing resources – money, policy, and technical assistance – in a thoughtful way is extremely complicated. And yet if you haven’t pre-developed a good disaster recovery plan, trying to do that in the aftermath of a disaster – which is actually very common but unfortunate – is very, very difficult.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/aug/29/tuesday-briefing-outrageous-act-north-korea-fires-missile-over-japan","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-29T05:29:22Z","webTitle":"Tuesday briefing: 'Outrageous act' – North Korea fires missile over Japan","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/aug/29/tuesday-briefing-outrageous-act-north-korea-fires-missile-over-japan","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/aug/29/tuesday-briefing-outrageous-act-north-korea-fires-missile-over-japan","fields":{"headline":"Tuesday briefing: 'Outrageous act' – North Korea fires missile over Japan","bodyText":"Top story: ‘Unprecedented and grave threat’ Hello – it’s Warren Murray with the news to start your day. North Korea has fired a missile over Japan’s Hokkaido island and into the sea – again violating UN resolutions and adding to tensions in the region. The missile took off from a site near Pyongyang just after 6am local time on Tuesday and flew across Hokkaido, one of Japan’s main islands before breaking up into three parts and coming down to the east. The Japanese military’s early warning system detected the missile, triggering air-raid warnings in northern Japan including sirens and text messages saying “Missile passing. Missile passing … Please take cover in secure buildings or underground.” There was no attempt to shoot it down, though a government spokesman said such a launch posed a “serious, grave security threat” to Japan. Kim Jong-un’s regime will have conducted the launch to show that Japan and other US allies or territories are in reach of its intermediate-range Hwasong-12 missile – the same type North Korea recently threatened to launch towards the US Pacific possession of Guam – and to reinforce its displeasure at joint US-South Korea defence exercises that are under way. The North has complained to the UN security council that the Ulchi-Freedom Guardian manoeuvres are “recklessly provocative” at a time of high tensions. The US counters that the exercises have been held for roughly the past 40 years. Following this latest missile launch, Donald Trump and the Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe, are calling for urgent action by the UN security council. * * * Pension gap – Experts have raised a red flag about the difference between large companies’ pension obligations and the amount they are putting aside to meet them. Among FTSE 350 companies this gap has risen to £62bn, accounting for 70% of their 2016 profits. In 2011 the deficit was 25%. Longer life expectancies and lower investment returns are among factors widening the gap. The consultancy behind the figures, Barnett Waddingham, says (somewhat grimly) that UK life expectancy increases look like grinding to a halt because of years of austerity policy, which could ease pressure on pension funds. Could reining in bosses’ pay help too? Well, at least by next June publicly listed companies will be forced to reveal how many multiples of a regular worker’s pay their CEOs receive. * * * ‘Water came through the walls’ – Texans fleeing the impact of ex-Hurricane Harvey have told of their homes being swamped and, in one case, a snake swimming through the kitchen. As our live coverage continues, there have been at least eight deaths from the storm and the state has mobilised its entire national guard – the US equivalent of the territorial army – committing 12,000 of its members to the emergency response. It is expected 30,000 people will need emergency shelter due to the deluges in Texas and Louisiana. President Trump is due to begin visiting disaster-affected areas on Tuesday. * * * ‘Picking up the pieces’ – Police phone lines are getting inundated with a record number of calls related to mental illness – and cutbacks to NHS services are being blamed. The London Met, Britain’s biggest police service, is now receiving one such call every five minutes. Inspector Michael Brown, mental health coordinator for the College of Policing, said: “The inability to access a mental health professional is the problem, and that generates a lot of work for the police.” Lincolnshire police have resorted to having a mental health nurse in the phone room to help deal with callers, and police are also coming under more pressure to detain people on the grounds of mental illness. Louise Haigh, the Labour shadow police minister, said: “Police are increasingly being asked to pick up the pieces of a scandalous lack of mental health provision.” * * * ‘He’s a patriot’ – Donald Trump has defended his decision to pardon Joe Arpaio, who, as Arizona sheriff, illegally targeted Latino people as part of a personal anti-immigration crusade. Trump’s decree sweeps aside Arpaio’s potential jailing for defying a court order to stop racially profiling Latin Americans. Separately, Trump has been summed up as an “asshole” by one of his earliest supporters in the presidential race. “But he’s our asshole,” added Congressman Duncan Hunter, according to people who heard him address a Young Republican meeting in Murrieta, California. * * * Not so lucky house – Prosperous Hong Kong has a forlorn secret: its many “coffin homes”, where the city’s poor and socially disenfranchised eke out their days in tiny cell-like rooms of barely a metre square. Our correspondent Benjamin Haas spent a week in one called Lucky House, where he met a cast of down-and-outers including the Fighter, the Janitor and the Carpenter.

The Sun is so excited about the new season that it uses most of its front page to promote it, while splashing with a story about the celebrity Katie Price. The Mirror also has Strictly over most of its front, but its main news story is: “Statins halve risk of breast cancer”. The Mail follows up the Times’ story from Monday about the five-year-old Christian girl who was apparently placed with a Muslim foster family in London. The Mail is evidently angry about this, and so are MPs according to the paper. The Times has Michel Barnier, the EU negotiator for Brexit, telling the UK that it is time to get serious and stop being ambiguous. The Telegraph sees the same EU story as “Britain’s fury at EU’s Barnier” and says Brexit talks have descended into a “slanging match”. The FT says that Theresa May will be disappointed with her upcoming visit to Japan as leaders there are unwilling to rush into free trade talks with the UK until they know what Brexit means.

As she writes, in Beyond Veiled Cliches: The Real Lives of Arab Women, “the tackiness of the so-called Bedouin camp appeals to tourists because it is perhaps the only way they can digest the Arab world.” Awad, 38, wrote Beyond Veiled Cliches to present another, more real, version of the Arab world; particularly of Arab women, who are routinely exoticised and commodified to make their culture more palatable. For the book the Sydneysider and SBS journalist, whose parents emigrated from Palestine to Australia in the 1960s, interviewed more than 60 women both at home and across the Middle East. They include Hadeel Abdel Aziz, a woman who established the first legal aid service in Jordan, and Rana Husseini, a journalist who fights against honour killings, who talk on subjects as diverse as love, war and religion. “I’m a big believer that the change will happen when we are driving the conversation ourselves,” says Awad, speaking over coffee in a Sydney cafe. “All these women are capable of using their voices.” Guardian Australia: What inspired you to write the book? Amal Awad: For years I’ve read books about Arab women written by non-Arab women. It never sat easily with me. I don’t think there’s anything wrong with being curious about other cultures and religions ... I do think it’s up to Arab women themselves to tell their stories. They don’t need a westerner to come in and save the day and say, “I’m going to give you a voice.” Why the title Beyond Veiled Cliches? Sexuality, sex, shame, feminism, justice, activism – funnily enough, the one topic I didn’t address specifically in my initial pitch document was the veil. It was just such an obvious one that I didn’t put it in: as I say in the title, I wanted to move beyond it. But when I started writing it became extremely obvious there’s no way you can talk about Arab women and not discuss it. Whether I like it or not, people are obsessed with how women dress – especially with how Arab women dress, because there is a very wide perception of Arab women all being Muslim and all Muslims wearing the veil. And it’s just not true. You wore the headscarf from the ages of 21 to 30. How did people treat you in Australia? And why did you take it off? When I was identifiably Muslim, people treated me differently. After 9/11 it was crazy, there was this very different energy. [Taking off the veil] wasn’t a lack of faith, it just didn’t feel like it was the best expression of my faith anymore. It was a personal decision, it wasn’t a move against hijab – I never said as I took it off, well, no one should wear it. What interests you about the veil? Outside the [Muslim] faith, what do people think? They see oppression, they see unthinking women ... they see a person who hasn’t necessarily made a choice. I just see a person who wears a veil – it can mean everything and nothing to a person. Have you experienced racism in Australia? Don’t shine too bright, don’t step too high, don’t try to be better than the people who are meant to be here ... I’m not somebody who cries racism ... you have to just be very determined and not take it personally. What differences stood out between the Arab women you interviewed in Australia and in the Middle East? In Australia, the Muslim Arab women were very, very much about identity and belonging – these were huge elements in their lives. How they dressed was very important, the abuse they’d experienced in wearing the hijab ... also the fact that they were so resilient. [They would ask] do I talk about problems in my community at risk of alienating wider Australia? If I admit there’s domestic violence in my community, am I throwing them under a bus? In the Arab world you were free to be just you – your identity wasn’t the centrepiece, it wasn’t the thing that drove you. I think people completely underestimate Arab women in the Middle East, just how active they are in society, how switched on, how aware they are of the problems they have to deal with and work on. What takeaway should we have from the book? We live in a world where everything is hashtag-friendly and quick – I have to give you a bite-sized solution. The outrage economy that is so huge right now – maybe it feels good for five minutes but is it helpful? The book is about progressing this conversation about Arab women – by showing what you think is black and white is multicoloured. I’m not interested in everybody agreeing with each other all the time, but we need to live together, and the way we do that is through stories. • Amal Awad is speaking at Women of Letters at Antidote, at the Sydney Opera House on 2 September"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"football/2017/aug/28/frank-de-boer-crystal-palace-talks-chairman","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-28T22:04:37Z","webTitle":"Frank de Boer clings to Crystal Palace job after talks with chairman","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/aug/28/frank-de-boer-crystal-palace-talks-chairman","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/aug/28/frank-de-boer-crystal-palace-talks-chairman","fields":{"headline":"Frank de Boer clings to Crystal Palace job after talks with chairman","bodyText":"Frank de Boer is still clinging to his job at Crystal Palace after talks with the chairman, Steve Parish, but will have to demonstrate a willingness to adapt his approach if he is to retain his position much beyond the current international window. Palace are actively seeking to strengthen their first-team squad this week and hope to beat West Bromwich Albion finally to secure Mamadou Sakho from Liverpool for around £25m, but their business is being played out amid the turmoil of a dismal start to the campaign and with serious doubts having surfaced over the suitability of De Boer’s summer appointment on a three-year contract. The Dutchman has overseen only three Premier League matches, all of which have been lost without a goal scored, but discontent is simmering in the ranks and the hierarchy have been left questioning whether he will bend his methods sufficiently to instigate a revival. De Boer’s inflexibility to date over his tactical outlook, married as he is to 3-4-3, and desire to have Palace playing more possession-based football have come across as naive in such an unforgiving division, particularly given the 47-year-old had taken the job promising “evolution, not revolution” when it came to the playing style. Saturday’s 2-0 home defeat by Swansea, when the manager began again with three at the back only to yield and tweak the formation at the break once chasing a deficit, provoked a furious reaction among the hierarchy and pushed an already tense relationship between manager and owners to breaking point. There was dismay, too, that the Dutchman chose to criticise his players for displaying a “lack of courage” in his post-match media duties. Yet, when the dust settled, talks are understood to have taken place on Monday with the question posed again as to how he intended to turn things round. There is an acceptance that all managers need time to put across their ideas and philosophy, particularly when coming to a new league, and discarding De Boer after less than 10 weeks in charge would constitute an acceptance of the failure of a month-long recruitment process mounted over the summer. Yet Parish and Palace’s American major shareholders, Josh Harris and David Blitzer, will expect to see clear evidence that the former Ajax and, briefly, Internazionale manager is willing to adapt his approach, from training ground to games, to suit the players at his disposal in the period ahead if he is to retain his position. In that context, the team’s next match – at Burnley on 10 September – feels pivotal. Transfer targets were also due to be discussed on Monday with Palace’s squad left feeling dangerously thin by summer departures, with the input of Dougie Freedman, appointed as sporting director last week, and the chief scout Tim Coe. Freedman, who spent 22 months as Palace’s manager in the Championship, would most likely step in on an interim basis if De Boer and Parish ultimately decide to go their separate ways. Sakho spent a successful loan spell at Palace last season, when he was instrumental in Sam Allardyce’s team hauling themselves away from trouble, before succumbing to a knee ligament injury in the run-in. The France international is out of favour at Liverpool and has been available all summer, albeit for a fee of £30m. West Brom had suggested they would be willing to meet that asking price, potentially once Jonny Evans had departed the Hawthorns for a similar fee, but the 27-year-old has apparently set his heart on a move to London. Leicester City asked about his services this week but Palace remain favourites to re-sign the player, particularly if Liverpool are willing to accept a deal worth nearer £25m including add-ons. There is a desperate need, too, for a back-up striker to be secured before Thursday’s cut-off, while a goalkeeper could join on loan."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/2017/aug/31/a-belotti-belter-pillar-channels-superman-and-transfer-deadline-day-fun","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-31T09:30:27Z","webTitle":"A Belotti belter, Pillar channels Superman and transfer deadline day fun | Classic YouTube","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/aug/31/a-belotti-belter-pillar-channels-superman-and-transfer-deadline-day-fun","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/aug/31/a-belotti-belter-pillar-channels-superman-and-transfer-deadline-day-fun","fields":{"headline":"A Belotti belter, Pillar channels Superman and transfer deadline day fun","bodyText":"1) The first international weekend of the season is already upon us, butting in on the frenzy of the domestic transfer window.

Holland travel to France needing a result to keep them in touch with the Group A pace-setters and a performance against Les Bleus along the lines of this one, in 2000, or this one, eight years later, would set them up nicely. But France won their most recent encounter, last October, thanks to a Paul Pogba stunner.

Michael Cohen, who was vice-president of the Trump Organization at the time as well as being Trump’s attorney, sent an email to Dmitry Peskov, a top Kremlin official, according to the Washington Post. “Over the past few months I have been working with a company based in Russia regarding the development of a Trump Tower-Moscow project in Moscow City,” the Post reported, citing “a person familiar with the email”. “Without getting into lengthy specifics the communication between our two sides has stalled,” Cohen said in the Peskov email, which is the most direct high-level communication between the Trump camp and the Kremlin to have emerged so far in the sprawling investigation into Trump-Moscow links. In a dossier of allegations of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russian officials compiled by former British intelligence official, Christopher Steele, Peskov is cited as being in charge of a Kremlin operation to damage Hillary Clinton’s candidacy and promote Trump’s. The Steele dossier also portrays Cohen as being a key player in the alleged collusion to skew the election, a role Cohen has repeatedly denied. According to the Post, Cohen wrote to Peskov: “As this project is too important, I am hereby requesting your assistance,” adding: “I respectfully request someone, preferably you, contact me so that I might discuss the specifics as well as arranging meetings with the appropriate individuals. I thank you in advance for your assistance and look forward to hearing from you soon.” The email is a vivid illustration of the blurred lines between Trump’s business and political activities. When it was sent, Trump was in full campaign mode, holding daily rallies in Iowa, New Hampshire and other states critical to the Republican primary contest. Other emails published on Monday showed that the Trump Tower project was being promoted by a Russian-born business associate of Trump who was claiming he could persuade Vladimir Putin to back the real estate scheme and help get Trump elected president. The new details about Trump’s links with the Kremlin, now being investigated by a special prosecutor, emerged from the leaks of emails sent by Felix Sater, who worked for the Trump Organization pursuing property deals around the world. Sater’s emails, sent in late 2015 to Trump’s lawyer and then Trump Organization vice-president, Michael Cohen, gave an upbeat assessment of the chances of getting Putin to back the development of a Trump Tower in Moscow and the positive knock-on effect that would have on Trump’s presidential campaign. “Our boy can become president of the USA and we can engineer it,” Sater said, according to an email published by the New York Times. “I will get all of Putin’s team to buy in on this, I will manage this process.” In another email, Sater looked forward to the eventual ribbon-cutting on a Trump Tower in the Russian capital. “I will get Putin on this program and we will get Donald elected,” he wrote. It is unclear, from the email excerpts published, to what extent Sater expected Putin to intervene directly to help Trump’s election campaign, but he clearly presented the Russian leader as crucial in determining the outcome of the US vote. However, the Trump Tower in Moscow never materialized. Cohen said in a statement published by the New York Times, that he had suspected Sater of overstating the prospects of success. “He has sometimes used colorful language and has been prone to ‘salesmanship’,” Cohen said. “I ultimately determined that the proposal was not feasible and never agreed to make a trip to Russia.” According to a statement Cohen submitted to Congress, also obtained by the Washington Post, he said he had written to Peskov on Sater’s recommendation, in an effort to get Russian government approval of the Trump Tower project. He said he did not recall receiving a response from the Kremlin spokesman and the project was abandoned two weeks later. The Trump Organization is reported to have handed the emails to congressional committee carrying out a parallel investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. It issued a statement Monday saying: “To be clear, the Trump Organization has never had any real estate holdings or interests in Russia.” However, the Cohen email to Peskov suggest that the organization was still eagerly pursuing a Trump Tower development in Moscow months after Trump entered the presidential race. According to Bloomberg News, Cohen said in his statement to Congress that he had discussed the Trump Tower-Moscow project with Trump himself on three occasions and that the Trump Organisation signed a non-binding letter of intent with a Russian developer in October 2015. However, Cohen said the building permits were not forthcoming from the Russian government, and that he had taken the decision to close down the project in early 2016 without referring to his boss, and for purely “business reasons”. Sater has emerged as a central figure in the Trump-Moscow investigation. He was born Felix Sheferovsky in Moscow in 1966 and moved to the US with his family when still a child. He was imprisoned for stabbing a man in the face with the stem of a smashed margarita glass in 1991, and avoided jail for involvement in a mob-related money-laundering and stock-fraud scheme by becoming an informant for the FBI on organised crime and arms trafficking. The assistant attorney-general who signed Sater’s plea deal in 1998, Andrew Weissman, is now working in the special prosecutor team investigating a Trump-Moscow links. The Financial Times reported that Sater is also cooperating with an international investigation into a Kazakh money-laundering network. Sater and Cohen are reported to have known each other since they were teenagers in New York. Sater established a business relationship with Trump when he was working for a real estate company Bayrock, which partnered with the Trump Organization to build the Trump SoHo hotel in New York, which was completed in 2010. The same year Sater was distributing business card identifying him as a “senior adviser” to Trump. However, the Trump Organization denied it ever formally employed Sater. Questioned in late 2015, about the time Sater was sending emails about Moscow, Trump claimed not to remember him. “Felix Sater, boy, I have to even think about it,” he told the Associated Press. “I’m not that familiar with him.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/aug/28/non-pork-meals-must-be-available-for-school-lunch-rules-french-court","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-28T19:40:33Z","webTitle":"Non-pork meals must be available for school lunch, rules French court","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/aug/28/non-pork-meals-must-be-available-for-school-lunch-rules-french-court","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/aug/28/non-pork-meals-must-be-available-for-school-lunch-rules-french-court","fields":{"headline":"Non-pork meals must be available for school lunch, rules French court","bodyText":"A French court has ruled that schools should provide an alternative to pork school lunches in the interest of Muslim and Jewish children who do not eat the meat. The decision came after a rightwing local authority stopped providing a choice for children. On Monday a Muslim organisation won its legal case against the authority at Chalon-sur-Saône in Burgundy. The court, sitting in Dijon, annulled the town hall’s 2015 decision not to provide an alternative to pork in its school canteens. Chalon-sur-Saône officials said they would appeal against the decision. The judge said he was not concerned with religious considerations but ruled that the town’s failure to provide an alternative meal, which meant many local Muslim children went without lunch, was “not in keeping with the spirit of the international convention on the rights of children” and was not “in the interests of the children”. At a hearing on Friday, a state legal expert told the court they had come to the same conclusion. Gilles Platret, the mayor of Chalon-sur-Saône for the rightwing Les Républicains party, claimed he was upholding the French Republic’s principle of “laïcité”, or secularism, when he decided to stop offering non-pork alternatives in the local schools. “The decision comes only a few days before the start of the term. It is materially impossible for the town of Chalon-sur-Saône to change the operation of a public service in such a short time without risking the continuity of that service,” Platret said in a statement on Monday. The council insisted that by making all children eat together they were combating separation and discrimination. The Ligue de Défense Judiciaire des Musulmans (LDJM – the Muslim Legal Defence League) rejected this and brought the legal action in 2015, claiming that the town hall’s decision to stop providing non-pork meals was “illegal, discriminatory and a violation of the freedom of conscience and religion”. The Dijon administrative court said it had not accepted the LDJM’s argument about religious freedoms but had considered the “greater interest of the child”. The judge pointed out that the town hall had provided alternative non-pork meals since 1984 “with no argument whatsoever”. The French national consultative committee on human rights said the town hall’s action relied on a “erroneous intepretation of the principles of secularism and equality”. “Secular principles come second to children’s rights,” Nicolas Gardères, LDJM’s lawyer, had argued. Chalon-sur-Saône is not the only local authority that is a battleground over national identity and the place of Islam in French society, as the Guardian reported in October 2015."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/aug/28/olympic-medallist-colin-jackson-announces-he-is-gay","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-28T18:27:09Z","webTitle":"Olympic medallist Colin Jackson announces he is gay","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/aug/28/olympic-medallist-colin-jackson-announces-he-is-gay","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/aug/28/olympic-medallist-colin-jackson-announces-he-is-gay","fields":{"headline":"Olympic medallist Colin Jackson announces he is gay","bodyText":"The British Olympic silver medallist and BBC sports presenter Colin Jackson has spoken publicly for the first time about being gay, saying he thought the time was right to reveal his sexuality. In an interview for a Swedish documentary called Rainbow Heroes, the Welsh two-time 110m hurdles world champion said the reason he had not previously spoken of his sexuality was to avoid it being “sensationalised”. Jackson, 50, said he told his parents in 2006 after a former partner sold a “kiss and tell” story to a tabloid newspaper. “I was waiting for them in the kitchen. They walked in and they sat down. My mother could see my face and I was quite distraught. It didn’t faze them at all.” Speaking to two Swedish former athletes, high-jumper Kajsa Bergqvist and long-jumper Peter Häggström, the track star said: “My mum went: ‘First of all, is the story true?’ “And I said so it’s true, so it’s not like I can deny it. And then she went: ‘Well, why are people so disgraceful?’ I just realised, I’ve got the best parents.” He told the presenters he had opened up because of the way they had questioned him. “The way you asked me, it was a whole storytelling kind of thing and you were just interested in the way it affected me sports-wise, emotionally wise and my preparation.” Jackson spoke about the stigma around gay athletes to the Voice newspaper in 2008 when he said: “It’s the 21st century. I don’t think anybody thinks about that any more. There might have been a stigma in years gone by.” Jackson retired from athletics in 2003. Other athletes, such as the race walker Tom Bosworth, have come out while still competing. Bosworth came out as gay in 2015, and has since been an impressive advocate for LGBT rights. At the time he told the BBC’s Victoria Derbyshire show: “Coming out is no surprise to my friends, family and even team-mates.” He had told team-mates at a training camp before the World Athletics Championships in 2015. “It was a great chance to talk about in a relaxed environment and everyone was very supportive,” he said. Recently, he spoke of his doubts that a top-flight English footballer would ever come out because nothing was changing in the game, and fans still created an atmosphere where they dared not. The Olympic diver Tom Daley’s decision to come out, which he did in a self-made YouTube clip in December 2013, was a “huge step in the right direction”, according to Bosworth, who added the sports profession still lagged behind others when it came to sexuality. Keegan Hirst, the then prop and captain of Batley Bulldogs, came out publicly in August 2015, becoming the first British rugby league player to do so while still playing, and receiving an overwhelmingly positive reaction from fans and fellow players. Casey Stoney, capped more than 100 times for the England women’s national football team, has said she decided to speak publicly about her sexuality after the positive reaction to Daley saying he was in a relationship with a man. The Australian Olympic gold medallist swimmer Ian Thorpe, who came out in 2014, said he had wanted to for some time, “but I didn’t feel I could. Part of me didn’t know if Australia wanted its champion to be gay.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/aug/28/the-guardian-view-on-corporate-governance-reform-be-stronger-not-weaker","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-28T23:01:46Z","webTitle":"The Guardian view on corporate governance reform: be stronger, not weaker | Editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/aug/28/the-guardian-view-on-corporate-governance-reform-be-stronger-not-weaker","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/aug/28/the-guardian-view-on-corporate-governance-reform-be-stronger-not-weaker","fields":{"headline":"The Guardian view on corporate governance reform: be stronger, not weaker","bodyText":"Attacks on excessive executive pay and calls for more consensual company management have always marked Theresa May’s Conservatism out from that of her more Thatcherite colleagues. Mrs May has highlighted these issues often since she became prime minister. At the weekend she returned to the theme in a newspaper article, echoing Edward Heath’s 1973 phrase about the “unacceptable face of capitalism”. Now she is having another try, launching a package of measures on high pay, workers’ rights and corporate governance to mark her return to the political stage after the summer break. Mrs May’s concern about these issues is right and rational. They are unfinished business for modern Britain. Unfortunately there is little that measures up in this package. Several of the ideas that Mrs May floated in 2016 – themselves fairly modest in the first place – have now been trimmed back or dropped altogether, in response to lobbying by the chancellor, Philip Hammond. Binding annual votes by shareholders on executive pay have bitten the dust. Now the City’s self-regulatory code will require companies only to publish the pay ratio between CEOs and their workforce average. Plans to put employee representatives on company boards have been abandoned. Now the appointment of a non-executive director “to represent employees” will suffice. The dilution of the proposals reflects several things. The most obvious of these is Mrs May’s loss of political authority since her June general election debacle. She is a leader on probation now. She must negotiate everything she does. But the most significant explanation may in fact be the wider Tory party’s continuing refusal to take City excess and the corporate reform agenda seriously. Mr Hammond’s rearguard action can perhaps be explained as the typical act of a departmental minister trying to protect his clients. Yet all too few Tory MPs embraced Mrs May’s ideas even when she was strong, let alone now that she is weak. Too much of the Tory party remains smugly beguiled by laissez-faire dogmas, in spite of the massive evidence of their failings. Too little of the party is genuinely inquisitive about issues like workplace codetermination. None of it, Mrs May included, seems to have had a fresh thought about trade unions or workers’ representation for at least 30 years. In spite of countless good reasons to do so, few leading Conservatives look to German, Scandinavian, Japanese or South Korean corporate thinking for better ideas, even in the wake of a financial crisis that wrecked public confidence in the City. Even one of Mrs May’s brightest allies, George Freeman, has accused her of “flirting with anti-capitalism” and chided her for not supporting “British enterprise”, rather than supporting her effort to make British companies act with restraint on pay and adopt long-term strategies. The irony, even in her weakened position, is that Mrs May ought now to find a readier Tory audience for her ideas than in the past. The increased prospect of a Jeremy Corbyn government, the very same prospect that holds the Tories back from ditching Mrs May, also highlights their need to find a compelling alternative to Labour’s revived statism and centralism. Logically, the Conservative party needs to find a believable and pragmatic business agenda that reins in top pay and treats workers more fairly. Yet it will never do that by sticking to the status quo."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/aug/28/tv-panel-show-women-comedy-format-gender","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-28T17:12:49Z","webTitle":"How should the BBC replace TV panel shows?

With more women, for starters","bodyText":"Can a desk make a career? With the BBC suggesting that it is going to phase out panel shows, this question is an important one for the comedy industry. And as someone who has benefited from taking part in a few TV comedy panel shows, I would say yes, and no … At their best, panel shows can be a fluid, fun playtime with all your comedic mates. At their worst, you are cut off at the set-up of a joke so someone else can nick the punchline. I’ve generally enjoyed the ones I’ve been on, but it’s taken me a while to work out how to do them. When you start on them, the more obvious your persona, the easier it is. I’ve only just started to feel comfortable in the way the boys get to be – by getting booked frequently and being surrounded by their mates. The shows I enjoy the most are the ones where I’m on with other female comics, so that I don’t feel like I’m representing all women, I’m just representing me. Panel shows have been a staple of British television for over 25 years and if the BBC ditches the format, it will leave a very big hole in the comedy landscape. Almost every comedian of note on the UK scene has appeared on a panel show at one time or another; some of those comics have been launched into the stratosphere from those appearances, others not so much, but it is undeniable that all have “levelled up” in one way or another. Where will these opportunities come from now? It’s great that the BBC want to commission more shows like The Mash Report, but with a fixed cast of four or five, where is the entry point for newer comedians? Granted, the panel show format was never ideal in that regard either: of the seven comedians that appear on Mock the Week, three are permanent male cast members, and the four available spots are very often filled by an established rota of men. When a new comic does get a shot, they’re competing with the regulars who audiences already know and love. Some may argue that it’s trial by fire and a great proving ground, but in reality familiarity is what leads to success. The main thing with any panel show is establishing yourself, and that’s hard when you only get to do one a year. Also, if a show sticks to a one-woman-per-episode policy, then we are made to feel that we are up against every other female comic for that privilege. It’s Highlander mentality … there can be only one. It is also a peculiarly British thing to feel the need to add a competitive element to comedy. Whether it’s in the dishing out of awards – judging a one-liner merchant against a political comic and someone clowning – or putting a bunch of us behind a desk to see who can do the best gags and win points. In the US they take a much less gladiatorial approach to comedy on TV: bringing people together for sketches a la Saturday Night Live or Inside Amy Schumer, and letting comics shoot the breeze or do standup on various nightly TV chat shows. I hope that, whatever the format of the new comedy shows that emerge from the BBC, women get a fair crack of the whip. We are nowhere near equal representation on screen yet. Let’s have a female-fronted satire show or topical chat show. Let’s see women of all ages, ethnicities and backgrounds. Let’s see women in their forties, fifties and sixties fronting their own shows like the male comics. While we’re at it, it’d be nice if being an Oxbridge graduate wasn’t a prerequisite, either. • Tiff Stevenson is a standup comedian and actor"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"music/shortcuts/2017/aug/29/titanic-soundtrack-gateway-drug-classical-music-greats","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-29T17:34:00Z","webTitle":"Can the Titanic soundtrack be a gateway drug to classical music’s greats?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/shortcuts/2017/aug/29/titanic-soundtrack-gateway-drug-classical-music-greats","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/shortcuts/2017/aug/29/titanic-soundtrack-gateway-drug-classical-music-greats","fields":{"headline":"Can the Titanic soundtrack be a gateway drug to classical music’s greats?","bodyText":"James Horner’s soundtrack to Titanic is the bestselling classical album of the past 25 years, according to Classic FM. Titanic: Music from the Motion Picture has sold more than 1m copies in the UK alone, surpassed 30m copies worldwide and risen to No 1 in 20 countries. You know you know it. Cast your mind back to 1997. First come the uilleann pipes: that’s Eric Rigler, an American player who previously worked with Horner on Aliens and Braveheart and has a band called – horrifyingly – Bad Haggis. His grace notes communicate directly with the album-buying soul of the US’s Celtic diaspora. Then comes the breathy vocals of Sissel Kyrkjebø, the bass lines lurking like icebergs in the deep, and Horner’s intriguing ability to make the instruments of the London Symphony Orchestra sound like Midi files. Céline Dion’s famous tune pops up all over the place. It is relentlessly rousing, but it doesn’t feel right without the full force of her larynx. (Eventually, we get Dion herself, after an agonising hour.) Apparently, the film’s director, James Cameron, wanted Enya to collaborate on the score, but she turned him down, so Horner selflessly replicated her knack for ear-gougingly fey Celtic wisp. The formula did the trick. Following the wild success of the first album, Horner made another suite, which he released in 1998 under the name Back to Titanic. Of the many disturbing aspects to this story, several concern categorisation. If commercial classical radio stations devise their playlists based on algorithms and perceived popularity ratings (which they do), then the music that shouts loudest will drown out the rest (which it does). Classical crossover is a mega industry complete with its own phenomenally lucrative stars (Il Divo, Katherine Jenkins, Josh Groban) and its own glossy production aesthetics, which can make a set of uilleann pipes sound interchangeable with an oboe, a panpipe or a synth. Horner’s score was lauded for its diverse influences, but in truth it is ersatz everything: ersatz traditional Irish, ersatz classical strings. It is like Botox on an eyebrow – with this degree of gloss, forget about grit, about risk, about surprise, nuance or authenticity. So, if you were one of the millions who purchased Titanic: Music from the Motion Picture, where do you go from here? You could watch Ludovico Einaudi playing piano on an iceberg – or you could escape the crossover vortex. For decent Irish music, try Planxty or Lankum. For decent film music, try Mica Levi, a creator of some powerful modern movie scores, or wind backwards through greats such as Miklós Rózsa, Dimitri Tiomkin, Franz Waxman and Bernard Herrmann (Hitchcock’s favourites) to Erich Korngold, who arguably invented the Hollywood sound. From Korngold, meet Richard Strauss, meet fin de siècle Vienna – heck, meet Arnold Schoenberg.

Under the slogan “Boys are born, Men are made”, the Manhood Academy reaches out to boys from African and Caribbean communities in London whose fathers are absent or unable to provide the support and encouragement that is crucial if they are to become confident and successful men. “A lot of young boys are growing up without fathers and lack that male imprint of principles necessary for them to make a positive move towards manhood. I can relate, as I know if I had a father figure I wouldn’t have made half the mistakes I made growing up,” Williams says. Williams and the other founders of the Manhood Academy – including Hughie Rose, Daniel Thomas, Kehinde Ogunlabi and Khonsu Sankofa – have developed a unique mentoring service for boys aged eight to 19, with a rites-of-passage theme inspired by a life-changing visit Williams made to the Gambia in 2016 to explore his own family’s roots. Instead, he found something he hadn’t bargained for, when he saw boys undergoing a ceremony that formally marked them as men and celebrated that transition. It was so different from the experience of similar boys in this country, he says. “I was truly humbled to witness this and something just clicked for me. This is exactly what’s missing in our community and could be the very tradition young people could benefit from.” It was then that Williams decided to recreate a more urban rites of passage, tailored to the complex needs of boys growing up in London. Williams has been creating drop-ins to help young people for many years, including outlets for them to air the issues that affect them. Much of what he has learned from listening to their frustrations has helped to shape what the academy now offers. “It made me realise how boys are in most need of our attention. They just want to belong – that’s what makes football so popular among men and could possibly be why gang culture emerged. Here at the Manhood Academy we push for their success to speak louder than any stereotypes.” The mentors are working in schools and at the Kori centre in north London. Many of the boys on the programme are referred to the academy by their school and their concerned mothers. I visit the Manhood Academy on a Wednesday afternoon and the sweet sound of singing wafts through the community centre: “Just another healing cry, going out to you and I,” trills Albert Johnson, one of the eight co-founders, as he vacuums the space before the boys arrive. Mentors arrange chairs in a circle. All of them are wearing striking wooden handcrafted beaded necklaces, some with a healing stone attached that hangs just above the Manhood Academy print across their sweatshirts. They discuss their intentions for the session. Johnson says: “We are committed to investing in possibilities for boys and their greatness as opposed to stereotypes. Here, we create a space where positive possibilities become realities.” Possibility is definitely in the air as a group of boys aged between eight and 12 pile in. There is a homely feel to the academy with a sense of brotherhood among the boys. Before this afternoon’s session – on commitment and values – can begin, the boys are required to surrender phones and hats, and each has to make his own affirmations. “I am focused!” shouts one boy as he heads towards his seat. “I am awesome!” says the next. Mentor Rio McLaren asks them, “What are your commitments?” Then it is on to teaching the importance of committing their energy to something positive. “Commitment is loyalty to something you set out to do long after the mood you said it in has left you.” Williams then explains to them that their core values can help them to stick at something. “It’s important for you young men to become independent of the influences of your friends and the media in order to make conscious decisions that align with values you set.” Later, Williams tells me, “A lot of our boys value their mothers. They desperately want to step up and support them. We challenge them, saying if you value your mother, what does that look like? Is exclusion from school or bringing police to your mother’s door supporting her? Sometimes there’s a discrepancy and we mirror this to them, urging them not to jeopardise their values to impress peers. “We teach the boys that to be successful you have to be willing to give something up. Grief, anger and even friends are just some of the things that hold them back from their true potential.” It is clear that some of the discussions are uncomfortable. “We don’t shy away from difficult topics,” says Williams. “We urge the boys to come out of their comfort zones emotionally, because that’s how you make connections.” The academy works through a series of modules. The first module is called Earth, “which is all about grounding boys in their core values, self belief and establishing career goals”. The boys are currently undergoing their second module, Fire. Here they learn about anger management and emotional intelligence. “Emotions run high on Father’s Day, there were tears and it was by far our most emotional session. It was important for us to let them cry, bottling it up only leads to emotions being displaced negatively on others.” Each boy was asked to write a letter to his dad, with no pressure to post it. “This gives them the ability to transform their anger and sadness into the change they want to see,” says Williams. His passion is inspiring, but where does it come from? “It all started 20 years ago when I was a football coach for Leyton Orient. I worked with many talented boys, but their attitude wasn’t healthy and it held them back tremendously.” He is also influenced by his own childhood in the East End of London: “The community was close-knit, neighbours really looked out for us and we wouldn’t dream of doing anything too naughty, for our mothers would surely know about it before we got home. “Today’s kids have it hard. Most aren’t allowed to play freely as we once did. The headlines breed fear. People walk past each other in the street with not so much as a hello, or good morning. Strong connections aren’t made in the community any more. “Teens have it harder, all it takes is a wrong look, or to step on someone’s toe by mistake and it could spark trouble. The Gambia was nothing like this. The boys didn’t struggle, because they had a whole community guiding them. Schools in this country aren’t meeting the needs of young boys any more. Young people learn more from their surroundings than textbooks alone, so let’s give them some scope to broaden their way of thinking.” The older boys at the academy now have the chance to visit the Gambia themselves, to be a part of the coming-of-age ceremony to solidify their rites of passage on a cultural exchange trip. “The London boys will be partnered with kids their age from the Gambia and will face various challenges together in a rural setting to implement what they have learned.” Williams admits that “many of the boys we work with have never left London, so we believe this trip will broaden their horizons as it once did mine, and put a lot of things in perspective for them moving forward in to adulthood.” • The Manhood Academy is expanding its programme with a Parenthood and Sisterhood Academy for girls, see manhoodacademy.co.uk for more details."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"culture/2017/sep/03/dara-o-briain-beyond-the-sky-childrens-book-interview","type":"article","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-03T08:00:00Z","webTitle":"Dara Ó Briain: ‘Poo is a gateway drug, then I hit them with the cosmology’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2017/sep/03/dara-o-briain-beyond-the-sky-childrens-book-interview","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/2017/sep/03/dara-o-briain-beyond-the-sky-childrens-book-interview","fields":{"headline":"Dara Ó Briain: ‘Poo is a gateway drug, then I hit them with the cosmology’","bodyText":"Wicklow-born Dara Ó Briain, 45, studied maths and theoretical physics at University College Dublin. In the mid-90s he became a children’s TV presenter and standup comic. He has hosted panel show Mock the Week for 12 years, and also presents BBC2’s revival of Robot Wars and astronomy series Stargazing Live. He has now written a children’s book about space. You’re currently writing your next standup show. How’s it going? Slowly. I’m two months away from the tour so I’m staring at a wall of scribbles and half-formed ideas. The process is driven by failure and wine. But it basically gets written on stage. I’ve been doing low-key preview shows in Edinburgh, and it’s the prospect of failure that lights the creative fire. The cold, unamused stare of the audience is a great motivator. Will you include topical material about, say, Trump or Brexit? Trump won’t make the cut. You tend towards the universal and timeless. Trump is anything but. Events move too fast with him – I could write gags about North Korea, then suddenly it’s overtaken by Charlottesville or the solar eclipse. We cover him on Mock the Week, but it’s also difficult to satirise someone so inherently ridiculous. I’ve written a Brexit routine, though. That’s clearly going to drag on slowly and painfully for years, so that’s fine. [Laughs] You’re also just about to publish a children’s book about space, Beyond the Sky. My eight-year-old son has been reading it and chortling away… Oh fantastic, I’m delighted to hear that. I’ve had very little beta testing, as it were. It’s not like I could try it on my own kids. They’d just roll their eyes and walk away. Are your children unimpressed by you? Of course, I’m just embarrassing Dad. The only thing that’s really clicked with them is Robot Wars. Our house is scattered with cardboard cutouts of robots. It’s back on TV in October, and this series there’s a 10-robot battle, so I got the kids along to the studio for that. There were 10 illuminated robots flying around the arena at once. It was by some distance the longest fight ever. By the end there was a huge robot pile-up in the pit, all still clanking and spinning. Even my kids conceded that was pretty cool. How did the kids’ book come about? The publishers approached me after seeing me on Stargazing. They thought my style would fit. Obviously I’m not going to write the sort of book that [co-host] Professor Brian Cox would. My job on Stargazing is to help communicate other, cleverer people’s ideas, rather than give my own view of my universe. I know enough to get by. Cox is the real brains. Was it a challenge to write for children? Kids are as tough an audience as any other. It’s been a fascinating process. The book’s unrecognisable from the manuscript I delivered. I wrote it, then handed it over for a sort of “kids book-imogrification”. They add cartoons and funny fonts, and suddenly it leaps off the page. It’s like seeing your words performed by an actor. It’s definitely for children, not one of those “for kids of all ages” books. If I saw an adult reading it on the train, I’d give them a stern look. [Laughs] You’ve met a lot of astronauts on Stargazing. What are they like? Astronauts are the most fantastic people you’ll ever meet but also the greatest pains in the arse. Whatever anecdote you tell them, they’ll have done a similar thing – but in space. They’re a chore to be around. To be fair, though, I’ve stolen lots of those stories. Like Buzz Aldrin ramming a felt-tip pen into the Apollo 11 control panel to replace a broken switch – he told me that, so I put it straight into the book. Were you space-mad as a boy? I used to recreate scenes from Flash Gordon – running around a 70s kitchen with a colander on my head for a space helmet – but my passion for science really took off when I was 14. I read In Search of Schrödinger’s Cat by John Gribbin, then Chaos by James Gleick and later, Stephen Hawking’s A Brief History of Time. That was what fired it all. You interviewed Professor Hawking two years ago on BBC1. How was that? Mind-bogglingly brilliant. A career highlight. There was none of that “never meet your heroes” syndrome because he was a delight. It was difficult in the sense that it’s slow to communicate, with these long pauses while he comes up with a response. I was burbling and floundering around awkwardly, but after it aired I met some people from a motor neurone disease charity and they thanked us for leaving that bit in, because people don’t know how to handle it. It’s important to show that it can be uncomfortable and that’s OK. Did you stargaze in childhood yourself? A bit. I had a nerdy little relationship with Ursa Major. Wherever I was, I would look up to it. When I was putting the bins out, it was like a scene from Annie: “Poor little me, made to do chores, but I’ll always have the Plough, my friend in the sky.” There’s a weepy Irish space musical in this. [Laughs] I also remember the first time I saw the Perseid meteor shower. I was studying for my physics finals in the shed one night, went out into the garden to have a think, then looked up and saw shooting stars over my head. That was a nice moment. There’s your rousing finale for the musical. My son loved the stuff in your book about astronauts’ toilet habits… The way that wee gets turned back into drinking water and poo gets dispatched back down to Earth? If you ever do a school assembly about space, that’s the first thing kids want to know. How do you do normal things up there? Specifically, how do you poo and wee? There’s real fascination for that stuff. So poo is a gateway drug, then I hit them with the cosmology. Come for the poo, stay for the black holes. Which children’s books do you rate? We’ve done all the Wimpy Kids, Tom Gateses, Philip Pullmans and Harry Potters. I’m gently pushing my two towards the classics, so we’ve been reading Oliver Twist recently. The language is dense but we’re ploughing through it. The two things that keep tripping us up are Fagin being repeatedly referred to as “The Jew” – yikes, that was an interesting teaching moment – and the character called Master Bates. It’s like that urban myth about Captain Pugwash. What are you reading at the moment? I flit between lit-fic and factual. Right now, it’s A Horse Walks into a Bar by David Grossman, which is excellent, and Robert Webb’s new book, How Not To Be a Boy, which I’m also enjoying. My all-time favourites are Philip Roth and Peter Carey. I bought a signed first edition of Oscar and Lucinda in Dublin last week, then got home and realised I already had two copies. So I’m well served for Oscar and Lucindas. One for every floor of the house. You’re a guest judge on Channel 4 contest Lego Masters. Are you a big Lego fan? Hell, yeah. You can’t beat that satisfying brick-to-brick click. I still remember the milestone moment I sold my Lego to buy a Commodore 64. Did you see that story recently about David Beckham making a Lego Disney castle for his daughter? Everyone thought that was cute but he built it when she was in bed! Surely the idea of Lego is that she makes it? The whole point is building. It’s like, “Look, I’ve finished your toy. Oh, and I bought you some paints but I’ve already painted a picture and used them up.” It’s a really weird thing to do. Speaking of footballers, you’re an Arsenal season ticket-holder. Are you Wenger in or Wenger out? I’m Wenger shake it all about. You caused a chip shop controversy recently… [Laughs] I discovered this place in Dublin that serves chips with peppercorn sauce, which was awesome, and tweeted, “This changes everything.” Except everyone got in a tizz about what I called the chip shop. I always say chipper but apparently in Belfast they say chippy. An Irish newspaper had an online poll and everything. It wasn’t vive la difference, it was “You, sir, are incorrect!” Chips can drive a wedge between us in a way that Brexit never will.

Stocks listed in Paris and Frankfurt also fell on Tuesday and the dollar came under pressure, underscoring the flight from equities to safe haven assets, including gold. The index of blue chip companies was down more than 1% before rallying to close at 7,337, down 64 points or 0.9%, following the news that a North Korean ballistic missile had flown over Hokkaido in northern Japan. The German Dax was the worst affected, falling by 1.5%, while the French CAC was down 1%. David Madden, a market analyst at CMC Markets, said: “The standoff between the US and North Korea never went away, and as of last night it is back in the forefront of traders’ minds. Tensions have shifted up a gear, and dealers are dumping stocks while the political situation plays out.” In London, financials were the biggest drag on the index, with the sector wiping more than 22 points off the index. Lenders Lloyds, Barclays and Standard Chartered all fell between 1.2% and 2%. In the energy sector, heavyweights BP and Royal Dutch Shell were both down about 1%. The German banks Commerzbank and Deutsche Bank were among the top 10 losers in Frankfurt. But while European stock markets lost ground, the euro and the pound were seen by investors as safe haven currencies. The euro has climbed two cents in as many days in reaction to the row brewing between Washington and Kim Jong-un’s administration. Last week, tensions appeared to ease, but the latest missile launch provoked a demand from Japan’s prime minister, Shinzo Abe, for further action against North Korea. “The race to the safe havens has seen the dollar ditched, which is resulting in some fresh and unwelcome sterling and euro strength,” said Mike van Dulken, the head of research at Accendo Markets. Some commentators said the euro’s status as a safe haven was increasing its value to a level where it was harming French and German exports, putting pressure on the European Central Bank to implement policies that will prevent the currency rising any further in value. Surveys of business confidence in Germany have fallen back in recent weeks in response to the euro and its impact on the country’s exports. Wall Street also suffered as the full impact of the heavy rains from tropical storm Harvey became clearer. More than 30 inches (76cm) have fallen in some areas, leading to widespread flooding, and close to two feet (60cm) more could fall over the next few days. Analysts said the cost of the storm could be about $50bn (£43bn). Energy companies also suffered falls following reports that oil producers in Texas had shut wells as a precaution against the storms. The majority of US oil is produced in the Texas region and Goldman Sachs estimated that as much as 17% of production could be affected. Many investors turned to gold as a safe haven, pushing up the price by $4 an ounce to $1,321. In a sign of demand for the precious metal, the investment firm the Pure Gold Company said it had seen a sharp increase in people buying physical gold. Its chief executive, Josh Saul, said: “We have been taking orders from clients citing fears that tensions between the US and North Korea will escalate after North Korea’s latest missile test over Japan. “President Trump has [previously] vowed to respond with ‘fire and fury’ and many of our clients believe this will make the situation considerably worse, increasing the unpredictability of the geopolitical situation.” The firm reported a 78% increase in clients investing in physical gold on the expectation that the equity markets and the dollar will continue to slip while the gold price rallies. “Physical gold investment from first-time purchasers has increased by 87% as they worry about market uncertainty in the face of such volatile world leaders,” Saul said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2017/aug/29/investigators-believe-toxic-cloud-on-sussex-coast-came-from-ship","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-29T17:27:56Z","webTitle":"Toxic cloud on Sussex coast may have come from ship, say sources","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/aug/29/investigators-believe-toxic-cloud-on-sussex-coast-came-from-ship","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/aug/29/investigators-believe-toxic-cloud-on-sussex-coast-came-from-ship","fields":{"headline":"Toxic cloud on Sussex coast may have come from ship, say sources","bodyText":"Authorities investigating the cause of Sunday’s chemical cloud are working on the assumption that it came from a ship in the Channel after environmental monitoring sites picked up a localised spike in pollution levels. The Maritime and Coastguard Agency is working with the Environment Agency to establish the source of the cloud, which left 150 people seeking medical treatment and caused the evacuation of Birling Gap beach in East Sussex. So far there is no evidence that the cloud came from an inland source, and authorities have also played down speculation that it could have drifted from as far as France. A source close to the investigation said: “It might be a ship venting, but let’s wait and see.” A satellite imaging agency may have located a possible source of the chemical plume to a boat close to the East Sussex shore. Neodaas, a facility of the UK Natural Environment Research Council that works with the Plymouth Marine Laboratory and the University of Dundee, tweeted images appearing to show a plume coming off a boat on Sunday morning. One image showed a plume of around 3.5km long. Neodaas is urging the Met Office to help determine whether wind speeds at the time could have drawn the plume onshore. Two pollution monitoring sites on the south coast picked up a quadrupling in ozone levels in a 30-minute period on Sunday afternoon, suggesting the toxic cloud came from a nearby ship. One site at Devonshire Park in Eastbourne, and the national monitoring site at Lullington Heath, East Sussex, are both within five miles of Birling Gap. Timothy Baker, from King’s College London’s environmental research group, which manages the pollution monitoring network for Sussex local authorities, said these readings suggested the source was nearby and offshore because of the wind direction at the time. “We are not sure what it was, but there was a very distinct peak: the levels quadrupled at the time that incident was reported. Within the space of about half an hour the readings we were getting from those sites went from 30 up to about 120 parts per billion of ozone,” said Baker. No other sites recorded a rise, he said. Similar levels of ozone pollution were reported during the 2003 heatwave, but at the time the levels did not rise so quickly, and no one reported stinging eyes, sore throats and vomiting as they did on Sunday. Baker said: “The most likely scenario is that it was either ozone combined with something else, or it is something that has reacted in a similar way to ozone and hence triggered the analysers.” He added: “It was probably something relatively close. I’ve heard speculation that it may have drifted over from France. The speed of the rise and very isolated points at which it was detected would seem to indicate that was less likely, because the further away the source the more it spreads. “All the indications were that the wind was coming in off the sea at the time.” Asked if the pollution came from a ship, he said: “All I can say is that it was something that came in off the sea.” An Environment Agency spokesman said: “We are currently investigating any potential onshore sources of the pollution and to date we have not identified anything that could be attributed to the mist and we are liaising with the Maritime and Coastguard Agency, who are doing similar investigations offshore.” Baker said the source of the cloud was still a mystery. “We have spent most of the day looking at it and we haven’t got a definitive answer yet. We don’t think it is just ozone that caused it. The monitoring sites don’t record all possible pollutants. If it was an unusual chemical it is possible that it may have triggered a similar reaction within the analyser to ozone.” Nothing was seen on other polluting detectors including those for nitrogen dioxide, Baker said. “Ozone is not an emitted pollutant. It is caused by reactions within the atmosphere. The levels of pollution didn’t indicate that this was a normal reaction, because ozone usually rises slowly and builds to a peak during the middle of the afternoon. This went up to four times what it was in half an hour,” he said. East Sussex fire and rescue service said the investigation was likely to take some time. Gas-monitoring equipment used in the aftermath of the incident failed to conclusively identify the gas, it said. It said the expert team investigating the incident concluded that the gas was unlikely to be chlorine “due to the symptoms and situation described”. It added: “All agencies involved ask that investigators are given time to carry out their work rather than speculate on possible causes.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/true-north/2017/aug/29/welcoming-haitian-refugees-to-canada-isnt-about-generosity-but-justice","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-29T16:36:29Z","webTitle":"Welcoming Haitian refugees to Canada isn’t about generosity but justice | Martin Lukacs","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/true-north/2017/aug/29/welcoming-haitian-refugees-to-canada-isnt-about-generosity-but-justice","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/true-north/2017/aug/29/welcoming-haitian-refugees-to-canada-isnt-about-generosity-but-justice","fields":{"headline":"Welcoming Haitian refugees to Canada isn’t about generosity but justice","bodyText":"The minders of Canadian PM Justin Trudeau’s brand are surely displeased. He’s spent two years cultivating an image of Canada’s refugee system as the political equivalent of airport hugs and teddy-bears. And now the pressure is on him to act like that were remotely the truth. The image of the country as a welcome haven was pitched to win the support of millions of people in Canada who rightly feel two things: compassion for the plight of refugees and disgust for the antics of Donald Trump. But refugee rights advocates had warned what would come to pass: desperate people would take Trudeau at his word. Hence an influx of thousands of Haitian refugees from the United States—afraid of being deported back to Haiti by Trump—now await an uncertain fate in Canada. The Liberal government may have been happy to reap the political benefits of Trudeau’s PR posture. But apart from accepting a small number of Syrian refugees, they have dumped hundreds back in Haiti since they lifted a ban on deportations to the country in 2016. And they have studiously avoided removing other barriers that would make Canada a truly welcoming country. The current debate has so far focussed on one such barrier: a 2004 agreement with the US that bars almost all refugees from making an asylum claim at a Canada-US border post. That’s why they are increasingly turning to precarious crossings—at which point they can at least get a hearing. This agreement—whose basis is the indefensible notion that the United States is safe for refugees—should long ago have been scrapped. Instead Trudeau has turned to admonishing Haitians, dispatching a minister to the United States to warn Haitians against seeking asylum in Canada. “For someone to successfully seek asylum it’s not about economic migration,” Trudeau warned. “It’s about vulnerability, exposure to torture or death, or being stateless people.” “Economic refugees,” of course, are not entitled to asylum. And this is where the base ranting of right-wing tabloids and anti-immigrant racists, who have stoked hate and fear of “selfish queue-jumpers,” dovetails with the high-minded reasoning of elite pundits and Liberal policy-makers preaching pragmatic limits and strict refugee criteria. Both adhere to a brand that is much more enduring than this latest Prime Minister’s: the brand of an innocent Canada, whose benevolence is indisputable, whose humanitarian impulse is never in doubt. What they disagree about is whether Canada should bestow it on refugees. Astonishingly, what has merited not a single mention in mainstream discussion is that Canada doesn’t stand at a remove from the misery that Haitians are fleeing: we had a direct hand in it. Ignoring this history—and absolving Canada of responsibility for Haiti’s situation—has created the greatest barrier of all to refugees receiving the welcome they deserve. Haiti’s long-suffering people, who have endured a line of dictatorships, had a brief respite in the last quarter century: a popular democratic wave that swept priest Jean-Bertrand Aristide to power. He raised the minimum wage from mere pennies, disbanded an army that bullied the population, and started providing education and medical care to the poor majority. Defying the agenda of the Haitian elite and multinational companies who used the country for cheap labour made Aristide enemies—the US, France, and sadly, Canada. in 2003, the Liberal government of the time hosted US and French officials to plot Aristide’s ouster. They cut aid to his government. And when US marines invaded the country, Canadian soldiers guarded the airport while they flew out Aristide and dumped him in Africa. A United Nations military force, commanded for a period by Canadians, occupied the country, providing cover for the regime installed after this coup d’état. Thousands of Haitians were killed. The Canadian government’s role was hardly based on humanitarianism: having refused a full role in the US war on Iraq, they needed to get back in the good graces of George Bush. In a moment of candour out of sync with our humanitarian brand, ex Liberal Foreign Affairs Minister Bill Graham explained: “Foreign Affairs view was there is a limit to how much we can constantly say no to the political masters in Washington…eventually we came on side on Haiti, so we got another arrow in our quiver.” The cost to Haitians of this cynical calculus was incalculable. Since the coup, Haiti has lurched from disaster to disaster, compounded by governments more accountable to the US than its own people. The devastating earthquake of 2010 was shaped by inequality and deliberate under-development that Haiti was plunged back into after Aristide’s ousting. The impact of similar storms on neighbouring Cuba—whose measures to lift people out of the most impoverished infrastructure have not been blocked by western governments—was a fraction of what it was in Haiti. Western governments have tried to wash their hands of their victims. In the wake of the earthquake, Obama’s administration built a fortress around Haiti: coast guards cruised the waters to prevent any from fleeing; air force bombers dropped messages in the country, warning that “if you leave, you will be arrested and returned”; and a US private prison company started setting up a detention centre in Guantanamo Bay, while Haitians had not yet dug themselves out of the rubble. And the reconstruction effort that millions of people around the world compassionately contributed to? Botched by the U.S. and Canada, it left Haiti with plenty of industrial parks for sweatshop employers and luxury hotels for tourists and NGO officers, but virtually no new housing for the million Haitians who had been made homeless. To make matters even worse, the occupying UN force introduced the world’s largest cholera epidemic into the country — it has killed 30,000, infected 2 million people, and rages on. Canada has “slapped some make-up” on the situation to justify deporting people to the country, says Haitian human rights lawyer Patrice Florvilus, who fled to Montreal from Haiti in 2013 after facing death threats. “Canada claims things have returned to normal. They have not. There is criminalization of homosexuality and dissent, assassinations, a corrupt justice system. So much suffering has flowed from the coup onward, and the state now has no capacity to protects its citizens. Canada should assume responsibility for the chaos and injustice it helped create.” Haiti is today sliding back toward dictatorship: disastrously bad elections, sanctioned by the US and Canada, have produced a parliament packed with thugs and drug dealers, the old army is being revived, and leading figures in the current government have links to the dictatorships of old. All of this could hardly be a better example of the slogan repeated by migrant justice movements around the world: “We are here because you were there.” Western government’s wars, their ransacking of resources, the manipulation and impoverishment of poor countries, has led to an inevitable flow of displaced and persecuted to our shores. “If Canada wants to become a real beacon for refugees, here is an opportunity prove it,” says Florvilus, who believes Canada should grant special refugee status to the arriving Haitians. He’s right. After all of our crimes toward that country, asylum should serve as the barest of reparations. The refugees arriving are hardly a “flood,” or “unsustainable” — they are drop in the bucket alongside the immigrants that arrive every year. As climate change wreaks devastation around the world, these numbers are sure to grow. In past decades, mobilizations led by the Haitian community in Montreal have forced the Canadian government to act more in line with its rhetoric. That can happen again. Now is the time to fight for the values that will govern how we address the graver refugee migrations to come. In the final account, welcoming refugees isn’t a matter of generosity, or burnishing Brand Justin — it’s a matter of justice.

He doesn’t want to tell you. Or rather, he wants to tell you that he doesn’t want to tell you. In recent interviews Aronofsky has insisted he wants to keep the details of the film secret, before going on to describe it as “a cruise missile shooting into a wall”, “a very intense ride”, with “home-invasion elements” and other such hints, just in case you thought it might be a sequel to Mamma Mia!. “Secrecy” is a pretty elastic term when it comes to the movies. Many a film-maker has become obsessive about keeping everything under wraps – usually the type whose movies hinge on grand mysteries and twists. It’s standard practice to swear casts to silence and guard scripts as if they’re nuclear codes. Christopher Nolan would only give Hans Zimmer one page of information about Interstellar when he commissioned him to do the score, for example. Someone who worked on James Cameron’s Avatar told me the non-disclosure agreement was the size of a telephone book, and contained the phrase “in this universe or any other” – and they probably weren’t even allowed to disclose that. But at the same time, they want us to know about the movie, don’t they? So “secrecy” has become part of the marketing strategy. Years ahead of release, we dutifully follow the trail of clues: an on-set Instagram here, a cryptic fansite interview there, a 30-second teaser trailer, maybe some preview footage – each giving away a precisely calibrated amount of new information to keep us speculating and salivating. Often such snippets spoil the movie’s surprises entirely. Often there wasn’t much to spoil anyway. The promotion has become the real mystery thriller; the eventual movie is merely a summing up of the case. This is probably all Alfred Hitchcock’s fault. He knew the suspense game began long before the movie’s release. He bought up all the copies of the novel on which Psycho was based, so nobody would know the plot twists. He informed viewers that “no one… BUT NO ONE… will be admitted to the theatre after the start of each performance”, and warned them not to give away Psycho’s secrets. For good measure, though, Hitchcock also recorded a six-minute prologue, touring the movie’s locations like a squeamish estate agent. “They’ve cleaned all this up now,” he says, inspecting Janet Leigh’s bathroom. Yet Psycho still delivered the promised shock. Let’s hope Mother! does too, because Aronofsky’s comments and the latest trailer already give away far too much.

I don’t usually find it this difficult – but then I don’t usually do it while balancing on a surfboard in a swimming pool. This is what you do in Floatfit, one of a whopping 93 classes on the programme of YogaFit, a retreat in Ibiza. It is a far cry from the average yoga holiday, which might offer a couple of classes a day. Here, my record was seven different classes in one day. It is also more affordable than most: guests can stay for just three night, or up to seven. YogaFit is the brainchild of London-based Lyndsay Jay, a fitness instructor (and model), who, twice a year, takes over the Cala Blanca beach resort on Es Figueral beach on Ibiza’s quiet north-eastern coast. The usual holidaymakers are replaced by 30 hyperactive instructors and hundreds of sporty guests, who can mix and match yoga and fitness classes. On my visit last October (retreats also run in April), there were 22 kinds of yoga, from beginners’ hatha to advanced rocket. The day starts at dawn with sunrise yoga on a deck overlooking the sea, and ends at 10.30pm after soothing bedtime meditation. In between, guests can take as many classes as they like. I found myself shaking my booty to Indian pop at a Bhangracise class with a brilliantly camp instructor, and attempting (and failing) to keep up with choreographed Ibiza club classics. There is plenty of hardcore fitness. Tabata, a very short high-intensity interval training (HIIT) workout, proved that four minutes is more than enough time to wear yourself out – especially the pool version. Beach circuits was another sweat fest, but with the bonus of a cooling dip in the sea. Perhaps the most surreal was Blockfit, billed as four workouts in one class, and led by none other than Chico, the former X Factor contestant (“What time is it?” “It’s Chico time!”). There was also a running club, and on the next retreat there will be kayak and cycling tours. Almost everything is included in the price. I could have paid extra for SUP yoga in the sea, but it was too windy to attempt it. At the hippier end of the scale, we practised “healing breath yoga”: sitting in a circle, holding hands and hyperventilating. Some people began to sob; it was a bit cult-like for my liking. Better was a yin yoga sound bath, a slow, candlelit class to the soothing sounds of singing bowls. Talks ranged from healthy eating to life-coaching. I went to a short nutrition session, which boiled down to: sugar is evil. Alex, the nutritionist, led us around the buffet, pointing out the foods to eat and avoid. (Advice I ignored: I wasn’t going to turn down rice and seafood in Spain!) Lyndsay runs the show with her husband, her brother and his wife, and has thought of pretty much everything. I arrived with an injured knee, and a physiotherapist gave me a sports massage that bordered on the miraculous. There was even a skin cancer doctor running a mole clinic with a state-of-the-art scanner. The resort is huge, with parts a little dated and some rooms quite basic, but it is gradually being renovated. Food, drink and even childcare (ages three and above) are included – the restaurant offers a few healthy dishes alongside the regular buffet. I had a break from booze, but there is no pressure – some people were drinking cava for breakfast. Though there were about 250 of us on the retreat (there’s capacity for 400) the instructors gave everyone a bit of individual attention. The mainly British participants ranged from fitness fanatics to mothers and daughters enjoying the sun, plus a handful of men; the oldest was 84, the youngest 16. I felt perfectly comfortable attending on my own, although I’d love to go back with my sisters to have more fun and a bit less exercise. I was expecting the resort to be closed to non-retreaters, but there were a few normal holidaymakers on site. Pity (or envy) the men trying to play darts next to the twerking class, as pop songs blared out and 50 people thrust their hips in unison… Guests can see a bit of the island, too: we walked to Pou des Lleo, an inlet with rust-coloured cliffs, unusual rock formations and spiky succulents. We also went to view Es Vedra, an island said to be the third-most magnetic place on the planet, with amazing healing properties. Luckily, you don’t have to believe in that to appreciate the beauty of the spot at sunset. I left after five days, a little sad to miss dancing in the moonlight at the farewell pool party. But I felt fantastic after all that exercise, good food and deep, exhaustion-induced sleep. It didn’t last, of course – but all the more reason to go back and perfect those balancing burpees. • Accommodation, meals and classes were provided by YogaFitret Reats.

The Financial Conduct Authority’s ad campaign, which is being paid for by the 18 banks, building societies and credit card providers with the most PPI complaints, is being launched exactly two years before the 29 August 2019 deadline for claims. It features an animatronic model head of Schwarzenegger mounted on tracks that pursues supermarket shoppers urging them to stop procrastinating and look into making a PPI claim. “Make a decision, do it now,” says the robotic Schwarzenegger threateningly, in scenes reminiscent of the Terminator’s dogged pursuit of his intended victim, Sarah Connor, in the 1980s film. The mini-terminator is voiced by David Brent, a Canadian actor and comedian. The £42m campaign has been created by M&amp;C Saatchi, the Conservative party’s longstanding ad agency, and will first air during Emmerdale on ITV1 on Tuesday night. “With this advertising campaign, our biggest challenge is cutting through the noise on PPI and we have created a campaign that is designed to do just that,” said Emma Stranack, the FCA’s head of business and consumer communications. “We have undertaken extensive testing to ensure the creative idea was impactful and understood by our very broad target audience. The result is a suite of adverts that we are confident will help us achieve our campaign objectives.” The FCA said it was spending £42.2m on the entire “deadline awareness” marketing push, with £24.4m of that going on the ad campaign across TV, billboards and posters, online and video-on-demand services. In addition, £4.9m was spent producing the ads, to cover items such as talent fees – including Schwarzenegger’s image rights – and another £4.2m was spent on a helpline and website. Agency fees, for M&amp;C Saatchi and the media planning and buying agency Manning Gottlieb OMD, totalled £3m. A further £3m was spent on partnerships, PR and social media customer service, and £1m on legal fees, staff costs and contingency. The FCA spent £1.7m on evaluation and testing to ensure the ad campaign hits the mark with consumers. “When people hear ‘PPI’ they switch off. We’ve heard so much about it, we’ve stopped listening,” said M&amp;C Saatchi executive creative director Justin Tindall. “This campaign is designed to cut through the white noise and capture people’s attention.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"higher-education-network/2017/aug/31/without-accessible-conferences-we-lose-the-voices-of-disabled-academics","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-31T06:30:23Z","webTitle":"Without accessible conferences, we lose the voices of disabled academics","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/2017/aug/31/without-accessible-conferences-we-lose-the-voices-of-disabled-academics","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/higher-education-network/2017/aug/31/without-accessible-conferences-we-lose-the-voices-of-disabled-academics","fields":{"headline":"Without accessible conferences, we lose the voices of disabled academics","bodyText":"Academic conference season is in full swing. For early-career researchers, conferences offer opportunities to share ideas and build networks. More established academics attend to meet with colleagues, old friends and learn about the latest work in their field. But they can also be a stressful, distressing and exhausting experience, particularly for disabled academics. Their first thought will not be the speaker line-up, but the accessibility of conference buildings. This includes the location of the conference venue – is it within easy reach of the closest airport? Are there wheelchair accessible hotels nearby? Even once answers to these questions have been obtained, there can still be barriers. I recently interviewed over 60 disabled academics in the UK for a research project. One participant, Anne*, told me that she had researched a recent conference carefully, sourced finance to support her carer’s attendance and hired a motorised wheelchair. The conference organisers insisted that the venue was wheelchair accessible. Arriving at the hotel, Anne found that there were steps to enter the building and she had to use the delivery entrance. Once inside it was clear that the lecture halls were not wheelchair accessible. Having spent considerable amounts of money, she had to sit outside the venue while her carer attended the sessions and took notes. Some academics love networking, others hate it, but for disabled academics the challenges go beyond personal preference. Anne said she was unable to fully take part in informal research discussions as she had missed the sessions with her project team. Susan, an academic recently diagnosed with an autism spectrum disorder, finds networking very tiring, and at times impossible. Equally, attending the conference dinner is a key part of the conference experience, but for some academics it isn’t an option. Conferences may start at 8am, going through to 6pm, by which time disabled academics can be too tired to continue working at the conference dinner. Dinners can also be problematic for academics with specific dietary needs. Alison, a researcher with a neurological disorder that is partially managed through a strict diet, has to miss conference dinners, returning to her self-catering accommodation to prepare food. If an academic with coeliac disease accidentally eats wheat in conference catering, the consequences can be embarrassing. Not least given the inaccessibility or lack of availability of bathroom facilities, which were reported to be a significant barrier to conference participation. Fatigue is one of the other primary barriers for disabled academics attending conferences. Academics told me they had fallen asleep at tea breaks or during sessions. For some, end of day socialising was impossible, with researchers returning to their rooms to sleep. Fatigue also extended beyond the conference. Laura told me she needed to take time off work after a conference to recover, a pattern shared by many of the participants in the study. For some participants, conferences were attended but at considerable risk to their health. Difficulty accessing conferences and the informal networking makes it harder for academics to build their networks and raise the profile of their work, which may negatively affect career progression. Promotion and recruitment panels should consider the effects of disability in their decision making. Conference organisers need to make sure that all venues are wheelchair accessible, that bathrooms are nearby and that the conference venue and accommodation are on accessible transport routes. The provision of quiet areas where delegates can relax can also aid participation. It’s worth considering the usefulness of long conference days with a late-night social networking event after, too. When conferences are held on university premises, hospitality teams can ensure accessibility information is clearly provided, including details of accessible taxis and hotels. Conference organisers are under increasing pressure to ensure space for childcare provision, but it’s time for this to extend to accessibility. Otherwise we are missing out on the contributions disabled academics have to make to our discussions. * Names have been changed Join the higher education network for more comment, analysis and job opportunities, direct to your inbox.

It’s long, and adverts are...wearing. But Sandi and Noel could work well if they relax, and the bakers themselves impressed. There are a few artists in there. I’d say that last round alone warranted another week’s watching. I also imagine GeneralMittens is bang on the money with what happens next, but I can’t print that up here. Shame on you. Er, General. Thanks for all your ribaldry/ Jaffa Cake research/ arms crossed nonplussedness everyone! Come say hello to me on twitter or Instagram (I know but it’s 2017). Otherwise, I’ll see you next week, same time. Unless you’ve been arrested by then! Is it dark because they make them stay in the grounds until they cry on camera? Next week is biscuits. I do want to see if Sandi and Noel relax, plus I’m contractually obliged. But I’d love to see you all again! A worthy win for Steven. And Peter is sent home. Called it. Goodbye Peter, we’ll miss you. But then again we didn’t really know you, so easy come, easy go. And the winner is...Microsoft Surface. This show does end tonight yes? What’s in Martin Freeman’s Vodafone bag is it Kevin Bacon advertising some bacon, to a Jake Bugg soundtrack? Did you say you wanted some ad- the upshot is, they’re here. So watch some capitalism and eat your cake. Judging time! Peter is giving the side eye to … himself? He could be on the way home. Noel decides to take one for the team, and leaves instead. I’m worried about his self-confidence, which is not something I thought I would ever worry about with Noel Fielding. “The standard’s been ridiculously high, hasn’t it.” AAAH! The Prue-Liam mutual propositioning staggers Paul. “Mouth-watering.” “I want to come for yours for breakfast.” “Any time.” Pure filth. Maybe that’s the reason the show’s moved to Channel 4? Are we going to get Prue’s Room after-hours webcam access? Stacey’s clutch looks like the mermaid’s purse that issued a kraken, but the flavour’s good. Sophie’s bottle is dry, but Steven, my man love, Steven’s sandwich looks like savoury heaven, and is described as “perfect” in all regards. Can Flo take him down, or does he have this sewn up? Nice bit of anti-Siberian humour from Julia. Not enough of that on the telly. Yan’s synaesthetic marvel wins plaudits, while Kate has points deducted for going topless. James suffers coffee collapse, and Chris’ pie is dry. Flo has made one big melon, singular, depriving the presenters and me the opportunity for seaside humour, and for that, I say: nuts to you. I know we forgot to talk about North Korea, but the interior of Flo’s cake is doing all the talking for us. It’s a big red wedge of superb-ness. Put down your cups of syrup everyone, we’re back, and it’s judging time! That katsu is mouthwatering. The fall of Kevin Bacon is a parable for our age. It’s like something off Black Mirror. Could really do with some adver- oh don’t worry, they’re here. Wow look at that Stork with Butter cake. Yan! What is Yan doing! She’s made a chicken katsu fillet and mango salmon roe made with liquefied agar jelly. A woman after my own heart. I’ve also decided I love Steven. Holy what now? Sophie’s bottle tops look like – how best to put this – an anatomically correct glans. Dong Perignon, anyone? sorry if I’m being Krug. Stacey bins four sponges, and is in a flap. “The clock seems to get faster” worries Chris, like a man whose very sense of reality is under-baked. On the whole though, this lot are actually pretty dang good, right? They’ve been hiding some serious chops in their bushel. I love how the set of Steven’s mouth and deadpan accent give him the fixed demeanour of a man who’s discovered a wiry hair in his yoghurt. Yan meanwhile is making a bananarama. No, a banana ramen. That sounds yumsch, let me at it. Is Noel Fielding in drag as a normal human being? Let your crazy out Noel! I know you want to put an icing bag on your dongle and impersonate Mussolini. Spreadsheet Chris is aping Paul’s own pork pie, which is a bold move. Flo’s melon sounds good too. But Kate! Kate has gone nuclear. Glacier mint glass terrarium housing buttercream houseplants! I don’t even know if that sentence makes English sense! She’s designed the moulds herself, as has Peter. Who is making a cake that looks like a cake, as far as I can see. Stacey’s moist clutch is definitely Noel’s bag, while Sophie has tricked bouncers before with her champagne bucket and bottle cake. Loving Liam’s Hollywood backchat. “Just trust me, Paul.” First name power play! Go on, Liam. Prue does look a little wind-tunnel struck. And a bit Mary Berry Mach II. But I don’t mind her. Thoughts? “Gotta smash it regardless of how I feel.” Not a recipe for mental health, Liam. I worry. I just want to mother him. A cake that looks anything but? Are illusion cakes a thing? Your guys’ verdict seems to be it’s a bit...uncanny valley? Not bad exactly, but too beholden to its forebear? Obviously you didn’t say it like that. And we think Sandi is a bit lost? Educating Manchester looks good... That drumming advert was pretty good, mainly because it wasn’t for cake. Not the dizzy heights of the Dairy Milk gorilla doing Phil Collins, but you have to live in the now. Show the aggressive chicken one! It’s all I want to see. She’s not going to make a...road cake? What’s road cake? Some commercial messages! Everyone’s favourite bit. Are you ready for 115 adverts for cake mix? Judging time! Julia appears constantly on the edge of total mental collapse, though her mini rolls are better than they look. Liam’s “sea inside” rolls are described as “art” by Prue, but Kate’s first ever attempt at mini rolls are glorious. James also impresses with his white lines. Yan and Peter fail the brief, and Kate takes it! She’s redeemed her first round performance, and looks good. s’funny Noel having a lot of fun with the concept of exposed bottoms. Chance would be a fine thing. Promises, promises etc I’m with you Scubar, Flo’s looking good... “They are looking absolutely … awful.” Not sure who said this, I think James, but I can’t stop laughing. That sentence took us on such a journey. OKAY we’re going to have to talk about that bowled over ‘bit’. Not on my watch Sandi. Egregious content “I’ve put white chocolate in with the milk chocolate – see if I can do something with it.” – Peter. Move over James, there’s a new contender! “Nice and smooth, but plenty of body. The egg is the only raising agent in this.” – James, the Barry White of mini rolls. Noel and Sandi look bloody odd together, don’t they. Like a velociraptor and a barn owl hanging out. It is against nature and against God, sir Ah mini rolls, the taste of a hastily improvised picnic. “I’ve never made a mini roll in ma life – why would I?” says Kate slightly angrily. It’s a good point. They cost about 4p for a hundred in the supermarket. Yan describes her effort as “the Peter Beardsley of cakes.” I love her. Another Hollywood handshake! Army veteran Sophie’s pineapple and coconut sandwich provides a wallop of flavour and she is beside herself. She looked like SUCH a Middleton when Paul gave her the digits. Steven’s Bonfire Night cake is a toffee-tailed delight to see, and a spicy hit. James has got a soggy bottom, middle, and a drowned top. Judging time! “No one’s going to eat a marigold.” Prue has an ear for an aphorism. And Noel has a mouth for eating flowers. “Tastes like a clown’s nose.” Kate’s cake is too rosy, Peter’s bicarbonate of burn-your-mouth-off doesn’t impress either. Early-finish Flo looks like she’s bossing it. The judging is much more compressed, isn’t it? A sort of highlights reel of insults so far. I agree, they do need to stop saying Froooty Cake. Gives me the heeebie jeebies. Why is the chicken so confident? Does he know what’s in KFC? OH MAN. This chicken advert is BANANAS Wow look at that Stork with butter cake! Do go away. Why are they all clapping each other? It’s not touchdown on a budget airline. James has lost his bottom but Stacey’s bundt looks mint. “Dripping all over the place,” she notes. Oh, Bake Off, it’s good to have you back. “Who doesn’t want a fruity conclusion?” Sandi is game. We like. Do we? What do we think of Noel? But how will we tell the Scousers apart? Can I say that? delete DELETE Another scouser! What is happening. What do you think of your new job? Flo asks Noel. “I don’t think I’m gonna be alright.” Oh Noel! First day nerves. He does seem a little buttoned up. I just want him to put his face in a sponge and impersonate the moon. Yes davidargile. Chris DOES look like Graham Norton. This is now a supergroup Architect Tom is putting a gilded pear on a cardamom cake. I hope to God he presents it while playing a white piano that rises out of the floor. She’s made “a puddle of fat” and has to start again. Meanwhile Paul is mocking Flo’s accent. “Is that a lemon cheuuurd? I’ll translate.” Wonderful scouse on scouse ribbing. Yan is a wildcard, on this evidence. A biomedical scientist and footballer who had to write “Turn the oven on” on her hand as a reminder. AND THEN DIDN’T DO IT ANYWAY. Which, er … area of bio-medicine do you work in just curious? Fruity cakes are fraught with peril. How long will the wetter batter take to bake? It’s turning a bit Dr Seuss. Look at the command with which Peter cracked that coconut on the counter. Like Sean Connery. A cross between Connery and a Creature Comforts character, anyway. Does a loaf imply bread, or merely bread shape? Paul and Liam getting into deep philosophical water. See also: are Jaffa Cakes cakes? I remember when boxes for Happy Meals and the like would carry the exploits of cartoon kid’s gangs, and there’d always be a disabled character who was called “Wheels” and a geeky one with glasses called “Prof”. Bad times. Stacey sounds like good value. “I call my grandmother Buzz because her hearing aid always buzzes.” One to watch. “It does get a little juicy.” Mel would have jumped all over that. Everyone’s on first day of school best behaviour so far. James digging a suspicious plot of turned earth with his father. “Put your back into it,” he threatens. Chilling. (No, he seems very nice.) “That looks like proper rhubarb out of a garden,” says Prue to James. What else would it be and where from? Flamingo legs from Rhodesia? Strawberry laces from the land of giants? They have to bake with fresh fruit, not dried. It’s a no sultana-party, as Noel says. It’s Cake Week! They’re going to be making … cakes. Different types of cakes. (I’m feeling a bit rusty too. Give me a minute.) Noel calls Paul Ol’ Blue Eyes (despite the fact he himself has very blue eyes). We are going to be requiring some meaner nicknames, Noel. Sue prodding at Paul like a bear in a tutu was one of the best things about the show. “She’s got 50 years experience.” Backhand to Mr Hollywood Paul making the very good point that no one knows what Prue likes in a bake. “It has to be worth the calories,” Prue answers immediately. Now THERE is a motto for life if ever I heard one. *tucks into back pocket* Relatively low-key intro, although they are in a hot air balloon so not that low key. Nice nod to Sue from Sandi, an elegant little baton pass. Ooh, I like the look of this new batch of bakers. They look up for it. Interpret “up for it” however you like. Buy Dr Oetker! And drink syrup! Are we all clear? Temperatures cooling, more showers coming, according to the weather report. Just say it, Ch4. WINTER IS COMING New lineup, new danger. How to make a bingo card with so many unknown elements in the mix? Watching the new show establish its own conventions, calibrate the chemistry and try new things will be fascinating. But let’s start with: Anyone addressing the channel-switch controversy, however indirectly Noel channeling a Victorian crow Paul fingering his goatee while smirking, possibly thinking about money Sandi plugging women’s equality AND QUITE RIGHT TOO Prue reinventing herself the way you do when you start at a new college RustyschwinnToo, you don’t know who Noel Fielding is? Excellent! You can be our litmus. Please update us by the end on who you think Noel Fielding is, on the strength of tonight’s showing. This is Real Science Exclusively North Korea chat in the ad breaks, Tallulah! Liveblog comments now possess more gravitas than our actual political discourse anyway sadface Well, well, well. Look who’s come crawling back. (It’s me. And by implication, you too.) Like all stout-hearted citizens, I was outraged by the Great British Bake Off’s move from the BBC when it was announced last year. You can’t cuckold Auntie! Then Channel 4 announced the new presenters would be Noel Fielding and Sandi Toksvig, a decision so bat-guano crazy I thought: they might just have saved the nation’s best-loved show. Or it’ll be the most fascinating misfire in the history of television. Either way, high stakes and worth a watch. And do you know what? The world is in a moral bog right now, and the yeasty bosom of Bake Off seems pretty damn appealing. So, I’ll be live blogging the new series every Tuesday (obviously) and I’d love for you to pitch in with scurrilous gossip, baking puns and misplaced outrage. Kickoff is 8pm tonight, so I’ll see you here then!"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"uk-news/2017/aug/30/game-of-thrones-location-dark-hedges-tourism-northern-ireland-tv","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-30T05:07:31Z","webTitle":"Hedge funds: Game of Thrones location spurs rise of business empire","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/aug/30/game-of-thrones-location-dark-hedges-tourism-northern-ireland-tv","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2017/aug/30/game-of-thrones-location-dark-hedges-tourism-northern-ireland-tv","fields":{"headline":"Hedge funds: Game of Thrones location spurs rise of business empire","bodyText":"When Stephen Gray noticed a dozen Game of Thrones fans, wearing helmets with torches, making their way in the darkness of a winter’s night along the road known as the Dark Hedges, the Northern Irish entrepreneur knew he had to buy the hotel and golf resort at its end. Gray was driving along the Dark Hedges, so-called because of the tangle of branches formed by the avenue of beech trees near Ballymoney, County Antrim, in late 2014 when he had the lightbulb moment. After standing in for the Kingsroad on the hit HBO show the public road, originally planted with 150 beech trees as the entrance to the Gracehill House country estate in the 18th century, has become a global tourist magnet. “That was the moment when I knew this hotel and the ground around had the potential to be part of this globalised product,” Gray said. “If people were prepared to come on to this road at 11.30pm on a cold, dark winter night just to say they were on the Kingsroad, then they would come any time, throughout the year, any season. It was a no-brainer.” Gray and his Belfast-based business partner Jonathan Gwynn bought the Gracehill House estate in early 2015 and have invested £5m revamping the house itself, the nearby hotel – named The Hedges – and golf course and surrounding grounds, set in 270 acres of Ulster countryside. He has also bought the Dark Hedges trademark to cash in on Game of Thrones tourism. It is stamped on everything in the Gracehill House complex from Dark Hedges coffee to cider, vodka and gin. The investment has increased the workforce, from 15 when Gray bought the hotel to 46 today. He is one of a number of Northern Ireland investors and business people hoping to exploit some of the most famous sites where Game of Thrones has been shot since its production located in the region seven years ago. As Game of Thrones tourists from Spain, the US, France and the Irish Republic grouped around the beech trees for photographs on a rainswept summer morning, Gray said he had further plans to exploit the popularity of the show. “We are in negotiations with a local helicopter firm to build a helipad out the back in order to fly ... tourists anywhere in Northern Ireland where the series was filmed,” he said. However, as Gray dodged the lines of cars, coaches and minibuses barrelling down the Dark Hedges, he admitted the tourism rush has brought new headaches. “As you can see the traffic is a problem and we need to make the Dark Hedges a vehicle-free route in order to preserve it for the future,” he said. “That means creating a new road [see footnote] that will divert vehicles away to our car park where we will have plenty of room. It’s absolutely vital we get that new road and take the traffic away from the Dark Hedges.” Northern Ireland Screen, which helps fund the filming of Game of Thrones at Titanic Studios in Belfast’s docklands and at various locations around the region, has estimated that the fantasy drama pumped £150m into the local economy up to 2016. But a Northern Ireland economist who has studied the economic impact of Game of Thrones on Northern Ireland and various cultural projects across the world has warned that the series’ legacy “has to be managed properly” to maintain the benefits for the local economy. Dr Graham Brownlow, an economics lecturer at Queen’s University Belfast, said Northern Ireland should look to Merseyside and the Beatles as a model for continuing to exploit Game of Thrones. He said: “The series’ legacy here has to be managed to be continually milked. The model for us has to be Liverpool. I have seen studies which suggest that the Beatles attractions on Merseyside bring in at least about £39m to the city every year. And this is about a band that broke up in 1970. “The key thing is to make sure attractions connected to Game of Thrones in Northern Ireland don’t take tourists away from other places here; to ensure that there is no ‘transfer’ of tourist dollars from other locations.” Brownlow added that the production expertise developed by those working on Game of Thrones since 2010 will act as a “magnet for other big TV and film series” seeking to locate in Northern Ireland. There are already encouraging signs. The final series of Game of Thrones goes into production at Titanic Studios later this year, and nearby the new £20m Belfast Harbour Studios is preparing for its first production, the Syfy channel’s Superman prequel Krypton.• This footnote was added on 1 September 2017. Stephen Gray has since clarified that the reference to a “new road” was made in relation to a creating a crossing from the car parks at the Dark Hedges Estate to the other side of the road and along the Dark Hedges, which would become a pedestrianised roadway."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"crosswords/crossword-blog/2017/sep/04/crossword-blog-anagrams-of-proper-nouns","type":"article","sectionId":"crosswords","sectionName":"Crosswords","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-04T10:40:24Z","webTitle":"Crossword blog: anagrams of proper nouns","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/crossword-blog/2017/sep/04/crossword-blog-anagrams-of-proper-nouns","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/crosswords/crossword-blog/2017/sep/04/crossword-blog-anagrams-of-proper-nouns","fields":{"headline":"Crossword blog: anagrams of proper nouns","bodyText":"Chris, is it fair to say that you take a more-than-average interest in anagrams? More than healthy, I’d say. I put it down to left-handedness. My natural inclination in spite of 40 years of practice, when glancing at some bit of text, is to scan right-to-left. It seems more intuitive, but unless there’s a palindrome, it reveals some arrangement of letters I won’t immediately recognise and my instinct is to try to make sense of it, even after reading the Right Way. I assume I’d have an easier time reading the Torah than, say, Sima Nitram. What’s the appeal of finding anagrams of words and phrases that don’t exist in dictionaries? I guess it’s the lure of uncharted territory. A few years ago on Twitter I learned that songwriter Kate Robbins’ name is an anagram of Bronski Beat. Whoever discovered that must have felt like an alchemist: that’s some niche digging – and it led to my becoming an app developer. Wanting to find company for Kate in the Celebrity Anagrams of Bands camp, I hunted for an app to let you generate letters like Scrabble tiles and slide them around the screen. I couldn’t find one, so an IT consultant friend said: make one. Eventually, with help, I did via the deceptively accessible and greenhorn-friendly Droidscript platform. Even so, I’ve only ever found one other candidate, and not one complicated enough to have needed an app. Figuring there must be a Seth whose surname lends itself to “The _____s” (Seth Smith, where are you?), I found US talk show host Seth Meyers, who offers up The Merseys. Now, once he or she leaves the safety of the dictionary, how do you think a setter should decide whether a proper noun is likely to be familiar to solvers? Context is obviously key: the setter has to know her demographic but online availability of many nations’ best-loved newspaper crosswords these days has to make a difference. Someone in the US or UK might reasonably be expected to know their cross-dressing prohibitionist from their vacuum cleaner; a Cheesehead or a Tractor Boy on the other hand wouldn’t be as obvious overseas. Now the world daily descends on Facebook and Twitter into a world of Obamacare and Brexit, Higgs Bosons and Corbynites, it must be getting harder to gauge these distinctions. Perhaps soon it won’t matter: if you want a vision of the End Times, consult the progress of Oxford Dictionaries’ Word Of The Year. American crosswords, with more crossing of letters, rely much more on proper nouns. I’ll return to that topic in another post; for now, let’s go back half a century. In 1961, Punch said that a young man may be said to have arrived when his name is ‘used as a pun in a quality Sunday paper’s erudite crossword puzzle’. Does the same hold true now? More than likely now it’s when his name is called to testify in a quality Sunday paper’s litigation – but that depends on your notion of quality, I guess. Incidentally, the young man in question was Adam Faith. Any anagrams there? Not a lot to work with … “had a fit, ma”? Finally, while you’re here: do you think everyone noticed what was going on in last week’s Clue of the Fortnight section, but was too cool to mention it? I imagine everyone did, but was too occupied by the fresh opportunity to show how clever they were to publicly acknowledge how clever someone else was. It would be nice if that were true. Thank you to Chris Miller, whose LetterSlate app can be found on the Google Play Store. He has some forthcoming cryptic crosswords as Metatron, and, like me, he is an alumnus of Only Connect."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"us-news/2017/aug/29/houston-dam-hurricane-harvey-overspill-floods","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-29T15:25:20Z","webTitle":"Houston dam begins to overspill as Harvey triggers unprecedented impact","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/aug/29/houston-dam-hurricane-harvey-overspill-floods","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/aug/29/houston-dam-hurricane-harvey-overspill-floods","fields":{"headline":"Houston dam begins to overspill as Harvey triggers unprecedented impact","bodyText":"A vital dam in suburban Houston that protects the central city began overspilling on Tuesday, and officials said the rainfall from Harvey is so unprecedented they do not know what the impact on surrounding communities will be. Water levels in the Addicks reservoir have reached 108ft, said Jeff Lindner, a Harris County flood control district meteorologist. He warned that neighbourhoods in the spillway zone would begin to see street and possibly structural flooding. “We have never faced this before. We have uncertainty in how the water is going to react as it moves out of the spillway and into the surrounding area,” Lindner told a news conference on Tuesday. “We are trying to wrap our heads around what this water will do.” Linder named six subdivisions that appear most at imminent risk and told residents: “If you want to leave, now is the time to leave. The reason being, once the water comes into the street you’re not going to be able to leave.” Another major dam and reservoir nearby, Barker, is also enduring exceptionally high water levels, and some residents in streets to the west of it are under voluntary evacuation orders. They also face the possibility that their roads could be rendered impassable just as the storm’s precipitation appears to be decreasing in intensity. “New streets will continue to flood, new homes will continue to flood … the amount of water that goes over the spillway will be increasing,” Lindner said. He added that it is unlikely to happen quickly but could leave some homes inundated for a month. “I completely understand the uncertainty that people are dealing with. This is a complex situation,” he added. “My own house is in the spillway region of [Addicks] reservoir so I completely understand what you’re going through.” Addicks and Barker were constructed in the 1940s by the US army corps of engineers, which maintains them. The dams are designed to control the flow of water into the Buffalo bayou, a river that stretches for dozens of miles and goes through the heart of the city, depositing water in the ship channel to the east. As Harvey battered the region over the weekend, the corps began “controlled releases” of water into the bayou and warned that surrounding areas were at increased risk of flooding as a result. The corps is performing a balancing act with water levels that sees some nearby places flood, or existing floods worsen, while protecting a much larger area from potentially catastrophic effects. The dams have been undergoing extensive repairs because several years ago the corps deemed them at “extremely high risk” of failing. The federal agency has repeatedly denied this means there is a serious chance of a disastrous breach. Many parts to the east of the dams were already flooded by the bayou even before the corps started the controlled releases. The bayou is so high that it has submerged outlets designed to feed it to relieve the reservoir levels. The Houston region’s dramatic population growth – about a million new residents in the past decade – has seen extensive construction of new houses, offices and apartment complexes built around the dams in what once was empty grassland. The area is now dubbed the Energy Corridor because it is popular with oil industry workers. A number of companies are headquartered there. “If you’re building in areas that are considered storage for the reservoir, that is an issue,” a corps spokesman said. To add to the problems, Lindner said that a reservoir monitoring gauge in the Barker reservoir was flooded on Monday evening and no longer works, and because so many streets and highways are unusable, United States Geological Survey officials are unable to reach the site and repair it. “We have law enforcement personnel going to pick them up in a high-water vehicle to take them to Barker and establish a temporary measuring gauge. Based on the elevation of Addicks we are concerned we may lose the Addicks gauge,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"fashion/2017/sep/03/changing-faces-women-making-their-mark-in-the-beauty-market","type":"article","sectionId":"fashion","sectionName":"Fashion","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-03T08:30:01Z","webTitle":"Changing faces: three women making their mark on the beauty market","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2017/sep/03/changing-faces-women-making-their-mark-in-the-beauty-market","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/fashion/2017/sep/03/changing-faces-women-making-their-mark-in-the-beauty-market","fields":{"headline":"Changing faces: three women making their mark on the beauty market","bodyText":"Marcia Kilgore: ‘Instead of luxury labels, what people want to portray is their own brand’ Marcia Kilgore was watching telly when she had the idea. “I thought, what about Netflix but for beauty – so everyone could get a bigger piece of the beauty pie?” The woman behind Bliss Spas, FitFlops and Soap &amp; Glory, Kilgore has long been renowned for “disrupting” the industry, but this project threatened to go even further, toppling it on its side, skidding into a hedge. I’d heard a rumour that Kilgore’s new venture was such a threat to established beauty brands that she’d received death threats. She chuckles. “There’s room for us and for them. After all, Netflix exists, but people still go to the cinema, right?” This is how Beauty Pie works: you pay £10 a month for membership, and then you can purchase its carefully curated collection of make-up and skincare at factory prices. So, that’s £20 lipsticks for £2.24, excellent foundation (in Armani-esque bottles) for £4.75, and the new “Super-Eye Energy Peptide Infusion Cream” for £5.65. The pricing is totally transparent, and the products are comparable to those in the fanciest beauty halls. As Beauty Pie nears its first anniversary, now with tens of thousands of members, Kilgore says the key to its success lies in the “personal brand”. Rather than define themselves through designer labels, she says: “What people really want to portray is their own brand.” Only a fraction of the cost of a luxury product is the product itself. The rest is what Kilgore calls LMAO, or “Landfill Marketing and Overheads.” Kilgore spends days at cosmetics factories: one will produce a perfect lipstick, at another she knows a product mixer who specialises in foundation. “You become quite elitist in terms of the quality. If something doesn’t have good colour payoff or the pencil is a bit too dry, I reject them.” Of the luxury brands, she says, her voice dropping a little, 95% buy the same products she does, tweaking the colours slightly, whacking it in their own packaging and adding a few zeroes to the price – often 30 times the price it costs to make. “We had this skin brush from Korea, a rechargeable one in soft-touch rubber, for £18,” Kilgore says. “In shops it would be more than £80. I’ve seen things like it in the airport for £300.” Is there a company she finds particularly disingenuous? She puts her hand over the tape recorder and mouths the name of a brand whose moisturisers sell for £200, and whose formulations can be found for a 10th of that through Beauty Pie. “This is luxury, but for everybody,” says Kilgore. She raises her chin, proud. “We call it ‘massperational’.” Ozohu Adoh: ‘The luxury market was not meeting the needs of women of colour’ This year Ozohu Adoh, a Nigerian-born ex-accountant, launched Epara, the first luxury beauty brand specifically targeting women of colour. The line has already been bought by Harrods, which knows its audience: in 2015, says Adoh, every £1 in £3 spent in the store was by a Nigerian. It began by accident. “I had excessive dry skin on my face. I tried all the luxury skincare brands and they just didn’t work.” She researched ingredients, making her own concoctions using mainly oils. “It took several iterations before I got something that worked,” says Adoh. When her skin cleared up “friends started to ask me for this thing in a nondescript jar.” That was three years ago. She has since developed a line including cleansers, a mask, serums and eye cream. Many of her ingredients, such as marula and moringa oils, and mango butter, are found on African soil. “I want to take them mainstream,” she says. Some have asked why women of colour need their own skincare line. “The market was not addressing our needs,” says Adoh. “Due to higher levels of melanin, typical problems present differently in darker skin tones. Uneven skin tone caused by hormonal issues or acne scarring can take much longer to heal.” The controversy of toxic ingredients in beauty products aimed at non-Caucasian women has been topical of late. Many beauty care products targeting this demographic, particularly those products that perpetuate the western ideal of beauty (skin lightening, hair relaxers or straighteners, etc), often include harmful ingredients, such as steroids and oestrogen, which go on to cause reproductive harm. Creating efficacious and “clean” products for women of colour is an ethos Adoh hopes others will adopt. It will, she says, help change the beauty landscape. Tricia Cusden: ‘Society hasn’t yet come to terms with the fact that we’re living longer’ “The beauty industry assumes we are all engaged in an anti-ageing battle,” says an emphatic Tricia Cusden, the 70-year-old founder of mature make-up brand Look Fabulous Forever. “I am determined to change this.” Cusden, a former management consultant from south London, has a “pro-ageing” attitude to beauty. She launched Look Fabulous Forever in 2013, “after wasting £50 on products meant for skin a lot younger than mine” and becoming “increasingly exercised” by the “insulting” rhetoric around older women and their beauty routine. Cusden’s mission was two-fold: create products and imagery that were “honest, featuring women over the age of 55”; and to use “positive language, to represent ageing as something to embrace, not to fight against”. Look Fabulous Forever was developed with a cosmetics manufacturer based in Suffolk, to specifically flatter mature skin, which has less collagen and is therefore more porous. The top three sellers are all primers. “Older skin is bumpy, meaning that make-up gets sucked into the skin faster.” A lip primer “seals the edges of the lips so that the lipstick doesn’t feather and bleed” while matte eye shadow, Cusden notes, “is much more flattering on older women”. These tips are delivered via her “how to” videos, which have had more than 4.2m views. Cusden wants to create a platform where she can “talk about confidence and risk taking”. Her forthcoming book, Living the Life More Fabulous: Beauty, Style and Empowerment for Older Women, will be out in February. Cusden describes it as a “handbook for empowerment”. “Society has not yet come to terms with the fact that everyone is leading much longer lives. Ageing is still associated with catastrophe. We need to re-frame longevity,” she says. Cusden admits that her mission may sound “incredibly grandiose – I am one woman, in her 70th year” but it’s an essential one. “Ageism has appalling consequences. It feeds into all sorts of issues, like older women not being able to get jobs.” The success of the brand has been “staggering” says Cusden, who put £40,000 into the business when she launched it. Less than four years later Look Fabulous Forever turns over £2m. She puts its success down to one thing: “no trickery”. And she’s only just got going. “If I’m going to live until I’m 90, I have another 20 years ahead of me. And I intend to make them really productive.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/aug/30/drones-britain-colluding-us-terror-trump-theresa-may-pakistan","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-30T13:39:25Z","webTitle":"This time Britain must resist colluding in US drone terror | Clive Lewis","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/aug/30/drones-britain-colluding-us-terror-trump-theresa-may-pakistan","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/aug/30/drones-britain-colluding-us-terror-trump-theresa-may-pakistan","fields":{"headline":"This time Britain must resist colluding in US drone terror","bodyText":"I know what it’s like to feel the fear of battle. To be constantly looking over my shoulder and thinking every sound might be a bomb or a bullet. When I served in Afghanistan in 2009 I felt that fear, but I made a choice to serve in the army and I knew I could come home to safety at the end of my tour. For people living in the border regions of Pakistan their homes may not be a place of safety for much longer. A familiar fear could be about to return to the skies overhead. Donald Trump is threatening to bring back the drone strikes that brought terror to the country for more than a decade. In doing this he is gambling with the lives of innocent people as diplomatic bargaining chips to punish the Pakistan government. Our prime minister should refuse to play any part. I am deeply concerned by our country’s tangled, and largely secret, involvement in the US drone programme. As an MP, it is my job to hold the government to account. Yet parliament has been given no role in scrutinising the UK’s role, and to date the government has refused to disclose the drone guidance that contains the UK’s policy. This must change. The use of lethal force is the most powerful action a state can take against a person. In a democracy, such policies must be published. How else can we can we know if they are lawful or justified? How else can we know what is being done in our name? Publication of this guidance is more urgent than ever because mounting evidence suggests the UK works hand-in-glove with the expanding US drone programme. It has been reported that British bases provide crucial intelligence and operational support in target location; and British intelligence personnel on the ground in countries all around the world provide vital human intelligence helping the US identify targets for deadly drone strikes. British pilots also fly US drones from the same seats as their American counterparts who pull the trigger on strikes in Afghanistan and Pakistan. It will take strength to untangle our involvement in America’s unlawful drone programme. But untangle ourselves we must. Far from being an effective tool in the “war on terror”, the use of drones outside areas of armed conflict devastates communities and fuels recruitment of the very terrorists the drones are meant to target. Terrorist organisations capitalise on the fear of drones and the resentment caused by the countless civilians killed by this “precise” technology. We are told by our governments on both sides of the Atlantic that the bombs are “targeted” only at terrorists. But all the evidence tells us that this is not true. I have spoken before about how close I once came to making the terrible mistake of shooting a civilian in Afghanistan. I know how difficult it is to make these calls from a few hundred metres; it is almost impossible from a few thousand feet. Analysis by the human rights charity Reprieve and its partner organisation, Foundation for Fundamental Rights, in Pakistan, found that on average it takes the US three attempts to kill an intended target; and in at least two-thirds of strikes, the missiles hit the wrong place and kill the wrong people. Drones may be precise, but it appears that they are precisely killing innocent people. Many civilians have lost their lives in the attempts by the US to assassinate terrorists: for example, in attempts to eliminate the current head of al-Qaida, 76 children and 29 adults have been killed; in attempts to take out four men in Pakistan, 221 people, including 103 children, have been killed – three of those targets are still alive, and the fourth died of hepatitis. Trump’s ramping up of rhetoric against Pakistan should concern us all. But it should worry Theresa May in Downing Street more than most. The dangers of drones returning to Pakistan are obvious not only to the innocent civilians who will once again live under constant terror, but also for our reputation as a country that proudly protects high standards in the field of battle. Our leaders should not allow themselves to be drawn into the diplomatic game Trump is playing with people’s lives. • Clive Lewis is the Labour MP for Norwich South"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"uk-news/2017/aug/29/gangs-stealing-powerful-farm-machinery-cash-machine-thefts","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-29T14:41:50Z","webTitle":"Gangs stealing powerful farm machinery to use in cash machine thefts","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/aug/29/gangs-stealing-powerful-farm-machinery-cash-machine-thefts","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2017/aug/29/gangs-stealing-powerful-farm-machinery-cash-machine-thefts","fields":{"headline":"Gangs stealing powerful farm machinery to use in cash machine thefts","bodyText":"Criminal gangs are stealing powerful farm vehicles and using them to rip cash machines out of walls. Rural forces across the country are reporting that machines such as telescopic handlers – which typically have a fork-lift attachment on the end of an extendable boom – are being taken from farmyards by thieves targeting ATMs. Officers in Devon have warned farmers to review security arrangements after thieves took a Merlo telehandler from a farm in South Hams to steal a cash machine from a filling station in Totnes. They managed to get away with the machine and partly demolished the petrol station in the process, causing thousands of pounds of damage. A few days later thieves attempted to steal a second Merlo from a farm near Kingsbridge. The three men involved were disturbed and fled empty-handed. “Police across the South Hams wish to raise awareness regarding the possible theft and subsequent use of farming agricultural vehicles in the targeting of cash machines, particularly at petrol stations during the night,” police said. “Last week, we saw a Merlo used to steal a cash machine from a petrol station at Totnes Cross. This Merlo was stolen from a nearby farm. On 25 August three male offenders attempted to steal a Merlo from a farm close to Kingsbridge, no doubt to be used to commit similar crime. They were unsuccessful as were disturbed by residents. “Please help spread the word and make sure efforts are made to better secure farming/building site machinery in order that these vehicles aren’t used to commit further crime.” Thieves have also used machinery such as excavators stolen from building sites to carry out smash-and-grab raids on cash machines. However, the introduction of immobilisers and chips that makes it easier to track such vehicles has prompted gangs to look elsewhere. There has also been a spate of incidents in Lincolnshire and Leicestershire. More generally, farmers have been hit by something of a crimewave this year, according to the insurer NFU Mutual. Emerging trends it spotted included thieves cloning the identities of large, expensive tractors to make them easier to sell and harder to detect; smaller and older tractors being stolen by organised gangs for export to developing countries; and of Land Rover Defenders being taken since production of the vehicles ended."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2017/aug/29/joiner-shane-ridge-born-and-raised-in-britain-told-to-leave-home-office","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-29T15:27:08Z","webTitle":"Man born and raised in UK told he is not a British citizen","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/aug/29/joiner-shane-ridge-born-and-raised-in-britain-told-to-leave-home-office","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2017/aug/29/joiner-shane-ridge-born-and-raised-in-britain-told-to-leave-home-office","fields":{"headline":"Man born and raised in UK told he is not a British citizen","bodyText":"A 21-year-old man who was born and raised in Britain has been told to leave the UK by the Home Office because he is not a British citizen. Shane Ridge, a joiner from Colne in Lancashire who describes himself as “as British as they come”, received a letter from the Home Office last week informing him that his driving licence would be revoked as he had “no lawful basis to be in the UK”. It came as a surprise because all of Ridge’s relatives are British citizens. His mother was born in Australia during a family holiday, but has lived in Britain since then and has dual citizenship. Under UK law, if a child was born before July 2006, the father’s British nationality will usually only automatically pass to the child if he was married to the mother at the time of birth. Because Ridge’s parents never married, he does not have an automatic right to citizenship and is required to apply for “right of abode”. Ridge said he did not know that his right to citizenship was not automatic, and is confused after being told he would have to leave his family behind or risk jail or a £5,000 fine for living illegally in the UK. The letter said the Home Office was working with the DVLA, NHS and banks to “stop access to benefits and services for those with no lawful basis to be in the UK”. It added: “This includes you.” Ridge was also told he must stop driving immediately. “It’s surreal,” he said. “This is the only letter I have ever received in relation to me having to leave the country. It just came through my letterbox out of the blue. “The last bit scared me the most – ‘leave the UK voluntarily’. I’m speechless – I don’t know what I can say. I received the letter from Immigration Enforcement saying they were going to revoke my driving licence and I should leave the UK voluntarily or face a £5,000 fine. “I’m confused and worried that I’ll have to leave my entire family behind and move to a country that I don’t know. I don’t understand it because I was born in the UK. I did my GCSEs here, I’ve worked for six years, I pay tax and national insurance. Me and my girlfriend rented a house, I vote, I use the NHS and opened a bank account without any problems, ever.” Ridge said he did not know he was not a British citizen until he received the letter. He said he applied for a passport last year to go on holiday and his application was declined, but he then successfully applied for and holds an Australian passport. The Passport Office advised him that he would be able to travel and safely return to the UK after his holiday and since then, he said, he had had no indication of any problems. “I applied for an Australian passport and was accepted because my mum was born there, despite both her parents being British, and therefore she has dual citizenship,” he said. “I went to apply for right of abode myself after receiving this letter and was told by the Home Office that I need to apply for British citizenship first before I can do that. “The laws on this have apparently changed in 2006 and they have changed backwards and forwards throughout the years. I just don’t understand how they’ve just got through to me now. I even have a birth certificate with my dad’s signature on it – he’s British. “If I cannot get dual citizenship or right of abode, or if this isn’t a mistake, I don’t know what I’ll do.” Ridge said he was particularly angry that his life as a law-abiding citizen in the country in which he was born had been thrown into doubt. “It’s terrifying. My parents keep telling me everything will be fine but I’m really scared. “My girlfriend, Jodie, isn’t happy. Everyone is in shock and wondering how this can possibly happen. I’ve lived by the book – never had a criminal record. “I have brothers and sisters. They have dual citizenship because my mum married their dad but my youngest sister, who is five, is also technically in the same position as me as my mum didn’t marry her dad. “The letter even says they will stop me accessing the NHS or banks. I’ve always been to the doctors with no problems and me and my girlfriend have a joint bank account.” The Home Office has not yet responded to a request for comment."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"housing-network/2017/aug/31/tiny-starter-homes-pocket-living-housing-crisis-sadiq-khan-deregulation","type":"article","sectionId":"housing-network","sectionName":"Housing Network","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-31T06:13:23Z","webTitle":"Dear Sadiq: pocket-sized homes are the last thing London needs | Lisa Mckenzie","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/housing-network/2017/aug/31/tiny-starter-homes-pocket-living-housing-crisis-sadiq-khan-deregulation","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/housing-network/2017/aug/31/tiny-starter-homes-pocket-living-housing-crisis-sadiq-khan-deregulation","fields":{"headline":"Dear Sadiq: pocket-sized homes are the last thing London needs","bodyText":"London mayor Sadiq Khan has announced a partnership between the mayor’s office and Pocket Living, a private housing developer. Pocket Living has been offered £25m funding in the form of a loan from the mayor, for the affordable housing within their development of tiny apartments. While existing council housing stock in London boroughs has been starved of money for much needed repairs, estates face demolition, and homelessness rises amid huge spending cuts, this doesn’t feel like the best use of public money. Although the loan is set to be paid back in full by 2030, a huge question hangs over whether these apartments will provide value for money. In regards to price per square foot, they will be some of the most expensive properties in the UK. The mayor’s loan will fund the “affordable” one- and two-bedroom apartments for first-time buyers at 80% of market rate. With the average home in London priced at over £450,000, that could mean prices of £350,00 to £400,000. But the average salary in London is £34,995, undoubtedly pushed up by the scores of people earning in excess of £100,000 in the capital. To afford these homes, on top of the 5% upfront deposit, a person would need an income of around £90,000 to secure a mortgage. Ultimately, it means this housing is only for a select few. Meanwhile, Architects for Social Housing has created a map of London’s proposed council estate demolition plans and there are more than 180 estates on that list. On these estates are families who have lived, worked and loved in London – making friendships, families and communities. They are low-paid workers, single mothers, pensioners, women and children escaping domestic violence, disabled people, migrant families building new lives. They will not be able to afford the “affordable” price tag for the micro homes, and it feels fair to ask whether such pocket places will be accessible for disabled people, children, and the elderly, too. The sad thing is that this money could be well spent on measures that would help all Londoners. The city has seen rents rise by 45% in the past decade – and desperately needs rent caps to ensure that everyone, including bus drivers, single mothers and those who are unable to work, can continue living in the city. An expensive new housing development does nobody any favours. It is an easy investment for foreign buyers that pushes up house prices. All the while, council estates continue to be demolished while second homes remain untouched. If Khan is serious about tackling the housing crisis, these are the issues he should focus on.

In great detail and with remarkable access he covers successive trials, across different states, in which she was handed the death penalty several times over for the shooting of six men on various highways. What is striking about the first film, The Selling of a Serial Killer, is how isolated and undefended Wuornos was. With her girlfriend giving evidence against her, Wuornos’s only emotional support came from one coquettish Christian woman who had decided to adopt her during the trial. Her legal counsel was Dr Legal, a solipsistic stoner she had seen on a TV advert, who hoped to make his own fee (she had no money, of course) by selling media access. No women’s movement, no statutory support, no flicker or hint that the courts are dealing with anything but a monster. When Broomfield goes back 12 years later, to make a second film, Aileen: Life and Death of a Serial Killer, she gives him her last interview before her execution, not looking for exoneration – indeed, in this film she rescinds her first defence that the victims had been trying to rape her – but because, one strongly suspects, he is her only friend. In the first film, Broomfield found Wuornos to be very honest – a beacon of integrity in contrast to the feral media and a police force that was negotiating with Hollywood for her story before the trial had even begun. In the second documentary he found her deranged by her years on death row, and reviewers at the time thought it remarkable that three state psychiatrists assessed her before her death and found her sane. Broomfield concluded that, abandoned by her mother at six, homeless by 13, she had been on death row all her life, and that’s what he talks about now, with incredulity, “the horrific background that Aileen came from. My real shock about that film, which made it really upsetting to make, was that I naively thought the social services would have an inquiry as to how it was possible that the abuse she went through wasn’t detected, why the school didn’t act on her truancy. Maybe that would have happened here, but in America, forget it. It’s just not at all a caring place. I remember in prison, before she was executed, there was a real atmosphere of vengeance.” It would be impossible to say what the film was about – the murders themselves were the least of it. There was a feminist element, a careful description of brute injustice, where the violence she had suffered in advance of her killing spree wasn’t just ignored, but treated with distaste, as though her victimisation had made her unclean. It is an unabashed social commentary, showing the most extreme outcomes when a country fails to care for its vulnerable children. It is also a portrait of marvellous weirdness, the satellite characters exuding idiosyncrasies you can scarcely believe they would parade before a camera. And there is this poignant core, a human connection between Wuornos and Broomfield. His presentation seems deliberately self-effacing – neutral, naive, softly spoken, curious, non-judgmental. His gaze, in the round, is unsparing, but in the conversational moment, intimate: the act of listening is its own absolution, or it is the way he does it. “You’re embedding, and you’re making very intense relationships, which is kind of wonderful,” says Broomfield now. “It’s an incredible privilege and education, and it’s also very exact, the science, or whatever, of getting on with people so that they want to reveal themselves to you, so they feel they trust you.” He has never gone by the term “pioneer” or been labelled a political film-maker, even though his subjects are always deeply political. Sometimes his approach is oblique – such as the close examination of race, gender and sexuality in his most recent film, Whitney: Can I Be Me, about Whitney Houston. It’s a beautifully crafted consideration of what it means to be black, female and famous and whether it would ever have been possible for Houston to be openly gay. The macabre 2014 Tales of the Grim Sleeper, featuring unsolved murders in South Central LA is, at root, about inequality and getting to the point of poverty where you drop out of the orbit not just of social justice but all justice. Politics is met head on in Tracking Down Maggie, about Thatcher, or The Leader, His Driver and the Driver’s Wife (1991), about South African neo-Nazi Eugene Terre’Blanche. Broomfield is known for being the “guerrilla” film-maker, a “gonzo journalist”. His style is pared down, crews are tiny though budgets are not low – necessarily, as the films take a long time to make. He adheres to the documentary principles of his training at the National Film School, an anthropological rather than entertainment tradition, “long takes, no cutaways – obviously you don’t get anybody to do anything twice – that whole idea of real time”. It is a mode of film-making that tries to get to the truth of the person, and more or less lets the story take care of itself. Yet, critically, Broomfield’s presence is not only strongly felt in his films, but in those of Louis Theroux and Morgan Spurlock. They create the feeling that curiosity has no agenda – the chaos and elation of the journey provide the story. Watching Broomfield’s films you feel this magnetic tension, because a part of you really wants certainty – moral certainty, narrative certainty, a clear destination: is this film about neo-Nazis, for example, or is it about a marriage? Yet a part of you understands that only openness can draw anything real from another person. “I never saw myself as a soft-skinned humanitarian, not really,” he says, from his house in Sussex which has an indoor tree growing up through the floor of the kitchen, “because I was always busy being a rebel, causing as much trouble as possible.” His first film after leaving college, Juvenile Liaison, was withdrawn in 1976 and banned by the people who bankrolled it, the BFI. Set in Blackburn, it was made with Joan Churchill: “I always thought I was going to be the cameraman, but she was so much better at it than me. I got relegated to sound.” (This remained his signature look, carrying a boom mic). They went on to work together intermittently, collaborating on probably his most famous film, Kurt &amp; Courtney, in 1998. He talks generously about Churchill’s talent, without ever mentioning they used to be married. She’s the mother of his son, Barney, who shot Tales of the Grim Sleeper and, on the day of our interview, is painting the outside of the house. The way Broomfield can conjure up a horrible, heart-wrenching scene with the barest amount of detail, an economic, unemotional language, is as striking in conversation with him as it is in his films. Juvenile Liaison is about out-of-control kids in a depressed town, committing minor crimes – “stealing apples, or a cowboy suit” – and being dealt with heavy-handedly by the police. “In one instance, the police had this kid in a cell and were threatening to leave him there over night, with the light off. He was clearly not in a good mental state. That [film] was shown in the House of Commons, and the police just put a stop to its release. Even though we had release forms from the parents, they said it would be damaging to the kids.” It was a scandal at the time, and members of the BFI resigned over the decision, on the basis that the police were protecting themselves and not the kids. Broomfield then started to make films in the US, where there was better access to interviewees and it was easier to raise money. Yet his film‑making nearly always courted controversy, and was often met with litigation: Courtney Love launched a full-scale attack on Kurt &amp; Courtney, putting pressure on the backers – MTV withdrew – and getting it removed from the Sundance festival. “Suddenly my film wasn’t playing any more, and the only person I was talking to was my lawyer, and the reception was terrible, and I remember feeling really, really desperate. I didn’t have any money, I owed my crew a fortune; all the offers for distribution were reliant on Sundance.” His fascination with the famous seems somehow incongruous: not long after the Cobain story, he made Biggie &amp; Tupac, about the murder of rappers Tupac Shakur and Notorious BIG (Christopher Wallace) and the east and west coast rivalries that resulted in so many untimely deaths. His main memory of making the film is of “Suge Knight. Even though it was in the Polo Lounge of the Beverly Hills Hotel, I was kind of frightened, there was a menace about him. You knew he was capable of great acts of violence, and he would enjoy it, you know.” (Knight is currently in prison, awaiting trial for murder). Whitney: Can I Be Me continues this quest, to uncover universal truths in the lives of extraordinary individuals. It’s as if he sets out to track down the unlikeliest character to have a pattern of behaviour, then pans out far enough so that the patterns reveal themselves after all. If Broomfield is remarkable for the breadth of his interests, he is also nerve-rackingly single-minded and stubborn in his approach; a lack of access to interviewees only encourages him; he seems unaffected by awkward or threatening situations. He describes making the Thatcher film in thriller-worthy terms: “We started interviewing all these guys who were part of the secret services, buying arms. They were highly organised: if they thought you knew too much they would have killed you. And you didn’t have the protection of normal law. When we were in Dallas, we were aware we were being followed – we all ended up sleeping in the same room.” Traces of his younger self constantly bubble to the surface. He had “a very sheltered upbringing, very romantic, went to a Quaker boarding school in the middle of nowhere. When you leave, you think, ‘Oh my God, what is this crazy place?’ You’re on catch-up. I’m not any more, but I still never go in with a really strong idea of what I think about things. You will inevitably change that idea completely by the end of the film.” In the early noughties, he started to experiment with a different kind of film-making, what he calls “direct cinema”, also known as “enhanced reality”, where non-actors play themselves in scripted dialogue. This was his approach in Battle for Haditha (2007), about insurgents and US Marines in Iraq, and Ghosts (2006), a film for Channel 4 about the Morecambe Bay cockling tragedy. He says rather regretfully that when it comes to commissioning dramas or documentaries, the focus has shifted back to more traditional forms of storytelling. “People write scripts and pitch meetings, and talk about three-act structures. A lot of them are very contrived. I wouldn’t apply that to great films like [Ezra Edelman’s] OJ: Made in America but often you can tell by the way they are restricting the information, that they’re padding it out to the eight hours they want to make. Particularly when you keep cutting back to the same interview. Why am I now, three hours later, getting this information? Fucking around with the chronology, a lot of re-creation, it almost becomes a faux search. That’s not what I like about documentary. I like it spontaneous and rough and tumble. I see it really much more as an adventure.” Whitney: Can I Be Me is on BBC2 on 2 September at 9pm."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"books/2017/sep/02/iq-joe-ide-review-sherlock-holmes","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-02T06:29:07Z","webTitle":"IQ by Joe Ide review – Sherlock Holmes in South Central Los Angeles","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/sep/02/iq-joe-ide-review-sherlock-holmes","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2017/sep/02/iq-joe-ide-review-sherlock-holmes","fields":{"headline":"IQ by Joe Ide review – Sherlock Holmes in South Central Los Angeles","bodyText":"Sir Arthur Conan Doyle strongly believed in the possibility of spiritual survival after death. If he was right, his own ghost must be amazed and gratified by the adaptability of the Sherlock Holmes stories. With top-rating TV modernisations – the BBC’s Sherlock and CBS’s Elementary – on each side of the Atlantic, American writer Joe Ide now begins a series of novels relocating the brain of Baker Street to South Central Los Angeles. Holmes finds his latest incarnation in Isaiah Quintabe, a 26-year-old African American, whose brilliant mind justifies his initial-nickname of IQ. In Hurston, a rough area where the finest diner is the Big Meaty Burger, he sets up as a private eye, taking on “local cases where the police could not or would not get involved”. IQ has known, as his London predecessor did, the temptation of recreational drugs, and his understanding of the criminal mentality is based on experience. His involvement in crime was typically idiosyncratic, stealing items (hair extensions, luxury pet products such as “feline epilepsy strips”) with low security but high resale value. In common with all renovated Holmeses, Isaiah is notable for noticing, although, when complimented on his deductive skills, characteristically corrects the compliment, pointing out that the process he employs is, in fact, “induction”, in which a broader truth is drawn from a particular detail, rather than “deduction”, which does the opposite. Ide sensibly leaves to Benedict Cumberbatch’s TV version those signature riffs in which a stranger is immediately categorised as a bisexual zoo-keeper who plays cribbage on alternate Thursdays. IQ’s inductive leaps tend to come from a single sight, sound or smell that no one else has considered significant. He survives one violent stand-off through mental arithmetic and sharp hearing. Ide’s relationship with the original stories is loose but learned. IQ’s sidekick is Juanell Dodson who, unlike John Watson, could only claim a medical title in the way that Dr Dre does, although, like Conan Doyle’s creation, he is a war veteran; in his case, from the gang battles in LA. IQ’s brother, Marcus, seems clearly to be a version of Holmes’s sibling Mycroft, although, in a formative character point, the elder Quintabe boy is present only in the 2005-06 flashback chapters that interleave the main storyline set in 2013. The absence of Marcus is what made his brother a detective; in an electrifying scene, the 17-year-old Isaiah teaches himself to memorise every detail of each passing car, convinced that the gift of total recall will prevent him from ever forgetting Marcus. Most satisfyingly, the plot line of the first novel adapts a Conan Doyle plot – The Hound of the Baskervilles – in a recognisable but thrillingly distorted form. A superstar rapper, Calvin Wright, who records as Black the Knife, faces an attempted assassination by a 130lb pit bull, who seems to have been bred by an enemy for murderous purpose. Many people’s idea of a perfect crime novel would combine the narrative and characterisation of Conan Doyle with the phrase-making of Raymond Chandler and, while openly acknowledging the first debt, Ide also makes a quietly impressive attempt at the second. Paragraphs crackle with one-liners that capture telling details about a person – the possessions of Black the Knife include “a bundle of rolled-up antique Persian prayer rugs from his two weeks as a practising Muslim” – or a place: a finance tycoon’s mansion is so big that “you could take a piss every day for three weeks and never be in the same bathroom”. Like his protagonist, Ide is brilliant at noticing, spotting in the background of a cycle shop “a family of eyeless mannequins pedaling along in matching spandex”. The career of a struggling TV reporter is skewered by her showreel of past stories having included “a kid that carved whistles for the troops overseas. A potbellied pig that could say I love you”. But, between the jokes, there is also serious critique of an American society willing to sacrifice so many (disproportionately black) lives through its gun laws and educational policies. A small regret is that, in the first book, Isaiah does not seem to encounter anyone who might become a recurrent potential nemesis in the manner of Moriarty, but the blurb of the second IQ novel, Righteous, published in the UK next year, suggests that such a criminal mastermind will arrive in that book, which sounds like Conan Doyle’s The Sign of Four translated to Las Vegas. Nor, so far, is there any direct equivalent of the housekeeper Mrs Hudson in the ’hood. With Ide already signed to write the third and fourth books in the series, it will be fascinating to see which details from his inspiration the writer adopts. Promisingly, the first book succeeds in being both highly original and continuing the spirit of Conan Doyle. • Mark Lawson’s The Allegations is published by Picador.

At the time the most expensive natural disaster ever to hit the US, Andrew caused an estimated $15bn in insured losses in the state and changed the way insurance companies assessed their exposure to risk for weather-related events. Many of the lessons that Florida has learned since 1992 have parallels in the unfolding disaster in Texas, experts say, and what was already a trend toward factoring in environmental threats and climate change to land and property values looks certain to become the standard nationwide as Houston begins to mop up from the misery of Harvey. “The question is whether people are going to be basing their real estate decisions on climate change futures,” said Hugh Gladwin, professor of anthropology at Florida International University, who says his research suggests higher-standing areas of Miami are becoming increasingly gentrified as a result of sea level rise. “In any coastal area there’s extra value in property, [but] climate change, insofar as it increases risks for those properties from any specific set of hazards – like flooding and storm surge – will decrease value.” Miami Beach in particular has become a poster child for the effects of climate change, with some studies making grim predictions of a 5ft sea level rise by the end of the century and others suggesting that up to $23bn of existing property statewide could be underwater by 2050. To counter those effects and preserve property values, Miami Beach has embarked on an ambitious and costly defensive programme that includes raising roads and installing powerful new pumps to shift the ever more regular floodwaters. Even so, there are indications that investors are already looking to higher ground elsewhere in the city, such as the traditionally poor, black neighbourhoods of Little Haiti and Liberty City. “The older urban core was settled on the coastal ridge and anything below that was flooded. The coastal ridge we’re talking about is clearly gentrifying,” Gladwin said. Or, as the journal Scientific American put it in its own investigation in May: “Real estate investment may no longer be just about the next hot neighbourhood, it may also now be about the next dry neighbourhood.” Other analysts cite recent storms including Harvey, as well as Sandy, which wrecked areas of New Jersey and New York in 2012, as evidence. “You have folks in south Florida buying houses in North Carolina and Tennessee, because they like the scenery but also because it’s high ground. If south Florida drops off into the ocean, they’ll have a place to go,” said Andrew Frey, vice-chairman of the south-east Florida/Caribbean Urban Land Institute and a Miami real estate developer. “The more frequent these volatile superstorms become, the more people will look to build in safer places. If seas are rising three millimetres a year that’s one thing, but if we’re getting superstorms every couple of years with greater frequency and intensity, things can change a lot faster.” Such concerns have fuelled demand for data-driven analysis and climate aggregation services that offer real estate advice to clients ranging from large corporations, state and local governments to farmers and individual house buyers. One such number-crunching company, the San Francisco-based Climate Corporation, which collates and analyses National Weather Service data mostly for clients in agriculture, has previously warned that it would take only “a few climatic events in a row” for a collapse in property values “that will make the housing crisis [of 2008] look small”. Its assessment is backed by Albert Slap, president and co-founder of Coastal Risk Consulting, a Florida firm that provides flood risk analysis reports. Slap said Harvey was only the latest natural disaster to expose flaws in the national flood insurance programme allowing property owners in the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s so-called Zone X – areas at risk of a once-in-500-years flood event – not to carry coverage or fully disclose their flood risk when they sell. “With storm surge and heavy rainfall increasing and climate and sea level rise, the system is just not working,” he said. “Millions more people need flood insurance than have it and the crazy thing about Houston was only 15% of those who were flooded had flood insurance. The risk communication is not enough. “You have thousands of properties in Norfolk, Annapolis, Atlantic City, Savannah, Charleston and Miami Beach where part of the property goes underwater with seawater for days at a time. When you have fish swimming in your driveway, it’s not an amenity, like a swimming pool. It means you’re driving through saltwater to get your kids to school, get to the supermarket, whatever you’re going to do. “Will there be a massive decline in the property values of the flooded areas in Houston? Common sense would say yes. And if that’s combined with new legislation that’s going to require full disclosure, then wow.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2017/aug/29/jj-watt-fundraising-hurricane-harvey-floods-houston","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-29T15:57:08Z","webTitle":"Sports stars raise millions for Houston flood victims but Rangers under attack","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/aug/29/jj-watt-fundraising-hurricane-harvey-floods-houston","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/aug/29/jj-watt-fundraising-hurricane-harvey-floods-houston","fields":{"headline":"Sports stars raise millions for Houston flood victims but Rangers under attack","bodyText":"Houston sports figures have rallied to raise million of dollars for those affected by the flooding and destruction in the wake of tropical storm Harvey. Experts say that the city and surrounding area could take years to recover from the damage done by the storm. NFL star JJ Watt – perhaps Houston’s highest-profile athlete - started a fund to help victims of Harvey and the drive has already raised more than $3m. The Houston Texans defensive end has donated more than $100,000 of his own money and says his new goal is to get the fund to $4m. “I think that it’s been an unbelievable display of what can happen when people come together,” Watt told the Houston Chronicle. “Just to see how many people are sharing it, to see how many people are donating. Whether it’s $5, whether it’s $500, whatever it may be, to see so many people’s support, to see so many people send the message, spread the message, it’s incredible.” Houston’s NBA team, the Rockets, have also been active. The team’s owner, Leslie Alexander, has donated $4m toward a relief fund while point guard Chris Paul gave $50,000 to Watt’s fundraising scheme. Meanwhile, Rockets center Clint Capela found himself trapped in his house by the rising waters but offered to use his social media following to tweet out pleas from people in need of rescue. “I’m here in downtown,” the Swiss player told the Chronicle. “I can’t [leave] my house go help people where they are right now. I’m trapped. I saw this stuff on Twitter. I was trying to help. I saw some people couldn’t do anything from the roof of their apartment or their houses. Some people were trying to go from their houses with their kayaks. I was just trying to spread the word. Of course, I feel really bad for those people. I tried to help any way I could.” The charity has not just been restricted to Houston teams. The New England Patriots and their owner Robert Kraft pledged $1m to the Red Cross relief fund. Tennessee Titans majority owner Amy Adams Strunk, a native of Houston, donated $1m to Watt’s fund. However, one team has come under criticism. The Houston Astros wanted to swap their home series against the Texas Rangers to late September. That scenario would have seen the Astros play the Rangers in Arlington this week before playing in Houston in a month, when the waters will presumably have retreated. However, the Rangers refused and the series will now be played at Tropicana Field in St Petersburg, Florida. The Rangers’ decision prompted anger among many fans and players. The Astros pitcher Lance McCullers was particularly incensed. “Classy as always, should be absolutely ashamed,” he wrote on Twitter. “Greed never takes off days, apparently. Stay strong #Htown! We hope to be home soon.” The Rangers said they are not seeking to gain a “competitive advantage” – a swap would have seen them end the regular season with a lengthy road trip – but instead did not want to inconvenience fans who had bought tickets for the Arlington series in September. “We didn’t feel it was right to give our fans 24 hours’ notice that their tickets in late September were now good this week,” the team’s general manager, Jon Daniels, said. “We were willing to play this series anywhere the Astros and MLB wanted, including here in Arlington.” The Astros manager, AJ Hinch, said he was concerned for those affected by Harvey rather than any dispute over scheduling. “Obviously there’s a lot of emotion involved on a lot of fronts,” he told ESPN. “Obviously the baseball schedule is going to continue. We would have loved to have played in Arlington and switched series but ... we’re really going to go wherever people tell us to go. “It sounds like there was a lot of debate on what to do. The right thing to do is really focus on the people back home and start the recovery when this relentless storm finishes. Until then, the emotion is going to come out. That’s the way the world works nowadays.” The Astros have one of the best record in baseball this season and are set for a place in the playoffs. The Rangers are in a battle for a wildcard spot in the post-season."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/aug/29/met-police-spied-lied-money-victims-helen-steel","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-29T15:35:09Z","webTitle":"The Met has spied and lied – and now it wants money off its victims | Jenny Jones","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/aug/29/met-police-spied-lied-money-victims-helen-steel","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/aug/29/met-police-spied-lied-money-victims-helen-steel","fields":{"headline":"The Met has spied and lied – and now it wants money off its victims","bodyText":"Having been deceived into a long-term relationship with an undercover police officer, the environmental campaigner Helen Steel is now being threatened with enforcement action by the Metropolitan police for legal costs associated with her attempt to disclose the truth. This pursuit of costs is part of a pattern in which the police use the courts to drag their feet, intimidate campaigners and obstruct the truth. After years of investigation by journalists and campaigners, the Met police has admitted that Steel and many others were right about the undercover officers who deliberately deceived them into sexual relationships. The Met has been publicly exposed as an organisation that has torn innocent people’s privacy to shreds by systematically encouraging police officers to develop long-term sexual relationships with environmentalists and other protesters. This was not police officers “falling in love”, but deliberately gaining trust and access to campaigning groups. Recovering court costs is something victims should do, not the abusers. Undercover police have been protected by the Neither Confirm, Nor Deny (NCND) policy from the very start. This has been the cover behind which the Met used the courts to prolong the years before they issued an apology and gave some of the victims any kind of justice. These apologies are reluctant and forced, with the result that very little appears to be changing in the darker corners of New Scotland Yard. The Met continues to drag its feet at the public inquiry into undercover policing, by claiming that privacy assessments on ex-undercover officers will take years. There is also the unashamed irony of the Met using the Human Rights Act to protect the privacy of the officers who spent years trampling over the private lives of the protesters. Since I started to raise this scandal almost seven years ago, I have made the point that the Met has been wasting our money and its time in snooping on a bunch of campaigners who are not engaged in terrorism or serious crime. In an era of police cuts and overstretched detectives, the real scandal is that the police haven’t recognised the stupidity of putting their energy into pursuing the likes of Helen Steel, when there are genuine threats to life out there. As Helen herself said: “The Met has done its utmost to protect the abusers rather than protecting the public.” If she is forced to pay the Met legal costs, then it will be a minor victory for the state snoopers, and another block on the pursuit of truth. It will also reinforce the position of those within the Met who have failed to learn a key lesson from decades of distorted priorities, where they have wasted millions of taxpayer pounds snooping on peace campaigners and anti-road protests. This has clear implications for today’s policing. I wouldn’t be surprised if a new generation of undercover police are currently snooping on local anti-fracking groups in Lancashire and elsewhere. There are lots of reasons to support Helen Steel and all the others seeking justice, but one of the biggest is simply to get the police to admit their mistakes and to stop repeating them."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/aug/30/kitchen-gadgets-frywall-pan-wearing-anti-scratch-collar","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-30T11:52:27Z","webTitle":"Kitchen gadgets review: the Frywall – it looks like my pan is wearing an anti-scratch collar","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/aug/30/kitchen-gadgets-frywall-pan-wearing-anti-scratch-collar","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/aug/30/kitchen-gadgets-frywall-pan-wearing-anti-scratch-collar","fields":{"headline":"Kitchen gadgets review: the Frywall – it looks like my pan is wearing an anti-scratch collar","bodyText":"What? The Frywall ($21.95, frywall.com) is a rubber, high-sided collar that slots along the inner circumference of stovetop cookware, limiting spurts of hot oil and sauce. Why? Cheap, fire-resistant, and easier to erect than lath and plaster. Oh no, that’s drywall. Well? “Continuous protection, continuous access, easy to clean silicone.” While it sounds like a mail order item from a reassuringly specialist magazine, this gadget is far less thrilling. In fact, it is meant to protect you from sauces and cooking oils getting out of hand. I run into early problems when I realise that the 12in model I have ordered is too large for my modest 10in pan. I have to gather the excess and sort of … tuck it in. However, that’s my fault, not the makers’, and I won’t hold it against them. Like my pan, the idea isn’t hard to grasp: this ludicrous flap of rubber is meant to sit inside your saucepan, extending its sides and trapping splatters. It is cumbersome, to say the least. Once fitted, it looks like my pan is wearing the kind of vet’s bonnet you put around a dog’s head to stop it chewing out stitches. This design might be a perfect fit if you happen to live in a rescue kennel, but most of the people that do are covered in fur, and hate greens. Speaking of which, greens are the second best use I find for Frywall: tall sides mean that I can tumble a whole pack of kale into my pan, and it would be great for spinach. (The best use, however, is as a megaphone, announcing its ugliness.) As for protection against sauce flecks, I would rather live with the flecks, or use a screen guard. This thing offers sizzle without splatter, yes, but it’s also a styleless pile-up. Besides, you could just use a wok, the sides of which get hot, which is generally considered quite good for cooking. Frywall’s hideous silicone, heat-resistant to 450F/232C, cannot boast the same. A wok on the mild side, you might say. Get out! Redeeming features? Gil Scott-Heron was the voice of that You’ve Been Tangoed ad, a fact even more depressing than Frywall’s existence. Counter, drawer, back of the cupboard? Mexican border.

The concertina door swishes open to reveal an avalanche of colour. A toe-cossetting aubergine carpet clambers up the navy-walled staircase. Acid-yellow upholstery fizzles against mustard walls. Add a peppering of contemporary art and furniture and the odd midcentury find and you have a home that rekindles the iconoclastic spirt of the original without feeling retro. It was the radical architecture of the house that first appealed to fforde. Designed by Edward Schoolheifer in 1964 the three-bedroom townhouse sits on the private Manygate estate in west London, a rare example of British Modernist housing. “After living in a claustrophobic London flat for 13 years I’d drawn up a precise property checklist,” explains fforde, who combines a job in television with an interior design business. “I wanted light and space with a west-facing garden and a sense of community. This place has it all,” she continues, stepping outside to admire the terraced facade, its simple design defined by white weatherboarding with picture windows enhancing the weightless feel. A slate-lined garden, which fforde designed to “echo the linear feel of the house” leads to shady communal lawns. “I’m convinced that the shared space makes us more neighbourly. We’ll wave to each other as we walk past, but there’s also an unwritten code – when you draw your curtains it means ‘Don’t disturb!’” When the estate – now a conservation area – was first built, its breezy, avant-garde feel also appealed to actors working at nearby Shepperton film studios. Previous Manygate incumbents include Julie Christie, Rod Steiger and Marlon Brando, who rented or bought properties. Even now residents point out the house where Tom Jones lived for a spell, choosing green carpets to evoke the valleys of home and sprinkling celebrity stardust on suburbia. But Modernism is not for everyone. “Over the years people have added partition walls or shrouded the windows with net curtains for privacy. I was lucky that my house was almost untouched,” says fforde, who found the property by chance. “One night an agent’s alert just popped up on my PC.” With three bedrooms and a bathroom upstairs, the focal point of the interior is the open-plan ground floor where the kitchen is separated from the living area by a veneered half-wall, designed to house a state-of-the-art television. The original pine ceiling is intact as are the vinyl concertina doors, installed as insulation and to soundproof the hallway, where the telephone once had pride of place. The 1960s gas-fired heating system, which pumps warm air through vents, still works and is “surprisingly efficient and means you don’t need space-consuming radiators”. Time had been less kind to the decoration. “It was dirty and cluttered with cardboard-coloured carpets and Regency striped wallpaper,” says fforde. “So I corralled a few friends and we began to restore the house.” Wrenching up the carpets fforde discovered the beech staircase and Jarrah hardwood flooring. Further excavation revealed original lead-based paint hues of yellows, purples and a clutch of forest-green tiles: “I’ll confess that at first I was tempted to paint everything white, but discovering these colours made me understand the house and inspired me to think differently, although I did draw the line at the dark green.” To this spirited backdrop fforde has added possessions which date back to her art student days at Central Saint Martins. There is a photo of Mick Jagger taken by fforde’s tutor, the photographer Jill Furmanovsky. A recent addition is the striking aluminium sculpture by Jonathan Clarke, whose work can also be seen at Ely cathedral. Downstairs, the heirloom sideboard and sculptural lamp evoke her parents’ 1960s house. “My mother is extremely stylish.

His US media group 21st Century Fox said it would withdraw Fox News from Sky in the UK on Tuesday because it no longer regarded the service as commercially viable. The decision came as Karen Bradley, the culture secretary, is set to return her verdict on whether to ask the competition regulator to launch an investigation into the Murdochs’ adherence to broadcasting standards in the UK as part of an inquiry into Fox’s £11.7bn takeover bid for Sky. However, sources said the decision to stop broadcasting Fox News, which went off air at 4pm, was not connected to the takeover bid, arguing that the channel attracted only about 2,000 viewers a day in the UK. “[Fox] has decided to cease providing a feed of Fox News Channel in the UK,” a spokeswoman for the company said. “Fox News is focused on the US market and designed for a US audience and, accordingly, it averages only a few thousand viewers across the day in the UK. We have concluded that it is not in our commercial interest to continue providing Fox News in the UK.” Fox News has become increasingly troublesome for the Murdochs as they attempt to buy Sky. The channel is embroiled in a sexual harassment scandal that led to a string of high-profile figures leaving, including the chairman Roger Ailes, who has since died, and leading presenter Bill O’Reilly. It has also been accused of colluding with Donald Trump’s White House on a discredited story about a murdered Democrat activist, which critics of the Murdochs have compared to the News of the World hacking the phone of murdered schoolgirl Milly Dowler. Ofcom, the UK media regulator, has also made a number of rulings against Fox News broadcasts in the last year, adding to the total of 22 breaches by Fox of its licence and Ofcom’s codes and rules in the last decade. Of those, Fox News was responsible for seven, including four last year, one of them being a programme which featured a guest who said Birmingham was a city “where non-Muslims just simply don’t go”. Tom Watson, the deputy Labour leader and shadow culture secretary, said the disappearance of Fox News from British screens should not affect the government’s decision on whether 21st Century Fox should be allowed to buy Sky. “Fox News has breached Ofcom’s rules over and over again, so 21st Century Fox clearly thought it was easier to pull it from the UK altogether than to clean up its act,” Watson said. “But the ongoing corporate governance and sexual harassment scandal at Fox News is still deeply relevant to the question of whether 21st Century Fox should be allowed to take over Sky, whether the channel is broadcast here or not.” Fox News was taken off air between 5am and 11pm on election day to avoid any issues with Ofcom. UK fans of Fox News will not be able to turn to the internet to watch the channel as it is not streamed online. Only clips of Fox News programming are available online. Sky, which is 39% controlled by 21st Century Fox, continues to fund Sky News, which loses tens of millions of pounds a year. Ed Miliband, the former Labour leader and long-time Murdoch critic, said: “This decision shows the Murdochs panicking about their bid for Sky. It amounts to an admission that despite having broadcast here year after year, Fox News is not fit for UK broadcasting in the standards and ethics of its journalism. It’s yet more proof that the Murdochs can’t be trusted to own 100% of Sky. “Stopping broadcasting in the UK changes nothing. Fox News in the US is the Murdochs’ channel, they are responsible for its broadcasting standards and the appalling racial and sexual harassment that happened on their watch. The Murdochs can’t run from their record at Fox News.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2017/sep/07/pajtim-statovci-my-cat-yugoslavia-interview","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-07T15:25:01Z","webTitle":"Pajtim Statovci: 'I’m drawn to fiction that makes the unimaginable possible'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/sep/07/pajtim-statovci-my-cat-yugoslavia-interview","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2017/sep/07/pajtim-statovci-my-cat-yugoslavia-interview","fields":{"headline":"Pajtim Statovci: 'I’m drawn to fiction that makes the unimaginable possible'","bodyText":"Many first novels are really first published novels, reactions to the angsty roman à clefs and 700-page epics that preceded them (now mercifully forgotten in a drawer). But this was not the case for Pajtim Statovci. My Cat Yugoslavia – which has already won gushing praise from the New York Times (“a marvel, a remarkable achievement”) and New Yorker (“strange and exquisite”) – is not only the first novel he tried to write, but the first piece of fiction he ever wrote. “I was working in a grocery store while simultaneously studying comparative literature at the University of Helsinki,” he says. “One night, after a late shift, frustrated and fed up with my job, I asked myself: what am I waiting for?” Eighteen months later, at just 21 years old, he had finished the first draft of My Cat Yugoslavia. But while Statovci the author, multilingual, bookishly handsome and improbably successful for his age – he’s now 27 – may make writing look easy, it took a turbulent childhood to get him here. He was born in Kosovo in 1990, a mere year before the first of the many Yugoslav wars broke out, and had dreamed of being a writer since boyhood: “As a child, I was sensitive and fragile to the point where I actually pretended that I was in the stories I consumed, that I led the life of their protagonists because the life in fiction was so much more interesting than [the one] I was living.” Although Statovci assures me that his novel “is a work of fiction from start to finish”, he admits to including some autobiographical elements. Like one of his protagonists, Emine, he fled his home for Finland with his family. His observations on nationality, racism and migration come from his own experience, as well as the people around him. Bekim, his other protagonist, talks at length about growing up as an Albanian migrant in Finland. “One day you’ll see that if you try to become their equal, they’ll despise you more,” he recalls his father saying about Finns. My Cat Yugoslavia is made up of two stories: one is a magical realist tale that follows a young, gay man – Bekim – and his relationship with a boorishly humanoid talking cat. The other, about Emine, is a realist portrayal of an Albanian mother who flees to Finland with her family during the 1980s. Bekim is Emine’s child, though you would hardly realise it from their interactions. “Oftentimes there’s a gap between the younger … and the older generation in families that have migrated from one culture to another. And sometimes there’s no solution to be found, no dialogue, no understanding,” Statovci says. “And the gap gets only bigger and deeper, and the distance between two worlds only grows longer, never closing up.” Magical realism, Statovci says, “doesn’t care about walls, and it doesn’t have constraints, whereas the reality does. It has rules, norms and codes of conduct.” After their initial meeting in a gay club, Bekim’s cat companion is abrasive, homophobic, bigoted – but Bekim thinks the love he gets from the cat is stronger and more powerful because of the boundaries it has crossed. Through fantasy, Statovci expresses the troubled inner life of Bekim – though this isn’t to say that Emine’s sections are any less lyrical; when performing chores, she remarks that “in a clean house, there were no secrets”. But in those passages, the lyricism lies in how events are presented. In Bekim’s surreal story, what happens is just as fantastic as how it’s told. Reality and fantasy aren’t entirely separate for Statovci, either. “Many things in my childhood and in my life, such as the war in Kosovo, did not make sense to me. They just were fenced outside my understanding,” he says. “I guess this is the reason I’ve always been drawn to works of fiction that make the unimaginable possible and the unbelievable understandable.” So why a talking cat? When writing the novel, Statovci became interested in the relationship between animals and humans, particularly how the latter project their own feelings onto their beastly companions, anthropomorphising them. “Reading animals as symbols of us reduces them, [it] violates their right to represent themselves,” he says. Depending on the culture, animals can symbolise completely different things, he says: “In Finland, cats are domesticated animals, whereas in Kosovo they are seen as dirty.” In this sense, animals fall foul of the same cultural stereotyping as humans. “We live in a world pierced with animal cruelty, racism, prejudice and stereotypes. Oppression and discrimination have always been, and are to this day, very much alive in our world. Only the victims of them keep changing.” Statovci isn’t too concerned about his own national identity. “I don’t go to sleep at night thinking about my relationship to the country I was born in,” he says. “I speak Albanian as my mother tongue, but I don’t use it when I think, write or dream.” In his novel, however, Bekim’s Albanian grandfather holds precisely those concerns, worrying that “one day [Bekim] won’t be an Albanian at all but something else all together.” There is also a wonderfully plain line where the cat decides he “no longer wanted to be a cat; he wanted to be a film director”. Statovci treats species and occupation as one and the same: both are roles we must play. While second-generation migrants are often robbed of a national “home”, considered foreign in both their adopted country and their family’s homeland, Statovci considers home “a state of mind”. “When I write, that’s home to me,” he says. “That’s the great thing about fiction – its ability to resonate inside everyone.” That is what appealed to Statovci the boy. It is also what he gives back in My Cat Yugoslavia. My Cat Yugoslavia by Pajtim Statovci is published by Pushkin Press, priced £14.99. It is available from the Guardian Bookshop for £12.74, including free UK p&amp;p."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"business/2017/aug/31/raising-pulses-uks-first-commercial-crop-of-lentils-to-go-on-sale-in-autumn","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-31T07:09:58Z","webTitle":"Raising pulses: UK's first commercial crop of lentils to go on sale in autumn","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/aug/31/raising-pulses-uks-first-commercial-crop-of-lentils-to-go-on-sale-in-autumn","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2017/aug/31/raising-pulses-uks-first-commercial-crop-of-lentils-to-go-on-sale-in-autumn","fields":{"headline":"Raising pulses: UK's first commercial crop of lentils to go on sale in autumn","bodyText":"The UK’s first commercial crops of lentils, grown on farms in Hertfordshire, Hampshire, Suffolk, Sussex and Wiltshire are being harvested this week before going on sale in the autumn. Blazing the trail is Hodmedod, a Suffolk-based pioneer of British-grown pulses and grains founded five years ago, which has worked with UK farmers since 2015 on a series of trial crops leading to 24 acres of organic lentils being picked and packed this season. The company is on a mission to reintroduce British-grown beans, peas and pulses and has already won the high-profile backing of chefs and restaurateurs such as Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall, Yotem Ottolenghi, Jamie Oliver and Mark Hix. Most lentils on sale in the UK are imported from India – the primary producer – or Canada, but mass production means they tend to have a bland taste with no trace of the earthy, peppery flavour they should have. Lentils are a notoriously difficult crop and have never been grown on a large or commercial scale in the UK. Low-growing and typically yielding no more than two lentils in each short pod, they need a warm, dry autumn to ripen for harvest. Yet they are thought to have been one of the earliest cultivated ‘legumes’ in the UK, with traces found on prehistoric sites. “We’d always wanted to grow lentils but were repeatedly told it just wasn’t possible,” said Hodmedod co-founder Josiah Meldrum. “Then we met some inspiring German lentil farmers who told us to just plant them and see what happened. We did and it turns out lentils grow well here, the trick is keeping them weed-free and harvesting them – skills we’ve been learning over the last few years.” Lentils come in a variety of different colours and sizes, including red lentils and speciality varieties such as Puy lentils (grown in the Le Puy region of France). Hodmedod’s lentils are a mixture of varieties including Rosanna and Flora and the variety grown in Puy. The new lentils will be showcased in a pop-up restaurant at London’s Borough Market for the whole of September and at other UK food and drink festivals, including Abergavenny and Aldeburgh. They will also go on sale online and via independent retailers and wholefood shops."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"culture/2017/aug/29/donald-trump-daily-show-joe-arpaio-trevor-noah","type":"article","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-29T15:08:08Z","webTitle":"Trevor Noah: 'For a guy who's not racist, Trump has a lot of racist friends'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2017/aug/29/donald-trump-daily-show-joe-arpaio-trevor-noah","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/2017/aug/29/donald-trump-daily-show-joe-arpaio-trevor-noah","fields":{"headline":"Trevor Noah: 'For a guy who's not racist, Trump has a lot of racist friends'","bodyText":"Trevor Noah addressed Donald Trump’s controversial pardon of Joe Arpaio, the Arizona sheriff who once referred to his notorious Tent City prison as a concentration camp and was held in contempt of court in a case linked to racial profiling. “Let’s move on from Hurricane Harvey to the storm that is battering the entire country: Donald Trump,” Trevor Noah began during The Daily Show. “He’s been president for seven months and, like a teenage boy with a locked bedroom door, he’s been exploring his new powers. And this weekend, Trump confirmed that he could get someone off all by himself.” Noah discussed Trump’s decision to pardon Arpaio on Friday night, in a move that had been speculated on for weeks. Members of the GOP, like speaker of the house Paul Ryan and senator John McCain, spoke out against the president’s use of the pardon power. “To understand why both Democrats and many Republicans have condemned this pardon, you need to understand the man who Trump gave the pardon to,” Noah explained. “Ladies and gentleman, meet Joe Arpaio. He was elected sheriff of Maricopa County, Arizona in 1993 and quickly developed a reputation as an intense opponent of illegal immigration. Which you can kind of get. He’s in law enforcement, he’s cracking down on something illegal. It’s like how Smokey the Bear brutally mauls anyone who starts a forrest fire.” “But as much as Sheriff Arpaio presented himself as anti-illegal immigrants, it turns out he was really just anti- being a decent human being,” the host continued, summarizing the dreadful treatment of inmates at Arpaio’s prisons, particularly in Tent City, where their shoes often melted as they were made to sleep outside in triple-digit temperatures, as well as the $142m in legal fees, settlements, and compliance costs Arpaio cost taxpayers because of wrongful deaths and civil rights infractions. “Yes, the man Trump pardoned was one of the worst sheriffs in America,” Noah said. “Worse than Sheriff Clarke, worse than Sheriff Rosco P Coltrane, worse than the sheriff Bob Marley shot in his song. Think about all the other things that that money could have bought: schools or roads, or they could’ve just paid Conor McGregor and Floyd Maywetaher to punch Arpaio in the face.” Noah continued: “And here’s what may surprise you. All that shit that Arpaio did, that’s not why he needed a pardon. Those were just his extracurriculars. It turns out his full-time job is racism.” Noah then detailed Arpaio’s July conviction for contempt of court due to his violation of a federal court order to stop profiling Latinos in his district. “Now, contempt of court may not seem like a big deal,” Noah said. “But this wasn’t some night-in-jail offense. This was a federal court ruling that Sheriff Arpaio was routinely violating Americans’ constitutional rights and ordered him to stop immediately.” “And here’s why Trump’s pardon is an even bigger deal than merely condoning Arpaio’s illegal actions. Remember how the three branches of government are supposed to be equal? Well, convicting someone of contempt is the one and only way the judicial branch can put muscle behind its decisions. So when the president of the United States steps in and pardons someone’s contempt conviction, he’s essentially rendering the courts powerless.” “For a guy who’s not racist, Donald Trump sure has a lot of racist friends,” Noah concluded."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/sep/14/wine-producers-marketing-ploys-virgin-aldi-fiona-beckett","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-14T16:00:36Z","webTitle":"Class in a glass: the oldest tricks in the wine marketers book","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/sep/14/wine-producers-marketing-ploys-virgin-aldi-fiona-beckett","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/sep/14/wine-producers-marketing-ploys-virgin-aldi-fiona-beckett","fields":{"headline":"Class in a glass: the oldest tricks in the wine marketers book","bodyText":"Last week, I wrote about wine labels as a source of information. This week, I’m looking at them as a marketing tool, by which I don’t mean a posh name or a gold-embossed script, but how a producer can give the impression that his wine is cooler or more upmarket than it actually is. A recent study by the University of Adelaide found that an emotive label encourages people to spend more on a bottle of wine. That mainly relates to descriptions, but it could equally well apply to names and images. Virgin, whose slightly too slick slogan is “Life’s too short for boring wine”, has certainly taken this message to heart, stocking a range of wines from a McLaren Vale-based project called 50S at between £12.99 and £16.99 a bottle, which is a fair bit more than the going rate for shiraz. By and large, the contents deliver, too. I particularly like the 50S Shiraz Touriga 2016 (£16.99; 13.5% abv), an intensely lush red with a very un-PC picture of a sultry woman smoking a fag (how did they get away with that?); the slightly cheaper 50S Project Red Blend 2015 (£12.99; 14.5% abv), which uses grapes left over from other bottlings, makes lipsmacking drinking, too. Or there’s the SC Pannell Field St Shiraz 2015 (£16.95 justincases.co.uk; 14% abv), a textbook McLaren Vale shiraz with deep, voluptuous fruit. The label alone is hard enough to resist, but it’s the words that seduce. Pannell describes it as “our house wine – the very heart of what we are trying to achieve. It’s where we have our vines in the earth and our feet on the ground.” I’m sold, anyway. Labels are also used to disguise less fashionable origins. Aldi recently listed a dark, full-bodied red called Black Star (14% abv) that you’d have sworn was Australian, but in fact turns out to be from Germany’s Pfalz region. And, at £6.99, very good it is, too, assuming you can still find a bottle. Or what about Smart Dog Syrah Trincadeira 2015 (£8.95 House of Townend, £9.40 Manor Wines, £9.70 Tanners; 13.5% abv), a cheerful, juicy red to swig with a pizza? Australia again? Nope, this one’s from Portugal’s Alentejo. Plus, a wine with a critter on the label is always a winner – my dachshund-owning neighbour loved it. Even ultra-traditional sherry producers are playing the game. Take a look at – or, better still, drink – the super-fresh Xeco Fino (£16.99 Master of Malt; 15% abv), with its square-shouldered, clear bottle and cool-looking label, which we’re instructed to “enjoy straight up as the Spanish do or as a long drink over ice with good-quality tonic or lemonade.” “Straight up” sherry?

In 2015, Chile’s congress approved same-sex civil unions after years of legislative wrangling. In March, Bachelet, a centre-left politician, pledged to send a full marriage bill to legislators before the end of the year. On Monday, she fulfilled her promise. “We can’t let old prejudices be stronger than love,” Bachelet said in Chile’s La Moneda presidential palace. “We do this with the certainty that it is not ethical or fair to put artificial limits on love, or to deny essential rights just because of the sex of those who make up a couple.” The bill is expected to allow same-sex couples to adopt children. The move comes a week after Chile’s constitutional court approved a landmark bill that will allow abortion in some circumstances. Before that, Chile was one of only a handful of countries in the world that outlawed terminating a pregnancy in any situation, including when a woman’s life was in danger. Bachelet’s push for marriage equality also comes as countries across the region are expanding gay rights. Same-sex marriage has been legalised in recent years in Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay and Mexico, despite the powerful influence of the Catholic church, which opposes such unions. It was not immediately clear if Bachelet will be able to push the gay marriage bill through congress before she leaves office in March 2018. Though her Nueva Mayoría coalition has a congressional majority, it is severely fractured ahead of elections in November and several members of the coalition hold socially conservative views. Former Chilean President Sebastián Piñera has said he opposes the bill. “There should not be discrimination, but at the same time the essence of an institution such as marriage should be respected, which has always been about conserving the human race,” he told the BBC. Gay rights activists have welcomed the move. “It’s the beginning of the end of discrimination based on sexual orientation to access marriage,” Luis Larraín, president of the Iguales Foundation, told the Associated Press. “This day will be remembered as much as the day when women were granted the right to vote, slaves were freed or children born out of wedlock were granted the same rights.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/sep/03/this-week-we-love-to-buy-sweaty-betty-jeans-crayola-sneakers-jo-malone-cologne","type":"article","sectionId":"fashion","sectionName":"Fashion","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-03T05:00:35Z","webTitle":"This week, we love to buy…","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/sep/03/this-week-we-love-to-buy-sweaty-betty-jeans-crayola-sneakers-jo-malone-cologne","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/sep/03/this-week-we-love-to-buy-sweaty-betty-jeans-crayola-sneakers-jo-malone-cologne","fields":{"headline":"This week, we love to buy…","bodyText":"Make a bigger splash Sweaty Betty’s double denim collection makes you look at jeans in a different light.

When I was 12, I understudied the fairies in the Old Vic production of A Midsummer Night’s Dream with Judi Dench, Tom Courtenay and lots of starry people, and I was completely stage-struck. I still do more performing than writing really. I don’t want to say I’m sick of The Gruffalo, but I suppose I do feel a bit like the little mouse in the story who makes up the Gruffalo and then comes face to face with the real thing. I made him up and then, suddenly, here he is in Chessington Zoo and there’s a little boy with a Gruffalo backpack. It’s everywhere. It’s a weird feeling, but as long as I can use the Gruffalo as a trampoline to bounce my other books about on then I’m happy with that. A lot of people are awfully silly about relationships. I’ve noticed that people who are incredibly sensible about practical things, like choosing a washing machine, will suddenly make some wild decision about relationships. I was always the other way round. I was a bit dreamy and disorganised, but when it came to relationships I was quite fastidious. I wouldn’t have rushed into anything. I started busking when I was a student in Paris to make some money and the songwriting grew out of that. Malcolm [Donaldson, her husband] and I used to get lots of gigs. We would be asked to sing after supper at a dentist’s dinner and I’d write a song about teeth or we’d perform at the Covent Garden hat fair and I’d write a song about hats. It was tremendously good training for the rhyming stories I write now. Ideas can come from anywhere. I was on a safari and we saw these wildebeests and the ranger said: “The wildebeest is one of the ugly five.” And I just pricked up my ears. Ugly five? Who are they? And I immediately knew what my next story was going to be. It’s a lovely feeling when a friendship gets this frisson and you realise you’re attracted to that person. I think that’s probably a more sound way than having the frisson first and then finding out you’re not really compatible. Malcolm and I have been married for 45 years and I can honestly say we’ve never had to work at it. It upsets me when I’m trying to read a rhyming story to my grandchildren and I can’t immediately see where the stress should fall. I’m not saying mine are perfect, but I try my very best to make it trip off the tongue. People underestimate what a lot of crafting goes into it. Quite a few of my books are subconsciously about loss [her eldest son Hamish died in 2003]. Stick Man and Tiddler are both about characters getting lost, and The Paper Dolls is about bereavement and memory.

There was a capacity crowd of 49,000 inside the HDI-Arena for their first home game back in the top flight and by the end of it, a second win from two games sent them into the international break in the fledgling table’s top four, shoulder to shoulder with Bayern Munich, Borussia Dortmund and (equally improbably) Hamburg. In reality, there were more mixed feelings than euphoria as André Breitenreiter’s team extended their perfect start against Schalke on Sunday. “The first home game felt a little bit like an away game,” wrote Hannoversche Allgemeine’s Carsten Bergmann. What is happening on the pitch is almost a sideshow, as vocal Hannover fans rail against the plan of the long-serving president, Martin Kind, to take majority control of the club. The club’s supervisory board voted to sell Kind a 51% controlling stake in early August, allowing the 73-year-old to apply for an exemption to the Bundesliga’s 50+1 rule, which disallows any single person (or company) from having more than 49% of a professional club’s voting rights. A group of fans attempting to take out an injunction to block the move have already had their application rejected by a regional court, but there’s no sense that the battle is over. The emotions running high in the Nordkurve were clear, with a sea of protest banners, most referring to the 50+1 rule itself and some addressing Kind directly, with the phrase “Kind muss weg” (Kind must go) smattered on banners and signs, sporadically, around the ground. Others included “Demokratie&gt;Monarchie” and “Keine Stimmung Ohne Mitbestimmung” – no atmosphere without co-determination. That last one, hinting at the idea of the club almost being held hostage by the fans, is a concept that has been on a lot of minds around the club recently. It was something that Breitenreiter, the coach who brought the club back into the elite after taking over in spring, addressed directly in his pre-match press conference. “We need the team and the fans to be a unit,” he implored on Friday. “My boys deserve to be supported, but with 34 away games in a season … without the support of the fans it will not be enough.” The general manager, Horst Heldt, is in an even trickier situation than Breitenreiter or the players, explicitly tasked with defending Kind and the club’s approach while simultaneously trying to keep the fans onside. “I think it’s just a pity,” Heldt said before the weekend meeting with his former club, “because the interaction between the fans and the team has been really outstanding since I’ve been here, and we’ve seen what a great atmosphere and support for the team can bring. This boycott has nothing to do with the team. The team can’t do anything about the problems, but they are the ones who don’t receive support and suffer from it.” The passion of those supporters is more than clear – too much so on occasions, with Kind being given police protection and an August friendly against Burnley at Turf Moor being abandoned at half-time after a number of away fans tore off seats and started throwing them. Not all those off-the-pitch misdemeanours should necessarily be linked to the current situation – Hannover have received more than €200,000 in DfB-imposed fines since 2013 for a variety of incidents, including fireworks and violent disorder – but the tension is undeniable. One wonders what the Brazilian striker Jonathas made of this in the week of his arrival. Signing from Rubin Kazan on Monday for €9m, the biggest purchase in the club’s history, he seized on a Thilo Kehrer mistake to sidefoot in the winner just five minutes into his debut as a second-half substitute. A seasoned goalscorer in Spain who started this season strongly with Rubin, Jonathas represents the sort of step up in quality to this honest, hard-working team that could make the difference to Hannover’s survival hopes. He is also exactly the sort of signing, of course, which Kind will argue shows why the 96ers need to join Bayer Leverkusen, Hoffenheim and Wolfsburg in stepping away from 50+1, to attract big-money investors. “Whoever puts money in wants to be able to decide what is happening with it,” he said recently. “Professional football can become more modern and still stand for values and traditions,” says Heldt. He has a tricky task persuading the majority of fans of that point of view, and not even the team’s great start will do much to help him. Talking points • Bayern Munich made it two wins out of two as well; again, not in particularly spectacular fashion, and it took them until 18 minutes from the end of the game at Werder Bremen to break through. Yet this was more like the level of control that we’re used to. Manuel Neuer, making his comeback after four months out with a broken foot, argued that it was impossible “to fully test yourself” in such a quiet game. It took him 21 minutes to get his first touch of the ball. Elsewhere, Thomas Müller wasn’t too pleased that Kingsley Coman was given the nod ahead of him from the bench to replace Arjen Robben. “I don’t know what exactly the coach wants to see [from me],” he said afterwards, though the fact that Coman set up Robert Lewandowski’s first goal just after coming on, before Müller entered the fray to tee up the Pole’s second, suggests that Carlo Ancelotti got it spot on. • In the week they finally said goodbye to Ousmane Dembélé, Dortmund again looked a happy camp as they swatted aside Hertha Berlin, a victory more emphatic that the 2-0 scoreline suggested. In fact, there’s a hint of Klopp-era BVB about them under Peter Bosz, a feeling not discouraged by Mario Götze (who played well in his first Bundesliga home game in seven months) and Nuri Sahin, who set up the opener for Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and got a terrific second himself, being important again. Christian Pulisic put in a man-of the-match display in Dembélé’s stead, and Dynamo Kyiv’s Andriy Yarmolenko arrived on Monday as a direct replacement for the departed Frenchman. • It was Bundesliga game number 50 for Julian Nagelsmann away at Bayer Leverkusen, and he got his gift in the form of a fortunate point for Hoffenheim. They showed their mettle at least in coming back from a losing position twice in a 2-2 draw, though the Leverkusen coach, Heiko Herrlich, was angry about Mark Uth’s second equaliser, believing there was a foul on Benny Henrichs in the build-up (which VAR examined). Herrlich should have saved his ire for his team – Dominik Kohr and Kevin Volland both missing sitters that could have put Leverkusen out of sight. On the plus side, they seem to have found a new penalty taker, with Wendell scoring from the spot with his first go, after the team missed nine of their previous 16. • There was no more heartwarming sight than Holger Badstuber’s winner for Stuttgart against Mainz on his home debut, which was his first since December 2009. His smile will live long in the memories, but it was significant that his diving header came from a Dennis Aogo corner, with the experienced pair set to be vital for their team. Mainz have now lost to both promoted clubs in successive weeks, though their sporting director, Rouven Schröder, was deeply unhappy with the use of VAR, which failed to give them an early penalty for a foul and Robin Quaison and later gave a very contentious spot-kick against René Adler – which Stuttgart’s Simon Terrode missed. • There were more recurring patterns of behaviour in Augsburg, where Borussia Mönchengladbach played with style but profligacy, conceding a late equaliser to Sérgio Córdova to give the home side a point. The defending from Dieter Hecking’s side was questionable, though Augsburg had 24 efforts on goal and really deserved their first point of the season. • RB Leipzig are off the mark too, though they had to overturn a half-time deficit before eventually overwhelming Freiburg 4-1. Timo Werner was back on the goal trail with a brace, and his new partnership with Jean-Kévin Augustin – who laid on two assists – looked very promising. The pièce de resistance, though, was substitute Bruma’s blockbusting volley, his first goal for the club. • It was more hard luck stories for Eintracht Frankfurt, with Kevin-Prince Boateng’s home debut not enough to prevent a loss to Wolfsburg. Both he and the club’s new centre-forward Sébastien Haller – who hit the post – missed presentable chances, much to the Prince’s displeasure. “I prefer someone who throws shoes into the corner in the half-time,” said the CEO, Fredi Bobic. “We need such types.” More influential on the day was Josuha Guilavogui, incandescent to be left out last week but setting up Daniel Dadavi’s winner for the visitors. • Last but by no means least, three cheers for Hamburg. They put a pin in the party balloons of Köln on Friday night, with the city busy salivating over their return to Europe after the Europa League draw earlier in the day. From André Hahn’s well-taken opener it was the consummate away performance, and they held on well even after a red card for Mërgim Mavraj on the hour – handed out by the replacement referee, Sören Storks, 44 seconds after he took over from the injured Felix Brych. Results Friday: Köln 1-3 Hamburg. Saturday: Dortmund 2-0 Hertha, Augsburg 2-2 Gladbach, Eintracht Frankfurt 0-1 Wolfsburg, Leverkusen 2-2 Hoffenheim, Stuttgart 1-0 Mainz, Werder Bremen 0-2 Bayern.

The last couple of weeks have been an exception, with blanket coverage of the trial of Charlie Alliston, convicted last week over the death of Kim Briggs after he struck her on his bike. This piece isn’t about the facts of this very tragic case. It’s about the aftermath, more specifically the repeated call in some part of the media for something to be done about what these articles believe is a particular problem of reckless and law-flouting cyclists. Much of this is perhaps predictable – I’ve written previously on the particular way cycling and cyclists are often dealt with in the media and public debate – but it’s worth pointing out the peculiarly one-sided and fact-avoidant tone of much of the recent discussion. It’s also worth countering some of the myths again propagated about cycling, because it’s not just pundits who have been making themselves look silly; a few politicians who should have known much better have also got involved. Two points before I begin. First – and this cannot be stressed enough – I am not seeking to excuse or mitigate Alliston’s actions, or those of other riders who behave in a potentially reckless manner. I have utter sympathy for the loved ones of Kim Briggs. This piece is only intended to provide context as to where the problem on danger on the roads really lies. Also: when I refer to a cyclist, I mean someone who happens to be riding a bike at that moment. They are not different, or apart, or special. The great majority of regular adult cyclists in the UK also drive cars. Like me, they’re also very likely to use trains, buses, planes, all the rest of it. This is a debate about modes of transport, not tribes. The anti-cycling backlash is disproportionate and ill-informed As an experiment I looked through the news feeds of all UK police forces for the fortnight following the first day of the Alliston trial, and compiled details of the serious road incidents they cited. It found that over the period, eight pedestrians had been killed after being hit by car drivers, and 27 were seriously injured, in five of these cases the motorist fleeing the scene. Two cyclists were killed (one in a hit and run) and four badly hurt, two again by drivers who did not stop. Three motorcyclists died after colliding with cars, and 26 people in motor vehicles died in various other collisions (I excluded single-vehicle crashes). Other incidents included a 12-year-old girl pushed off her bike by a man, after which she was almost hit and killed by a car, and a six-year-old boy run over and trapped under a mobility scooter, the driver of which then left the scene (at a presumably sedate pace). Beyond the horrible crash on the M1 which killed eight people, none of these, that I saw, made the front pages – or any pages – of the national newspapers. To me, this shows that the supposed “problem” of dangerous cyclists, as identified by such disparate sources as the Times leader column, Adam Boulton and Tony Blackburn, is less serious than billed. To stress again: this is not to excuse or mitigate what Alliston did. It is simply to place it in the wider context of the everyday, normalised and largely ignored daily carnage on our roads. There is not an epidemic of dangerous cycling on the roads Even some of the more sensible post-trial commenters felt obliged to note, with a weary sigh, that cyclists can be a particularly lawless bunch overall. My esteemed and wise colleague, David Shariatmadari, contrasted the anarchic world of bikes with the “rigorously tested and policed” arena of driving. There’s a flaw with this argument: there’s no evidence it’s true. Yes, a percentage of cyclists ride like idiots, and their actions can cause injury and, more often, intimidation or alarm. But the same can be said for just about every form of transport. As I’ve written before, I strongly suspect cyclists who rush through red lights are likely to drive a car equally stupidly. It’s about idiots, not the mode of travel that happen to be using at the time. And there is a lot of stupidity in cars. Speeding and phone use at the wheel is less visible than a cyclist sailing across a red, but (for reasons of physics rather than morals) is much, much more likely to kill or maim someone else. Those who think licensing cars and testing drivers curbs lawlessness should follow the Twitter feed of the joint Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire roads policing unit, an endless daily list of uninsured, illegally-modified or otherwise dangerous vehicles. For more context, consider this. Earlier this month Essex police had a single day of action in Clacton – a town of about 20,000 people – connected to poor driving. It found 116 speeding offences, 12 drivers with no insurance, 18 with no MOT, seven using phones, and 11 cars seized for faults or illegal modifications. Rushed laws are bad laws As any politician will tell you, the classic example of this was the 1991 Dangerous Dogs Act, a rushed and confused measure introduced following a series of high-profile attacks by a handful of breeds. This has not stopped several commentators, including a Times editorial, demanding a change to the admittedly ancient and arcane laws which saw Alliston convicted under an 1861 measure barring “wanton and furious” driving. It’s worth noting that Briggs’ widower, Matt, has also suggested a law change, and that it is clear why he might think this. I’d make just two points. First, there is a reason there has never been a specific law targeting cyclists who kill – it happens very occasionally, usually between zero and two times a year in Britain (as against 300 or so killed by motor vehicles), and prosecutions resulting from these are still rarer. Second, there is a much better argument for a wholesale revamp of road laws to better protect all vulnerable road users, whether pedestrians, cyclists or motorcyclists. A BBC study found that fewer than half of driver convicted of offences in which a cyclist died went to jail. Other research has found large numbers of drivers keep their licences even after being repeatedly convicted of law-breaking. In 2015 a van driver, Christopher Gard, killed a cyclist as he sent a text at the wheel. It emerged in court Gard had six previous convictions for using a phone as he drove. If you want to use law to make the roads safer, this might seem a better place to begin. There is no powerful cycling lobby, or even many cyclists This is one of the more curious arguments from the cycle sceptics, and again it’s nonsense. Cycling UK (formerly the CTC), named by the usually sensible Boulton as “a well-resourced lobbying organisation”, has an annual income of about £5m, precisely 10% that of the powerful Cats Protection League. One of the reasons there is so much media misinformation about cycling is that virtually no one cares about the subject, and even politicians make regular howlers about it. The usually reasonable Labour MP Wes Streeting used the Alliston case as a reason to tweet that there was need for “better enforcement of brakes, lights and helmets”, somehow not noticing helmets are not a legal requirement to be enforced. But more than that, the idea that the UK is menaced by an advancing tide of reckless cyclists ignores the fact that cycling levels across the country have stayed largely static for years, and remain pitifully low, at about 1% or so or all trips. Yes, there are more cyclists now in London, where most of the commentators live. But if you live in, say, Burnley where, the 2011 census shows, precisely 397 of the town’s 63,000 commuters cycle to work, the whole argument probably seems like an odd irrelevance. It’s missing the point on an industrial scale Last week, figures from Public Health England showed 6 million middle-aged people in England are currently getting more or less no exercise, at massive risk to their health. If you talk to just about any public health expert they will tell you two things. First, the pandemic of avoidable ill-health caused by sedentary lifestyles will, if unchecked, pretty soon bankrupt the NHS and social care systems. They will also tell you that the best way to get people active is exercise which forms part of their everyday life, such as active travel, and that cycling is ideal for this. About 85,000 people in England and Wales die each year from illness connected to inactive living. Obsessing about the supposed dangers caused by cycling, rather than the many, provable benefits it brings, strikes me as extremely odd."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/sep/15/cocktail-fourth-marquess-gin-sherry-st-germain-dickies-bar-london-dead-rabbit-new-york","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-15T15:00:46Z","webTitle":"Cocktail of the week: the fourth marquess","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/sep/15/cocktail-fourth-marquess-gin-sherry-st-germain-dickies-bar-london-dead-rabbit-new-york","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/sep/15/cocktail-fourth-marquess-gin-sherry-st-germain-dickies-bar-london-dead-rabbit-new-york","fields":{"headline":"Cocktail of the week: the fourth marquess","bodyText":"This is one result of our collaboration with Gregory Buda from The Dead Rabbit in New York and Richard Ryan of Drinksology.

On the flipside, the so-called mates’ taxi is becoming less popular among teenage drivers, offering the hope of fewer multiple-fatality crashes involving cars overloaded with young passengers. A report published by the Department for Transport shows that 30% of over-60s who have chosen not to learn to drive did so because they preferred to rely on family and friends (compared with 12% five years previously). while the figures for 17- to 20-year-olds giving the same reason fell to 23% from 30%. The proportion of young people blaming the high cost of learning to drive was 44% – down from 55% five years earlier. Separate DfT figures show that, for the first time in recent years, the proportion of over-70s with a driving licence has dropped, from 64% to 62%. The decline relates almost exclusively to older men, down from 81% to 78%, while older women maintain the previous year’s 50%. However, it does not mean fewer pensioners driving on the road. Half a million more full driving licence holders are aged 70-plus compared with five years ago. The statistics offered hope that the teenage driver death and injury toll would decline more quickly, the AA said. Official road casualty figures show that 29% of killed or seriously injured passengers are aged between 17 and 24. “It looks like the mates’ taxi will have to pull over and make way for ‘gran and grandads’ taxi – payback for all the times parents drove their kids to school, sports activities and parties,” said the AA president, Edmund King. “However, there is a worrying side. In 2010, after high pump prices led to an exodus of hospital appointment and other volunteer drivers, AA campaigning helped to convince the coalition to raise the tax threshold on claiming private car mileage expenses from 40p to 45p a mile for the first 10,000 miles. That reversed the drop in numbers and the increasing burden on NHS resources to fill the gap.” King said lower dependence on the mates’ taxi was a hopeful sign. “Among 15- to 18-year-olds, 58% of accidental deaths happen on the road. Among young males in this age group, it is 55% and a staggering 63% among young women. The likelihood of dying in a crash is even higher when it is a car full of teenagers. It is such a tragic waste.” The road safety group Brake said peer pressure could encourage bad driving and led to younger drivers “showing off” to their passengers and taking more risks. Sixteen- to 17-year-old drivers are up to four times more likely to die in a crash when carrying young passengers than when driving alone, but 62% less likely when carrying older adult passengers, suggesting it is peer pressure rather than simply the presence of passengers that raises the risk."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/sep/02/family-life-my-parents-in-a-south-african-mine-she-loves-you-by-the-beatles-and-my-grandmothers-krautsalat","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-02T05:45:06Z","webTitle":"Family life: My parents in a South African mine; She Loves You by the Beatles; and my grandmother’s Krautsalat","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/sep/02/family-life-my-parents-in-a-south-african-mine-she-loves-you-by-the-beatles-and-my-grandmothers-krautsalat","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/sep/02/family-life-my-parents-in-a-south-african-mine-she-loves-you-by-the-beatles-and-my-grandmothers-krautsalat","fields":{"headline":"Family life: My parents in a South African mine; She Loves You by the Beatles; and my grandmother’s Krautsalat","bodyText":"Snapshot: My parents in a South African mine This photograph is one of many that my father took on the trip of a lifetime to South Africa to visit his brother and family. As a child, the youngest of three, I had no memories of Uncle Peter, my father’s younger brother, and found it hard to believe that he existed, let alone that he had children – my cousins – who shared a surname with us. All those miles away. By the time Mum and Dad made the trip over to Johannesburg in 1980, I was a student at Thames Polytechnic and so was able to see them off at the airport – as well as welcome them back on their return a month later. I worried about them going to a country riven by apartheid. They were both politically active with the Liberal party and were also committed Methodists – teetotal, non-conformist and committed to the ideas of individual freedom and social justice. Uncle Peter and his wife, Joan, organised a road trip with my parents to show them as much of the country as possible and they travelled between Johannesburg and Port Elizabeth, where one of Dad’s nieces lived. They visited gold mines, ostrich farms and stayed overnight at a game reserve. Mum told me about stopping to buy carvings and bead dolls from stalls at the side of the road; she also talked about the discomfort she felt when grown men were addressed as “boy” simply because they were not white. Dad laughingly told us about the party they were invited to – where pet rabbits were dyed in various pastel shades and the women wore scanty bikinis. This photograph was taken at the Crown Mines in Johannesburg and they are wearing the protective gear that was needed to tour the mine. I don’t suppose I listened to their anecdotes all that closely. I was a student and had better things to do than be bored by holiday talk. And that is why I cherish this photograph so much. It sits on the shelf in the back bedroom and I look at it when I stand in there and iron. I see their excitement about their trip, their enthusiasm in learning about new things and their willingness to be a bit silly. Most of all, I love it because it looks as if they are having fun. They continued to be interested and have fun for many more years until Dad suffered a fatal aneurysm in 2006 and Mum developed dementia, passing away in 2015. The photographs that I inherited are now the only link we have to our South African cousins. Janet Flexney Playlist: I went to the US and missed the Beatles She Loves You by the Beatles “She loves you, yeah, yeah,yeah … / She says she loves you / And you know that can’t be bad” In 1963, my father, who was professor of statistics at Aberystwyth University, got sabbatical leave and took a post at Harvard for six months. The whole family – my mum and dad, me (13), my sister (12) and my little brother (six) – sailed across the Atlantic on the Empress of Britain to live in Lexington, Massachusetts for a while. We didn’t go to school, adopted some kittens, were amazed at the autumn colours and the strange shapes of the squashes on sale, and listened to a hit record by Allan Sherman called Hello Muddah, Hello Faddah (based on letters of complaint Sherman received from his son, Robert, while he was attending summer camp). Oh, and President Kennedy was assassinated and, yes, I do remember exactly where I was when I heard the news. Eventually, we sailed back to Britain and while we were away the Beatles had happened. In those pre-internet days, they were unknown and unheard of in the US and it was vital for a 13-year-old girl to know who they were and to know the complex lyrics of She Loves You. To remedy this deeply uncool state, my best friend and I spent hours in her bedroom, huddled over their photos, while she taught me the names and characteristics of the Fab Four and the words to their hit. Then she would test me. She told me it was important to choose a favourite, so I chose George, or was it John, or Paul? I can’t really remember now. Sorry, Ringo! I did think that She Loves You was a vast improvement on Hello Muddah … and proved how very sophisticated us Brits were, but I never really caught up with being cool. Jan Lindley We love to eat: My grandmother’s Krautsalat Ingredients 1/4 firm white cabbage Salt A vinaigrette made by whisking vegetable oil with wine vinegar, seasoning and plenty of German mustard (although French mustard is easier to get and works just as well) Finely shred the cabbage into a bowl, layering it with spoonfuls of salt as you go. Blanch the shredded cabbage with boiling water and drain well. Dress with the vinaigrette and serve with cold meats. My grandmother was an expert cook and she brought all the tools of her trade with her from Germany when we – my parents, my siblings and I, my aunt and my widowed grandmother – came to England in 1939. She cooked for the whole household in the north London house that was still my second home, when, five years later, most of the extended family moved away, leaving only Grandma and my unmarried aunt behind. Auntie worked as a secretary until well into her 70s, and as a student and career girl in the south-east, I would visit for a weekend meal. I became Auntie’s surrogate daughter. When she finally downsized to a retirement home, one of the useful and interesting kitchen implements I inherited was a mandolin, along with this recipe for Krautsalat, for which it is indispensable. The mandolin (pictured) is a precision instrument, and a dangerous one, too; sliced fingers are quite a hazard. The two steel blades that are slotted into the wooden frame are razor-sharp, and that they still work well after 75 years is due to loving care by successive owners. With my mandolin, I can knock up a healthy, low-fat Krautsalat for a salad lunch in five minutes flat, and I always make a point of washing it by hand and drying it meticulously.

Puss had recently mauled one of the fancy pigeons with which Darwin had been trying out his own theories of selective breeding. No one had warned little Etty Darwin about her pet’s fate, and as an old woman she declared that the trauma of discovering her parents’ treachery still rankled. Here, in a nutshell, is the kind of anecdote on which AN Wilson’s “revisionary” biography of Darwin depends, one that dramatises the great man of science as a monster of ruthless self-interest, an assassin in a nightmare land of kill-or-be-killed. The only way that the story could be bettered from Wilson’s point of view is if he could show Darwin actually strangling the cat with his bare hands. What Wilson is engaged in here, then, is not just a demolition of Darwin’s science, which he maintains is mostly bogus and outmoded, but an assassination of the man’s moral character. Darwin, Wilson contends, was not the nervy but benign magus of Down House, labouring patiently for decades in rural Kent to unlock the origins of human life for the benefit of all mankind. He was actually an egotist with an unfailing eye for “the main chance”, determined to go down in history as the greatest scientist of all time. According to Wilson’s long charge sheet, Darwin routinely stole ideas, couldn’t be bothered to go to family funerals and wasn’t keen on sex, despite having 10 children (some of whom were “notably plain”). Despite dying seven years before Hitler was born, he apparently paved the way for the Nazis’ love affair with eugenics. To cap it all, his unsavoury insistence of having a “privy” in the corner of his study meant that he probably smelled of his own poo. First, let’s take the science. Wilson concedes with a smirk that Darwin “was among the foremost experts on the earthworm” but not much else. Specifically, the big picture stuff was beyond him, which is why he gobbled up other people’s theories about evolution, including those of his grandfather Dr Erasmus Darwin, and then passed them off as his own. Indeed, Darwin-as-plagiarist is one of the chief poison darts in Wilson’s argument. What actually happened, of course, was that Darwin absorbed the hints and hypotheses of an earlier generation of science writers, including those of his grandfather, and embarked on a painstaking programme of data-gathering that allowed him to substantiate what had previously been merely a widely held hunch. That there remained gaps, dead ends and errors in his narrative account of how life unfolded on earth over multi-millennia was something Darwin was always quick to acknowledge. It was in response to the questions and corrections that flooded into Down House from around the world that he continued to modify his arguments. This, one might think, is what scientists do, especially ones who are committed to the concept of evolution, the slow adjustments of shape and form over time. For Wilson, however, Darwin’s constant need to revise his published work is evidence of nothing more than the narcissist’s terror of being caught in the wrong. Although Wilson will just about allow On the Origin of Species a credible place in the history of science, The Descent of Man, published 12 years later in 1871, is his holy terror. It was in this book, Wilson suggests, that Darwin finally came clean about his view of the natural world, which crucially now included the human race alongside fancy pigeons and pet cats, as a dog-eat-dog frenzy, where only the fittest survive and everyone else ends up as lunch. It was a terrifying vision, unless you happened to be a member of the emergent upper-middle classes to which Darwin and his Wedgwood cousins belonged. For this happy crew, whose income came mainly from mature investments rather than directly from manufacturing or agriculture, it was consoling to believe that prosperity and pre-eminence were the just rewards of intellect and energy, while poverty was a kind of moral failure. As far as Wilson is concerned, what Darwin does in the aptly named The Descent of Man is to provide a charter for amoral greed, whereby “people like us” carry on despoiling British society, and increasingly the rest of the world, with nothing more than a slight murmur of regret about how unfair life is. None of this is remotely new. For decades, historians of science have acknowledged that Darwin’s natural world bears a striking resemblance to mid-Victorian Britain, minus the antimacassars and the workhouse. But to argue, as Wilson does, that Darwin positively relished the principle of vicious individualism over mutuality and collaboration simply isn’t true. His most famous motif, the one that everyone remembers because it leaps off the page with such unforced joy, is that of the tangled bank. Based on his daily observations of a stretch of land near his home, Darwin describes a buzzing ecosystem that is home to plants, birds and insects “all dependent on each other”. Here, he implies, is a microcosm for how we too might imagine our lives. Most beastly of all, though, is Wilson’s almost-claim that Darwin was secretly sympathetic to slavery. By a series of elisions as slithery as any he ascribes to his subject, he manages to suggest that, if forced to answer the question posed by the enchained black man on the famous abolitionist medallion, “Am I not a man and a brother?”, Darwin “could” have answered “in the negative”. The shock value comes from the fact that the medallion, which did so much to turn ordinary Britons against slavery in the 1790s, was made by Darwin’s grandfather, the potter Josiah Wedgwood. It turns out that Wilson has no evidence for this egregious slur. All he can muster is the whiskery argument that, because Darwin saw black and brown people (not to mention Jews, Slavs, Celts and anyone who didn’t come from his native belt of central England) as lesser, he was a proto-eugenicist. What he actually was, however, was an Englishman with the usual prejudices of his time. To blame Darwin for being racist is like accusing Freud of not being a feminist, which is to say both blindingly obvious and slightly beside the point. Instead of subtitling this book “Victorian Mythmaker”, Wilson might have more accurately called it “J’Accuse”. For despite a few pious throat-clearings on the dust jacket to the contrary, he has no interest in balance, no desire to be nice about the man whom he blames for pretty much everything that went wrong in the 20th century, from totalitarianism to the decline of organised religion. Still, Wilson being Wilson, there’s no mistaking the jaunty pleasure he gets from this exercise, and the fun he has in knowing that he is going to ruffle as many feathers as little Etty Darwin’s cat did when it stole into the loft at Down House and started snacking on a particularly juicy pigeon. • Kathryn Hughes’s Victorians Undone is published by Fourth Estate.

And no one’s been on the receiving end of that criticism more than Taylor Swift. Despite a lengthy catalogue of hits in which she plays scorned exes and lovelorn balladeers, the country singer turned pop superstar has been seen less as a victim than as a purveyor of victimhood, using her prodigious songwriting talents and natural affability to become a megaphone for perceived injustice. So what does Taylor Swift do to prove to us she’s aware of this narrative (the one, of course, from which she’d like to be excluded)? Release a music video – for her new single, Look What You Made Me Do – that’s practically boiling over with meta-commentary and self-referential detail, from an ongoing visual snake motif to a tombstone that literally reads “Taylor Swift’s reputation”. Yes, it’s painfully on-the-nose, but Swift’s brand hasn’t exactly been built on subtlety. Look What You Made Me Do – or LWYMMD, as its Twitter hashtag dictates – is well on its way to smashing streaming records, but the song hasn’t been as well received by critics. Continuing in the tradition of her last album, 1989, which marked Swift’s official evolution into pop music behemoth, it largely abandons that which made her a household name – singable melodies; sharp, specific lyricism; grand tales of romantic enchantment – in favor of radio-engineered pop and glib proclamations of vengeance. Near the end of the song, she answers a phone call; someone’s asking to speak with Taylor Swift. “She can’t come to the phone right now,” Swift 2.0 says. Why? “Because she’s dead.” In the battle between Swifts, my allegiance is with the deceased version, a shrewd chronicler of young-adult courtship and seasoned, starry-eyed songwriter. So much so that hearing her new single made me nostalgic for the days of Fearless and Red. But the Old Swift be damned; this new one is all about retribution and, as the title of her forthcoming album suggests, reputation. The music video for LWYMMD, which premiered during Sunday night’s VMAs, sees Swift double down on her vengeful streak, making theatre of her scandal-laden career in an attempt to communicate a self-awareness that’s mostly eluded her. The video is good fun, if a little bit mad; it’s certainly the most brazen and ambitious pop music video since Beyoncé dropped Lemonade in the spring of last year, replete with pyrotechnics and dozens of costume changes. But it doesn’t amount to much more than a succession of disconnected images. And if the images could talk, they might say, “I know what you think of me”, or, perhaps, in the words of Joanne the Scammer: “I’m a messy bitch who lives for drama.” But still, in all those images, Swift left a lot to be decoded. A connoisseur of the tongue-in-cheek (remember the capitalized letters in her lyric booklets that spelled out clues about a song’s subject?), it begins with a zombified T-Swift digging her own grave. Get it? The Old Swift is dead, dunzo, kaput, resigned to the graveyard of pop culture history. First, we see the aforementioned tombstone, where Swift’s reputation lies, but also a second one, reading “Nils Sjoberg”, the pseudonym Swift used as a co-writer on her ex-boyfriend Calvin Harris’s song, This Is What You Came For, a collaboration widely assumed to have contributed to their breakup. Swift’s writing credit was supposed to be kept secret, but when her team revealed that she had, in fact, written the Harris-Rihanna hit, her ex went on a tweetstorm about how Swift was looking for “someone new to try and bury”. So she buried the fictitious Mr Sjoberg. In the next shot, Swift luxuriates in a tub of diamonds, where there sits a single dollar bill, a possible reference to the symbolic dollar she earned in last month’s sexual assault case against the radio DJ who groped her in 2013. Internet conspiracists, too, ran with this as a visual reference to Melania Trump, who could be seen forking diamond necklaces like spaghetti in a Vanity Fair spread last year. But those were the same people insistent that Swift, who kept mum during last year’s presidential campaigns, is a closeted Trump supporter. That the election coincided with Swift’s period of self-imposed exile did little to get her back in the public’s good graces; but diamonds, unlike gilded toilet seats, do not a Trump reference make. This next one is a dead giveaway: Swift sits atop a throne as dozens of snakes slither at her feet. One even serves her what we can only assume is piping hot tea, the kind Kim Kardashian dished out when she released audio of Swift, who publicly disputed Kanye West’s lyric about her in Famous, appearing to sign off on those same lyrics in a phone conversation with West. Afterwards, Swift’s reputation as a snake in sheep’s clothing took off; Kardashian helped further that image by tweeting a bunch of snake emojis on international snake day. More than a year later, it seems Swift’s ready to embrace the title: ahead of the single’s release, she dropped cryptic reptilian teaser videos. And now, the snake has shed her skin. There’s also an inscription on Swift’s gold throne that reads “Et Tu Brute”, the Latin phrase used in William Shakespeare’s Julius Caesar when Caesar is being assassinated by his friend Brutus. It’s a far cry from the Swift of yesteryear, whose Shakespeare references were more Romeo and Juliet than Julius Caesar. But she’s dead, remember? It was at the 2016 Grammys, when 1989 beat Kendrick Lamar’s To Pimp a Butterfly for album of the year, that Swift first began to truly test the public’s patience. That was also where she publicly rebuked West’s lyric about her in her acceptance speech. So in the next shot, as the chorus begins, Swift rams a shiny gold car into a storefront where paparazzo are lurking. She opens the door, a cheetah in tow, to show off none other than her Grammy award. She proceeds to display and caress it in one of the video’s most bewildering moments. Swift’s love of cats is well documented. Here, she’s surrounded by stacks of cash and a Girl Squad of masked felines, wielding a baseball bat and a sweater that says “Blind for Love”. In the next scene, the masked marauders can be seen robbing a music streaming company. Swift, if you remember, boycotted Spotify for years due to its dismal compensation of artists. She also wrote an open letter to Apple Music in 2014 arguing on behalf of increased artists compensation and then took to Tumblr, in June 2015, blasting Apple’s decision to give users three-month free trials. And now she’s back to rob them, cat imagery to boot. Swift first assembled her Girl Squad in the music video for Bad Blood, supposedly a shot at rival Katy Perry. She then spent her 1989 world tour parading her besties around in different cities, throwing parties for her supermodel coterie and bringing them to red carpets. This didn’t work out great for Swift, adding to the perception that she surrounds herself only with similarly alpine, Aryan beauties such as Karlie Kloss, Martha Hunt and Gigi Hadid. But she knows you think that, alright? So here’s a factory of fembots united like the sentient hosts of Westworld. Swift stands before them in leather and latex, the ringleader of scorned Girl Squads the world over. This next still made waves for its apparent resemblance to a shot from Beyoncé’s Formation video. But the real hidden gem is the backup dancers’ belly shirts, which read “I Heart TS”. Tom Hiddleston, one of Swift’s ex-boyfriends, was caught in a similar shirt when splashing around the beaches of Rhode Island with Swift. All of which seems to suggest that Swift surrounds herself only with those who emblazon their love for her on T-shirts. Or, she’s commenting on the fact that you think she does that. As we get closer to the finale, we see Swift standing before a bunch of former Swifts: the lovesick high-schooler from the You Belong With Me music video, the one in a silver flapper dress who was interrupted on the VMA stage by Kanye West, the innocent, bespectacled one wearing pajamas, the one dressed as a white swan from the Shake It Off music video. They claw at her feet, aching to be resurrected. But Swift 2.0, wearing a black shirt that says “Rep”, banishes them all and declares the “old Taylor” dead. This segues into the video’s utterly cringeworthy dance break which, for all I know, is more Swift meta-commentary on how bad of a dancer everyone thinks she is (an, ahem, reputation corroborated by all the times awards show cameras have panned awkwardly to Swift in the audience during a performance, writhing around like the inflatable tube men at gas stations). Finally, the Swifts both old and new assemble before an airplane, where the word “reputation” appears again. Here, Swift on Swift reaches its thematic apex: Zombie Swift tells You Belong With Me Swift to “stop making that surprised face, it’s so annoying”. White Swan Swift adds: “You can’t possible be that surprised all the time”. Top-hat Swift tells Cowboy Boots Swift that she’s “so fake”. Cowboy Boots Swift bursts into tears. “There she goes, playing the victim again,” responds another Swift, wearing spiked leather. Leopard-clad Swift holds up her phone and announces she’s “getting receipts” – and that she’ll “edit them” too, a reference to Swift’s belief that Kardashian artfully edited that incriminating audio of her. And finally, 2009 VMAs Swift, holding her Moonman, announces she would “very much like to be excluded from this narrative”. And with that – as old Swifts expire and a new one is born – the narrative lives to see another day."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"film/2017/aug/29/fantastic-four-most-mismanaged-superhero-franchise-film-comic-book-marvel","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-29T09:41:59Z","webTitle":"Is Fantastic Four the most mismanaged superhero franchise ever?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/aug/29/fantastic-four-most-mismanaged-superhero-franchise-film-comic-book-marvel","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2017/aug/29/fantastic-four-most-mismanaged-superhero-franchise-film-comic-book-marvel","fields":{"headline":"Is Fantastic Four the most mismanaged superhero franchise ever?","bodyText":"It is tempting to wonder if there has ever been a superhero team more mishandled on the big screen than the Fantastic Four. On the face of it, Marvel’s awesome foursome are less frumpy and passé than Captain America, more recognisable to the general public than … say … Deadpool, and have a collective backstory that’s almost as absurdly cosmic as the Guardians of the Galaxy. Yet somehow all of the above are thriving in multiplexes, while Reed Richards and co are an enduring Hollywood disappointment. If blame is to be laid anywhere, it should probably be placed at the door of 20th Century Fox, the studio that bought the big screen rights to Fantastic Four way back in the 1990s, and has held onto them ever since despite all available evidence suggesting that it hasn’t got a clue what to do with the superhero team. In fact, the history of the franchise points to one knee-jerk decision after another, a pattern that shows no sign of letting up if rumours that the latest reboot are to be believed. Bleeding Cool has reported that the new version of Fantastic Four will be a kid-centric movie similar in tone to Pixar’s The Incredibles, and focused on Franklin and Valeria, the children of Reed Richards (Mister Fantastic) and Susan Storm. The other two members of the Four, Johnny Storm (The Human Torch) and Ben Grimm (The Thing), will be featured but not in central roles. The blog’s latest suggestion is that the new project might be based on Mark Millar’s unpublished Kindergarten Heroes comic, about a gang of toddler superheroes, which Fox optioned in 2013. Of course, there is absolutely nothing wrong with identifying a market for comic book stories aimed at the very young. We live in an era in which parents taking their kids to see a movie about Captain America and Iron Man are likely to have to shield their little ones’ peepers during the excruciating scene where a helpless, tied-up baddie is slowly, horrifically drowned, or the denouement in which our heroes cheerfully beat each other to bloody wrecks. Meanwhile, The Lego Batman Movie, The Incredibles and Big Hero 6 have proven that there is a place for meta-tastic animated superhero flicks that appeal to all ages. The problem here is not the idea of Kindergarten Heroes coming to the big screen, it’s that Fox reportedly want to bundle up its rights to Fantastic Four as part of the package. Apart from being contemptuous of Marvel’s longest running superhero team, the idea of focusing a movie on their offspring – even if a tale centred on the preposterously powerful Franklin Richards is tantalising – ignores the fact that the studio has yet to get the original quartet right on the big screen. The duo of noughties movies – Fantastic Four and Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer – which starred Ioan Gruffudd as Reed Richards and Jessica Alba as Sue Storm, are best remembered for their TV-movie quality and the dull interplay between its four main heroes. Perhaps Fox decided those films’ failure to pick up critical traction resulted from the safety-first approach adopted by director Tim Story, because it then appointed up-and-coming film-maker Josh Trank (Chronicle) to oversee a dark and gritty reboot. Unfortunately, the result, 2015’s Fantastic Four (also known as Fant4stic) is now remembered as one of the most infamous box office turkeys of the decade, with Trank even disowning the film prior to its opening. In the wake of this repeated maladministration, there is only one obvious way forward for the Fantastic Four to establish their rightful place among the highest plinths of the big screen comic book pantheon, and that is for the quartet to be absorbed into the Marvel Cinematic Universe – a route that has just seen Spider-Man return to prominence after the relative mediocrity of the wallcrawler’s last few Sony movies. The parallels are obvious: audiences would no more pay to see another film in which the Fantastic Four gain mysterious powers after a trip into space than they would have parted with their hard-earned cash for yet another Spidey origin story featuring the death of Uncle Ben and Peter Parker beating up Flash Thompson. Bringing the webslinger into the MCU avoided the need to bore us with a slightly shifted version of the same old origins story, and it’s not hard to imagine a similar trick working for Richards and team. Instead, Fox seem determined to go an entirely different route, one that would conveniently allow the studio to keep full control of the property it bought the rights to all those years ago. Yet the concept goes against all received thinking in this arena, which is that spin-offs work best when the original property being bounced off is so popular that there is genuine demand for more stories set in the same universe. The Fantastic Four certainly doesn’t fall into this category. In Hollywood terms, it’s as if someone decided to make a spin-off to Mother’s Day centred on the character played by Julia Roberts. By skipping a generation, Fox would essentially be giving up on ever making the definitive Fantastic Four movie that fans have been waiting for since Roger Corman’s execrable low-budget 90s effort. Evidence suggests this will really not be a Fantastic Four film, but rather a movie tagged to the Fantastic Four brand for commercial reasons. And that, surely, will represent the studio finally admitting that it simply does not know what to do with these storied comic book titans."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2017/aug/28/peter-whalley-obituary","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-28T12:15:54Z","webTitle":"Peter Whalley obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/aug/28/peter-whalley-obituary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2017/aug/28/peter-whalley-obituary","fields":{"headline":"Peter Whalley obituary","bodyText":"Peter Whalley, who has died aged 71 of cancer, was Coronation Street’s longest-serving and most prolific scriptwriter, penning 601 episodes over 35 years. Between 1979 and 2014 he bridged several eras and a multitude of characters, and brought to life some of the soap’s biggest storylines. One of his earliest, in 1980, was a slanging match across the Rovers Return bar between Elsie Tanner and Bet Lynch – over a man – which combined classic characters from Coronation Street’s first two generations and demonstrated the strong, fiery women who stepped along its cobbles. Three years later he wrote the episode resolving the Mike Baldwin-Deirdre Barlow affair, which had gripped the nation for months. When she chose to stay with her husband, Ken, 18 million viewers were watching – and the Old Trafford scoreboard for a midweek Manchester United match informed fans at half-time: “Deirdre and Ken united again!” Whalley was also responsible for the scripts when Mike and Ken had a punch-up in the Rovers (1990), Alan Bradley posed as the late Len Fairclough to defraud his widow Rita out of her house (1988), Vera had stone cladding put on her hers (1989), Mavis Wilton left the soap in a tear-jerking final episode (1997), and Ken’s companion Babs Fanshawe died during a dinner date when he was working as a male escort (1998). He also wrote episodes in which Todd Grimshaw told Sarah Platt that he was gay (2004), David Platt drove his car into the canal to spoil Sarah and Jason Grimshaw’s wedding day (2007), and Jack Duckworth movingly sang If You Were the Only Girl in the World as his wife, Vera, died (2008). Peter Barlow’s bigamy story in 2003 was Whalley’s idea and he wrote many key episodes, including Peter’s showdown with his two “wives”. Bringing a quiet, self-assured voice to story conferences, Whalley went from high drama to comedy in an instant and was behind many memorable lines: “Bet Lynch’s place is behind a bar wearing a daft pair of earrings and very little else” (Hilda Ogden, 1985); “If my wife put her mind to it, she could find good reason why Joseph and Mary were unfit parents” (Don Brennan on the devout Catholic Ivy, 1991) and “Have you seen him actually flying planes because I’ve seen him actually selling ties?” (Ken to Deirdre during her relationship with the bogus pilot Jon Lindsay, 1997). Whalley was born in Colne, Lancashire, son of Francis, a supervisor in a textile factory, and his wife, Edna (nee McMullin). As a child, he was an avid reader and, on leaving St Mary’s college, Blackburn, studied philosophy at Lancaster University. He then spent 10 years teaching English, first at the Latymer school, London, then at the King’s school, Pontefract. At the same time, he started writing plays. The Hilton Boy (1977) was the first of more than 30 for BBC Radio 4, most of them thrillers. He broke into TV with A Man of Morality (1976), starring James Grout, and Risking It (1977), starring Alun Armstrong and Shirley Ann Field, two dramas for Centre Play, a showcase for new writers. He joined Granada Television on Coronation Street in 1979 after sending in sample scripts. Whalley also wrote episodes of the student nurses serial Angels in 1980 and 1981, and the rape-trial drama Jury (1983), as well as several other Granada-produced soaps: Albion Market (1985-86), his co-creation, which suffered from being launched shortly after EastEnders, complete with market stalls; Families (1991), with storylines switching between Britain and Australia; and Russell T Davies’s late-night religious serial Revelations (1994). He also created Castles (1995), about three generations of a large London family, produced by Granada for the BBC. Later, Whalley wrote the TV movies Suspicion (2003), starring Amanda Redman and Adrian Dunbar, The Baby War (2003), featuring Gina McKee and Steven Waddington, and The Good Samaritan (2007), with Shane Richie. The first two were thrillers, like both his stage plays, The Maroon Cortina (1984) and Dead of Night (2003), which have been performed at many theatres around Britain, and his 11 works of fiction. In 2009, Whalley won the British Soap Awards special achievement accolade. Five years later, he retired. Throughout his life he loved theatre, rarely missing a production at Manchester’s Royal Exchange, and was a lifelong Burnley football club fan and season-ticket holder, as well as a supporter of Colne cricket club. Whalley’s first marriage, to Ruth (nee Joseph) in 1970, ended in divorce. He is survived by his second wife, Janette (nee Munn), whom he married in 2006, by Matthew and Esther, the children from his first marriage, and by his brother, David. • Peter Whalley, writer, born 12 March 1946; died 26 July 2017"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"business/2017/aug/28/amazon-whole-foods-discounted-produce-day-1","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-28T16:16:46Z","webTitle":"Amazon's tech-style takeover of Whole Foods: cheaper produce and 'farm fresh' Echos","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/aug/28/amazon-whole-foods-discounted-produce-day-1","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2017/aug/28/amazon-whole-foods-discounted-produce-day-1","fields":{"headline":"Amazon's tech-style takeover of Whole Foods: cheaper produce and 'farm fresh' Echos","bodyText":"Amid stands of discounted raspberries and “end of summer” organic peaches, Amazon’s effort to revolutionize the US retail grocery business got under way Monday morning with deep price cuts to some produce at its newly acquired Whole Foods chain. Signs of Amazon’s plans for Whole Foods, purchased for $13.7bn in June with the stated ambition of marrying technology and rapid distribution to the bricks-and-mortar business of food retail – including placing a stand of Amazon Echo devices, discounted from $149.99 to $99.99, next to the organic red seedless grapes. The grapes, in turn, were discounted from $3.99 a pound to $2.49, and large organic California yellow peaches had fallen from $3.49 a pound to $1.49. The placement of Amazon’s artificial intelligence assistant plainly indicated the company’s plan to integrate grocery shopping and delivery into its online and the Amazon smart AI assistant, called Alexa. In addition to the Echo, the Echo Dot was discounted from $49.99 to $44.99. One shopper, who gave her name as Celine, said she was unlikely to purchase peaches and the music-playing Echo at the same time, “unless I’m going to a barbecue”. She said that while she welcomed cheaper prices at the chain often derisively known as “Whole Paycheck”, she was also concerned that Amazon’s entry into the food business could also serve to put smaller retailers out of business, increasing the sense that the Seattle-based tech online shopping behemoth now enjoys monopoly-like power. Last week, Amazon announced plans to begin integrating the two companies. “This is just the beginning – Amazon and Whole Foods Market plan to offer more in-store benefits and lower prices for customers over time as the two companies integrate logistics and point-of-sale and merchandising systems,” Amazon/Whole Foods said. Over time, Amazon plans to integrate its Prime membership program into the Whole Foods checkout process. Amazon will also place its Amazon Lockers package pickup machines in some Whole Foods stores, and make Whole Foods’ private label products available on its website. Jeff Wilke, the CEO of Amazon Worldwide Center, said on Thursday that the company is determined to make healthy and organic food affordable for everyone. “Everybody should be able to eat Whole Foods Market quality,” he said. “We will lower prices without compromising Whole Foods Market’s long-held commitment to the highest standards.” Shoppers in Manhattan – used to paying over the odds for almost everything – welcomed reductions on Whole Trade bananas, Gala and Fuji apples, tomatoes, salads, organic avocados (at two for $3, down from two for $5) and cartons of raspberries (two for $5, down from $4.99 each). At Agata &amp; Valentina, an upscale grocery close to Whole Foods on Manhattan’s Union Square, price cuts had yet to be matched. Bananas were priced at $1.19 a pound, compared to 49¢ (down from 79¢) at Whole Foods. Similar avocados were $3 each, raspberries at $4.99 a box, and Gala apples at $2.29 a pound. Only tomatoes, reduced from $3.99 to $1.49, matched Whole Foods’ aggressive new pricing. Another shopper, who offered her name as Wendy, welcomed the early changes. She said she had purchased 6lb of apples instead of four. “I think they want to make it more Walmart,” she ventured, referring to the nation’s largest food retailer, typically found in suburban locations. Jenna Pairolero said she believed the change in ownership and operations would make “a big difference, probably”. But, she added: “I don’t really pay attention to prices at all, frankly.” Analysts anticipate that Amazon will be able to use its massive buying power and vast supply chain with the infrastructure of Whole Foods’ 460 stores in the US, Canada and the UK to reduce prices purely through logistics. The list of products Amazon said it would immediately discount also include organic large brown eggs, baby kale, baby lettuce, “animal-welfare-rated” 85% lean ground beef, organic “responsibly farmed” salmon and tilapia, creamy and crunchy almond butter, organic rotisserie chicken and house-brand organic butter. Shoppers who had not ventured into the vegetable section said they experienced no difference at the checkout. One customer, Neil, said it was “all about the same” after purchasing pineapple chunks, a bottle of water and a muffin. Whole Foods employees in Manhattan said teams had worked overnight to prepare for the price drops, known as “day one” at the company. Nadia Papasidero said she rarely shopped at Whole Foods. “I’m happy to pay a little more for better quality,” she said, but Whole Foods is “big-time too expensive”. She said that if Whole Foods reduced its prices she would consider making it her “main shop” for groceries. However, Papasidero said she was unlikely to use an AI assistant like Alexa: “I’m Italian, I love food shopping. I need to pick it up and look at it.” She added: “It’s hard to know what to expect.

EEF, the manufacturers’ organisation, said a quarter of the firms it represents had seen job applications from the EU fall and 16% had seen more European workers quit since the 2016 referendum. With a majority relying on EU staff due to a lack of skilled UK applicants, manufacturers warned that uncertainty over recruitment would choke off growth and damage the British economy. The reciprocal rights of EU and UK workers is one of the core questions in the Brexit negotiations, with the prime minister having confirmed that freedom of movement must be limited, despite business fears and cabinet objections. However, the government has indicated it will seek a transitional period following the article 50 deadline of March 2019. A report published by EEF says that while manufacturers are looking to bring in more apprenticeships and training, these can only be long-term solutions, with 11% of staff now coming from the EU and many vacancies attracting no UK applicants. It warned that skills shortages would worsen should post-Brexit restrictions mean a cap on EU staff as well as non-EU staff employed by firms, with three quarters of manufacturers surveyed saying they were already struggling to fill roles. Tim Thomas, EEF director of employment and skills, said: “Preventing industry from being able to recruit the best skilled workers from the EU could stifle growth, damage British industry and the UK economy as a whole. “As a priority the government should clarify the reciprocal rights of EU nationals in the UK and British nationals currently working in other EU member states. Skills shortages are endemic in manufacturing and engineering, and any points-based type system would choke off the skills needed by this sector.” EEF has urged that skilled European workers should have the right to work in the UK for up to five years and then apply for permanent residency, and that EU nationals should continue to be able to come to study in the UK and seek ensuing employment here. The manufacturers also urged that rules be relaxed again to allow non-EU students to stay after graduation for two years to seek skilled employment. The EEF survey follows other warnings of a “brain drain” after Brexit, with a KPMG survey suggesting that almost a million highly skilled EU citizens were planning to leave the UK. The figures showed that the intention to leave was most prevalent among the best qualified and highest paid EU nationals living in the UK, including half of those with postgraduate qualifications. Meanwhile, German industrialists have criticised the UK government’s negotiating stance. “The British government is lacking a clear direction of travel,” said Dieter Kempf, head of the German employers’ association BDI. “In spite of British cabinet members declaring a united front, there is no discernible coordinated line on behalf of the government. “These are poor preconditions for the third round of negotiations. Noteworthy progress can hardly be expected. British proposals for managing customs come with disproportionately high amount of additional bureaucracy. “For businesses these ideas are impractical. The United Kingdom has at last got to deliver unambiguous statements on the modalities of leaving [the European Union].”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/sep/16/gozleme-recipe-turkish-stuffed-flatbread-meera-sodha","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-16T08:30:07Z","webTitle":"Meera Sodha’s recipe for vegan gözleme","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/sep/16/gozleme-recipe-turkish-stuffed-flatbread-meera-sodha","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/sep/16/gozleme-recipe-turkish-stuffed-flatbread-meera-sodha","fields":{"headline":"Meera Sodha’s recipe for vegan gözleme","bodyText":"As a child, I loved watching my mother make chapatis: her hands rhythmically rolling the balls of dough; the click of her wedding ring each time the pin moved under it; the thwack as the dough hit the pan, sending a tiny cloud of blackened flour flying; a tower of hot chapatis quickly forming in the background. Although I can recreate those same chapatis in my own kitchen, I can’t replicate the experience. Which is why I’m so drawn to north London’s Turkish cafes. Unlike kebab houses, which have a distinctly masculine presence, these cafes tend to have a formidable woman in the window. My local is Zena’s domain. Her low stool is like a throne from which she wields a giant wooden spatula, regularly pointed at her husband or son, between fulfilling insatiable orders for her gözleme. Gözleme is a masterpiece in simplicity: a ball of dough and a little filling – potato, spinach and/or, for non-vegans, cheese – come together to form a fresh, hot filled flatbread that’s much greater than the sum of its parts. It doesn’t boast the many flavours and textures of a burrito, and it’s not as quick to make as a sandwich, but it tastes how I want all the food I yearn for to taste: as if handmade with the care and grace of someone’s mother. Courgette and mint gözleme Gözleme is best filled in much the same way as you’d layer a pizza: with just enough filling to make it delicious, but not so much as to make it soggy. If you have leftover filling, don’t be tempted to over-stuff the gözleme; instead, eat it separately. Yellow courgettes look very nice here, but they’re not essential. The dough takes an hour to prove. Ideally, you’d have a flat pan (like a pancake or chapati pan) to cook this on. Serves four. For the dough 300g plain flour 1 tsp (or 5g) fast-action yeast ½ tsp salt 3 tbsp olive oil For the filling 750g courgettes (a mixture of green and yellow, if possible) 3 tbsp olive oil 4 garlic cloves, peeled and very finely chopped ¾ tsp red chilli flakes ¾ tsp salt 1 small handful fresh mint leaves, very finely shredded Put the flour, yeast, salt and oil into a big bowl (ie, large enough for the dough to double in size) and mix together with your hands until it resembles breadcrumbs. Fill a jug with 140ml hand-hot water, then slowly add to the dough, mixing as you go. Knead for five minutes, until you have a soft and springy dough, then cover with clingfilm and leave on the worktop for an hour. Meanwhile, get on with the filling. Cut the courgettes into discs as thick as a £1 coin. Heat the oil in a wide frying pan on a medium heat and, when hot, sizzle the garlic for a couple of minutes. Add the courgettes, chilli and salt, stir to combine, then cook gently for 25 minutes, stirring now and then, until all the liquid has evaporated. Leave to cool, then stir in the mint. When you’re ready to cook the gözleme, cut the dough into four equal pieces. Lightly flour a work surface and roll out one piece into a large oval (around 28cm x 32cm), until nice and thin. Lay courgette coins over the dough in a single layer, making sure they barely overlap, and leaving a 5cm border at the top and bottom and an 8cm gap at the sides. Fold the flaps at the top and bottom over the filling, then fold in the sides to meet in the middle. Repeat with the remaining pieces of dough and filling. Heat a large frying pan and, when hot, carefully lift one gozleme into the pan. Cook for a minute, until it blisters, then flip and cook for another minute. Flip and cook for 30 seconds more on each side, then transfer to a plate or board. Repeat with the remaining gözleme, cut them all into four and serve hot."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"education/2017/aug/28/oxford-university-professor-bo-rothstein-resigns-donald-trump-protest","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-29T11:26:11Z","webTitle":"Oxford University professor quits Blavatnik school in Donald Trump protest","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2017/aug/28/oxford-university-professor-bo-rothstein-resigns-donald-trump-protest","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/education/2017/aug/28/oxford-university-professor-bo-rothstein-resigns-donald-trump-protest","fields":{"headline":"Oxford University professor quits Blavatnik school in Donald Trump protest","bodyText":"A leading political academic has resigned from his Oxford University post after he claimed that one of the university’s main patrons is also one of Donald Trump’s biggest financial backers. Bo Rothstein was a professor of government and public policy at the Blavatnik school of government, named after the Ukrainian-born billionaire Leonard Blavatnik, who gave the university £75m to set up the school. Rothstein said he resigned on Monday after concluding that Blavatnik had given a substantial donation to Trump’s inauguration, which he called “incomprehensible and irresponsible”. Hours after news of the resignation emerged, a spokesman for Blavatnik denied this was the case. He said the oligarch had only donated $1m (£770,000) to Trump’s inauguration committee, which he said was a joint congressional committee that “helps to organise public and private events during the week leading up to the inauguration”. The spokesman added that despite the professor’s resignation “neither Blavatnik nor any of his companies ever made a donation to the Trump presidential campaign”. After Blavatnik’s spokesman released his statement, Rothstein told the Guardian: “The information I based my decision on, which is now verified by a spokesperson for Mr Blavatnik, is that a donation was given to Trump’s inauguration. That is in my book a support to Donald Trump.” In his resignation letter, Rothstein said: “President Trump stands for a system of governing that is completely contrary to what I have come to define as ‘quality of government’.” He said his own research had found that “quality of government” was crucial for improving human wellbeing. The letter added: “As I see it, Donald Trump’s policies are also antithetical to the goal of the Blavatnik school of government, which aims to improve the quality of government and public policymaking worldwide, so that citizens can enjoy more secure and more fulfilled lives.” Oxford University said: “Len Blavatnik did not contribute to Donald Trump’s campaign either before or after the election, although he did make contributions to the campaigns of other Republican candidates.” Rothstein, an expert on political governance and corruption, told the Swedish news site Dagen Nyheter that he had read about Blavatnik’s donations to Trump in the Dallas News. That report details that Blavatnik made donations to Marco Rubio and other unsuccessful Republican candidates but not Trump. The university was heavily criticised for accepting the original donation from Blavatnik. In an open letter published in the Guardian in 2015, a group of academics urged Oxford to “stop selling its reputation and prestige to Putin’s associates”. The signatories accused the university of failing to investigate whether Blavatnik and other oligarchs played any role in what they described as a state-sponsored campaign of harassment against BP in Russia in 2008. Blavatnik was named the UK’s richest man in 2015, with an estimated wealth of more than £17.1bn. He made his fortune through his company Access Industries, which began buying up aluminium and businesses in Russia during the fall of the Soviet Union. He has since expanded into property, film and music, and took control of Warner Music Group for $3.3bn in 2011. He became a US citizen in 1984 and a UK citizen in 2010."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2017/sep/01/how-not-to-be-a-boy-by-robert-webb-review","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-01T08:00:38Z","webTitle":"How Not to Be a Boy by Robert Webb review – the gender conditioning of men","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/sep/01/how-not-to-be-a-boy-by-robert-webb-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2017/sep/01/how-not-to-be-a-boy-by-robert-webb-review","fields":{"headline":"How Not to Be a Boy by Robert Webb review – the gender conditioning of men","bodyText":"The actor and comedian Robert Webb is seven years old when the penny drops about boys and their feelings. He is in his final year at infant school and is known for being quiet. “I wish they were all like you, Robert,” say the mums at birthday parties as the boys run noisily amok, while his mother tells his teachers, “He’s just a bit shy.” At the local golf club where his granddad works as a kitchen steward, Webb finds a bee on the gravel courtyard and, observing its laboured attempts at crawling, realises it is close to death. Rain is on its way so he builds a small circle of tiny stones around it for protection and, with tears in his eyes, leaves it to its fate. “I’m not going to tell anyone about this, not even Nan or [Aunty] Tru or Mum,” he decides. “They would be nice about it, of course, but I know the truth about my bee. I wasn’t supposed to look after it. I was supposed to stamp on it.” In this coming-of-age memoir, Webb, who was born in 1972, tells the story of his upbringing as the youngest son of a working-class woodcutter in the village of Woodhall Spa in Lincolnshire. He also examines, with enormous poignancy and insight, the damage that can be done when young boys are encouraged to behave in ways supposedly befitting their gender. In the late 1970s, certain rules had to be observed for a boy to fit in. These included: not crying, not discussing feelings, not being gay, hating girls, getting into fights, obsessing about sport and, when the occasion demanded it, stamping on bees. None of these things came easily to Webb, who was sensitive, had sticky-out ribs, liked poetry and hated sport. During football lessons he would “welcome the sight of the ball arching towards me in the same way that a quadriplegic nudist covered in jam welcomes the sight of a hornet”. Webb’s early portrait of himself as a hapless underdog navigating the boulder-strewn path of masculinity is vividly drawn and very funny. There are echoes of Adrian Mole in the way he seesaws between priggishness and melancholy (the young Webb also kept a diary). These years are rich in period detail, full of Anaglypta wallpaper, Raleigh bikes, Knight Rider, aniseed balls chain-smoking adults and singalongs to Rod Stewart’s “Sailing” in the car. His life, on paper, is close to idyllic, though, under the surface, anxiety, dread and confusion reside. Webb’s childhood was spent under the shadow of his father, Paul, who was admired in the village for his drinking and philandering, and feared at home for his explosive temper. For Webb and his two brothers, elbows on the tables would be dealt with by being “knocked clean from our chairs”. Once, while watching The Six Million Dollar Man, he recalls being lifted off his seat and thrashed around the legs with his own Woody Woodpecker-embroidered shorts. He never found out why. Eventually Webb’s mother left, taking her sons with her. A year later she married Derek, the “teetotal and mild” owner of an agricultural spare parts company, with whom they found a degree of stability. But at 17, Webb’s life was upended again when his mum was diagnosed with breast cancer and died shortly afterwards. It’s at this point, with his fate in the hands of two emotionally dysfunctional men, that his crisis began in earnest. What had started as self-doubt morphed into severe self-loathing that enveloped his years at Cambridge and his early forays into writing and acting, and manifested itself in arrogance, frequent drunkenness and treating his girlfriends badly. While Webb milks his most atrocious moments for laughs – there’s the time when, talking to his mother on her deathbed, he moans about still being a virgin, while at college he cheats on his girlfriend with two women in one night – he treats the underlying problems that have afflicted him and scores of other men with the utmost seriousness. It’s to his credit that he never loses sight of his privilege as a man, and the cost of that privilege to women. If at times his fear of a feminist roasting is palpable – “feminists aren’t out to get us,” he explains, rather unnecessarily. “They are out to get the patriarchy. They don’t hate men, they hate The Man” – he is clear and convincing in his argument that addressing the gender conditioning of men will improve life for all. It’s with a mixture of bafflement and frustration that he unpicks the semantics of masculinity and femininity, noting how many words “come pre-loaded with a steam tanker of gender manure from the last century”. He asks what it is to “act like a man”, why men struggle to maintain adult friendships and why they are more likely than women to kill themselves. “To put it childishly,” he says, “if you want a vision of masculinity, imagine Dr Frankenstein being constantly bum-raped by his own monster while shouting, “I’m fine, everyone! I’m absolutely fine!” These, then, are the themes that underpin Webb’s memoir, and are the prism through which he views his own life. Caitlin Moran’s How to Be a Woman is referenced here in the title and the cover image, but this is less a righteous manifesto for the modern man than a highly personal story that might just resonate with others and give them confidence to talk, too. “Being male is terrific,” Webb says, “but comes with an extra load of baggage that is worth noticing. Because you might be carrying a load of stuff you don’t need. Stuff which is getting in your own – and other people’s – way.” • How Not to Be a Boy is published by Canongate.

They don’t make flying any less petrifying","bodyText":"I’m writing this 36,000ft above the coast of Albania. My stomach is an icy mass, I want to cry, and an ache that begins in my thighs intensifies down my legs, reaching a soggy apogee in the soles of my feet, where the nerve endings are continuously, painfully primed for landing. I’m on a plane for the fourth time in six weeks, and I’m scared of flying. I know many want to help, so let me start by saying: for me, at least, the statistics don’t make me feel better. It’s the safest form of travel! You’re more likely to be harmed in the taxi on the way there; you’re more likely to die in your own bathtub; you’re more likely to brain yourself on the front doorstep after slipping on a slug. I don’t dispute the facts, although I haven’t checked the bathtub one (I daren’t turn on the wifi). One of my uncles died of the head injuries he incurred slipping on a slug while drunk, and I’ve never known anyone who’s been involved in an air crash, so I’m sold – in terms of both anecdote and data – on the statistical safety of flying. It’s just that it doesn’t stop me wanting to run screaming from the departure lounge. People who fly happily think – not unreasonably – that nothing bad will happen. Those of us who are scared are fixated on the knowledge that it might. There’s an egotism here, a deeply skewed belief that the fact of my existence is so significant that it must irresistibly draw down the most numerically unlikely catastrophe. I’m also convinced that the emotional force of my terror is somehow important. If I stop worrying – if I read, sleep or listen to Kermode and Mayo – we will fall out of the sky. This applies only to me: other people doing it is fine. Landing in New York – the only long-haul flight I have taken in 30 years – I was completely exhausted by the effort of keeping the plane in the air. Oh, as Dr Seuss nearly said, the places I won’t go. Of course, we’re not scared of flying: we’re scared of crashing. There’s nothing irrational about being conscious of your vulnerability when you’re cruising some way above the level of the Hillary Step. It’s a cocktail of some of the most common fears: falling from a great height, enclosed spaces, having no control. It’s also borne of an overactive imagination, of picturing the kind of death it would be, conscious and free-falling. The second worst scenario, for me, involves sliding into uncontrolled panic in front of a baffled audience. On a flight some years ago I saw an elegant young woman roll up her jumper, lay it between her head and the window, and fall asleep before takeoff. This is the kind of traveller I aspire to be, rather than a wet-footed, half-drunk hysteric strung tighter than piano wire. It’s got worse with age. Among people I know, the brotherhood of the nervous expands each year. A friend who makes a living by writing about foreign cities has to go everywhere by boat or train or car. A corporate lawyer cannot avoid flying, but it makes her miserable. Another friend planning the holiday of a lifetime to Canada sympathises: “Oh God, I hate it too.” Perhaps it’s contagious. On this flight, on take-off, a woman two rows in front of me buried her face in her hands while her husband rubbed her arm; I was torn between wanting to offer solidarity, and wanting to ask her to get a grip, because she was adding an extra level of freak to my already considerable freak levels. I settle for doing neither and instead retreat to pretending that Tom Hanks is on my flight. I do this often, because he is the world’s most reassuring presence, and will surely not die on a tourist shuttle from Epirus. Take off is the worst, but descending is also awful, as the engines suddenly get quieter and your duodenum appears in the back of your throat. Stacking is exquisitely nerve-racking, endless rack-twists of ascent and descent. At various points on any given flight I will become convinced that the engines have cut out, before realising that my ears have popped. And like most nervous fliers I watch the cabin crew constantly, so that when one of them runs up the aisle (it almost always turns out to have something to do with paninis) I start levitating. There are upsides, though – all of them to do with being on solid ground. Some of the happiest moments in my life have been spent half-standing, half-crouching in a row of seats while someone closer to the exit than I am takes half an hour to retrieve 14 pairs of skis and a gun carriage from an overhead locker. But through it all, I know, obscurely, that later on tonight I will be at home, falling asleep to the sound of planes overhead. I grew up under the Heathrow flight path and live beneath it still, near the great reservoirs west of London that mark the way home. Each night I’m lulled by the roar of engines above my head and imagine passengers in the low lights of nighttime cabins, heading to Dublin or Dallas, or Delhi or Dubai; business or pleasure, home or away. And somehow I know that they, like me, will – almost certainly – have a safe journey. • Rowan Davies is a digital campaigns and communications consultant"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"books/booksblog/2017/aug/29/dark-chapter-winnie-m-li-review-book-defiant-retelling-personal-trauma","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-29T11:38:32Z","webTitle":"Dark Chapter by Winnie M Li review – a defiant retelling of personal trauma","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2017/aug/29/dark-chapter-winnie-m-li-review-book-defiant-retelling-personal-trauma","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/booksblog/2017/aug/29/dark-chapter-winnie-m-li-review-book-defiant-retelling-personal-trauma","fields":{"headline":"Dark Chapter by Winnie M Li review – a defiant retelling of personal trauma","bodyText":"In 2008, Winnie M Li was raped twice while on a walk through Colin Glen Forest Park in Belfast. Li was 29; her attacker was just 15. He pleaded guilty before the case could go to trial and was jailed for eight years. In her work as a film producer, Li had recently seen one of her projects, Vagabond Shoes shortlisted for an Oscar. Just one day after she was assaulted, she attended the premiere of another, Flashbacks of a Fool starring Daniel Craig. Her bruises were visible through her gown. Li suffered post-traumatic stress, anxiety and depression following the attack, and she was unable to keep up her career. But she didn’t stay silent. She told the Irish Sun: “One of the most damaging things, apart from the crime itself, is keeping it to yourself.” She set up Clear Lines festival, a four-day event with art, music and discussion of sexual assault, that ran in 2015, and wrote her first novel, Dark Chapter. The book closely maps Li’s experience. In spare, direct prose it gives a vivid account of an attack on a Taiwanese-American called Vivian as she walks near Belfast. This is not an easy book to read. The assault is brutal and degrading. Vivian does what she has to do “to survive” and we are made to see and feel it all. The aftermath is also addressed with impressive clarity. First there is the realisation of what has happened: “He said he was 16, and again she wants to vomit. She just had muddy, unasked-for-sex with a 16-year-old.” Then there are the police interviews, medical examinations – “bright fluorescent lights and grey-green walls” – frightening procedures to guard against AIDS and test for infections. There are also months and years coming to terms with what happened, floating, as Li describes it, on the “grey surface” of a lake, wanting to stay inside, hide under the duvet, frightened of the world. In a deviation from Li’s experience, Vivian’s attacker pleads not guilty and a trial follows. This too is a tense, dramatic reading experience. Defence lawyers attempt to humiliate Vivian, question her conduct and undermine her experience. The rage we feel as readers is compounded by the knowledge that this is often what happens in real-life sexual assault cases. The writing feels defiant and urgent – but it’s only half of the book. In a move that’s possibly even braver than recreating her personal trauma, Li attempts to get inside the mind of her rapist, explain his thought processes and explore his emotions. There’s a dual narrative from the point of view of Johnny, a 15-year-old Irish traveller, which runs in parallel with Vivian’s, relating the same events and even trying to explain them sympathetically. Sometimes, this is effective. There is no doubt that Johnny has had a brutal life and the story is full of queasy moments of empathy, for his rage and feeling lost in an indifferent world. However, this narrative strand is also problematic. Li has had to take a considerable imaginative leap to get into the head of this young “pervert” and she doesn’t always clear the distance. His thoughts about his “hard-on” and “beaours” (the Irish slang word he uses to refer to attractive women) don’t always ring true. The attempts at dialect and rendering the speech patterns of the Travellers never flow as easily as those living in Vivian’s privileged world. In her acknowledgements, Li is careful to say that she “does not intend for my novel (inspired as it is by my own lived experience) to portray an entire community nor to malign it”. She also makes sure to show some of the hardships and prejudices Travellers face. Even so, all of the male Travellers we meet in this story are violent criminals, petty thieves and sexual predators. Johnny himself feels like “an evocation of a type of man”, as the blogger Scott Manley-Hadley puts it in a sensitive review on Triumph of the Now. He also feels like a representative of a community, one in which all “the lads” are out to get what they “want” from “tourist girls”. All of Johnny’s male friends and relatives are, at best, complicit in his crime and it’s often implied they are committing similar outrages. It creates the sense that an entire race might be preying on women. Some allowances must be made for the fact that these ideas about sex are relayed through Johnny’s warped mind, and also because Li herself has suffered so much and is retelling her lived experience. Even so, it sometimes feels as if there is a dangerous lack of attention to the presentation of highly sensitive material. There’s no reason to think this unpleasantness is intentional – but it is a misstep in such a didactic book. The overall message remains important and it is generally conveyed with skill and emotional force. But I have reservations.

This is all definitively explained, first by its low price, and second by Nigella Lawson’s keen observation that it had such an uptick on her mood that she called it prozacco. Yet it exacts a price later, when the carbonation, alcohol and sugar – dentistry’s axis of evil – destroy your teeth, variously stripping their enamel, making holes in them and pulling them out of your gums. Dr Mervyn Druian, of the London Centre for Cosmetic Dentistry, warned that women, especially, were putting themselves at risk of a “prosecco smile”, taking the opportunity presented by oral health to underline to the uppity drunk ladies that when you’re not pretty, nobody loves you and then you die, like in a Melanie Martinez song. If I were a young woman, this would only encourage me; but being the bearer of an ex-smoker and Fanta-drinker’s smile, I care about teeth, and proffer six other good reasons to stop drinking it. 1. River Island have a prosecco slogan T-shirt – “I’ll be there in a prosecco” – and they’re not the only ones. Suffice to say that the kind of people who advertise their drink on a T-shirt are the kind you shouldn’t be drinking the same drink as. 2. Even at a tenner a bottle, it is plainly cheaper than champagne, yet the price can go as low as £3.33 a bottle, with no discernible impact on its taste. I’m not a stickler, but this isn’t a wine, this is an alcohol delivery system. That lowest price, by the way, was recorded at Lidl, when they were offering six bottles for 20 quid, generating queues outside the Bristol store that gathered at 6.50am. Two words: Roman Empire. No, wait, three more words: Decline of the. 3. In the olden days, if you wanted to get drunk on bubbles but couldn’t afford champagne, you would drink beer. The more or less wholesale replacement of “fizz” with a “cheaper thing that is also fizzy” has a kind of resigned permanence, as though we’re reconciled to being a nation with less to celebrate and less money to do it with. 4. Prosecco has that inexplicable, unmarketable status as the drink you drink when it would be inappropriate to drink a proper drink, a bit like Pimm’s without the vitamins. You can drink it on a playdate, or at 11am, or anytime you are on a boat, whatever time it is, whatever the destination. But – Newsflash – after a bottle, you are just as pissed as you would have been after a bottle of anything else, which makes you feel weak and unjustly used, like you’ve been mugged by a child. 5. Prosecco hangovers have a particular quality, like having your eyeballs removed and replaced by pear drops. I do not like that. 6. I saw a stag party walking past the pub last night, carrying a pick’n’mix of booze, including prosecco. It caught my eye because, usually, binge drinkers never touch it. This is because of the prosecco-blackout, which is like going to the pub and spiking yourself. Hope this helps. Stay toothsome, ladies."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"film/2017/aug/28/tobe-hooper-obituary","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-28T15:07:42Z","webTitle":"Tobe Hooper obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/aug/28/tobe-hooper-obituary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2017/aug/28/tobe-hooper-obituary","fields":{"headline":"Tobe Hooper obituary","bodyText":"There can be no argument as to The Texas Chain Saw Massacre, the 1974 horror film about a group of teenagers who fall into the clutches of a psychopathic family, being one of the most pervasively disquieting films ever made. Its uniquely rotten, insidious flavour is the result of macabre production design, degraded cinematography, clammy lighting and a sophisticated and abrasive use of sound. Like George A Romero’s Night of the Living Dead and Wes Craven’s The Last House on the Left, the film used horror to express the discontentment of a country reeling from Vietnam and widespread social unrest. Fans included Ridley Scott (“It shocked the hell out of me”), Stanley Kubrick, who bought his own print, and William Friedkin, director of The Exorcist, who said it “transcended the [horror] genre”. Its writer-director, Tobe Hooper, who has died aged 74, was already working on a story about young people in peril when he found himself one weekend in the hardware department of a busy store while trying to locate the exit. “I looked down and there was a rack of chain saws in front of me for sale. I said, ‘if I start the saw, those people would just part. They would get out of my way.’” So was born a movie – and a character, Leatherface, the chain saw-wielding brute wearing a mask of human skin – that would become a benchmark in horror and a thorn in the side of film censors everywhere. Ten local authorities in Britain showed the film with an X rating after the BBFC (British Board of Film Censors, as it was known until 1984) refused to issue a certificate in 1975 on the grounds that the picture exemplified “the pornography of terror”, though when that body finally relented in 1999, it noted that “there is no explicit sexual element in the film, and relatively little visible violence”. Indeed, Hooper’s greatest achievement is to have created an atmosphere of extreme dread and distress chiefly through insinuation. It will be some small compensation for audiences terrified by the film that it was even more hellish to work on than it was to watch. The stench of animal bones and carcasses in the stifling heat caused cast and crew members to throw up. There were accidents and injuries (“Everyone had got a ding on the head or a cut to this or that,” noted Hooper) while the clutch had to be removed from the chain saw itself after an actor fell while operating it. Hooper engineered divisions among his cast to create tension and refused to let them see Leatherface until their first encounter with him on camera. “That was the heaviest set I’ve ever been on,” the director said. “It was miserable really.” Tobe was born in Austin, Texas, the son of Lois (nee Crosby) and Norman Hooper: he claimed his mother went into labour in the cinema. His parents were hotel managers who owned a movie theatre in San Angelo. After studying film at the University of Texas he worked as a documentary cameraman and a college professor. He made his feature debut with Eggshells (1969), a partly improvised psychedelic drama described by Hooper as “a mixture of Andy Warhol’s Trash and Walt Disney’s Fantasia”, and directed The Song Is Love (1970), a documentary about the folk trio Peter, Paul &amp; Mary. Hooper then co-wrote The Texas Chain Saw Massacre with Kim Henkel, who had starred in Eggshells. He remained in the horror genre for Eaten Alive (1976), about a killer who feeds his victims to his pet alligator; a well-regarded TV adaptation of Stephen King’s vampire novel Salem’s Lot (1979), starring James Mason and David Soul; and The Funhouse (1981), in which teenagers hiding out at a carnival overnight are preyed on by a killer. He directed Poltergeist (1982), written by Steven Spielberg, but spent many years defending the work as his own following an LA Times article headlined Poltergeist: Whose Film Is It? in which Spielberg was quoted as saying: “Tobe isn’t what you’d call a take-charge sort of guy. He’s just not a strong presence on a movie set.” Spielberg published an open letter of apology, though this did not lay the matter to rest. Hooper said that Hollywood stopped calling in the wake of the Poltergeist rumours. He turned to the producers Cannon Films to make Lifeforce (1985) and Invaders from Mars (1986), camp science-fiction horror movies from which no one emerged with distinction, as well as The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 (also 1986). For this attempt to continue the story with a rowdier and more satirical tone, Hooper hired LM Kit Carson, co-writer of Paris, Texas, who advised him that they would need to find the right sort of victims. Once again, it was a shopping trip that provided inspiration. “I saw all these yuppies buying piles of things, seven sweaters at a time,” said Carson. “I called Tobe up and said, ‘I’ve found the victims.’” The picture was no match for Cannon Films, which was reportedly more brutal in its cutting even than Leatherface himself. From then on he worked mainly in television directing episodes of Tales from the Crypt and The Equaliser, and a segment of the 1993 portmanteau TV film Body Bags. His final film, Djinn (2013), a horror story set in the United Arab Emirates, attracted scathing reviews. Hooper was married and divorced twice. He is survived by his son, William Tony. • Willard Tobe Hooper, writer and director, born 25 January 1943; died 26 August 2017 • This article was amended on 17 September 2017. Hooper’s first name was Willard, rather than William, and he is survived by one son, William Tony Hooper, not two, William and Tony, as originally stated."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/sep/02/i-turn-down-a-paying-lodger-and-a-stray-cat-were-overcrowded-already","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-02T05:45:06Z","webTitle":"I turn down a paying lodger and a stray cat – we’re overcrowded already","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/sep/02/i-turn-down-a-paying-lodger-and-a-stray-cat-were-overcrowded-already","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/sep/02/i-turn-down-a-paying-lodger-and-a-stray-cat-were-overcrowded-already","fields":{"headline":"I turn down a paying lodger and a stray cat – we’re overcrowded already","bodyText":"Living with five adults, four of them grownup children, means I am rarely on my own. Mysteriously, the only time that nobody is around is when the doorbell rings, so I spend my days running up and down the stairs to open the door to other people’s deliveries. But when I want to use the bathroom, someone is always there. Sharing with a crowd means our fridge, filled on a Friday, is empty by Monday, except for a limp carrot and scrapings of pesto in a mouldy jar. Every room I walk into has music playing. There is never any space for me on the sofa. In the shower, the hot water runs out when I’m in the middle of washing my hair. I dream of the luxury of a bathroom with no one rapping at the door to ask when I’ll be finished. Maybe if I had a shed … But our shed is full of gardening clutter. My bedroom is the only sanctuary, although I share it with Ed and three dogs, and, lacking an office, have to work in there, too. However, as soon as I’m stuck into work I receive constant visits from the kids, none of whom seem to understand the basic code of a closed door. “Look,” I explain. “I know I’m in the house, but that doesn’t mean I’m available. When my door is shut, think of me as being in an office somewhere, totally uncontactable.” “Except,” says Lily, “if there was an emergency, we’d have to contact you.” “Well, yes. If there’s a real emergency, then you can knock.” For a day or two, the plan works. But then Zac needs cash to go to the climbing wall. “That’s an emergency?” “Well, I don’t have the money,” he explains, as if I’m hard of hearing. Megan wants to know if there are any clean towels. She is wet and cross, having not checked the towel situation before she got into the shower. I go back to my laptop, but I’ve forgotten what I was going to say. “I do have deadlines you know,” I yell. “I’m not filing my nails in here.” “I need to ask you something,” Lily says, delivering a cup of tea to my desk. “Do you think Claire could move in, just for a while, until we get a place together?” I almost choke on my first gulp of tea. “Are you mad?” “But she needs to move out of her flat … and she wouldn’t take up much space.” “No.” I shake my head. “Absolutely not. Your bedroom is tiny. And imagine if everyone invited their partners to come and live with us? We’d be a household of 10!” “But we hardly ever see each other. She lives two hours away.” I set my shoulders. “She’d pay rent …” “That’s not the point. Well, it is the point. But more to the point, it’s the overcrowding. I’d never be able to have a shower again.” Meanwhile, a local tom cat has moved in without asking. He sneaks through the cat flap when we are asleep, helps himself to cat biscuits and then leaves a pungent thank you spray. Even if I remove the food, he still persists in visiting us. “It’ll be foxes next,” I tell Ed as I wipe away the traces on the skirting board. “Maybe we should hang a sign: the more the merrier.” “We can’t have another creature in this house.” Ed’s eyes are wide with horror. “Time to get tough.” He goes out and buys a new cat flap – a special one that opens only when it reads the chips in our cat’s necks. That night, I am woken by an odd, repetitive thumping and realise it’s the uninvited tom headbutting the cat flap. Next morning, our kitchen is free of cat pee. Another lodger turned away. It is a satisfying feeling. A few days later, Lily announces that, seeing as her girlfriend can’t live with us, she has arranged to spend every other week at Claire’s until they raise enough cash for a London rent. I tell Ed. “This is major,” I say. “I think it counts as nearly leaving home.” “Great,” he says. “Just try not to send her off with half the contents of our fridge.” Some names have been changed"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"fashion/shortcuts/2017/aug/28/from-hypebeast-to-hypepriest-why-the-church-is-embracing-streetwear","type":"article","sectionId":"fashion","sectionName":"Fashion","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-28T15:30:25Z","webTitle":"From hypebeast to hypepriest: why the church is embracing streetwear","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/shortcuts/2017/aug/28/from-hypebeast-to-hypepriest-why-the-church-is-embracing-streetwear","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/fashion/shortcuts/2017/aug/28/from-hypebeast-to-hypepriest-why-the-church-is-embracing-streetwear","fields":{"headline":"From hypebeast to hypepriest: why the church is embracing streetwear","bodyText":"Think of church merchandise and you will likely think of mugs decorated with stained glass windows or key chains with bible quotes, sold in a dusty gift shop. But things have changed: for the face of “church merch” in 2017, look in the somewhat unexpected direction of Justin Bieber. In recent weeks, the Canadian pop star has been Instagramming photos of his friend and pastor Chad Veach – a man whose look isn’t a million miles from fashion’s creepy “Uncle Terry” Richardson. In one image, both are decked out in the sort of attire Bieber tours in, including a scarf from the recent, much-hyped Louis Vuitton x Supreme collaboration for which streetwear fanatics AKA “hypebeasts” queued for hours. Veach, who was recently dubbed the “hypepriest”, is matching his look in a long-sleeved T-shirt with a checkerboard design on the sleeve – merchandise from LA’s Zoe Church, where Veach preaches and Bieber attends. Other garms from the new collection include white sports socks, emblazoned with “Zoe LA”, and hoodies, all sold at a recent pop-up. Veach isn’t the only streetwear-loving pastor running in Bieber’s crew: there’s LVxSupreme-wearing Carl Lentz of global megachurch Hillsong, and Judah Smith of Seattle’s City Church, who looks more Hunter S Thompson than Uncle T, in his tucked-in graphic shirts. Threads as church merch are nothing new. Jian Deleon, editorial director of streetwear and fashion website highsnobiety.com – and attendee of the Brooklyn chapter of megachurch C3 – remembers the Pepsi-can-inspired T-shirts from the 90s that read “Jesus: the first choice of a pure generation”. And streetwear inspired by religion has also been done; Deleon points to cult streetwear designer Jerry Lorenzo, whose brand Fear of God “is literally inspired by his fear of God” (and is a Bieber favourite). But that Zoe, and others such as Miami-based Vous, whose pastor officiated at Kim Kardashian and Kanye West’s wedding and who had Lorenzo design T-shirts for them in 2015, are turning to streetwear aesthetics is original. “The new wrinkle is that they are doing it in a cool way,” says Deleon. It is a two-pronged bid to cater to their young, hip, savvy congregations, and the communities they serve, as well as promoting “the church in a super organic way”. But jumping on the streetwear bandwagon to promote their message could also be read as a cynical ploy to reach younger generations of churchgoers. “Hypebeasts” used to waiting in line for hours for the latest drop may notice similarities beyond the clothes: “I’ve been to a couple of Hillsong services,” adds Deleon, “and you can’t go there without getting in line, like a club.” While he wouldn’t himself wear “church merch”, he does believe that the modernity of the messaging is a much-needed antidote to the longstanding portrayal of the church on the news and in pop culture; at best “out of touch”, at worst, he mentions the Westboro Baptist Church, known for its hate speech. So does he think that church hoodies that look like they could have come from the latest Palace drop will work? “I don’t think people are getting into church for the merch, I think they are getting into it for the message, and for the pastor,” he says. “And maybe the fact that Justin Bieber goes here.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"world/2017/aug/28/german-nurse-niels-hoegel-suspected-murdering-90-patients","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-28T10:40:28Z","webTitle":"German nurse suspected of murdering at least 90 patients","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/aug/28/german-nurse-niels-hoegel-suspected-murdering-90-patients","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/aug/28/german-nurse-niels-hoegel-suspected-murdering-90-patients","fields":{"headline":"German nurse suspected of murdering at least 90 patients","bodyText":"At least 90 people were killed at the hands of a German nurse who injected patients with cardiovascular medication in order to show off his resuscitation skills, a three-year police investigation has found. Niels Högel, 40, was jailed for life in February 2015 for two murders and several attempted murders of intensive care patients at Delmenhorst hospital in northern Germany. But police have found evidence of another 88 murders after analysing scores of patient files and exhuming more than 130 bodies in Germany, Poland and Turkey, starting during his employment at another hospital and continuing after he was caught in the act by a colleague. Since several of Högel’s patients were cremated, police said the real figure could be higher. “The death toll is unique in the history of the German republic,” said the chief police investigator, Arne Schmidt, adding that Högel had killed randomly and preyed on those in a critical condition. There was “evidence for at least 90 murders, and at least as many [suspected] cases again that can no longer be proven”, he told a press conference, declaring himself “speechless” at the outcome. Police believe that the man whom the Bild newspaper is calling “Germany’s worst serial killer” carried out his first murder in February 2000, when he was still employed at a clinic in Oldenburg in Lower Saxony, close to the Dutch border. After killing at least another 35 patients, he moved in 2002 to a hospital in Delmenhorst near the north-western city of Bremen, where he resumed his grisly practice within a week of starting his new job. Högel would inject patients’ veins with a cardiovascular drug in order to orchestrate medical emergencies that would require him to step in and resuscitate them in the hospital’s intensive care unit. The nurse used five different drugs including ajmaline, sotalol, lidocaine, amiodarone and calcium chloride, police said on Monday. Overdoses can lead to life-threatening cardiac arrhythmia and a drop in blood pressure, causing a rapid decline in an already ill patient. During Högel’s time in Delmenhorst, the number of deaths at the hospital’s intensive unit doubled from about 5% to 10%, though the issue was not raised with authorities. On 22 June 2005, a colleague at Delmenhorst hospital witnessed Högel injecting ajmaline into a patient, who died a day later. However, management decided not to call the police or raise the issue with their employee directly until two days later, allowing the nurse to kill another patient, his last, at 7pm on 24 June. Six employees of the Delmenhorst clinic have been charged with manslaughter through failure to render assistance, while an investigation into neglect at the Oldenburg hospital is continuing. “The murders could have been prevented,” said Oldenburg’s head of police, Johann Kühme. He added that those in charge could have acted faster to stop further loss of life. Instead, the nurse was given a spotless report that allowed him to continue his killing spree at another institution. “People at the clinic in Oldenburg knew of the abnormalities.” When Högel was sentenced in 2008 to seven and a half years in prison for attempted murder, a woman who had followed the case in the media contacted police with suspicions that her mother could have also fallen victim to him. The case was brought back to court, and in January 2015 Högel confessed to administering 90 unauthorised injections, of which 30 had been fatal because he had been unable to resuscitate the patients. At the time, he said he felt “fully responsible” for the 30 deaths but denied any further killings. Konstantin Karyofilis, a psychiatrist, said last year that Högel was aware he had caused many people, including his patients and their families, “huge damage, suffering and anxiety”. He said the former nurse wanted it to be known that he was not “basking in the limelight” of his case. “This is not so. He is deeply ashamed,” he told the court. As the extent of the nurse’s crimes has emerged, there have been calls for tighter controls on the use of drugs at clinics. The Högel case is the most extreme and bleakest of a number of similar instances that have shaken Germany’s healthcare system in recent decades. In 2006, a male nurse was sentenced to life for the murder of 29 patients at a hospital in Sonthofen, Bavaria. In 2007, a nurse was sentenced for the murder of five of her patients at Charité hospital in Berlin. Otto Dapunt, a former head of heart surgery at the Oldenburg clinic who worked with Högel for almost three years, told the court last year that the nurse had participated with an “above average regularity” in cases where resuscitation was necessary. He said that while he had never considered this to be suspicious – particularly as the nurse was regularly on call and often had to deal with serious cases – he had often found Högel to be “overly zealous” in wanting to take care of the more critical patients. He was also often unusually moved by the deaths of his patients, Dapunt said, recalling one occasion when the accused took two patients who had died to the morgue and returned in a “completely distraught state”. “But he was factually competent, perhaps more competent than others,” Dapunt told the court. Though Högel has already been sentenced to life in prison, the latest police findings mean it is likely he will face court again, with charges expected to be filed by spring next year."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/aug/29/turkeys-12000-year-old-hasankeyf-citadel-faces-obliteration","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-29T11:01:28Z","webTitle":"Turkey's 12,000-year-old Hasankeyf settlement faces obliteration","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/aug/29/turkeys-12000-year-old-hasankeyf-citadel-faces-obliteration","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/aug/29/turkeys-12000-year-old-hasankeyf-citadel-faces-obliteration","fields":{"headline":"Turkey's 12,000-year-old Hasankeyf settlement faces obliteration","bodyText":"The destruction of Turkey’s 12,000-year-old Hasankeyf settlement and ancient citadel has moved a step closer as authorities have begun to collapse cliff faces around the ruins of the citadel. The move, linked to the construction of a highly controversial dam about 50 miles downstream, is also expected to damage the rich ecosystem of the Tigris river basin. Local authorities have announced that the rocks were broken off “for safety reasons” and that 210 caves – a fraction of thousands of manmade caves in the area – would be filled before the town’s inundation in order to prevent erosion. The Ilisu dam, part of the Southeast Anatolian project (Gap) and one of Turkey’s largest hydroelectric projects to date, has been mired in controversy ever since it was first drafted in 1954. The dam will raise the level of the Tigris at Hasankeyf by 60m, submerging 80% of the ancient city and numerous surrounding villages, including more than 300 historical sites that have still not been explored. Environmental engineer Ercan Ayboga of the Initiative to Keep Hasankeyf Alive warns that close to 80,000 people will be displaced. Many of them will lose their land and their livelihoods. Because of additional debts taken up to purchase new homes, thousands face impoverishment. Germany, Austria and Switzerland withdrew financial support for the Ilisu dam in July 2009, citing concerns about the social, cultural and environmental impact. The Turkish government, arguing that the dam will help produce much needed energy and irrigation, has secured domestic financing of the €1.1bn (£1.02bn) project and is pushing ahead despite a pending court decision at the European court of human rights. The Ilisu dam has a life expectancy of less than 100 years, but the destruction of the fragile natural environment will be irreversible. “The Tigris river basin is one of the last areas where a river runs freely in Turkey without having been dammed,” Ayboga says. “The dam will completely destroy the river banks. The microclimate will change due to the dam, a phenomenon we have already seen after the dams on the Euphrates. The biodiversity will suffer; the rich variety of plant and animal life will be severely diminished.” Numerous vulnerable and endangered species are threatened by the construction of the dam, including the Euphrates softshell turtle, the red‐wattled lapwing, and many other rare birds, bats and mammals. While the environmental impact on Turkey will be severe, the effect on neighbouring Iraq is expected to be catastrophic. Toon Bijnens, international coordinator for the Save the Tigris and Iraqi Marshes Campaign in Sulaymaniyah, said downstream water levels are expected to decrease by 40%: “This means that the water quality of the Tigris will worsen. There will be increased salt water intrusion, making the water unfit for drinking or irrigation.” Ilisu, once operational, will also be detrimental to the Mesopotamian marshes, a wetland area in southern Iraq declared a Unesco world heritage site in 2016. “The dam will dry up a considerate part of the marshes,” Bijnens said. The marshes were drained by Saddam Hussein in the 1990s and the community of the Marsh Arabs has only recently returned to their land. Their livelihoods are now again endangered by the Turkish dam. An official source from the Turkish ministry for Forests and Water Works told the Guardian that “all dammed up water is sent downstream via the turbines”. Because Ilisu was a hydroelectric dam, there would be no decrease of water levels. “The importance of reservoirs as a safe water source in the fight against global warming and drought has increased,” the source said. “For that reason the Ilisu dam has to be seen as an advantage for Iraq, not a threat.” However, Ankara has not yet ratified the 1997 UN Watercourses Convention, a treaty that seeks to establish a law for governing freshwater resources shared across international borders that entered into force in 2014. Since no formal agreement was signed, the sovereignty over how much water is released downstream rests with Turkey, Bijnens warned. Ayboga stressed that despite the controversies surrounding the construction of the Ilisu dam, all protests and public meetings were banned under the current state of emergency, declared just over a year ago. “There has always been a serious lack of transparency and accountability,” he said. “But now the Turkish government uses the conflict in the region and the state of emergency to speed up the project and to silence all opposition. Many locals are scared to protest now.” Ayboga added that it was very difficult for journalists, both local and international, to access the area. “This makes it easier for the government to push ahead with extremely controversial measures,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/live/2017/aug/28/transfer-liveblog-mbappe-diego-costa-oxlade-chamberlain-and-more-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-28T16:36:26Z","webTitle":"Transfer liveblog: Oxlade-Chamberlain to Chelsea, Keïta has Liverpool medical – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2017/aug/28/transfer-liveblog-mbappe-diego-costa-oxlade-chamberlain-and-more-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/live/2017/aug/28/transfer-liveblog-mbappe-diego-costa-oxlade-chamberlain-and-more-live","fields":{"headline":"Transfer liveblog: Oxlade-Chamberlain to Chelsea, Keïta has Liverpool medical – as it happened","bodyText":"We began by admiring the public-spiritedness of Barry Glendenning and Jonathan Wilson; we finished with some fairly meaty football stories. It’s a broad church. So here’s a roundup of the day’s most important news: Liverpool have agreed a deal to sign Naby Keita from RB Leipzig next summer. Arsenal have accepted a bid from Chelsea for Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain. Ousmane Dembele has been unveiled at Barcelona. Kylian Mbappe is probably going to PSG on loan – and Stevan Jovetic appears to have nicked his Monaco squad number. Borussia Dortmund have signed Andriy Yarmolenko from Dynamo Kyiv. There will be much more of this tomorrow, brought to you by the fair hand of Nick Miller. I’ll be back on Wednesday; in the meantime thanks a lot for all your tweets, emails and remarks – it’s been a hoot. If we’re wondering why Oxlade-Chamberlain wants to leave Arsenal, perhaps one reason is that he doesn’t want to suffer the same fate as his fellow Southampton alumnus Theo Walcott. Walcott will be 29 this season; if one person can tell me he’s achieved what he should have, I’d like to hear from them. It’s downhill from now – that’s the sad truth – and he should have left Arsenal two or three years ago to become a leading man elsewhere. I think he’s been too comfortable. Oxlade-Chamberlain is 24. He has a number more strings to his bow than Walcott, admittedly, but probably still has to make this move in order to avoid becoming him. Cech and Gallas both did/have done OK since moving but the trend is undeniable, yes. The last player to move from Arsenal to Chelsea, by the way? Their much-loved former left-back, Ashley Cole ... Is he destined to be a utility man for the rest of his career, then? They do need to get a few “in the building” now. Chelsea have kick-started a frantic scramble for reinforcements in the final week of the summer transfer window by agreeing a fee with Arsenal for Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, with the player potentially the first of three England internationals destined for Stamford Bridge before Thursday’s cut-off. Oxlade-Chamberlain, who has entered the final 12 months of his contract at the north London club, had been offered new and improved terms to commit his future to the club, but made clear towards the end of last week that his preference was to seek a new challenge elsewhere. Arsenal are not prepared to lose Oxlade-Chamberlain, Mesut Ozil and Alexis Sanchez under freedom of contract next summer and, given the lack of suitors for the German and the hierarchy’s intransigence over the prospect of selling Sanchez this summer, that always left the Englishman as the likeliest to depart. Liverpool had also been interested in Oxlade-Chamberlain, who had been secured from Southampton back in 2011, but the 24-year-old’s preference was always to remain in the capital. Personal terms are unlikely to prove an issue, with Antonio Conte hoping a versatile player will challenge Victor Moses at right wing-back and bolster his midfield options with a Champions League campaign ahead. A fee of around £35m had been mooted for his signature. Oxlade-Chamberlain could yet be joined at Stamford Bridge by Leicester City’s Danny Drinkwater, with talks ongoing between the clubs over his switch to the Premier League champions. There is interest, too, in Ross Barkley at Everton – the attacking midfielder is currently in rehabilitation from a torn hamstring, and will not be available until the new year – while Swansea City are braced for a bid for the Spain forward, Fernando Llorente. Chelsea’s young forward Jeremie Boga has signed a new three-year contract and become the 28th player to be loaned out by the club this summer, joining Birmingham City in the Championship for the remainder of the season. Where do you see Oxlade-Chamberlain slotting in then, Chelsea types? Will he get the gig he wants in the middle? Can he perhaps be the mixture of Fabregas and Kante that Conte craves? Matt Loten writes: “Does the loan of Jeremie Boga to Birmingham - who, let’s not forget, were only the 19th best team in the Championship last season - lend further weight to the argument that Antonio Conte’s starting lineup on the opening day was indeed a pointed message to the board? Though of course Boga was unlucky that Cahill’s red card effectively ended his game against Burnley, if he has only been deemed worthy of a Championship loan it would suggest that Conte wasn’t exactly expecting to utilise him regularly this season.” Possibly, although for me it just makes yet further mockery of the idea that Chelsea don’t have enough players. Via our man Dominic Fifield, we can confirm that news about Oxlade-Chamberlain – more to come ... Kevin Wimmer has passed his medical at Stoke, so goes the latest news. And Birmingham have signed Chelsea midfielder Jeremie Boga on loan – some meat on the bones for ‘Arry there. Thing is, Arsenal are going to have to bring some players in now aren’t they? I don’t think for one moment that Oxlade-Chamberlain is indispensable. I don’t think Mustafi, should that Inter rumour be right, is either. But I’d have thought the players they could have done with moving on more are yer Calum Chamberses and yer Joel Campbells (yep, he’s still there). It strikes me that they are in a bit of a mess unless some drastic surgery is made this week – and will even that be enough? I do wonder how much good it does to create these slightly fawning personas around players before they’ve ever actually done anything. “The Ox”. Maybe someone will relieve Arsenal of “The Jeff” (that’s Jeffrey Reine-Adelaide, to prove my point) as well. Now how about this: Sky say Chelsea have agreed a fee with Arsenal for Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain. Presumably they turned a blind eye to yesterday’s dialled-in performance at Anfield. But it’s been clear enough that “The Ox” is probably off and it looks as if he’s making a move to the other side of London! Any thoughts? Here’s some fresh fun for you: Football Weekly! Messrs Rushden, Glendenning, Wilson and MacInnes chew the fat. Hopefully there’ll be some extra light shed on that Boris Bike incident too: Why won’t Charlie Nicholas take his jacket off? Just under an hour til I leave you. It’s been a slightly more eventful day than expected so far, no? Not too late to get your observations in. Sean Doyle suggests: “I think it’s pretty clear Liverpool have plenty of spare cash. The Keita transfer is hardly dependent on money raised from a Coutinho transfer. Seems to me that the move for Keita is move pre-empting Can’s possible departure.” Well that would be a shame if you’re right, Sean, as Can is getting better and better. He’s just 23, only a year older than Keita, and I think people forget that. Against Arsenal yesterday he was sensational, even if the opposition weren’t up to anything. Here’s an agency take on Ousmane Dembele’s unveiling at Barcelona today. I think we have more coming on this later: Not a big one really, or not an unexpected one anyway. De Jong spent last season on loan at PSV but returns to his first club. He only made 26 appearances for Newcastle after arriving in 2014, scoring twice. Bad luck with injuries is a reason for that, to be fair. This is an interesting point from Tony Barr: “I see the Keita deal as Liverpool planning ahead for when they sell Coutinho next summer. Much has been made of their early form without Lil’ Phil, to use his rapper name, but given Liverpool’s schedule it makes no sense to cave to Barca this late in the window. “I can’t blame him for having his head turned either, but hope he stays mature enough to play for his dream transfer next summer. I think he’ll actually benefit from not being regarded as the silver bullet by his team-mates now they know they can do it without him. The question is, what if both he and Keita have terrible seasons and Barca haven’t committed? Perhaps Liverpool also hope to seal a pre-purchase agreement with the Catalans.” Good questions here. Is it a case of one for the other though? I have Keita down as more of a dynamo who speeds things up between the boxes, albeit he’s certainly creative too. James Gerard on Seri: “Shaun Wilkinson is right that I can’t just refuse to go to work because it won’t be fun. But I can take up an offer from another employer, which is what Seri wants to do, as long as I serve a notice period. Footballers do have a strange employment status.” “To be clear, is the Keita-to-Liverpool a buy-and-loan-back, or a “we’ll buy him later but don’t sell him to anyone else”? How does this stuff work? You know, in like a few words, because why should you have to spend all afternoon with that question?” writes Drew Gough. Don’t worry Drew, I’ve been here six and a half hours already so what’s another minute to answer this. I don’t know how all the legal stuff works but broadly it’s the second thing you say – they’ve done a deal to do the deal, if you like, and I can’t see that anybody will be able to disrupt it now. We were talking a lot about Monaco this morning, weren’t we? Here’s why they think they can win the title despite all those departures: You have an excellent memory. Don’t forget that our incredibly nifty Transfer Window interactive tool helps you track all of the spending in Europe’s major leagues: From Shaun Wilkinson: “‘I did not play for Nice this weekend because football should be about joy and I did not feel this.’ Do you think the rest of us can try that one? ‘Sorry, I am not bothering to turn up to work tomorrow. I know you pay to do so, but I do not feel the joy.’ Footballers ... ” I’m about to nip downstairs for a coffee but before I do, here are some quotes from the Nice midfielder Jean-Michael Seri – who had believed he was about to sign for Barcelona last week, but didn’t and is now absolutely seething: “Nice did not deliver on their promises, I’m very hurt. I’m not going to lie - I feel awful. I did not play for Nice this weekend because football should be about joy and I did not feel this. My dream of joining Barcelona has been broken and this is terrible for me. “From what I understand, the deal did not go through because of financial reasons and that makes me very sad. I was stunned to hear negotiations had broken down after my talk with Barcelona officials the previous evening, I was shattered. It was incomprehensible to me so the next day I went to the offices at Nice and I exploded with anger, honestly, the walls were trembling! “The leaders of my club could not tell me anything, they could not even look me in the eye. I played against Napoli out of loyalty to my team-mates, this was not their fault but honestly I don’t know what will happen now.” Those quotes are courtesy of El Mundo Deportivo. Not a happy chap, is he? Tim Woods writes: “I have nothing much to add on Naby Keita, having never seen him play (although will address that this year), but I have been to Guinea. It’s a very beautiful country, and most people seem to support Barcelona or Real Madrid. Not great for vegetarians.” Imagine there’ll be a few more Liverpool shirts on the streets of Conakry soon. They could always use their old Titi Camara ones, I guess .... I like this question. But I can’t answer it. Here is a full take from Andy Hunter on that Keita deal – and Liverpool’s Lemar interest: Another curveball imminent – remember Ravel Morrison? He’s being linked with a move to Atlas FC in Mexico! He is still on Lazio’s books but has no future there, and nothing appeared to come of interest from Birmingham during the summer. It’d be quite a step for him ... Just on that Stuart James post – you saw that, right? Renato Sanches? Possibly to Swansea? It does give them time to replace him, although they could perhaps have done that two month ago. Most likely they just want another year of a top-class player – so they’d better hope he is focused. Swansea are hoping to complete two, possibly three, signings before the transfer window closes, with a chunk of the Gylfi Sigurdsson money still available to spend. A move for Nacer Chadli is not out of the question despite Swansea cooling their interest, although West Bromwich Albion would have to lower their £25m asking price for a player who is unable to get into their team and not on the best of terms with Tony Pulis, the head coach, after a fall-out during pre-season. A deal remains in place for Wilfried Bony should Swansea wish to press the button and re-sign the Ivorian from Manchester City. Swansea, though, have other irons in the fire to cover both Bony’s and Chadli’s positions and are also looking at strengthening defensively. One of the more unlikely moves of the summer would see Renato Sanches, the Portugal international, swap Bayern Munich for Swansea – the bookmakers have made the Welsh club second favourites to sign the talented 19-year-old. Paul Clement, Swansea’s head coach, retains strong links with Bayern Munich, where he previously worked as Carlo Ancelotti’s No2, and has spoken in the past about trying to use his contacts across Europe. Yet the only way a deal for Sanches to Swansea has any chance of coming off is if all parties agree to a season-long loan and there are no better offers on the table for the player from higher-profile clubs (the word on Merseyside is that Liverpool are not, as things stand, interested in signing Sanches, despite speculation to the contrary). Swansea’s transfer business over the last few days will also be influenced to some extent by Fernando Llorente’s future. Chelsea’s interest in Llorente is genuine and long-running, although it is understood that Swansea have not received an official offer for the Spaniard this summer. Llorente would be very much an Antonio Conte signing, rather than a Chelsea signing, and no more than a back-up player at Stamford Bridge. There are also doubts within Chelsea as to whether Llorente would fit into the club’s style of play and questions over the merits of signing someone who is aged 32. Conte, though, has worked with Llorente before, at Juventus, and clearly feels that a striker who scored 15 Premier League goals for Swansea last season could be a useful squad player at Chelsea. Clement reiterated on Saturday, after Swansea’s win over Crystal Palace, that he is confident of keeping Llorente, but he also said that “all of a sudden something can come out of absolutely nowhere”. I’ve just received a fascinating dispatch from Stuart James about Swansea’s potential dealings, with one particularly eye-catching name in there. I’ll put it up in a minute ... Interested in Liverpool fans’ – and Leipzig fans’ – views on this. Is Keita worth the wait? Will a drawn-out goodbye in Saxony suit anybody? One thing I think is true having watched him a fair bit: he’s a heck of a player. Liverpool have agreed a deal to sign Naby Keita from Red Bull Leipzig next summer and are interested in signing Thomas Lemar from Monaco before this week’s transfer window closes on Thursday. Keita, Jurgen Klopp’s prime midfield target for this summer, has undergone a medical in England today ahead of finalising the terms of a transfer that will see Liverpool pay a premium on his £48m release clause. That clause only comes into effect at the end of this season and Leipzig have refused to consider selling the midfielder in this window. Klopp is also an admirer of Lemar, although Liverpool have yet to make a bid for the 21-year-old. Arsenal have been long-term admirers of the France international but have been told Monaco will not sell this summer. That may also apply to Liverpool’s interest but the Anfield club are expected to test Monaco’s resolve with a club record offer of around £60m in the coming days. Well, well, well ... I said in my write-up of Arsenal’s Community Shield draw with Chelsea that they looked underdone, particularly in defence, and it caused a bit of upset below the line but can anyone really argue now? Ozgur Celtikci is back with a rather more informed take on reported West Brom target Josef de Souza: “I’m sure Mr Pulis is keen on a defender but Josef de Souza is a central midfield enforcer who has played as a right-back for only a handful of games in his native Brazil. I have not seen him play as a defender for Fenerbahce or Porto in a total of four-and-a-half seasons spent in Portugal and Turkey. “Fener ex-manager Dick Advocaat didn’t even give him a chance as a stand-in centre-back when both Skrtel and Kjær were injured last season - his partner in the pivot, Mehmet Topal, got the nod instead. So, I don’t really get how he would fit in as a defender in that Albion squad. If they think of him as a potential Evans replacement, they need to have a big big look at their scouting team.” Cheerio, Barry. The man has more good deeds to do. This Mustafi thing then ... there’s a rumour going around on Twitter that he may be heading to Inter Milan on loan. Odd one if it happens, no? Or perhaps not – I quite like Mustafi but is he really the dominant defender Arsenal need? If they can get a replacement in I think it’d be good business. But they’ve sold Gabriel too ... Thats’s all from me, folks. I will hand you back over to Nick Ames, who has an interesting update on the future of Arsenal defender Shkodran Mustafi. Benedikt Höwedes to Juventus? Schalke have confirmed that Juventus have made an approach to sign the World Cup-winning defender, but they have turned down the bid. Howedes wants to leave the Bundesliga club, where he is surplus to requirements after 16 years on their books, to get regular first team football and keep his hopes of representing Germany in the next World Cup alive. Schalke want to sell him and value the player at €18m, but so far Juventus have only offered to take him on loan. Höwedes has also been linked with a move to Liverpool. Done deal klaxon! Pictures are circulating in cyberspace of Andriy Yarmolenko posing with a Borussia Dortmund shirt. The 25-year-old winger has been linked with the German side for years, but has finally signed from Dynamo Kyiv. €25m was the fee being bandied about as news that a deal was close circulated earlier today. It’s international break time II It being international break time with the transfer window closing, expect no shortage of unsettled and disgruntled Premier League players to give local, sympathetic journalists in their own countries revealing interviews in which they voice their dissatisfaction with life ... before coming home to discover their comments have been picked up by the British press and subsequently claim they either (a) said no such thing or (b) have been hideously quoted out of context. It’s international break time: It’s difficult to know exactly how this will affect the logistics of getting last-minute transfers over the line, with players scattered around Europe and beyond with medicals need to be undertaken and contracts inked. For example, Scotland travel to Lithuania this week, England go to Malta and Northern Ireland will be in San Marino, with all three teams set to play on Friday, the day after the window closes. Wilson speaks: On the episode of Football Weekly we recorded earlier - spoiler alert! - Jonathan Wilson said it is his opinion that Chelsea will sign three new players before the transfer window closes: Danny Drinkwater, Fernando Llorente and one other. He also suggested that Tottenham HOtspur or some other Premier League side should make a cheeky £35m bid for Paris Saint-Germain winger Angel Di Maria. I am reasonably confident, as it was a woman, although she may well have been on her way to sign for one of London’s many Women’s Premier League teams. QPR Women would probably be the nearest to Guardian Towers - Loftus Road is a 44-minute cycle away, according to Google Maps, although our new friend could probably get there more quickly due to reduced traffic congestion on this Bank Holiday Monday. More on Juan Foyth: Anyone looking for more information on Tottenham Hotspur’s new signing, Juan Foyth, could do worse than take a few minutes to read this scouting report on Bleacher Report. “Without wanting to place too lazy a comparison on his shoulders—Foyth is Foyth, his own man, after all—he resembles the Argentinian version of John Stones,” says the report, before going on to praise the teenager’s poise and bravery on the ball, as well as his willingness to get involved in physical battles. Of course, perhaps the most ringing endorsement of all is that his new manager, a fairly decent and uncompromising Argentinian centre-half himself, rates him highly enough to take him to Spurs. Countdown to deadline day: For anyone wondering - and I suspect most of you wonder about little else - exactly how long it is until the transfer window slams shut: three days, nine hours and 42 minutes. Good day to everyone. Barry Glendenning here, fresh from recording today’s Football Weekly podcast, which will be available for your aural pleasure in a few hours ... and may also contain the full low-down on how exactly myself and Jonathan Wilson helped a young German tourist to successfully rent a Boris bike, despite neither of us having ever hired or cycled one before. I’ll be here to answer your transfer bike hire-related queries while Nick Ames finds a dark corner and has a lie-down for an hour. With that, I’m going for some lunch and will leave you with Barry Glendenning, one of our Good Samaritans from this morning, for the next little while. If you’re lucky he might tell you exactly how he and Wilson helped the confused party into the saddle. Done deal? Maybe! Are Tottenham getting their act together as demanded by Chris Brown? Sky’s yellow ticker has whirred into action with tidings that they’ve agreed a deal with Estudiantes for defender Juan Foyth. He is a 19-year-old centre-back so presumably “one for the future”. Anyone know anything more? Tony Pulis would like to sign another defender. Apparently he’s keen on bringing Fenerbahce’s Josef de Souza to West Brom. De Souza has three caps for Brazil! A big ask but you’d expect they’ll get several done. Pochettino’s biggest problem has been signing the right squad players. He’s not managed it yet. Been linked with a move to the Riverside, apparently. All jokes aside, get well soon. ‘Arry Redknapp’s down to the bare bones at Birmingham – but can he get a deal for Torino’s highly-rated midfielder Afriyie Acquah over the line at last? Talks have been dragging on, but the deal does not appear to be dead ... One deal that could go through today: Tottenham’s Kevin Wimmer is expected to sign for Stoke any time soon. Stoke will have a lot of centre-backs. If you like graphs, this tells a lot about the transfer madness that has enveloped us: Michael Hunt wonders whether someone else should have taken a serious look at Mbappe: “Now we’re established that Mbappe is worth every penny (in providing an excuse for Hanson soundtracks to football highlights if nothing else), is there any reason anyone can think of why Barca aren’t lobbing good money his way? They need to score PR points as much as anything against both PSG and Real and this would represent both. Too similar a prospect to Dembele as a speedy French kid with one good season and a terrifying price tag? Maybe, but the two of them are a slightly intimidating prospect to add to the Messi and Suarez axis.” Sky say Tottenham are closing in on their move for Serge Aurier, and are also looking for another forward. Why are they leaving this so late? It is costing them, as their early results surely prove. Will Newcastle land Rafa’s targets in this window? A few reports going around suggesting they’re in for Maccabi Tel Aviv striker Viðar Kjartansson, the Iceland international. He has a good domestic goalscoring record in five different countries but just the one for his national team. Meanwhile, in Scotland ... Ozgur Celtikci is back with some thoughts on Diego Costa: “Is it just me who feels a team in the mould of Zenit, Besiktas or Fenerbahce (aka ‘lavishly-spending little-achieving eastern powerhouses’) might pick him up on a season-long loan on the very last day of the transfer window for a hefty amount? Apparently, he’s yearning for a permanent move to Atlético but that is clearly not happening and we’ve seen stranger things happen before.” Or could China be back in the mix? A couple of you wanting more information on the nature of the assistance granted by Messrs Wilson and Glendenning to the puzzled would-be cyclist at 11.38. As far as I could tell Glendenning was the more proactive of the pair, offering advice on how to work the machine, while Wilson took on a more pastoral role with some hand movements and some studied examination of the bikes themselves. Enough to keep FdB in work? Now this is interesting, and also involves PSG – a report suggests Leicester would like to bring in Grzegorz Krychowiak to replace the possibly Chelsea-bound Danny Drinkwater. Never say this isn’t a circus! “Does Jay Rodriguez count as under-the-radar?” asks David Wall. “He’s an international player, bought for a pretty low fee, and who was doing excellently at Southampton before his injury problems. Wasn’t he being considered by the likes of Arsenal and Liverpool, and for more than West Brom paid this summer, a couple of years ago?” Yep, decent one. I think Rodriguez needed a move. Whether he will be able to express himself enough at West Brom – he’s decent technically – will be borne out with the passage of time but he also has good physical attributes and a willingness to play all across the front line. Put his head in there well for that goal yesterday, too. Something more for you transfer sleuths: Mbappe’s Twitter bio no longer mentions Monaco – even if his picture does. This is what we have all become. In this Twitter thread lies some uproarious trolling from PSG, in “conversation” with their own player Thomas Meunier. There’s some news involving the letter “M”, it transpires ... but what can it be? Turns out they were trailing the 35th birthday of Thiago Motta. M is for Motta. Not Mbappe. Larks! Another thing we will all enjoy later today, of course, is the new edition of Football Weekly. I’ve just spent five minutes watching from the second floor window at Kings Place as Barry Glendenning and Jonathan Wilson, two of this morning’s podders, chivalrously helped a young woman in her attempt to rent one of the Boris Bikes/Sadiq Cycles lined up outside the building. She succeeded, thanks in no small part to the assistance of our dynamic duo. It would have all made for a perfect short silent movie. Ozgur Celtikci writes from Turkey and, among other things, alludes to the fact that this apparently stripped-back Monaco side beat Marseille 6-1 yesterday ... “I think Monaco are exactly doing what a team their size with their fanbase (!) should do. They’ve sold Bernardo, Mendy, Bakayoko, Germain and are about to sell Mbappe and Lemar but they’ve recruited excellently with Tielemans, Diakhaby, Kongolo and Ghezzal (Rachid Ghezzal on a free from Lyon is beyond a steal) and Rony Lopes, Adama Diakhaby, Carillo and Sidibé are probably next in line to be paid multi-millons by Premier League giants in a season or two. “Their all-around team performance against Olympique de Marseille in yesterday’s thrashing demonstrates that they will be up for the challenge this season as well. Selling assets for around £200-250 and replacing them for roughly £100m makes brilliant sense financially, too.” I can understand that school of thought – especially if you believe the transfer market bubble will burst, or the system itself not exist as we know it, within five years. Nothing to see here. And a reminder that, with the international break now upon us, many of the more likely movers this week will be with their national teams. Cue last-ditch private jets from various camps across the continent. Good call – a manager there who should get the best out of him too. Bristol City have signed exciting West Brom forward Jonathan Leko on loan for the season. He’s an excellent prospect – it’ll be interesting to see how things work out for him in the Championship. Might Barkley end up at Chelsea before August is done? I think Wilshere might be up for grabs too – although how Arsenal need a purposeful midfielder – but, as with many of their fringe players, his wages might be a problem for most of his suitors. Arsenal are lumbered with a lot of players they don’t especially want at the moment, but you make your bed. David Wall is back with a reply to those replies: “Just to clarify, I certainly agree with people who say that Mbappe, and friends have lots of ability, you can see that by watching a couple of matches. And I accept that the fee for Neymar has demolished any sense of proportion that still existed in the transfer market. But for Mbappe in particular, the figure being suggested is the second highest fee in history, for a teenager who has had one, albeit very good, season at the top level. And what he showed was that he is very quick, has good control, and finishes well. “In contrast (again, admittedly in deals done before Neymar’s move), Lukaku went for half that figure, and Lacazette for a third of it, yet both have shown consistency over a number of seasons, and in both cases the selling club were thought to have done well out of the deals. Monaco players seem to have taken on the role of the latest ingredient featured on a new series by Delia Smith or Nigella Lawson, they’re the next thing after avocados, and cranberries - they may be good, but they’re not that-price-good.” He is only 18 so it might not help just yet but I’d have thought Arsenal will be well aware of Nice’s Malang Sarr, who has a big future ahead of him. A question from Shaun Wilkinson: “Who do you think has been the best under-the-radar signing so far in this transfer window? Mikel Merino at Newcastle looks incredibly composed for such a young and relatively unknown player.” Let me open that up to the rest of you too. Merino is a good shout, he was very good on Saturday wasn’t he? I would have said Ahmed Hegazi at West Brom until the 77th minute yesterday, and despite that mistake I’d still put him up there – looks a very good player. When jokes go wrong. Tim Woods asks, on Monaco: “Why are a club not short of cash ripping apart a title-winning side, and also helping out their main rivals (i.e. a loan to PSG for Mbappe?) Did I miss something over the summer?” No, it’s a good question. I think it’s fair to say Monaco know they will never be the biggest club in the world, even if the owner is rich, and I think they market themselves to players – explicitly or not – as an excellent final step before moving on to one of the biggest names. Also worth noting that if players want out, and are being paid well, it doesn’t always make sense to hold onto them. They probably would need a body in there to replace Coutinho even if mainly to ensure they have quality in depth. The other points are interesting – Can was very good indeed in midfield yesterday, to be fair. And that’s the counterpoint to David Wall. We can’t pretend these players are not good. “I can see Anfield sounding like a late 90s episode of Nevermind the Buzzcocks this season, particularly at corners. ‘MARK LEMAR! MARK LEMARRRR!!’ What? No I don’t know how to block email addresses, why do you ask?” Don’t worry, Ronan Heffernan, our IT whizzes have got it under control. Reports on Sky that West Brom have rejected a £21m bid from Leicester for Jonny Evans. Will Man City make their move now? An Evans-Maguire defensive partnership for Leicester would look pretty good, by the by. I was at Old Trafford on Saturday and Maguire was outstanding – bailing Wes Morgan out more than once too. You’d like to think not, although there’s an increasing school of thought that social media clamour and potential marketing benefits carry a bit more weight sometimes than might be advisable ... Worth pointing out, regarding that possible Liverpool move for Lemar, that this would probably make a rubber-stamping of Coutinho’s move to Barcelona more likely. Nicely put and I think there can be a lot of truth in that. In Monaco’s case I think the most successful export this summer, based on the buying team’s need for him and the manner of fit, will be Benjamin Mendy. Shoot me down. Allow me to share this Dominic Fifield piece on the troubled situation at Palace. They need some new faces – but that’s not ideal if they’re not sure about the manager. What would you do, Palace fans? This is a Long Read, by this blog’s standards, from David Wall – but an interesting one about Monaco: “In terms of making profits this summer, Monaco seem to have been the big winners, with so many of their players going for pretty big fees. Of course, there often seems to be little rationality in the transfer market, but I wonder if people have completely lost their heads when looking at the principality club. It’s true that they won the league title in France, but the impression I get is that most of the interest is based on their progress in Europe. And I think their achievement there was given an enormous helping hand by very fallible opponents, and other freak circumstances. “They were fortunate in that the putative strongest opponents in their group were Spurs, who can’t put anyone away at Wembley (not even the side who managed one away win all of last season). Then in the second round they managed to go through despite conceding six goals across the two ties, because City took the ‘Arsenal at Anfield’ approach to defending. And in the quarter finals they undoubtedly benefited from Dortmund being understandably distracted after being victims of a terrorist attempt on their lives, in which one of their team mates had been seriously injured, the day before their match eventually took place. “They exploited all of those situations ruthlessly, it’s true. But the real pedigree was exposed by Juventus in the semi-final. If people looked more at that tie then they might think twice about some of the figures being suggested for Mbappe, Lemar, and friends.” Well! What do we think? Might Monaco’s star crop not quite be the real deal they’re made out to be? I do know what David means; I think Mbappe, in particular, has a fine chance of being very good but some of the stuff you read and hear goes too far. We don’t really know yet, and if we say we do we’re pretending. Stay with us, Sid, we’ll keep it mellow. I can’t yet vouch for the quality though. Only five minutes elapsed before the first Lemar gag, this one from Ronan Heffernan. Perhaps this will be a good day. “If there’s any justice in this world* Monaco will let Lemar leave for Anfield. “*Being not that familiar with his back catalogue Its Not That Easy to come up with other Lemar related puns....” Barry has mentioned this already but what a move that would be – Arsène Wenger pretty much admitted last week that this was a deal he wanted to do. So what might today’s key themes be? It seems PSG, the scamps, are close to an ever-so-cunning loan of Kylian Mbappe from Monaco. I’m sure they just want to be cautious and try before they buy, that’s probably what’s going on there. But that might be the biggest Done Deal sorted today. And will any of Arsenal’s want-away players – 11 of them judging by yesterday – be ushered swiftly out of the door? Looking at Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain in particular but there should be plenty of other movement around the Emirates this week. What about Crystal Palace? They’re already getting twitchy over Ronald de Boer – so will that prevent them getting the players they need in? And surely Tottenham need to get two or three more in after yesterday’s warning shot from Burnley? I could go on – but what do you expect to happen at your club this week? Email me via the link above. Or tweet. Let’s chat. For clarity, by the way: the deadline is at 11pm, UK time, on Thursday. It’s transfer deadline week! And you know what that means – four days ram-packed with tittle-tattle, innuendo and half-truths ... with the occasional Done Deal too. I’m expecting some serious money to be flung around in England’s top two divisions, actually, as distasteful as some of it might be – there’ll be several sides looking for a final piece or two in the jigsaw, and others that have started badly and run into a bit of a panic. So it shouldn’t be boring. Today might be a little slower, to be fair; if you’re not on these shores, it’s a bank holiday here, and while that doesn’t really stop the football world from turning it might mean things get signed off a little more slowly. But I’d have thought that, at the very least, we should get a better idea during the day of some of the biggest developing stories for the next few days. And here, actually, is the perfect primer. It’s this morning’s Rumour Mill courtesy of the man sitting to my left, Barry Glendenning: Nick will be here shortly."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/live/2017/aug/28/england-v-west-indies-second-test-day-four-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-28T17:22:22Z","webTitle":"England declare and set West Indies 322 to win on day four – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2017/aug/28/england-v-west-indies-second-test-day-four-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/live/2017/aug/28/england-v-west-indies-second-test-day-four-live","fields":{"headline":"England declare and set West Indies 322 to win on day four – as it happened","bodyText":"That was a great day for England, who are strong favourites to win this match on a wearing, spinning pitch. Tom Davies and Daniel Harris will be here tomorrow. Thanks for your company, night! 6th over: West Indies 5-0 (Brathwaite 4, Powell 1) Moeen bowls the last over of the day with four men round the bat. Powell gets off strike and off the mark, which gives Brathwaite three balls to survive. He turns the first fractionally short of the diving Anderson, lurking round the corner, and then survives a huge LBW shout from the last ball of the day. It went straight on, past the outside edge to hit the pad. England are very tempted to review but decide against it. I think that’s the right decision as he might just have been outside the line. Yes, replays show it was the right decision from S Ravi. 5th over: West Indies 4-0 (Brathwaite 4, Powell 0) Brathwaite survives a huge LBW appeal when is knocked off his feet by a big inducker from Anderson. I think it was going down leg, and England decide not to review. Replays shows it was umpire’s call, shaving the leg bail. That’s fine umpiring from Chris Gaffaney. Brathwaite survives again when he tries to leave and accidentally diverts the ball on the bounce to second slip. A cracking over from Anderson. “And over-60s can get in for £5 tomorrow,” says John Starbuck, “which must be at least half the OBO readership.” Yes, John, I believe you are. “Hi Rob,” says Tom Bowtell, “just back from Stockholm where thousands of people are blithely living cricket-free lives. If - IF - England win this, should they blood Crane at Lord’s in the name of pre-Ashes fact finding? I’d personally go wild and blood Jofra Archer too. Pick a promising uncapped spinner for a dead rubber in the final Test before an Ashes tour? What could possibly go wrong? (Yes, if they win this I’d play Crane ahead of Westley and put Malan at No3.) 4th over: West Indies 4-0 (Brathwaite 4, Powell 0) Another loose over from Broad, who can’t get his radar right. I’d give Moeen the final over at that end, with 14 men round the bat. “Delighted to see Podmore getting the nod for Derbyshire,” says Nick Fisher. “As the man himself might say - ‘Get in! Very much so.’” All we need now is a curmudgeon called Reardon at No6. 3rd over: West Indies 4-0 (Brathwaite 4, Powell 0) Brathwaite almost falls over as he lunges like a libidinous drunk at a gorgeous delivery from Anderson that bursts past the outside edge. The next ball goes the other way to prompt a big LBW appeal that is turned down. Too high. “Afternoon Rob,” says Andy Bradshaw. “Wonder if Broad and Jimmy might break the habit of a lifetime and PITCH THE NEW BALL UP AT THE SODDING STUMPS AND NOT WASTE IT THE USELESS *$&amp;$&amp;%$^&amp;”$*&amp;*”$£%(“*”!£&amp;$%”$£(%”£%$**.” Is it time for England to put these thoroughbreds out to pasture???? 2nd over: West Indies 4-0 (Brathwaite 4, Powell 0) A poor first over from Broad, who gives Powell plenty that he can ignore. By the way tickets are £10 tomorrow, with kids getting in free. GO! 1st over: West Indies 3-0 (Brathwaite 3, Powell 0) Jimmy Anderson starts to Kraigg Brathwaite, who cuts the first ball assertively for three. That allows Anderson to start toying with Powell, who is beaten by an outswinger and struck on the pad by an inswinger next up. England go through with a token LBW appeal but everyone realised it was missing leg stump. Good stuff from Anderson. “Hi Rob, was just checking to see how the Admiral Lord Collingwood of Shotley Bridge was getting on,” says Chris Howell. “Very pleased to see he has his century, also tickled that there is a Mr Podmore playing for Derbyshire...” He should be in the Ashes squad. If it’s good enough for Lord Cowdrey, it’s good enough for Lord Colly. Let’s see how all those sexy Australian pace bowlers handle Brigadier Block coming at them with the front dog and a dead bat. West Indies must be so disappointed that a potential win, the greatest win of their careers, has turned into a grim struggle for survival. That’s not easy to deal with, no matter how hard you try. It wouldn’t surprise me if they were routed. So, West Indies need 322 to win. Unless somebody does a Mark Butcher, it’s not going to happen. Woakes punishes the weary Holder for consecutive boundaries with a cut and a drive. Some effective scampering makes it 12 from the over, and Joe Root decides to declare. I didn’t expect that but it’s the right decision; West Indies look physically and mentally shattered and could easily lose a wicket or two tonight. They have six overs to survive. 140th over: England 478-8 (Woakes 50, Broad 14) Woakes drives Bishoo for a single to reach an accomplished, sedate half-century, his third in Tests. “Highest England total without a century, blah…” sniffs Adam Hirst. “We’re also into the top 10 for England in the third innings and still climbing. Look! I done a statsguru!” Statsguru with a capital S, please. Show some respect. 139th over: England 477-8 (Woakes 49, Broad 14) Thanks Tanya, hello again. I don’t think a declaration is imminent – on the balcony, Joe Root still has a hoodie on – though they will probably be bowled out before the close. There are 10 overs remaining after this one from Holder. Woakes flicks four more to move closer to a fifty – and, according to the chaps on Sky, make this England’s highest Test score without a century. The previous record was also on this ground 23 years ago, when Mike Atherton was agonisingly caught and bowled for 99 in his first innings after the dirt-in-the-pocket scandal (sic). 138th over: England 470-8 ( Woakes 42, Broad 14) England lead by296 And a knock on the door means that I miss all that over but I turn you over to the Master himself, Rob Smyth. Thank you for reading! 137th over: England 465-8 ( Woakes 41, Broad 10) England lead by 296 Holder brings himself back on, as a Mexican Wave swoops round the ground - a swooping slice from Broad grabs their attention back. England near the magic lead of 300. 136th over: England 460-8 ( Woakes 40, Broad 6) England lead by 291 Another no-ball from Bishoo is swept by Broad and short leg nearly gets thwacked by Woakes swinging the bat around. The shadows are lengthening at Headingley. 135th over: England 455-8 ( Woakes 37, Broad 5) England lead by 285 Some extra bounce from Chase and a maiden. MEanwhile Dennis in Leicester has some statty fun of the type Rob likes so much. “England’s first innings was 258. The Windies first innings was 427. In the 126th over, England were on 427 and their lead was 258, both exactly the same as the two teams’ first innings scores. Spooky, eh?” 134th over: England 455-8 ( Woakes 37, Broad 5) England lead by 286 Just two runs from Bishoo’s over and everyone takes drinks out on the field and perhaps a cup of Yorkshire for Joe Root in the dressing-room. If he is going to declare tonight - the 8073 basking in the crowd will be in for a fascinating last hour. Oh, and Hameed has just been out for 15... 133rd over: England 453-8 ( Woakes 36, Broad 5) England lead by 285 132nd over: England 453-8 ( Woakes 35, Broad 5) England lead by 284 Time for a breath. I’ll leave the words to Peter Salmon. “I notice Eminem was headlining the Leeds festival last night – any news on whether he took advantage of the terrific £15 ticket deal today? Seems just the sort of chap who’d like the cut and thrust of a good day’s test cricket. He could bring the wife and kids and still have change from a £50.” 131st over: England 450-8 ( Woakes 32, Broad 5) Broad, on a pair, gets off the mark with a sweep behnd square for four. The instructions from the dressing-room are pretty clear here. 130th over: England 448-8 ( Woakes 31, Broad 0) Moeen went for a big hit and lobbed it up to long on, where Brathwaite holds on! For shame - a century would have been right. 129th over: England 437-7 ( Moeen Ali 81, Woakes 29) England lead by 270. Tickety, tockety, goes the scoreboard, two from Chase’s over, as England’s lead grows. Meanwhile Richard Hands is in a happy place. “I am, as ever, surreptitiously but immensely enjoying the OBO while summer half-heartedly puts in a belated appearance on the Brussels streets outside my office (blue sky! What’s that all about? We never have blue sky…). I just want everyone to know that I love Moeen Ali. I love him. Nothing untoward, mind. My love is pure and beautiful and not of this world; just like his strokeplay. “ 128th over: England 437-7 ( Moeen Ali 80, Woakes 28) England lead by 268. Just the one run off Bishoo’s over - and a chance for Holder to take a breath. 127th over: England 436-7 ( Moeen Ali 79, Woakes 28) England lead by 267. What can you say about Moeen Ali in full flow like this? Will you count the ways? A couple of classy boundaries - it is just a shame Headingley isn’t more full on such a sunlit eve. 126th over: England 427-7 ( Moeen Ali 70, Woakes 28) England lead by 258. A maiden from Bishoo. 125th over: England 427-7 ( Moeen Ali 70, Woakes 28) England lead by 258. A full toss from Chase is driven to the boundary from Moeen and a sweep for four brings up the 100 partnership from 113 balls. These two have turned the match as much with their speed and confidence as their strokeplay. 124th over: England 418-7 ( Moeen Ali 61, Woakes 28) An excellent over from Bishoo, teasing away, though England stretch their lead to 250. 123rd over: England 418-7 ( Moeen Ali 61, Woakes 28) Chase returns to bring a little control to proceedings. Moeen watching and noting, watching and noting. 122nd over: England 415-7 ( Moeen Ali 59, Woakes 27) England lead by 246 “Evening Tanya”, writes Simon McMahon . “Will England bat on for as long as they can, or try to get a lead of, say, 300 and then have half a dozen overs from Anderson and Broad tonight..?” Simon, I can’t even replace the batteries in my remote control so what would i know? But you’d think he’d be tempted... 121th over: England 412-7 ( Moeen Ali 56, Woakes 27) England lead by 241 Fifty for Moeen with a drive through the covers off Roach for four - and what a counter-attacking, carefree, little beauty it has been! 120th over: England 403-7 ( Moeen Ali 48, Woakes 26) England lead by 234 119th over: England 402-7 ( Moeen Ali 47, Woakes 26) England lead by 233 So Kemar Roach has a go, but the result is a similar looking soup. A drive and a cut from Woakes takes England past 400. 118th over: England 394-7 ( Moeen Ali 47, Woakes 18) England lead by 225 117th over: England 391-7 ( Moeen Ali 47, Woakes 16) Moeen drives gloriously for four, then uppercuts for four off a no-ball and finishes off with a crisp, flourishing cover drive to the boundary. The West Indies body language says “bewildered” 116th over: England 376-7 ( Moeen Ali 33, Woakes 16) England lead by 192 Oh West Indies. More calamity. Moeen is caught cutting off Bishoo’s first ball of the over, but it is no-ball. Only just, but only just enough. Then, Holder calls for a review of an lbw decision - which it turns out is spinning past leg. 115th over: England 374-7 ( Moeen Ali 32, Woakes 16) Shannon Gabriel attempts to restore some common sense at the other end, bustling and bristling, but a couple of full tosses and a no-ball rather spoil the tone. And there’s a gorgeous drive for four by Woakes and a flick off the pads to the boundary by Moeen. 114th over: England 361-7 ( Moeen Ali 27, Woakes 9) England lead by 192 A slightly off the wall bowling change from West Indies as part-time offspinner Kraigg Brathwaite, whose action was quibbled after Edgbaston, opens the bowling after tea. First ball is a loopy full toss thwacked for four by Moeen. “Is he bowling for a declaration?” asks Ian Ward.A loopy, full toss thwacked for four by Moeen. The over improves, slightly. If you can tear your attention away from the Test for a minute - it is a fascinating day in the Championship. A mile away from this very sitting room, Haseeb Hameed will shortly be batting against Warwickshire. And at Chelmsford, top of the table Essex are stumbling against struggling Somerset. Read all about it here! 113th over: England 357-7 ( Moeen Ali 23, Woakes 9) England lead by 188 Well, that was a bit of an unexpected adrenaline boost. A wicket cascade has left West Indies in with a chance and yet... if Moeen hangs around... Over on Sky, Athers and SirIan think England have enough. Just the thought of the myriad possibilities has put a boiiiiing and a spring in Robert Wilson’s step, “Bangladesh thumping the Aussies, the West Indies coming right back at ya, is it just me or does the world seem suddenly young and fresh again? I feel like singing songs or strewing daisies around the sunlit meadows.” Robert, you go for it. 113th over: England 357-7 ( Moeen Ali 23, Woakes 9) England lead by 188 The lesser-spotted Bishoo comes on for the last over before tea and tight it is. 112th over: England 356-7 ( Moeen Ali 22, Woakes 9) England lead by 187 Moeen thwacks the first ball of Roach’s over for 4 -high over backward point. Lovely! 111th over: England 351-7 ( Moeen Ali 17, Woakes 9) England lead by 178. “Afternoon Tanya.” writes Guy Hornsby. Hello! “What a time to join us, eh. I love YJB as much as the next OBOer, but that was a true brain fade. Getting on top of the bowler doesn’t have to be that brazen. You do have to wonder how much stick Moeen would’ve got had he done that? This is on a knife edge now, with these two needing clear-headed batting, not the brash swinging bravado of one of the West Stand faithful. Anything under 230 just won’t be enough. Pessimism ahoy!” 110th over: England 347-7 ( Moeen Ali 15, Woakes 7) England lead by 178. Kemar Roach replaces Holder at the Kirkstall Lane End. Moeen slaps it through the covers for four. Thwack! And another boundary, this one a clip off the hip. 109th over: England 339-7 ( Moeen Ali 7, Woakes 7) A slog-sweep from Moeen for four off Chase - neither of these batsmen are going to hang around twiddling their thumbs. England lead by 170 Liam again, on ironing: “I wouldn’t mind but I then tried to finish off a third and Bairstow. Stopping now.” Very wise - I consider ironing a complete waste of time myself. But then I’m a scruffbag. 108th over: England 333-7 ( Moeen Ali 2, Woakes 6 ) Holder chugging away, keeping Woakes guessing, playing and missing. And then a classy Woakesean on-drive which runs down to the boundary for four. 107th over: England 328-7 ( Moeen Ali 2, Woakes 1 ) England lead by 159. Oh Jonny - he’d just played two beautiful strokes and I was going to wax lyrical on how many runs he has scored for Yorkshire at Headingley over the last few years. Oh no! He tries to reverse sweep Chase from outside leg and drags the ball on. Yikes. 106th over: England 323-6 (Bairstow 14, Moeen Ali 2) Another one down - this time Bairstow dropped by Kyle Hope at short cover off Holder. Tricky, but West Indies needed it. “Bloody hell I only started doing the ironing 10mins ago and there has been two wickets” writes Liam Bergin. “Creased shirt tomorrow, it’s a sign” But of what Liam? Of what? 105th over: England 316-6 (Bairstow 9, Moeen Ali 0) Ohhh, this is fascinating, Chase to Moeen, some big turn here. 104th over: England 316-6 (Bairstow 9, Moeen Ali 0 ) Four byes as a ball from Holder bounces and swings past the diving Dowrich 103rd over: England 312-6 (Bairstow 9, Moeen Ali 0 ) Poor Malan - not done quite enough to save the game, not done quite enough to guarantee his tour place. Watchee, waitee. Malan perhaps unsettled by uneven bounce earlier in the over, bowled playing inside an off-break. Game on? 102nd over: England 312-5 (Malan 61, Bairstow 9) Beautiful extra-cover drive by Bairstow for four off Holder from a man who will be desperate to do well here. And again, a lovely little four off his toes. 101st over: England 304-5 (Malan 61, Bairstow 1) The wicket fell to the first ball after drinks, but will it be too late for West Indies to grab the match? Stokes caught at long off going for a big hit, a cool, cool catch by Brathwaite just inside the boundary And thank you so much Rob, lucky I made you odd cup of tea during your work experience stint, back in the day. Turned out my technical issues were that the remote needed new batteries - which feels a bit like the sort of problem the West Indies might have had this afternoon. Sky have England 50% chance of a win, West Indies 10%, and a draw sneaking up to 40% 100th over: England 303-4 (Malan 61, Stokes 58) Holder jags one back into Stokes, who is hit near a painful area again. That’s drinks. “Hi Rob,” says Brendon O’Sullivan. “Having tried Cloudwater’s fantastic double IPA at Birmingham’s marvellous 1000 Trades bar last month (at half that price), I’d say it’s worth it. But it was their alternative 80s night, Now Ham, and the dj had just dropped “The Killing Moon”, so I was a bit emotional to begin with. Keep up the fairly good work!” I shall do no such thing. Tanya’s Sky feed is working again, so I’ll hand over to her until tea. Thanks for your company, bye! 99th over: England 302-4 (Malan 61, Stokes 57) Roston Chase replaces Gabriel. Nothing happens. Pulitzer please! 98th over: England 300-4 (Malan 60, Stokes 56) The captain Jason Holder stands alone on the burning deck. He bowls a good maiden to Stokes, with one delivery going past the outside edge. What he really needs, however, is a wicket or six. This is slipping away. “Re Martin Phillips complaint about ‘2nd new ball’,” begins Paul Ward. “Does he not share my pain when the OBO keeps saying ‘1 new update’ when updates are by definition new?” Yes, but have you considered… I mean, you do realise that sometimes an update can… is it not possible that… I’ll get back to you. 97th over: England 300-4 (Malan 60, Stokes 56) Stokes has broken his bat. He looks genuinely upset, as if he’s already planning whereabouts in the back garden to bury his best friend. Parting with your bat is such sweet sorrow: Stokes belts his first delivery with the replacement bat for four to reach a sensational fifty, full of authority and extravagant strokeplay. The next ball is too straight and flicked for four more, and then Malan smashes a boundary to make it 13 from the over - and bring up the 300. England lead by 131, and West Indies are starting to drown in fatalism. 96th over: England 287-4 (Malan 56, Stokes 47) Sound the demerit poiunt klaxon! Ian Ward, on Sky, apologies for some language coming through to the stump mic. I’m not sure who it was but presumably one of the West Indies players. Jason Holder has replaced Roach, who picked a bad time to bowl a bad spell, and beats Malan with a very full delivery that misbehaves out of the footholes. “Have you seen the price of this beer?” says Sam. “GBP13.40 a pint!” Look, Sam, aspirational alcoholism doesn’t come cheap. 95th over: England 285-4 (Malan 54, Stokes 47) Stokes rams Gabriel’s attempted yorker whence it came for four. The next ball, another attempted yorker, elicits an even better shot through mid-on for four.. This has been a brilliant innings from Stokes, an immaculately judged fusion of positive attack and positive defence. And the moment I type that, he is beaten on the inside by a significant jaffa from Gabriel. That only just missed the off bail. “Hello Rob,” says Martin Phillips. “Am I the only one (answer, very probably, yes) to be bothered when pundits talk about ‘the second new ball’? The first ball used in an innings is by definition going to be new, so really it’s just ‘the ball’. Once 80 overs have been bowled, the option comes of taking a “new ball”, so it shouldn’t be the second new ball, or even the first new ball, just... the new ball. Is there, perhaps, a sound reason for this?” There is indeed: cricket is an incorrigible kook. And thank goodness for that. 94th over: England 275-4 (Malan 54, Stokes 39) A flowing drive from Malan off Roach brings him a sixth boundary. He doesn’t need Junior Soprano to tell him how close he is to going on an Ashes tour. A century would seal his place - this isn’t 1998 - and I suspect 80-odd might as well. But if he falls for 79, it’s over between us. Roach isn’t bowling well, and I suspect Holder will replace him at this end. England lead by 106. “It’s £4.50 for a pint of black sheep at Headingley,” says Matt Fordham. “I think there was a bigger queue for Yorkshire tea as it was free. I’m saying nothing.” Two more bits of housekeeping, while I remember Will Macpherson is taking care of the County Cricket Blog, and fictitious OBO creation Gary Naylor has written his county cricket talking points. 93rd over: England 269-4 (Malan 50, Stokes 38) That’s a great point from Nasser, via someone on Twitter: had Stokes sworn when he was hit in the box, would he have been given a demerit point and therefore banned? Back at the ranch, Malan reaches a gritty, 162-ball fifty with an inside-edge for a single off Gabriel. Well battled, youngish man. Meanwhile, after another terrific day’s play in Mirpur, Bangladesh have a great chance of a first Test win over Australia. 92nd over: England 268-4 (Malan 49, Stokes 38) Stokes walks onto a wide, full-length delivery from Roach and punches a lovely drive through extra cover for four. Stokes now averages exactly 40 since the end of last summer, which is excellent given the game-changing nature of his runs. If you go back to the start of 2016, which includes the 258, he averages 45. Here’s your friend and mine, Ian Copestake “Talking of technical issues, I am attempting to follow the game while editing the next issue of the William Carlos Williams Review (imagine editing the New Yorker in your pants [not your pants, Rob, obviously] in a bedsit with no staff while being abused online by Mac Millings et al). So I want to state publicly that any typos, factual errors or inclusion of inadvertent references to cricket are entirely the fault of Ben Stokes.” 91st over: England 264-4 (Malan 49, Stokes 34) Malan hooks Gabriel for a single to bring up the fifty partnership. Although Stokes has been the dominant partner, Malan’s innings is becoming increasingly valuable as a platform from some lower middle order bish-bosh. Here’s an email from Project B. “Check out what’s going down and coming up at PROJECT B...” Not now Project B, there’s a Test match going on! 90th over: England 260-4 (Malan 46, Stokes 33) Roach is picking a bad time to spray the ball all over the place, and there are no alarms for England in that over. “Hello Rob,” says Bill Vincent. “I can’t see why Root’s conversion rate matters. He averages 54, and has made well over 5000 runs in under 60 Tests. Plus he’s only 26, so has at least a decade’s Test cricket ahead of him. In short, he’s well on track to becoming England’s most prolific ever batsman. All done with style, much of it under the pressure of coming in at the inevitable 35 for two, and at a scoring rate that often makes his runs decisive. Better that, surely, that getting a century every ten Tests, but 10s and 20s between them, at a conversion rate of 100%. One other thing, the far more important issue of beer prices. When I arrived at University (In a long lost Sheffield of steel mills, smoky pubs and barmen who called a 16 stone prop-forward - me - “love”) a pint of Newcastle Brown was 25p in the Hall bar. Happy for a quid, blotto for two quid, in A&amp;E for three quid. Happy days - eat your livers out, kiddies.” I’ll never forget, or remember, the night cans of Coors was 50p at Keele in 1996. That’s an interesting way of looking at Root’s conversion rate. I suppose we’re just never satisfied; we always want more. What do they call that? Greed, aye. 89th over: England 259-4 (Malan 45, Stokes 33) Shannon Gabriel, all muscle and bustle, charges in to Stokes, who defends carefully. His bowling hasn’t really kicked on - he’s still the occasional match-changer he was in 2015 - but he is a serious Test batsman now. Even the greatest are not exempt from the cheap comedy that occurs when they are hit flush in the box, however, and that’s what has just happened to Stokes. A good over from Gabriel is tarnished when a misfield from Holder at mid-off gives Stokes four runs. 88th over: England 255-4 (Malan 45, Stokes 29) Kemar Roach has just bowled an iffy first over with the second new ball, including a poor delivery that Malan pulled round the corner for four. Hello, Rob again. Tanya is having technical issues, so I’m stepping in for a minute. My gain is your loss. West Indies are going to take the second new ball. Tanya Aldred, one of the golden generation of young cricket writers at Wisden Cricket Monthly in the early 2000s (Tanya, Booth, Emma John, Simon Briggs, Christian Ryan, Peter English, somebody I’ve offended by momentarily forgetting them), will be with you straight after lunch. You can email her on tanya.aldred.freelance@theguardian.com. Bye! 86th over: England 251-4 (Malan 41, Stokes 29) Bishoo’s last over before lunch goes for a couple. That’s been an excellent session for England, despite the loss of Joe Root. Dawid Malan played like Chris Tavare, scoring 20 runs in the session, and Ben Stokes played like Ben Stokes to take England’s lead up to a useful 82. The afternoon session, when West Indies will take the second new ball, is likely to decide the match, and possibly the series. 86th over: England 249-4 (Malan 40, Stokes 28) We’ll have one last over before lunch, after which West Indies will surely take the second new ball. “Rob,” says John Starbuck. “On TMS Aggers is bemoaning his broken boiler. This was preceded by Boycott delegating all household tasks to his housekeeper, but as she is unlikely to drive down the A1 to fix it, Aggers intends to go to the pub to find a short-notice plumber (his regular guy being away in Wales). This sounds like an excellent excuse for getting a drink or two, no matter what a pint costs, but one suspects it’s more likely to work in the country rather than a town or city. Dating aside, would you go out to a city bar?” Never, although I do live in Orkney so city bars aren’t the easiest to access. That would be quite the drunken journey home. 85th over: England 248-4 (Malan 40, Stokes 27) Stokes is looking dangerous. When doesn’t he? Bishoo drops short again and is flashed through midwicket for four. He has bowled too many fourballs, which have obscured the wicket-threatening deliveries - like that, a good legspinner that Stokes inside-edges for a single. “I think we can easily explain the Root Conversion dilemma based on the wrongheadedness of expecting adherence to a decimal system,” says Michael Hunt. “Fifty and a hundred are relatively arbitrary scores given importance based on using a rounded 10 as key. If we move instead to a much more sensible duodecimal system and so look at conversion rates from 36 to 72, we see that the perfect conversion of this innings sits Joe on I make it a 56% conversion rate, compared to Smith (52), Kohli (50), and Williamson (50).” 84th over: England 242-4 (Malan 39, Stokes 22) Chase beats Stokes with a beauty that drifts in and spits away. There is plenty in this pitch for the spinners, as has often been the case at Headingley in recent times. Stokes knows that being beaten is an occupational hazard and it isn’t affecting his attacking approach. When he gets a straighter delivery from Chase, he crashes a sweep through midwicket for four. England lead by 73. I think they’ll win this now, perhaps by a biggish margin. 83rd over: England 237-4 (Malan 39, Stokes 17) Malan, caught in umpteen minds, almost drags Bishoo back onto the stumps. The next ball is a long hop and hammered into the leg of the man at short leg. He’s fine, although the incident gives a bit of a shudder to those who recall Nick Knight wearing one on the head at silly point in 1995. “I don’t want to talk about Roots converstion rate,” says Felix Wood, subtly making that point by misspelling conversion and omitting Root’s possessive apostrophe. “It is, however, astonishing that he can have such a good average with so many runs left on the ground, as it so often feels. But I could talk about Thorpe all day long. One of my favourite things about him was that he decided to bat left handed just because his brothers batted right handed. I used to long to be good enough at batting to be able to copy his marking of his gaurd with the bail, but as I usually only lasted a ball or so I think it would have invited too much ridicule. Ah, memories.” 82nd over: England 236-4 (Malan 38, Stokes 17) Roston Chase comes on to replace Holder and rips one out of the rough to beat Stokes’s attempted sweep. As Mike Atherton says on Sky, it’s fair enough to delay the second new ball until after lunch, when Roach and Gabriel will have had a rest. It’s such a pivotal moment in the series, and the last thing you want is them to bowl four weary overs for 30 before lunch. In other news, a plot just thickened. “Hi Rob,” says Ben Parker. “In response to Mr Millard (71st over) asking about the price of t’pint at that fancy Lords I am pleased to confirm that it is indeed much more than ooop norf. I found this on their new-fandangled internet site: ‘Revisionist Craft Lager, Stowford Press Cider, New World Pale Ale, Marston’s Pedigree and other guest ales from £5.20’. Yours in regional stereotyping.” I’ll be pretty surprised, and even more disappointed, if this burgeoning mystery doesn’t have its own Netlflix Originals documentary by this time next week. 81st over: England 234-4 (Malan 38, Stokes 15) Bishoo continues, nothing happens. Here’s Ian Copestake, and by heck is he feeling mindful. “For Test matches to engage with the people who matter (namely flush hipsters) there should be an alcohol ban and a focus on wholewheat snacks grown organically on the practice pitches. Make England healthy again.” 80th over: England 233-4 (Malan 38, Stokes 14) It’s hard to judge this Malan innings. The half-full argument says he has shown impressive character and restraint; the half-empty argument says he is strokeless, was out early on and dropped this morning. The new ball is due but it looks like West Indies will continue with the old one until lunch. “It was £3.50 a pint in the bar under The Tavern Stand,” writes ‘Steve Hudson, debunking stereotypes since 1961.’ What about the pork scratchings mate? 79th over: England 231-4 (Malan 36, Stokes 14) “Dear Rob,” says Robert Wilson. “Has there ever been a less charismatic or sexually attractive statement than your ‘God, I love stats.’ (63rd over). Best laugh I’ve had in months. Thanks. I know that it’s a magical, surprising and infinitely complex world we live in but even if you were an unholy mix of Ryan Gosling, Brad Pitt and Zayn Malik, when your eyes meet those of some toothsome damsel over the shimmering candle-light (after an evening of perfect cooking and kitten-rescuing) and you say God, I love stats, the night just isn’t going to pan out as you hoped.” You clearly weren’t at Data Night 2017. It was like Eyes Wide Shut in there! Without the boring bits! 78th over: England 230-4 (Malan 35, Stokes 14) There’s a good battle going on between Holder and Stokes. Holder is changing his angle of delivery; Stokes is changing his position on the crease, standing outside to some deliveries. It’s a maiden. The new ball is due in two overs’ time. That’s the game and the series, right there. We haven’t really talked about the state of the series. It’s as if we’re all assuming England will win the third Test by an innings regardless of what happens here! “Confirming a stereotype is all in a day’s work,” says Jon Millard. “And if we have overpriced North/South beer parity, then the Grauniad’s Job is done. Root dismissal a horror show.....sound of sucking teeth between shot and catch nearly gave me tinnitus. Never mind, In 45 quid’s time I won’t care...” 77th over: England 230-4 (Malan 35, Stokes 14) Bishoo has a biggish shout for LBW against Stokes turned down. Stokes was beaten on the inside but had gone so far across that he was hit outside the line of off stump. When Bishoo then tosses one up towards the rough, Stokes reaches out and clatters it down the ground for four. That’s another superb stroke. Malan and Stokes then steal a second run to take England’s lead to 61. “Last year the Marston’s Pedigree in the Tavern at Lord’s was £3.50,” says Steve Hudson. “So there.” Do you mean at the ground or in the Lord’s Tavern? Not that I particularly give a solitary stuff, but there is a difference between the cost of a pint inside the ground, just outside the ground, and if you shove a 12-pack of Hofmeister up your jumper. Follow the bear! 76th over: England 223-4 (Malan 33, Stokes 9) Malan belted 78 from 44 balls on his T20 debut against South Africa. In Tests he has been the opposite, with a strike rate in the 30s rather than the 170s. In this innings he has 33 from 116 balls. “I’m sure I’m not the first to point out that the obvious reason for Joe Root’s poor conversion rate is that you keep jinxing him by talking about it,” thunders Mac Millings. You wouldn’t like him when he’s angry! 75th over: England 223-4 (Malan 33, Stokes 9) Stokes edges a quicker delivery from Bishoo just short of slip. There is no sense that both teams are waiting for the second new ball; Bishoo looks a threat. 74th over: England 222-4 (Malan 32, Stokes 9) That’s a stunning shot from Stokes, a short-arm pull for four off a ball from Holder that kept a bit low. He does play some unique, almost Pietersenian shots; there was another against Australia in the Champions Trophy that had Virat Kohli purring and tweeting. “Am sat in a play-gym wondering if I i ever see my three year old again so I don’t have the stats to hand,” begins Nick Goldspink, “but isn’t the conversion rate problem due to the fact that his rate of scoring 50s is exceptional - something close to 50 50+ scores in a little over 100 innings...it would be Bradmanesque to convert 50% of that many....” That’s a fair point, though Steve Smith has a similar rate of scoring 50s and an almost Bradmanesque conversion rate. Maybe he’s just too good for everyone. 73rd over: England 218-4 (Malan 32, Stokes 5) This is only Bishoo’s tenth over a match in which, thus far, he has played as a specialist nightwatchman. It’s a decent one, most of which is defended solidly by Malan. “Morning Rob,” says Simon McMahon. “This is shaping up to be a gripping Test match. As is the one in Dhaka. Not that I’m following them closely or anything. Working, you see. Working. (Insert winking emoji here).” 73rd over: England 218-4 (Malan 32, Stokes 5) This is only Bishoo’s tenth over a match in which, thus far, he has played as a specialist nightwatchman. It’s a decent one, most of which is defended solidly by Malan. “Morning Rob,” says Simon McMahon. “This is shaping up to be a gripping Test match. As is the one in Dhaka. Not that I’m following them closely or anything. Working, you see. Working. (Insert winking emoji here).” 72nd over: England 217-4 (Malan 32, Stokes 4) Holder is bowling superbly around the wicket to the left-handers, getting the ball to tail away from a line that makes any leave fraught with peril. Malan is beaten, following one such delivery. “Just from you mentioning Thorpey, I remember his struggles to convert fifties,” says Gareth Fitzgerald. “In his early career there were plenty of counter-attacking 60’s and 70’s (his front leg off the ground pull shot was awesome) and then he totally changed in the second part of his career (bad back?) Would love to see a grizzled Joe Root in ten years time making nurdled, crab-like hundreds with only one boundary. I’d take one today in fact...” What a genius he was. His calculated counter-attacks were one of the best things about watching England in the 1990s, and he was so adaptable. Never mind my granny: I’d run myself over in a handbrake-related fiasco to have him batting at No5 in this team. England had some outstanding batsmen in the 90s but I think he was the best. It’s such a shame he lost a fair bit of his peak years to injury and heartbreak. 71st over: England 217-4 (Malan 32, Stokes 4) Bishoo comes into the attack and gets some sharp turn into the new batsman Stokes. He has improved enormously against spin but he still isn’t that comfortable starting against it when the ball is turning. Bishoo generously gives him one off the mark - or rather four, a long hop that is slaughtered to cow corner. It almost went for six. “Regarding Matthew Doherty’s wish...does Stokes get to be Botham or Dilley?” says Jon Millard. “Incidentally, I’m a Yorkshireman at Test cricket for the first time in my life. In Yorkshire. £4.50 a pint. What is it at Lord’s?” £4.50 a sniff I think. Also, congratulations on your sterling work in preserving Yorkshire stereotypes. 70th over: England 213-4 (Malan 32, Stokes 0) Jason Holder replaces the slightly wayward Kemar Roach, now with two left-handers in his sights. And Malan has been dropped! Oh, madon, the West Indies have had a shocker in the field. Malan had a big, loose drive and edged it straight to first slip, where it was put down by the crouching Powell. In his defence, he was probably put off by Dowrich, who dived a long way and then withdrew from the catch. That was not the time for a keeper to dummy his first slip, however adroitly he did it. In his defence, the ball did start to swing away at the last minute. Maybe it wasn’t quite the shemozzle we first thought. 69th over: England 212-4 (Malan 32, Stokes 0) That was really well bowled from Gabriel, who has had such a good match. Root shaped to lift it over the cordon but it followed him and left him with no room to control the shot. England lead by 43. “Using your immense archives of cricket knowledge and actuarial stats abilities,” begins Ben Parker, mistaking me for someone, anyone else, “can you tell me if a tenner on Windies to win at 4-1 is a good bet?” It is now! (I still think England will win, but that wicket is, in the parlance of our time, mahoosive.) Joe Root has gone! He was cramped for room by Gabriel and steered the ball to gully, where Shai Hope almost muffed a simple chance before grabbing it at the 48th attempt. Root can barely drag himself from the field. That is a mighty wicket for the West Indies. 68th over: England 212-3 (Root 72, Malan 32) Root strongarms an attempted yorker from Roach through midwicket for four, is bowled by a dead ball - no controversy, he wasn’t ready and pulled away - and then flicks another boundary to move into the seventies. It was always likely that, in the short-term, the captaincy would have a positive impact on Root’s batting. Even so, 727 runs at 72.70 represents a fine summer’s work, even if that bloody conversion rate continues to put an asterisk against his achievements. “I think there are many factors influencing a player’s conversion rate aside from the individual merit of the batsman,” says Jonathan Gresty. “One thing I would say in Joe Root’s defence is that he knows he has a lot of good batsmen coming in after him. So if the team needs to chase a game or go on the attack, he knows he can take risks which the batsmen with higher conversion rates might not take. Perhaps the fact that he puts the team ahead of his own run-scoring ambitions is one of the key reasons - for which we should definitely cut him some slack.” Yes he’s certainly selfless, though I don’t see that as a big factor – it’s not like he is slogging for a declarations. It’s hard to explain. Graham Thorpe had a similar problem for much of his career. 67th over: England 203-3 (Root 63, Malan 32) Gabriel swings one down the leg side for a bye, with Dowrich acrobatically saving three runs. The next ball is a wide. Holder might have to bring himself on sooner than anticipated, because Roach and Gabriel have been more Jackson Pollock than Shaun Pollock this morning. Malan takes a dodgy single to mid-off and has to dive desperately to make his ground as Holder’s throw whistles past the stumps. He has an even bigger scare off the last ball of the over, flciking it just over the leaping square leg for four. 66th over: England 195-3 (Root 62, Malan 27) Roach has been too wide to Malan, who is playing only when absolutely necessary. It’s like watching Alastair Cook. Roach gets the last ball spot on, a superb awayswinger that goes past the edge. “Hello Rob,” says Matthew Doherty. “In answer to Joe Root’s low conversion rate compared to the other batsmen is that England are 20 for 3 when he comes in to bat.” Why would that affect his ability to turn fifties into hundreds? I’d have thought that would make him more likely to not reach fifty. 65th over: England 195-3 (Root 62, Malan 27) Root walks across his stumps to clip Gabriel through midwicket for four. That also brings up the hundred partnership. These are slightly ominous signs for West Indies, though the wicket of Root would change everything. 64th over: England 189-3 (Root 57, Malan 26) Roach goes around the wicket to the largely strokeless Malan. It’s another maiden, better than the first, though I was a bit distracted by Mikey Holding, who is ranting majestically about everything from the West Indies’ fields to the underuse of Devendra Bishoo. “Hello Rob,” says Matthew Doherty. “Is it tempting fate for Bairstow and Stokes to do a Botham and Dilley this afternoon?” England aren’t in that much trouble, at least not yet. I think they’ll give it some humpty though, certainly if Root and Malan can bat for a couple of hours. 63rd over: England 189-3 (Root 57, Malan 26) Root pulls Gabriel through backward square leg for four before being beaten by two superb full-length deliveries. Root will be desperate to make a hundred today for a few reasons. It’s his first close Test as captain, on his home ground. And then there’s that pesky conversation rate of fifties to hundreds: 28 per cent, which compares unfavourably to his peers. Virat Kohli’s is 55, Steve Smith’s 50 and Kane Williamson’s 40. It’s hard to find a reason for it. Maybe it has become self-perpetuating in the last year or so because the problem is getting worse rather than better: since the end of the 2015 Ashes, Root’s conversion rate is 21 per cent. God I love stats. 62nd over: England 185-3 (Root 53, Malan 26) A poor maiden from Roach to Malan, the kind Alan Mullally used to bowl on a bad day, with the radar all over the place. 61st over: England 185-3 (Root 53, Malan 26) A no-ball from Gabriel is punched down the ground for four by Malan. He hasn’t looked convincing in his short Test career, in truth, yet that won’t matter if he gets a score today. A big innings would surely secure a place in the Ashes squad. 60th over: England 179-3 (Root 53, Malan 21) Kemar Roach opens the bowling to Joe Root. To say Root is a big wicket today is like saying oxygen is a useful survival tool. He reaches the usual fifty with a couple of boundaries between the slips and gully. The first was deliberately played, the second a thick edge through the gap. The Dan Lucas Memorial Cup Dan’s girlfriend Liz has asked me to thank everyone who went to or supported his memorial match last weekend. It was a great success, with £1310 raised on the day and the kind of feelgood athletic ineptitude you would expect from Guardian readers. Andrew Miller, UK Editor of Cricinfo and aspiring stand-up comedian, has written a very funny match report here. Pre-play reading Vic Marks’ day three report Andy Bull’s quotes piece Andy Bull on the admirable Jason Holder Hello there. After five one-sided Tests, finally a contest. For the first time this summer we go into the fourth day with no real idea who’s going to win. England will resume on 171 for three - a precious lead of, erm, two - with Joe Root on 45 and Dawid Malan on 21. It was hard work yesterday evening, but the labours of England’s batsmen have given their flammable lower middle order something to work with. If England win, it will be only the fifth time they have done so after a first-innings deficit in excess of 150. A West Indies victory would be their first in England since 2000, and only their fourth away to a team other than Zimbabwe or Bangladesh since 1997. All told, this should be quite a day."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/blog/2017/aug/27/jurgen-klopp-loris-karius-liverpool-arsenal","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-27T20:30:43Z","webTitle":"Jürgen Klopp’s Loris Karius gamble left untested by Arsenal’s familiar failings | Andy Hunter","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2017/aug/27/jurgen-klopp-loris-karius-liverpool-arsenal","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/blog/2017/aug/27/jurgen-klopp-loris-karius-liverpool-arsenal","fields":{"headline":"Jürgen Klopp’s Loris Karius gamble left untested by Arsenal’s familiar failings","bodyText":"Sir Alex Ferguson once galvanised Manchester United for victory with a team-talk that stretched no further than: “Lads, it’s Tottenham.” The same brutally dismissive thought may have crossed Jürgen Klopp’s mind before Liverpool destroyed their north London rivals. The Liverpool manager chose the perfect day and the perfect opponent to rest his first-choice goalkeeper. His second choice enjoyed a day of rest too, although Loris Karius was on the pitch against Arsenal. Any misgivings or judgment on Klopp’s decision to give Simon Mignolet a day off was postponed by yet another anaemic Arsenal performance at Anfield, where they have conceded 17 goals on their last five visits. Familiar failings from familiar faces made a mockery of claims of change at the Emirates Stadium. So much for the Liverpool manager’s risk. Karius, Mignolet’s replacement for one Premier League game only, did not have a save to make against an abject opponent. The only threats to the Germany Under-21 international came when he had the ball at his feet. Klopp has healthy competition and options in goal this season with Karius and Danny Ward, the Wales international having returned from a successful loan spell at Huddersfield Town. In Mignolet he has a goalkeeper who thrives on the confidence of being first choice. Though the Belgium international was clearly unhappy at not making the squad for such a prestigious game, Klopp avoided any unnecessary issues by assuring the keeper he will be back in the side for the trip to Manchester City after the international break. The Liverpool manager was asked, jokingly, whether he started Karius in the knowledge the 24-year-old would have nothing to do. “You shouldn’t ask a question like that,” Klopp replied. “I lose a bit of respect for a question like that. “Intensity for a goalkeeper is different. It is not physical. It is mental. We said before the season that we wanted to have three really strong goalkeepers and that is the situation now. Simon is the clear number one but the other two are not clear number twos or threes. Simon won the race in pre-season. He is solid, he is like a machine. You can always rely on him. I told him yesterday and it was not that he gave me a hug and said ‘Thank you boss, that’s what I would do too’ but I wanted to do it and give him this rest and have Loris in this game. Loris did a lot of good things. He was sometimes too cool but we all need to get used to playing football in close situations. He did a good job and I am happy with this. If nothing happens Simon will play against City 100%.” The Liverpool manager’s claim that four games in 12 days was taxing for the 29-year-old Mignolet did seem an exaggeration, however. The same could not be said of Liverpool’s opponents. One of the many damning indictments of Arsenal’s display was that Karius had no competitive opportunity to press his claims as Mignolet’s rival in the Liverpool team. The only conclusion that could be drawn from his performance was that his distribution puts more pressure on his own team than the man he replaced. Karius was closed down twice by Danny Welbeck as he dawdled in possession inside his penalty area and fortunate the ball ricocheted in Liverpool’s favour on both occasions. The former Mainz keeper was so slow on the ball that even Mesut Özil almost caught him in the second half. There were ironic cheers from the home crowd when Karius played his next clearance first time under pressure rather than attempting to beat his man. Otherwise he did not have a save of note to make all game. Punching away an Alexis Sánchez free-kick and an Özil corner was, in truth, the sum total of Karius’s exertions. “He took too long on the ball sometimes but he needs to get used to playing football in close situations,” Klopp explained. “You need games to learn to play in close spaces as a goalkeeper and as an outfield player.” The Liverpool manager’s other defensive change from the Champions League play-off defeat of Hoffenheim in midweek was Joe Gomez for Trent Alexander-Arnold at right-back. That decision was vindicated before half-time with Gomez having a vital role in both Liverpool goals. The defender reacted quicker than the woeful Héctor Bellerin to win possession for Roberto Firmino’s opener, also providing the inch-perfect cross, and intercepted Sánchez’s attempted through ball to the same player in the buildup to Sadio Mané’s second. Gomez typified the chasm between the two teams in many respects. Both sides may be blessed with creative talent but only Liverpool worked hard enough to let it flourish. As against Hoffenheim, Klopp’s forward line mesmerised again but the urgency and strength in his central midfield and the appetite throughout the Liverpool ranks put Arsenal to shame. The suited Mignolet could only sit back and admire."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/2017/aug/27/england-west-indies-second-test-day-three-match-report","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-27T18:31:59Z","webTitle":"Joe Root stands firm to give England hope after compelling third day","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/aug/27/england-west-indies-second-test-day-three-match-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/aug/27/england-west-indies-second-test-day-three-match-report","fields":{"headline":"Joe Root stands firm to give England hope after compelling third day","bodyText":"The most compelling Test of the summer, brimful of incident, excellence and aberration, hangs in the balance. After three days, during which West Indies have played most of the best cricket, the outcome nonetheless remains hard to predict. The bald figures are that England in their second innings have seven wickets remaining and they lead by two runs. England’s batsmen have had to scrap for every run; some enjoyed good fortune with catches dropped and, in one case, probably unnoticed and they have had to cope with the unnerving experience of waiting for an umpire’s decision to be overturned. Critically, at the end of a harum-scarum day Joe Root was still at the crease on 45 and he remains the likeliest batsman to influence the result of a contest that has restored faith in Test cricket. England started their second innings 169 runs adrift and for once the game situation overtook the constant debate about the constitution of the upper order for their winter tour. Alastair Cook and Mark Stoneman set about their task diligently, adding 58 together, and Cook, caught behind off Jason Holder for 23, was the first to go. Then Tom Westley endured an innings that he would rather forget. First he should have been run out after a mix-up with Stoneman but Devendra Bishoo at the bowler’s end dropped the ball, which compelled him to hurl it at the stumps with Westley still yards short. He missed them. No matter; soon after Westley drove wildly at Holder and was caught behind. The selectors would have viewed his failure more sympathetically if he had been the unfortunate victim of a run out. Stoneman was much more impressive in an unfussy way. He stands still at the crease with minimal pre-delivery movement and not much more after the ball has been released. He played several crisp drives in between calm defence and was able to register his maiden Test 50 before being bowled by a beauty from a perspiring Shannon Gabriel. In came Dawid Malan to join Root and now England had their escapes. When Malan was on four there was an appeal for caught behind; it was rejected and the West Indies decided not to review but UltraEdge suggested the ball had feathered the bat. Then Root, on 10, was dropped in the gully by Kyle Hope off the deserving Kemar Roach. Later, when 35, Root was given out lbw by umpire Sundaram Ravi, whose decisions have been overturned four times in this match so far and, to England’s relief, this was one of those instances. This was not a passage of play for the faint-hearted and the West Indies could easily have been better rewarded for their efforts. The first session when West Indies resumed on 329 for five was even more frenetic and flawed on a day when prompt arrivals were rewarded with high drama. Jimmy Anderson’s first ball kissed the outside edge of Shai Hope’s bat, which gave the West Indian the unusual and unwelcome experience of a standing ovation after receiving a solitary delivery. The second delivery from Anderson was edged by Shane Dowrich and a jubilant Root took the catch at second slip. Out came the West Indies captain, Holder, who negotiated the hat-trick ball with aplomb before guiding a boundary to third man. Then another incident, more commonly witnessed in a club third XI game, had the crowd gasping and Stuart Broad struggling to retain his composure. Jermaine Blackwood drove Broad’s second ball in the air without much power straight to mid-on, where Moeen Ali dropped a catch that would not have taxed many grandfathers – or grandmothers. Had that catch been taken West Indies would have been 333 for eight. Instead Blackwood and Holder counterattacked boldly, the former improvising impishly, the latter unveiling strokes of classical purity. Holder took 14 runs from a Broad over and England were creaking again in the field. This pair added a quickfire 77 before the next flurry of wickets. Holder attempted a lofted straight drive against Chris Woakes; he miscued and this time Moeen held a much more difficult chance as he ran back from mid-off. Then came a brilliant piece of fielding from Ben Stokes and a misjudgment from Blackwood, who must be one of the quickest West Indians. Blackwood spied a third run but Stokes pounced and hurled his return, which was deftly gathered by Jonny Bairstow. Next ball there was another basic error, this time from the England side. Gabriel presented a straightforward catch to short-leg and Stoneman dropped it. Surprisingly, since Gabriel’s batting prowess is miniscule, another 21 runs were added before he was lbw to Stokes. The bowler celebrated silently, which was just as well. In the morning Stokes had received a demerit point for “using language that is obscene or offensive” after being edged for four by Shai Hope on Saturday night. This means that Stokes will be banned for a Test or two ODIs if there is another transgression, which led to the notion that he should “do a Beckham” before the Ashes series. However, he had better behave for the rest of this match, because England may yet need him at Lord’s to ensure a series victory."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"us-news/2017/aug/27/rex-tillerson-donald-trump-charlottesville","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-27T20:18:35Z","webTitle":"'The president speaks for himself': Rex Tillerson distances himself from Trump","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/aug/27/rex-tillerson-donald-trump-charlottesville","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/aug/27/rex-tillerson-donald-trump-charlottesville","fields":{"headline":"'The president speaks for himself': Rex Tillerson distances himself from Trump","bodyText":"Appearing to suggest that Donald Trump did not represent “the American people’s values” after the recent violence in Charlottesville, Virginia, Rex Tillerson said on Sunday “the president speaks for himself”. The US secretary of state was responding to questions about Trump’s assertion that “many sides” were to blame when white supremacists and anti-racism protesters clashed in Virginia on 12 August. One person died and many more were injured when a suspect who demonstrated with white nationalists at a so-called Unite the Right rally rammed his car into crowd of counter-protesters. Days after an official White House statement attributed to Trump blamed the violence “on many sides”, Trump went further in a testy exchange with reporters. “You had a group on one side that was bad and you had a group on the other side that was also very violent,” Trump said. Both sides included “very bad people”, the president added, saying those gathered for the far-right rally, ostensibly to protest the removal of a statue of Robert E Lee, included many “fine people”. Asked if such remarks made it harder for him to represent America abroad, Tillerson said: “I don’t believe anyone doubts the American people’s values or the commitment of the American government or the government’s agencies to advancing those values and defending those values.” “And the president’s values?” asked Chris Wallace, the Fox news anchor. Tillerson replied: “The president speaks for himself.” Asked if he was “separating” himself from the president, Tillerson said: “I’ve made my own comments as to our values as well in a speech I gave to the state department this past week.” Tillerson is the latest member of Trump’s cabinet to refuse to defend his shifting reactions to Charlottesville. Earlier this week, chief economic adviser Gary Cohn was quoted by the Financial Times as saying the White House “can and must do better” to condemn racist groups and should “do everything we can to heal the deep divisions that exist in our communities”. Cohn contemplated resigning, according to several reports. This weekend, video of James Mattis telling troops abroad America had “problems” and had lost “the power of inspiration” prompted suggestions the secretary of defense may have been referring to controversy surrounding the president. Dozens of Republicans joined the backlash to Trump’s response, which not only drew a moral equivalence between Ku Klux Klan sympathizers and neo-Nazis and those opposing them, critics said, but came too slowly after a horrific instance of violence. This weekend, the former vice-president Joe Biden criticised Trump in an essay published in the Atlantic. “Today we have an American president who has publicly proclaimed a moral equivalency between neo-Nazis and Klansmen and those who would oppose their venom and hate,” Biden wrote. “We have an American president who has emboldened white supremacists with messages of comfort and support.” In a campaign-style rally in Phoenix, Arizona, on Tuesday, Trump defended his controversial remarks and blamed the media for misrepresenting what he said. “Here’s what I said on Saturday,” he told the crowd, before reading parts of the initial White House statement. In his reading, he left out three key words he originally used to describe the violence: “on many sides”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/blog/2017/aug/27/arsenal-pay-price-for-failing-to-pick-their-best-front-three-against-liverpool","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-27T17:55:55Z","webTitle":"Arsenal pay price for failing to pick their best front three against Liverpool | Paul Wilson","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2017/aug/27/arsenal-pay-price-for-failing-to-pick-their-best-front-three-against-liverpool","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/blog/2017/aug/27/arsenal-pay-price-for-failing-to-pick-their-best-front-three-against-liverpool","fields":{"headline":"Arsenal pay price for failing to pick their best front three against Liverpool","bodyText":"Were Arsenal fans excited about the return of Alexis Sánchez? Yes. Were they dismayed when it turned out to be at the expense of Alexandre Lacazette? You bet. Much had been written and said about the performance of Liverpool’s front three after the performance against Hoffenheim in midweek. Here was Arsène Wenger’s chance to fight fire with fire by selecting a fairly nifty front three of his own. Yet instead of going for the obvious option, not to mention the strongest, the ever quirky Arsenal manager chose to bench his new record signing and give Danny Welbeck a game. It was soon easy to see which front three was going to be busiest, with Mohamed Salah forcing an early save from Petr Cech, Sadio Mané fizzing around like a firework on the left and Roberto Firmino putting his side ahead when Arsenal lost the ball on halfway. Had Jordan Henderson managed to put the ball in the net rather than narrowly wide after dispossessing a dozing Mezut Özil, the German’s savaging at the hands of past and present Liverpool captains this week would have been complete. But Arsenal survived that scare and might have made it to the interval without further damage until Joe Gomez made his second telling interception of the afternoon. Arsenal were not doing too much wrong at that point but Gomez easily read Sánchez’s intended pass to Héctor Bellerin in the Liverpool penalty area, and from then on it was the speed with which the home side advanced into the spaces Arsenal had left that impressed. The ball was over the halfway line in no time and once Firmino found Mané with room on the left to run into there was only going to be one outcome. That was essentially the story of Arsenal’s afternoon. Their three-man back line was under pressure all the time because Liverpool had the numbers in midfield. There was no way Aaron Ramsey and Granit Xhaka could stem the red tide; in fact both Arsenal midfielders had experiences they would prefer to forget. Xhaka found himself passing the ball out of play for a corner because he had nowhere else to turn when Salah closed him down in his own area while Ramsey, who was replaced at half-time, suffered the indignity of being stood up and beaten by Georginio Wijnaldum twice in quick succession. Welbeck struggled to get into the game up front after putting an early half chance over the bar, but so did Özil and Sánchez. Arsenal’s front men found themselves isolated whereas Liverpool’s were constantly supplied by Emre Can, Henderson and Wijnaldum. Clearly Liverpool’s job was made easier in the second half by Arsenal’s need to take risks and chase the game, though that does not explain why the visitors were so regularly caught in possession by determined home runners relentlessly closing them down. A pattern was already emerging in the second half before Héctor Bellerín realised too late on halfway that Salah was not going to allow him as much time on the ball as he required. Nacho Monreal had already coughed up the ball to Salah in the same way, obliging Cech to come to his rescue with a save, and even before the third goal Rob Holding and Sánchez had been similarly pickpocketed. Once Salah took maximum advantage of having an empty half to run into, Sánchez adopted his now familiar “beam me up” pose, and when Wenger took a step into his technical area there were a few boos from travelling supporters in the Anfield Road end. The manager did manage to send on Lacazette and Olivier Giroud for the last half hour but, as Sánchez was one of the players withdrawn, Arsenal followers have still not seen their ideal front three in action. If Manchester City get their way before the end of the transfer window perhaps they never will. The only conclusion to be drawn from this game is that Arsenal are going to find it difficult to regain their Champions League status and Liverpool taking their place last season was no fluke. Jürgen Klopp was highly complimentary to Wenger’s side before the game, pointing out that Arsenal have outstanding players all over the pitch. Not here they didn’t. Liverpool were the side with too many talents to keep pinned down, with Mané, Wijnaldum and Can excelling and Firmino, Salah and Henderson not far behind. Even Daniel Sturridge came on for a late cameo and bagged his first goal of the season, whereas Arsenal’s substitutes were unable to make any impact. When Giroud headed over from Özil’s free kick in the closing seconds it simply confirmed that Arsenal had not managed to properly bother Loris Karius in 90 minutes of football. Whichever way Wenger chooses to arrange his front line, that is an unsatisfactory return."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/2017/aug/27/andy-murray-us-open-surgery-knee","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-27T16:39:30Z","webTitle":"Andy Murray considering surgery as last-resort solution for injured hip","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/aug/27/andy-murray-us-open-surgery-knee","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/aug/27/andy-murray-us-open-surgery-knee","fields":{"headline":"Andy Murray considering surgery as last-resort solution for injured hip","bodyText":"Andy Murray is seriously considering having surgery for the second time in four years to rescue his career after nagging hip pain forced his late exit from the US Open, which begins on Monday. Consultation with several specialists has failed to deliver a solution to the unspecified problem – most probably a bone spur but possibly arthritis – which first struck in the French Open semi‑finals in May, then cut him down in the Wimbledon quarter-finals. It is clear six weeks of rest and rehabilitation since losing against Sam Querrey at the All England Club were not enough to ease the discomfort or provide the world No2 with sufficient lateral movement to compete. It is also obvious his problem was much worse than he let on at the time, when he claimed his pronounced limp was no different from the way he normally walked. Murray’s shock announcement on Saturday was not taken lightly. He left the call until 20 minutes before an emotional press conference in which he looked as dispirited as when he decided in 2013 to have an operation on his back after years of playing with the aid of painkillers. He took a few questions then returned to the Manhattan hotel accommodation he has been sharing with his brother, Jamie. What he hoped would be a solid shot at a second US Open title after being handed the gentlest of draws disintegrated during the closing moments of a training session on Saturday with the Frenchman Lucas Pouille. Looking on with serious concern was Ivan Lendl, who had both hips replaced last year to enable him to resume as Murray’s coach. It took Murray a year to recover properly from his first surgery but he looked to have been restored to full health when he won his third grand slam title and second Wimbledon championship last year. However, a charge thereafter to haul down Novak Djokovic as the No1-ranked player in the game, culminating in his first ATP World Tour Finals title in London in November, took its toll this summer. One solution to his chronic hip problem could be platelet-rich plasma injections into the joint, which the former British No1 Andrew Castle tried, to no avail, when diagnosed with severe osteoarthritis after a long career. Eventually he had a metal hip inserted. If Murray goes under the knife again, at 30, he risks another long period of recovery. It is clear the only alternative is a lengthy spell away from the Tour, similar to the breaks chosen by Rafael Nadal, Roger Federer to spectacular effect last year and, most recently, Djokovic and Stan Wawrinka, who only a year ago were contesting the title here at Flushing Meadows but have decided to rest until 2018. Murray is aware this is the biggest turning point in his career. He once said he could happily retire without winning a major or getting to No1 as long as he was satisfied he had given his best. Since winning the boys’ title here in 2004 he has done that time and time again, acknowledged as one of the sport’s great survivors and gathering three majors as well as two Olympic gold medals and a 41-week reign as world No1, which he surrendered to Nadal last week, in his absence from the Tour. However, Murray’s famous fighting qualities have dimmed. Once he was almost unbeatable when holding a 2-1 lead in five-setters; over the past year he has lost four times from that position. He does not need reminding that the quality that separates him, Nadal, Djokovic and Federer from the herd is their ability consistently to repulse the challenge of younger contenders over the longer distance. Yet Juan Martín del Potro came from 1-2 down to beat him in the Davis Cup semi‑finals last year; Murray was 2-1 up before losing to Kei Nishikori in the quarter-finals of this tournament; this year he led Querrey 2-1 at Wimbledon; and he held that advantage over Wawrinka at Roland Garros, before fading in the match he identifies as the one where his hip problem first flared. This is not yet a full-blown crisis but those defeats mark a worrying trend. With a second child on the way Murray might reluctantly consider that his life as a professional athlete is drawing to a quicker close than he would like. He has compiled a strong investment portfolio and would have no problem turning his immense tennis knowledge to good cause, although he might not be drawn to sitting in another player’s box. His preference remains staying in the sport he has known for so long. He is one of the game’s most dedicated trainers, having turned a scrawny teenage frame into a powerhouse that has carried him through so many marathon matches. He revels in the struggle and would miss it desperately. An operation may well be the only way to extend his career. However, surgery is risky, especially so late in his career. Federer said he thought long and hard about opting to have his knee repaired last year, although he made a comeback that surprised even him, winning the Australian Open on his return, then Wimbledon and he is now staring at a shredded draw that could open his path to a seventh US Open title, the 20th grand slam of his long career. Federer, who opens his campaign on Tuesday against the exciting young American prospect, Frances Tiafoe, may have to get past Nick Kyrgios, Dominic Thiem or Juan Martín del Potro to get to a semi-final against Nadal. The Spaniard, who has never played his Swiss rival here, has a slightly easier path to the final weekend, beginning on Tuesday against Dusan Lajovic. Tomas Berdych, David Goffin and Grigor Dimitrov are in his quarter, so there is work to be done. It is a job Murray would have relished. He had been gifted a draw as easy as in any slam he has played. Tennys Sandgren, however, now plays Marin Cilic, who inherits the Scot’s second spot in a reshuffle of the seedings. It is not just parochial concerns that make the US Open a little poorer this year. Whenever he leaves, Murray will be hugely missed."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"music/2017/aug/28/taylor-swift-unveils-dark-video-for-look-what-you-made-me-do","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-28T01:13:25Z","webTitle":"Taylor Swift unveils dark video for Look What You Made Me Do","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/aug/28/taylor-swift-unveils-dark-video-for-look-what-you-made-me-do","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2017/aug/28/taylor-swift-unveils-dark-video-for-look-what-you-made-me-do","fields":{"headline":"Taylor Swift unveils dark video for Look What You Made Me Do","bodyText":"Taylor Swift might not have made an appearance at this year’s MTV video music awards but the singer still made her presence known with the release of a dark new video. Last week the 27-year-old unveiled the first single from her new album, Reputation, the dark electro-pop track Look What You Made Me Do, accompanied by a lyric video that broke viewing records. The accompanying visuals for her new video open with the star crawling out of a grave with a tombstone reading “Here lies Taylor Swift’s reputation”. After playing a zombie, Swift soon takes on a variety of different hard-edged personas, including the leader of a squad of female robots, a bank robber and a celebrity involved in a paparazzi-caused car crash. Mirroring the lyrics of the song, the video implies that the old Taylor is dead and a darker iteration is here instead. Swift also skewers her overly earnest image during a finale that brings together all of her characters and includes a throne of snakes, in reference to the snake emoji used by Kim Kardashian to describe her. Reviews for the track have been largely mixed, with the Guardian’s Maura Johnston calling it “a skeletal bit of electropop”, yet sales have been robust and her initial lyric video racked up 19m views in 24 hours – a new record. This year’s VMAs are hosted by Katy Perry and have so far seen Fifth Harmony winning best pop video and Kendrick Lamar predicted to win the most trophies.

Liverpool humiliated Wenger’s team 4-0 with goals from Roberto Firmino, Sadio Mané, Mohamed Salah and the substitute Daniel Sturridge – and could have scored more in a one‑sided contest. Arsenal have now conceded 17 goals in their past five visits to Anfield and have lost two of their opening three league games for only the third time in 26 seasons. The uncertainty over Wenger’s future is no longer an excuse for Arsenal’s repeated failures against the Premier League’s leading teams, with the manager having signed a new two-year contract, and he did not spare his players in a damning assessment of their efforts. Asked what went wrong at Anfield, the Arsenal manager replied: “Everything. From the first minute to the last minute we were not at the level requested for such a game. Not physically, not technically, not mentally and we were punished. That’s basically it. Of course, you can analyse the chances we gave away, but I just think overall the performance was not at the requested level.” Wenger’s post-match press conference lasted only two minutes and 10 seconds before he left the media room at Anfield but he also said: “The result is a consequence of our performance. We were not good enough. We were beaten everywhere physically, in the end I believe we made it easier for them, and the mistakes gave them a cushion. “It was shocking [conceding a second before half-time] but our performance was absolutely disastrous. Not to become too emotional, we have to take some distance, and there are some reasons behind it, and the players now go on their international break, but we do have to take the consequences of our performance today. If you find a manager who is happy with that performance today, I wish you good luck. The emotions are negative, but it’s not the right moment to talk about that.” Wenger was booed by sections of the away support when he stepped into his technical area for the first time in the second half. On the hostile reception he said: “I don’t want to answer that. That’s part of the crowd’s feelings. If I am the problem, I am sorry, but I believe all together we lose. The only thing we can do is come back and give them a better level of performance.” For Jürgen Klopp, however, victory provided another demonstration of Liverpool’s improvement on a game-by-game basis this season, and of their formidable attacking threat. “So far this season we learn from each performance, each game we played different things,” the manager said. “Watford was not as bad as people say. We were close to winning there, but we defended the last few minutes too deep. We did this well against Hoffenheim away and then built on it against Crystal Palace. We played an outstanding game against Hoffenheim and today we did the next step because we did it again. “We need to learn we can do things like this every three or four days. We wanted to show it today and prove to ourselves and be spot on from the first second. We wanted to show our ambitions against a very strong side. The performance was perfect and the result was the result of the performance.” Klopp confirmed he expects Liverpool to be busy in the final days of the transfer window, with the Dutch defender Virgil van Dijk still a target despite Southampton’s refusal to sell him. As for outgoings, Divock Origi could be a late departure while Palace and West Bromwich Albion want to sign Mamadou Sakho. The manager said: “We will see what happens. If players come in, it makes sense we think about what happens on the other side. If Divock is involved, we will see.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"uk-news/2017/aug/27/birling-gap-evacuated-after-chemical-incident-on-east-sussex-coast","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-28T05:07:29Z","webTitle":"More than 100 treated after 'chemical incident' at Birling Gap in East Sussex","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/aug/27/birling-gap-evacuated-after-chemical-incident-on-east-sussex-coast","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2017/aug/27/birling-gap-evacuated-after-chemical-incident-on-east-sussex-coast","fields":{"headline":"More than 100 treated after 'chemical incident' at Birling Gap in East Sussex","bodyText":"More than 100 people have been treated in hospital after a chemical “haze” descended on beachgoers on the East Sussex coastline. Birling Gap, near the Seven Sisters chalk cliffs, was evacuated by emergency services after people complained of breathing difficulties and irritation to their eyes and throats at about 5pm on Sunday. A spokesman for Eastbourne district general hospital told the BBC that 133 people had received treatment on Sunday. Police said an unknown “haze” coming from the sea had left people along the coast from Eastbourne to Birling Gap requiring assistance. They warned people in the area to keep doors and windows closed. East Sussex Healthcare NHS Trust said: “We became aware of a hazardous cloud moving across from Birling Gap to the Eastbourne area earlier today. “Six patients initially presented to us with minor symptoms. As at 22.30hrs, this number has risen to more than 100 patients being cared for by us at our Eastbourne district general hospital site. “The patients we are caring for are being decontaminated on site by our trained hospital staff. We are working with East Sussex fire and rescue and being supported on site by Secamb and the police.” East Sussex fire and rescue service said the “chemical incident” was ongoing. Sussex police said the incident appeared to have been caused by “an unknown haze coming in from the sea,” but the exact source had not yet been established. The first report came from Birling Gap just before 5pm on Sunday. The RNLI said that “possibly some kind of gaseous fumes” had drifted over the area and a significant number of people on cliff tops had been suffered symptoms including irritation, sore eyes and vomiting. Fears that people could be trapped on the beach resulted in RNLI lifeboats being launched from Eastbourne and Newhaven. There was a doctor on board the Eastbourne lifeboat. A spokesman said: “We have been checking along the shoreline to try and ensure that everyone is safe.” He said a “plume” had drifted across the area, bringing “some sort of substance” with it which seemed to affect a number of people. Guardian reporter Ian Cobain, who was walking along the Seven Sisters with his wife Jackie, said: “At midday, we could see a thick mist off the coast, below the cliffs, but assumed it was just a sea mist. “It was immense. Once past Beachy Head, you could look down over Eastbourne and see it reaching the tip of the pier. After doubling back inland, around 4.30 we dropped down into Birling Gap, where immediately our eyes started stinging and streaming. One or two children could be seen washing their eyes. “As we drove away, the coastguard were pulling up, blue lights flashing. My wife’s eyes were still hurting 30 minutes later, and mine had become sensitive to light. But only when we listened to the radio news did we realise it had developed into a major incident. “When we arrived home a couple of hours later, we washed our clothes and showered. As soon as my wife started washing her hair, her eyes began to hurt once more.” Rebecca Balldock, 21, from St Albans, was on the beach near Beachy Head with friend Jacob Ward, 21, and boyfriend Scott Smith, 20, when the haze arrived. “We were at the beach for the day with the drone to take some photos of the cliffs. We went for a swim and when we got out, our eyes were itching. We thought it was because we’d been swimming in the sea, but it kept getting worse and worse,” she said. “When we were climbing up the steps to get off the beach, we were all crying and could hardly see. People were getting up from the beach and rushing for the stairs to get away. “When we got to to the top, some medics took us to wash our eyes and told us there was a chemical incident. But even when we’d washed our eyes, we were crying again.” Smith first noticed the effects of the haze when his nose became blocked and his eyes started to sting, but said the “mist” was odourless. “We look like we were all crying,” he said. “When we got to the car, some ambulances and two fire engines arrived. We just sped away as quickly as we could.” Police believe Sunday’s incident was an isolated one and investigations to find out the cause were continuing. Sussex Police said: “With another fine day expected for Bank Holiday Monday, thousands of people are expected to flock to the coast once again.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2017/aug/27/broad-appeal-of-new-labour-stance-on-brexit","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-27T17:43:09Z","webTitle":"Broad appeal of Labour’s new stance on Brexit | Letter from David Owen","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/aug/27/broad-appeal-of-new-labour-stance-on-brexit","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/aug/27/broad-appeal-of-new-labour-stance-on-brexit","fields":{"headline":"Broad appeal of Labour’s new stance on Brexit","bodyText":"As a Labour supporter not yet ready to renew my membership, it is good to see Keir Starmer’s position agreed with Jeremy Corbyn.

In the middle of the chaotic, noisy hedonism of carnival, hundreds of volunteers were on the streets from soon after dawn till long after dusk, urging the revellers to wear something green as a mark of mourning and respect for those who died and the hundreds made homeless. The ragged and inspiring response to the Grenfell tragedy in the streets of north Kensington gives us a glimpse of what society really means in practice. It is profoundly disconnected from conventional politics and all the better for that. Conventional politics failed the tower before the blaze and in the chaotic, shameful aftermath as well. Conventional politics represented the tyranny of the smug, the people for whom house prices were a store of wealth and pensions, not an insuperable barrier to a life a little less insecure. Conventional politics tried to lock out the angry survivors from council meetings, and had for years paid huge salaries to local civil servants who failed completely when the hour of crisis came. Many were people who seemed to believe in nothing much except self-advancement according to the rules. The prayers, the songs, the release of doves and the conscription of the colour green to the cause all mark a different kind of politics, one conducted on the basis of emotion and a knowledge of injustice. The spine of this kind of resistance was religious. Whatever some may think of their beliefs – whatever they may think of each other’s beliefs – it was the churches and the mosques of the surrounding communities that first stepped up and have continued with efficient, self-sacrificial zeal to help their neighbours. The families of Grenfell seem to have trusted their religious representatives far more than they trusted their political ones – and who can blame them? Nor can any one party or leader claim their allegiance now. It would certainly have to be earned. Faith groups and other community-based organisations can claim it because they are, after all, entirely voluntary. Those that no one believes in just wither away as the mass membership of political parties once did. Unlike the clicktivism of internet-based movements, the community organisations, faith-based and otherwise, have earned their legitimacy methodically and over time. They did not abandon the poor just because there were no votes in them. In an almost forgotten time before austerity, David Cameron talked up the idea of the big society. That was widely, and as it turned out rightly, derided as a way of coating with nostalgia the decay of the welfare state. Yet what we have seen in and around the tower provides a glimpse of what the big society might actually mean. It is an awkward beast to tame. It can’t do without government. It can’t replace conventional politics entirely, but it doesn’t do what the government wants. It does not have leaders with whom deals can be struck, except in small piecemeal ways. A society that takes account of the marginalised and angry will not be miraculously delivered from conflict as a result. But it will be fairer, more just and less uneasy with itself. That – as well as all the concrete help that still is needed – would be something worth growing from the ashes."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/aug/28/government-has-no-plans-to-fund-coal-power-plant-malcolm-turnbull-says","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-28T10:53:08Z","webTitle":"Government has 'no plans' to fund coal power plant, Malcolm Turnbull says","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/aug/28/government-has-no-plans-to-fund-coal-power-plant-malcolm-turnbull-says","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/aug/28/government-has-no-plans-to-fund-coal-power-plant-malcolm-turnbull-says","fields":{"headline":"Government has 'no plans' to fund coal power plant, Malcolm Turnbull says","bodyText":"Malcolm Turnbull has said the government has “no plans” to fund a coal-fired power station, but refused to rule it out as part of a compromise to help a Clean Energy Target pass the Coalition party room. Appearing on ABC’s 7:30 on Monday Turnbull defended his government’s legacy, saying its interventions in the energy market including gas export controls and funding for the Snowy 2.0 pumped hydro feasibility study showed it was “protecting Australian jobs”. With a rolling in-fight in the Liberal party on religious freedom, Turnbull hedged his bets saying the same-sex marriage postal survey was not a vote on religious freedom but the legislation that would follow a yes vote “will certainly have implications” for it. Turnbull trumpeted the government’s legislative achievements including school funding reform, reintroduction of the building industry watchdog, tax cuts for small and medium businesses, and childcare reform. He said his government’s signature achievement was “ensuring that Australians have got the opportunities to realise their dreams, ensuring that we have a strong economy” citing jobs growth of 240,000 in the last year. Asked if he had betrayed a commitment to free market principles, Turnbull conceded he had “intervened massively” in the gas market but said it had given him “no pleasure” to impose export restrictions, as the government did in April. “I have had to take very strong, heavy-handed measures to protect Australian jobs ... I believe in protecting Australian jobs and in policy that is well-informed.” Asked if the government was prepared to fund new coal-power stations as part of a compromise to pass the Clean Energy Target, Turnbull said the government had “no plans” to do so, and noted its “strong steps” in contributing $8m to a feasibility study for the Snowy Hydro 2.0 pumped hydro scheme. After a follow-up, he refused to rule out funding coal but repeated that the government had “no plans” to do so, noting “there is a market out there with plenty of opportunities to fund additional energy infrastructure”. The government has been under pressure from repeated public lobbying by senior Nationals to bring more coal into the electricity generation system. The environment minister, Josh Frydenberg, has said new high-efficiency low-emission coal power plants have a role in the energy mix and the government is prepared to intervene in the market. Turnbull said the government is aiming to respond by the end of the year to the Finkel review’s recommendation for a Clean Energy Target, citing the need to get a report from the Australian Energy Market Operator about the demand for baseload power first. Asked what would happen if deputy prime minister, Barnaby Joyce, is ruled ineligible to sit in parliament by the high court, Turnbull said he was confident the court would clear him but – if it didn’t – Joyce would win a byelection in New England and the issue would not bring down his government. “The fact is we are very confident, based on the advice we have, that the court will conclude that where a person like Barnaby is an Australian citizen by reason of being born here, the fact that they have had conferred on them by the law of another country citizenship by descent will not disqualify them unless they have acknowledged or accepted that citizenship previously.” Asked if he accepted Tony Abbott’s view that the same-sex marriage postal survey is also a vote on religious freedom or freedom of speech, Turnbull replied: “No, it is a vote on a question of principle – should same-sex couples be able to marry?” He added that “the legislation that follows, assuming it is carried, will certainly have implications for religious freedom”, arguing the Coalition would be “much better able” to protect that freedom than Labor. Although the government has not specified which bill will be used to legalise same-sex marriage in the event of a yes vote, Turnbull said Australians could “trust us to carefully consider those issues and make sure that religious freedoms are protected”. Asked about the government’s continued poor run in the polls, having lost 18 Newspolls in a row, Turnbull said he was “very confident we will win the next election”.

Mohamed is running a small group therapy session, together with Parisa Moayedi, a colleague from Iran. “What do you feel when you get stressed?” Mohamed asks two recently arrived asylum seekers from Somalia. This building housed US servicemen during the cold war. It has been converted into a medical centre with green tile floors and examination rooms for the paediatricians and doctors in charge of screening newly arrived asylum seekers. A sign posted outside lists the distances back to where some of the people milling around the base began their journeys to Germany: Kabul, 5,007km; Damascus, 2,815; Kiev, 1,445. Quietly, a tall, thin young man says he forgets important appointments and loses his appetite. Next to him, another young Somali wearing a pressed button-down shirt and dark jeans says he gets headaches and has trouble concentrating. “That’s good to recognise,” Mohamed says encouragingly. “Can you think of some things you can do to make yourself feel better?” The session is part of the first mission Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) has ever launched within Germany. A pilot project to train refugees as psychosocial peer counsellors, the goal is to teach coping skills and stress management while giving new arrivals someone to talk to about their troubles. Officially launched in March in cooperation with a local hospital in Schweinfurt, the project is one of a small but growing number of programmes aimed at addressing the near-total lack of mental health services for the hundreds of thousands of refugees and asylum seekers who have arrived in Germany since 2015. When the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, gave her “we can do it” speech two years ago, MSF quickly realised there was a huge gap in mental health care - even in wealthy Germany. Many newly arrived refugees suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder; a 2015 estimate by Germany’s largest association of psychotherapists indicated up to 40% of refugees had symptoms of depression or anxiety related to the situation back home or their difficult journeys. Left untreated, such disorders can be crippling, costly and potentially dangerous. Several recent attacks in Germany allegedly involved asylum seekers or refugees with untreated mental health problems. Germany’s mental health care system was strained even before the arrival of hundreds of thousands of migrants from Syria and elsewhere in 2015. “The German system is totally overwhelmed,” says MSF clinical psychologist Henrike Zellmann. “When it comes to prevention and help, there’s almost nothing.” And even if there were enough trained German counsellors to handle the thousands of new arrivals suffering from trauma and depression, language and cultural barriers often conspire to keep refugees from accessing mental health care. German health insurance does not pay for translation services, and many asylum seekers are not even aware that counselling is an option. “In Somalia, there’s no mental health care system, and people often have no idea there’s anyone you can turn to outside family,” says Mohamed. “It’s unbelievably reassuring to talk to someone in their language from their country.” Zellmann says refugees working as psychosocial peer counsellors are poised to play a vital role. Trained counsellors fluent in Arabic, Somali and other languages – and familiar with the culture and situations refugees are coming from – can give people the skills to manage stress and anxiety themselves, before their symptoms get worse. “They had good reasons to leave their homelands, there were difficult experiences on their journey, and being in Germany isn’t easy either,” Zellmann says. “We don’t want to wait until they ask for help.” Zellmann modelled the Schweinfurt project on a similar counselling programme she ran at an MSF camp for displaced Syrians in northern Iraq. The pilot project’s counsellors – Mohamed, a former radio journalist from Mogadishu who arrived in Germany in 2011; Moayedi, a trained social worker from Iran who works with the shelter’s many Farsi-speaking Afghan refugees; and a former English teacher from Aleppo, Syria – went through months of classroom training before seeing their first clients. The counsellors are employed by the local hospital and supervised by trained psychiatrists. An important part of their training is immediately recognising tougher cases – people who are considering suicide, for example – and referring them to doctors. They then accompany patients to translate and explain what is happening. To reach as many people as possible, a one-on-one session is part of the standard intake procedure, like a medical checkup. The sessions are held in a bright, airy room on the second floor of Barrack 209. Boxes of tissues sit atop a low coffee table made of repurposed pallets. In the corner, there’s a small easel and a plastic stegosaurus toy to put children at ease. The meetings are low-key: the peer counsellors introduce themselves and ask new arrivals about themselves, their worries and their journeys. Group therapy sessions are also an important part of the programme. It’s often hard for people to talk about problems in front of strangers, but seeing other people with the same concerns is a huge help. Zellmann observes as Mohamed concludes the group therapy session by asking the men to close their eyes and listen to their heartbeat for three minutes. It’s a standard mindfulness exercise, he explains, one the men can do on their own when they feel overwhelmed. As the minutes tick by, the sound of birdsong and muffled traffic fills the room. The men visibly relax and smile for the first time in the 90-minute session. “When they’re alone and can’t sleep and have nightmares, people start to think they’re crazy and weird and don’t want to talk with their family. That’s where problems really start,” Zellmann says as the men leave, chatting with one another. “It’s good to know there are others in the same situation. That’s why education is so important.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"crosswords/crossword-blog/2017/aug/28/crossword-roundup-who-coined-the-term-neologism","type":"article","sectionId":"crosswords","sectionName":"Crosswords","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-28T11:15:26Z","webTitle":"Crossword roundup: Who coined the term 'neologism'?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/crossword-blog/2017/aug/28/crossword-roundup-who-coined-the-term-neologism","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/crosswords/crossword-blog/2017/aug/28/crossword-roundup-who-coined-the-term-neologism","fields":{"headline":"Crossword roundup: Who coined the term 'neologism'?","bodyText":"The news in clues The setter Punk – known locally as Paul (Q&amp;A here) – seems to be discussing national affairs in an Independent clue ... 4d/25d Political institution dispensing with French leader from afar, Marine Le Pen up to no good (8,10) [ AFAR, minus first letter of FRENCH, plus MARINELEPENUPTO, all anagrammed (‘no good’) ] [ anag. of AARMARINELEPENUPTO ] ... which in fact refers to the institution of the “supranational binding decision”, the EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT.

He’s not wrong. It wasn’t long ago that Jamie Adenuga was making beats in his bedroom using the forgotten Snes game Mario Paint, doing a degree in digital design and driving around cardboard boxes of self-released CDs to give to independent record shops. In grime’s pirate radio days in the mid-00s, once it was clear no one beyond Dizzee, Kano and Wiley were about to be signed, there wasn’t much choice beyond giving up or DIY independence. Adenuga defiantly made a virtue of the latter, with phenomenal – if not immediate – success. Twelve years after the crew was founded, built around Jme and his Mercury-winning older brother Skepta, Boy Better Know have ascended to the state of pop cultural grace that allows for a day-long takeover of the O2 complex: not just the 20,000-capacity main arena, but its many side-rooms, alcoves and cubby holes too. Everything but the All Bar One. Grime really is at its US-rap-in-1992 crossover moment now. Even a couple of years ago, it was inconceivable that you might have seen eight-year-old children in baggy Wiley T-shirts, accompanied by their parents, turning up for a bank holiday outing to a grime festival – with the opportunity for on-site dinner at a Harvester beforehand. The entirety of the North Greenwich peninsula seems to have been swamped by excitable teenage boys wearing man-bags and using slang they picked up on YouTube. It’s effectively a one-day festival, offering much more than just live PAs from grime’s better-known names. Among other things there is the tantalising offer of afternoon rollerskating to legendary American garage DJ Todd “the God” Edwards, in the Tropical Roller Disco. Only 25 people or so are in there, but it’s a surreal treat nonetheless. Elsewhere there’s the unique opportunity to play Jme at Call of Duty in the gaming room and a five-a-side football tournament going on in the late-summer sunshine, while Big Zuu and Logan Sama host the next generation of grime MCs at an outdoor stage next to the pitch. It is all a bit silly. But if you’re going to relocate a genre rooted in low-ceilinged clubs with dim lighting and juddering sub-bass to the massive suburban shopping mall that is the O2, you may as well do it warts and all, with a sense of fun. In the main arena Tim Westwood is the between-acts DJ, and if few of the teenagers know who he is, they do recognise his crowdpleasing selection of recent American rap anthems. Rising French afro trap rapper MHD is sensational, effervescent and funky, but the language barrier sadly seems too much of an obstacle, giving rise to the weird dynamic of Westwood’s between-sets bangers du jour being more popular than the live acts either side of them. With A$AP Rocky cancelling at the last minute, the final support act J Hus immediately has the crowd captivated; the young rapper’s beguiling blend of Afrobeats and grime, singing and MCing quickly has the crowd moshing to Clartin, and attempting a skank on the garage-tinged Plotting. His hype man announces this is J Hus’s first ever London show, which sounds like it must be a mistake – he was born barely a couple of miles away from this venue and has been getting plaudits on the underground scene for a couple of years at least; but like Giggs before him, a de facto (though unofficial) Met police blacklisting has stifled his live career so far. It’s a bizarrely overdue London debut for a Mercury-nominated artist, but all the more triumphant for it. As the headline crew, Boy Better Know aren’t about to take any risks: this isn’t their first festival-sized show, and they’ve learned to tailor their set to chant-along anthems, following Skepta’s focused, clear-voiced path in particular. So the godfather Wiley shows up and is a consummate professional, delivering Speaker Box and Can’t Go Wrong with his usual energy but none of his erratic behaviour of the past. There are a flurry of Skepta tunes: the three key anthems from Konnichiwa – Man, Shutdown and That’s Not Me – as well as new track Hypocrisy, and Lethal Bizzle turns up to perform I Win with him. Jme brings out Giggs for Man Don’t Care – perhaps the tune of the night – and Giggs then ups the ante and brings out Drake for KMT. The Canadian megastar is wisely restricted to one tune rather than being allowed to overshadow his hosts, and the show is notably lacking in ridiculous pyrotechnics, visuals or stagecraft. This is an ensemble show, and a homecoming show, and if BBK have really become the first grime super-brand, then it’s hard not to be impressed that they’ve done so by thoroughly rejecting the music industry and – tropical roller disco and five-a-side football tournament notwithstanding – sticking to grime’s original pirate radio formula. One DJ, a few MCs passing the mic – and the musicians themselves in full control."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/aug/28/kangaroo-island-koala-cull-rejected-by-south-australian-government","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-28T06:50:18Z","webTitle":"Kangaroo Island koala cull rejected by South Australian government","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/aug/28/kangaroo-island-koala-cull-rejected-by-south-australian-government","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/aug/28/kangaroo-island-koala-cull-rejected-by-south-australian-government","fields":{"headline":"Kangaroo Island koala cull rejected by South Australian government","bodyText":"Koala numbers on Kangaroo Island have more than tripled over five years but the South Australian government has rebuffed calls to cull the animals, saying they can be managed through existing sterilisation programs. Koalas were introduced to Kangaroo Island in the 1920s because of concerns they were facing extinction from hunting and habitat destruction on the mainland. Eighteen animals grew to tens of thousands by 1997, when the SA government instituted a koala management plan to curb koala numbers in an effort to preserve the shrinking manna gum habitat. The management plan involved sterilising adult female koalas and in some cases moving the sterilised females to manna gum forests south-east of Adelaide, providing some relief for the Kangaroo Island trees. Between 1997 and 2016, about 12,500 koalas were sterilised and about 3,800 were relocated. The population dropped from 27,000 in 2001 to 13,000 in 2010 but modelling done by the University of Adelaide based on 2015 survey data found the number had since grown to about 50,000. The final results of that survey have not been released but the Department of Environment, Water and Natural Resources regional manager for Adelaide and the Mount Lofty ranges, Brenton Grear, said the estimates appeared to be accurate. It has prompted calls by the state MP for the island to hold a koala cull, a proposal that the ABC reports has been backed by the Conservation Council of SA. Grear said the massive increase in numbers would prompt the department to review its plans but that a cull was not on the cards. He said one option could be moving from surgical sterilisation to a hormonal treatment, which has been successfully trialled in south-western Victoria. “You might have to do more sterilisation, you might have to look at techniques around sterilisation that are more effective,” he told Guardian Australia. Under-skin hormonal implants, similar to contraceptive implants available to women, can be delivered “at the bottom of the tree” and are much quicker and cheaper than surgery. Grear said culling koalas would be contrary to both state and federal policy and would take a massive public information campaign to convince locals and tourists that it was an effective idea. On top of that, he said, you would have to be assured that the animals could be culled humanely. SA allows the commercial harvesting and culling of kangaroos and some other native species but Grear said that, despite not being native to Kangaroo Island, koalas were still placed in “a different category to other native animals”. A spokeswoman for the SA environment minister, Ian Hunt, said it was not government policy to cull koalas and that the sterilisation program would be extended. “Culling will never happen,” Deakin University wildlife and conservation lecturer Dr Desley Whisson said. “It becomes a political issue. We do cull other populations of other species but I don’t think the public will ever support a cull of koalas.” Whisson managed Kangaroo Island’s koala program for a number of years and said it had a finely tuned sterilisation program that involved sending out a team of koala wranglers every year to find and catch female koalas and send them to a vet, who would perform the keyhole surgery to cut the oviduct. The whole procedure, from capture to release, took about five hours. In 2015-16 Natural Resources Kangaroo Island caught 517 female koalas, or 6.9 a day. Of those, 503 were sterilised, 10 had already been sterilised and four were euthanised due to poor health. Whisson said it was “plausible” that the koala population had grown by 37,000 in five years but it was also possible that previous surveys had underestimated the population by discounting the bluegum plantations, which the most recent survey found were prime koala habitat. Booming koala numbers in south-west Victoria are linked to the growth of bluegum plantations, which are a favourite koala food tree along with manna gums. Grear said problems on Kangaroo Island were caused not by the sheer number of koalas but by their density in specific locations, particularly the vulnerable manna gum forests. Preliminary results from the 2015 survey showed the densities were at “acceptable” levels in the manna gum forests but unacceptable levels in the bluegum plantation, which is ready to be harvested. Whisson said that targeting the sterilisation program on the manna gum forests would leave those areas open to “constant invasion” by koalas from other areas of the island moving toward their preferred food. “You might sterilise or translocate koalas out of those areas but there will be others that want to come in,” she said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/aug/28/adelaide-councils-push-to-scrap-australia-day-ceremony-unlikely-to-pass-mayor-says","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-28T05:31:28Z","webTitle":"Marion council’s push to scrap Australia Day ceremony unlikely to pass, mayor says","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/aug/28/adelaide-councils-push-to-scrap-australia-day-ceremony-unlikely-to-pass-mayor-says","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/aug/28/adelaide-councils-push-to-scrap-australia-day-ceremony-unlikely-to-pass-mayor-says","fields":{"headline":"Marion council’s push to scrap Australia Day ceremony unlikely to pass, mayor says","bodyText":"A push for an Adelaide council to follow two inner-city Melbourne councils in scrapping Australia Day celebrations and citizenship ceremony is not supported by the majority of residents and unlikely to pass, the City of Marion mayor, Kris Hanna, has said. On 26 September, Marion council is scheduled to debate the proposed change, which is based on a motion passed by Melbourne’s Darebin council. The most significant of the proposed changes is moving the annual 26 January citizenship ceremony to another, less contentious date. Yarra and the neighbouring Melbourne council of Darebin were stripped of their right to hold any citizenship ceremonies by the federal government after changing their ceremony date, which the government branded “utterly out of step with Australian values”. Hanna said the council had done “zero” consultation on the issue but his sense from talking to residents was that they would not support it. He did not plan to vote on the motion unless there was call for a casting vote, but said he did not support it and saw it as council overstepping its bounds. “I am not against having the debate but it needs to happen at a national level,” Hanna told Guardian Australia. “I actually don’t think it’s helpful for a council to get ahead of the public.” The City of Marion has a population of about 90,000 and is located about 10km from the Adelaide CBD in the coastal south-western suburbs. Hanna said the council had a good relationship with the local Kaurna people and was “committed to reconciliation”. Councillor Bruce Hull, who proposed the motion, told the Advertiser that changing the date would recognise the hurt felt by many Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples at celebrating the day Australia was formally colonised. Hanna said local government should focus on local issues. “I have been encouraging our councillors just to focus on local issues, on making the quality of life better for our residents, and not getting into ideological debates,” he said. “My sense is that if you want to get involved in those ideological issues – and there are a lot of worthy ones – you should get into state or federal parliament.” The Nationals leader, Barnaby Joyce, agreed, telling reporters in Adelaide on Monday that councils should stick to “rubbish and roads”. “Every time a council decides their job is not to look after rubbish and roads but some social engineering for our nation, it is just garbage,” he said. Melbourne’s Yarra council voted unanimously on 15 August in support of not holding a citizenship ceremony on 26 January, referring to Australia Day as “January 26” in all official council documents, and replacing the traditional celebrations with a culturally appropriate event focused on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander history and perspectives. It was stripped of its right to hold any future citizenship ceremonies the next day. Darebin council followed a week later and was similarly stripped. The assistant immigration minister, Alex Hawke, has warned that any council that refuses to hold a citizenship ceremony on 26 January, the most popular day of the year for migrants to become Australian citizens, would be considered in breach of the Australian Citizenship Ceremonies Code and have its power to hold ceremonies revoked. Nine months ago Western Australia’s Fremantle council announced plans to shift its citizenship ceremony to 28 January, only to move it back following government pressure. Fremantle did, however, scrap its Australia Day celebrations in favour of the One Day celebrations on 28 January this year."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/aug/28/wa-criticises-incredibly-naive-plan-to-drug-test-welfare-recipients-in-mandurah","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-28T06:55:10Z","webTitle":"WA criticises 'incredibly naive' plan to drug test welfare recipients in Mandurah","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/aug/28/wa-criticises-incredibly-naive-plan-to-drug-test-welfare-recipients-in-mandurah","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/aug/28/wa-criticises-incredibly-naive-plan-to-drug-test-welfare-recipients-in-mandurah","fields":{"headline":"WA criticises 'incredibly naive' plan to drug test welfare recipients in Mandurah","bodyText":"The Western Australian state government has attacked plans to trial drug testing of welfare recipients in Mandurah, describing the proposal as “incredibly naive”. Western Australia is now the second state Labor government to voice its opposition to the drug-testing trial, after Victoria refused in June to play any role in what it described as cheap populism. Speaking at the WA Labor state conference, the state’s community services minister, Simone McGurk, said punishing drug users through the welfare system would not address addiction. “I think what a lot of families who are experiencing the effects of drug and alcohol abuse, particularly methamphetamine, understand is that it’s quite a complex issue,” she said. “To think you can do one policy change and it will solve the problem is incredibly naive,” she said. She warned the measure could increase homelessness and crime by threatening the income of already vulnerable Australians, a similar opinion to that expressed by welfare groups and frontline workers. “What we need is a comprehensive range of approaches to effectively approach drug and alcohol abuse, particularly effective rehabilitation, early access to those rehabilitations services,” McGurk said. “I do have concerns that cutting off people from income support could have just a detrimental effect on those people, and not lead them to seek help and rehabilitation,” she said. The government has already announced Logan in Queensland and Bankstown-Canterbury in Sydney as trial sites, despite not having secured the bill’s passage through the Senate. The trial would see welfare recipients who test positive to an initial test placed on income management, in the form of a cashless welfare card. The card would restrict the way they can spend 80% of their income support. A second failed test would see the welfare recipient referred to treatment and forced to cover the cost of drug tests. If they fail to engage in treatment, their welfare payments could be stopped. The proposal has been condemned by drug policy researchers, physicians, psychiatrists, the Australian Medical Association and frontline drug treatment services. On Sunday, the human services minister, Alan Tudge, hit back at the proposal’s critics. “My main response to those medical professionals and to the Labor party who are criticising this, is that this is a trial in the very sense of the word, where we want to try something new, evaluate it, and if it works then we might roll it out further,” Tudge told Sky News. “If it does not work then we adjust. That is how you do a trial. By the way, all medical advances are done on this basis, of trial and error. And if it is good for health policy, why isn’t it good for social policy to do it this way?” South Australia and Queensland declined to comment on the plan when contacted by Guardian Australia last week."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/aug/28/advocates-and-churches-vow-to-fight-cuts-to-asylum-seeker-support","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-28T02:10:26Z","webTitle":"Advocates and churches vow to fight cuts to asylum seeker support","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/aug/28/advocates-and-churches-vow-to-fight-cuts-to-asylum-seeker-support","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/aug/28/advocates-and-churches-vow-to-fight-cuts-to-asylum-seeker-support","fields":{"headline":"Advocates and churches vow to fight cuts to asylum seeker support","bodyText":"Community groups, refugee advocacy organisations and churches have vowed to throw open their doors in support of any refugees and asylum seekers cut off from government support or evicted as a result of changed visa rules. “We’re not going to let these people starve. We’re not going to let these people go homeless,” the Asylum Seeker Resource Centre’s chief executive, Kon Karapanagiotidis, said after news of the changes emerged over the weekend. “We’re not going to let these people go back to Manus and Nauru. We’re going to fight back. We together are going to rally again. Ian Rintoul, from the Refugee Action Coalition, told Guardian Australia there was “a small army of people” around the country who would would help asylum seekers and refugees with housing, income, legal representation or anything else they needed. One hundred refugees and asylum seekers in Australia have been instructed to meet with the immigration department this week and have been told they will be issued with a “final departure bridging E visa” before being returned to Manus or Nauru. They lost all government payments – currently $300 a fortnight – from Monday, and will be given three weeks to leave government-supplied housing. Refugees and asylum seekers will have access to Medicare and will be allowed to work, and children will be able to attend school. But when the visa expires they will be expected to return to either Manus or Nauru, or abandon their protection claim and return to their country of origin. The first 60 appointments began at 9am on Monday. The 100 are among about 400 refugees and asylum seekers who have been brought to Australia from Manus and Nauru for medical treatment, including complex surgery and long-term mental health treatment, or to give birth. Some have been victims of rape and assault offshore. The 400 also include 37 babies born in Australia. Many of those in Australia have court orders requiring the government to give 72 hours’ notice if they are to be returned offshore. Courts across the country have been told that to forcibly send them offshore would be to “return them to danger”. None of these court orders have been challenged by the government. The immigration minister, Peter Dutton, said asylum seekers and refugees had been exploiting the system in Australia, but that “the con is up”. He told News Corp, “they were brought to Australia on the premise that once their medical needs were met they would return to Nauru or Manus. “The medical care has been provided and through tricky legal moves they are now prevented from being returned to their country of origin, Manus or Nauru.” At a press conference in Melbourne on Monday the opposition leader, Bill Shorten, said it was “cowardly and cruel” to treat people who had come to Australia for medical treatment badly. “Any person who’s sick and ill and requires Australian assistance in Australia should get that assistance. That’s not about politics, it’s just about being a decent human being. “I say to you, Malcolm [Turnbull]: we want these people resettled in third-party nations, we want to see the US deal come off, we don’t want to see the people smugglers back in business. But do you really have to make a hero of yourself by mistreating in a weak, cowardly and cruel fashion the most vulnerable people in the world?” According to the Australian National Audit Office it costs $573,000 to hold a single person in offshore detention for one year. The auditor says it costs about $100,000 to house someone in community detention, and about $40,000 to have someone living on a bridging visa. Speaking on Sydney radio 2GB on Monday, Dutton agreed with presenter Alan Jones that lawyers who represented asylum seekers in such cases were “un-Australian”, Fairfax Media reported. The government has made it harder for refugees and asylum seekers requiring high-level medical care to get to Australia for treatment. More than 50 people – including three pregnant women – have been refused, or not even considered for, medical transfer, after doctors recommended they be moved off the island. Rintoul said refugee advocacy organisations had been mobilised by the government’s sudden announcement of the new visa regimen, with offers of housing, income, food and other essentials. “There is a whole army of people who have responded to this, organisations and individuals; there’s been an enormous response.” On social media, people have offered rooms in their homes, food and clothing. Tim O’Connor, from the Refugee Council of Australia, said refugees and asylum seekers living in the community – even those who had not received notices – feared they would be left destitute by this proposed change. “People are terrified, these announcements cause great anxiety, because no one seems to know exactly who this is going to affect, or who’s going to be next. Our members are working with the people who have been affected to assist them, and trying to calm the anguish of those who won’t be affected but who fear they might be next. We’re seeking clarification on who is being targeted and we are co-ordinating with community groups, with lawyers, politicians and with the very vulnerable people directly under attack.” Government “fact sheets” about the new final departure bridging visa have been sent only to single men and women so far. But the documents address the rights of children, giving rise to concern that family groups will be targeted next. “We’ve already had generous Australians contacting us, wanting to offer financial and other support directly to those people affected.” The Australian Churches Refugee Taskforce acting executive officer, Caz Coleman, said the organisation was “definitely concerned” by the changed situation of asylum seekers and refugees in Australia. “The removal of financial aid is a deep concern and we will be working to support people in any way.” Hugh de Kretser, the executive director of the Human Rights Law Centre – which represents most of the affected people – described it as a “cruel new policy” designed to “coerce people back to danger”. He said the government must abandon the policy. “These are people who came to our country seeking safety after fleeing persecution, enduring harm on Nauru and Manus and finally getting a chance to rebuild their lives,” de Krester said. “This is an incredibly cruel policy and it seems that it’s a policy that will be applied to the entire group of 400 … this group includes women who were sexually assaulted on Nauru, men badly bashed on Manus and children so traumatised they’ve needed urgent medical assistance. “These people finally have had the chance to rebuild their lives in the Australian community and some of them have been here for years.” Natasha Blucher, the detention advocacy manager for the Asylum Seeker Resource Centre, said people would be effectively left homeless, some with as little as $10 in their bank accounts. “Parents are desperately worried about how they will feed their children. It will end with children homeless.” The opposition immigration spokesman, Shayne Neumann, earlier said Labor was reviewing whether it could reverse the decision, describing it as “cruel” and “heartless”. “We will look at whether it is possible to disallow this in the Senate,” Neumann told ABC radio. Greens immigration spokesman Nick McKim said his party was exploring whether parliament could stop the measure. “We will be taking advice about whether any aspect of what the government is proposing to do is disallowable,” McKim said. “And if it is, then we will move in the Senate on the first day back [in parliament] to disallow it.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"media/2017/aug/28/us-broadcaster-cbs-agrees-buy-australia-ten-network","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-27T23:58:00Z","webTitle":"US broadcaster CBS agrees to buy Australia's Ten Network","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/aug/28/us-broadcaster-cbs-agrees-buy-australia-ten-network","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2017/aug/28/us-broadcaster-cbs-agrees-buy-australia-ten-network","fields":{"headline":"US broadcaster CBS agrees to buy Australia's Ten Network","bodyText":"The US media and entertainment giant CBS has agreed to buy the Ten network, which has been in receivership since July. The surprise bid comes after billionaires Lachlan Murdoch and Bruce Gordon had appeared poised to buy Ten after getting clearance from the competition regulator last week, subject to media ownership laws. The $28bn CBS Corporation, a long-term provider of content to Ten, owns CBS Television Network, cable networks, content production and distribution, television stations, internet-based businesses and consumer publishing. Network Ten receiver and manager Christopher Hill said: “Network Ten has played a significant role in Australia’s media landscape over many decades, and the sale of the business to CBS will allow the iconic broadcaster to move into a new chapter on a strong and stable footing.” The deal would also allow CBS to launch its streaming service CBS All Access in the Australian market, the US company said in a statement. CBS said the purchase was part of its expansion plans in the English-speaking world. The chairman of CBS, Leslie Moonves, said Ten was a strong brand with a 50-year history. “We have been able to acquire it at a valuation that gives us confidence we will grow this asset by applying our programming expertise in a market with which we are already familiar,” he said. The US network says it will supply its own content as well as produce Australian sport, drama, reality and news. The future of Australian soap opera Neighbours remains unclear. The purchase is subject to regulatory approval. It would not be the first time under foreign ownership for Ten. It was 50% owned by Canadian company CanWest until it sold its stake in 2009 after going broke. Once known as the Simpsons network, Ten pursued a youth strategy in the 2000s and enjoyed success with Big Brother, Australian Idol and Neighbours. But when multi-channelling was introduced to free-to-air TV Ten lost its hold over the 16-to-30 demographic and began to falter. The network entered into a period of instability with constant management changes and mass redundancies. Ten chairman Lachlan Murdoch was brought in as CEO and made further changes to its strategy, but they failed to stabilise the network’s ratings or revenue, resulting in serious financial challenges this year. Receivers PPB Advisory were appointed by the Commonwealth Bank in June over a $200m debt falling due in December, and no longer guaranteed by shareholders Murdoch and Gordon."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"fashion/2017/aug/29/welcome-to-the-house-of-dior-from-the-new-look-to-miranda-kerrs-wedding-dress","type":"article","sectionId":"fashion","sectionName":"Fashion","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-29T04:19:57Z","webTitle":"Welcome to the House of Dior: from the New Look to Miranda Kerr's wedding dress","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2017/aug/29/welcome-to-the-house-of-dior-from-the-new-look-to-miranda-kerrs-wedding-dress","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/fashion/2017/aug/29/welcome-to-the-house-of-dior-from-the-new-look-to-miranda-kerrs-wedding-dress","fields":{"headline":"Welcome to the House of Dior: from the New Look to Miranda Kerr's wedding dress","bodyText":"The two strapless gowns stand side by side. One is scarlet, its tightly sculpted bodice descending to a full skirt that flares from the hip. The other has a brightly coloured beaded bodice topped with a full African-style bead collar and a skirt of stiff fabric petals shooting out from the waist in a riotous burst of red, orange and yellow. The first was designed by Belgian Raf Simons, the second by UK designer John Galliano. The two could not be more different and yet they share a heritage and a fashion language: both were designed for the French fashion house Dior. Both gowns are featured in the National Gallery of Victoria’s The House of Dior: 70 Years of Haute Couture, which opened in Melbourne last weekend. The magnificent exhibition celebrates 70 years of fashion since designer Christian Dior presented his first couture collection in Paris. There have been six designers since then, who have each reinterpreted Dior’s aesthetic, as well as his ideas about women, fashion and society, and this exhibition charts the creative twists and turns as the label evolved into one of the world’s leading brands. The NGV exhibition is distinct from the 70th anniversary exhibition that opened at the Musée des Arts Décoratifs in Paris in July – and it’s a coup for the gallery. Often Australian galleries get the tail end of these exhibitions when they crisscross the globe; this time, it was the NGV that got in first. Speaking at the media launch, Dior Homme president, Serge Brunschwig, said the gallery approached the house about four years ago, prompting the Dior team to start thinking about their own plans to mark the anniversary. “If ever there was a moment to pitch the idea to do something like this for audiences, where there is the capacity to reflect back on a substantial number of decades and to say something hopefully intelligent out of all of that, the time is now,” said exhibition curator Katie Somerville. Designer Raf Simons’s very different take on a red scarlet gown (front) from his predecessor John Galliano’s (back), as displayed in the NGV’s The House of Dior: Seventy Years of Haute Couture. The exhibition also bears the hallmarks of NGV director Tony Ellwood, who was the driving force behind the popular Valentino retrospective in 2010 when he was director at Brisbane’s Gallery of Modern Art. It was also on his watch that the NGV mounted the highly successful Jean Paul Gaultier exhibition in 2015. With visitors in their hundreds of thousands, Ellwood and his teams know that fashion sells tickets. The gallery has been collecting fashion items since the 40s, with curatorial teams arriving in the 60s. Its first Dior item, a hat, was purchased in 1972; there are now about 40 Dior items in the NGV collection, 20 of which are in this exhibition. The exhibition brings together more than 140 Dior items, borrowed from the house archives and from institutions including New York’s Metropolitan Museum, London’s V&amp;A, the Kyoto Costume Institute and Paris’s Musee des Artes Decoratifs. Private collectors have contributed, including American Vogue journalist Hamish Bowles and Sydney barrister and legendary couture collector Louise McBride – and at the very last minute, Australian model Miranda Kerr agreed to loan her wedding dress. Christian Dior’s early gowns, in the NGV’s House of Dior exhibition. Visitors enter through a slim avenue lined with tall mirrored window panels. At the far end is an enormous black and white photograph of Dior’s Paris headquarters at 30 Avenue Montaigne in Paris. Set in front of the house is a faceless mannequin dressed in a white satin jacket with a nipped-in waist over a voluminous black pleated skirt. This is the house’s defining look, debuted by the young designer in his first couture collection in Paris in 1947, and christened by fashion editor Carmel Snow as “the New Look”. With its emphasis on femininity, the New Look shook up the fashion world and was swiftly copied. It established the brand, but the attention also revitalised the postwar Paris fashion industry and made Dior a national hero. After the avenue, the first exhibition room is dedicated to the founder of the label, and stepping into the plushly carpeted room with its grey panelled walls is like stepping into the house on Avenue Montaigne. Here are more of the dresses with their tiny waists that made Dior famous but, says Somerville, the New Look was not limited to evening gowns. “It’s not necessarily all about gratuitous meterage of tulle and beading and silks and satins. A lot of those pieces are about incredible tailoring, beautiful checked wools and velvets, and a much more structured approach to design. All the clues are there early on in terms of the things that were important, and underpinned how he then moved forward as a designer.” The next space is divided into the four codes of the house; the signature elements that each designer draws on to make a Dior outfit Dior. The line, flowers, the 18th century and of course, the New Look have all been reinterpreted countless times by each of the designers in their own way. More John Galliano for Dior gowns, including Nicole Kidman’s 1997 Oscar dress, in the NGV’s House of Dior exhibition. The cleverly designed space has been split with a mezzanine level. At the centre is a dramatic staircase, modelled after the same in Dior’s head office, where famous clients such as Marlene Dietrich would perch to watch the couture collections each season. At the exhibition it’s not just for dramatic effect; it allows visitors to reach the mezzanine level, and to see each of the 32 gowns from every angle. From this room, visitors enter the atelier, a space dedicated to the craftsmanship of couture. On one side is a bright red belted coat flanked by mannequins wearing white toiles, the first cut of a couture pattern. On the other side, two Dior artisans sit at a bench, demonstrating the painstaking detailing that makes up each couture outfit. These are the highly skilled yet often unrecognised and mostly female seamstresses who, each day, don their white coats and bring the designer’s most fanciful couture creations to life. The Dior Reinvented room showcases the six designers who took on the behemoth brand and made it their own. Yves Saint Laurent was only 21 when he was thrust into the spotlight as designer following Dior’s sudden death, and here are some of the distinct gowns he created to great acclaim as he ushered in a new era at Dior. Saint Laurent only lasted for six couture collections, before Marc Bohan took over. Although a lesser-known figure in the Dior pantheon, Bohan steered the house for the longest stretch from 1960 to 1989. “He presented a very classical silhouette, very wearable couture which found a great deal of support within the community,” says Somerville. The flamboyant Italian designer Gianfranco Ferré took over in 1989, creating “some of the most theatrical and spectacular gowns in the history of the house”, before the arrival of the inimitable John Galliano in 1996. Six different interpretations of the House of Dior: couture gowns (from top, left to right) by Yves Saint Laurent, Marc Bohan, Gianfranco Ferre, John Galliano, Raf Simons and Maria Grazia Chiuri. The British designer was the creator of some of the most recognisable Dior gowns, including Nicole Kidman’s 1997 lime-green Oriental Oscar gown. “[Galliano] was very much a man who loved the history of fashion and the storytelling capacity of using fashion to tell rich stories,” says Somerville. “He also loved the tradition of couture and reflected that in the way he constructed his garments and the incredible technical detail of these pieces.” After Galliano was dismissed in disgrace in 2011, Belgian designer Raf Simons held the top job for seven couture collections. He had a very different approach to his predecessors. “His approach is much more simplistic and modern,” says Somerville. “It still is very much about paying homage to the original heritage of the house, key lines and silhouettes, but reducing them to the most pure and simple form.” And then in 2016 the first female creative director, Italian Maria Grazia Chiuri, stepped into the top job. Chiuri wants to reinvent the house and redraw its concept of femininity. “It’s about women finding themselves within what they see rather than the imposed idea of femininity.” Although it is well compensated, the role of the creative director is not easy. The designer has been charged with balancing heritage with contemporary culture, honouring those identifiable codes within modern and relevant garments. Oh, and they’ve got to sell the frocks. It is a tall order, beset with challenges – which perhaps explains some of the departures. Raf Simons coat and toiles for Dior, in the NGV’s House of Dior exhibition. After the profusion of gowns comes all those things that complete an outfit – and the Top to Toe room is dedicated to the shoes, the fragrances and the hats of Dior. UK milliner Stephen Jones, who was in attendance at the opening, has worked with the latest three Dior designers. He says each brought their distinct design approach to the hats for their couture collections. “With John [Galliano] each hat had to tell a story … while Raf [Simons] was “an essay in modernity,” he says. Chiuri likes to try on the hats herself, so “it’s very much about the reality but she loves the fantasy as well.” When asked about his favourite Dior hat, Jones points to the grey suede hat from Dior’s autumn winter 2007 couture collection, styled as a paint palette and seemingly pinned to the head with a long paintbrush. The palette look is completed by deceptively simple “paint” daubs, actually deluxe paillette embroidery by craftsman Cécile Henri. “The little paint splodges in sequins were maybe the most expensive thing in the collection. They cost about €2,000 each one, and I got into such trouble for that,” says Jones with a laugh. “But anyway, what price beauty?” Milliner Stephen Jones’s favourite hat from the Dior autumn-winter 2007-2008 couture show held in Versailles. The room is also a subtle tribute to the business side of the brand, and for all the glamour, this is unquestionably big business. Dior is part of the mighty French luxury company LVMH, and last year the Christian Dior group reported revenue of €39bn , with profit at €7.3bn. Couture itself posted revenues of €1,936m, but the engines of the business are the accessories, jewellery, perfume and beauty lines. Last year the fashion and leather goods posted a revenue of €12,775m, while perfumes and cosmetics posted €4,953m. Somerville says the importance of running a successful business came straight from Dior himself. His father was a wealthy fertiliser manufacturer and although the young Dior had no intention of joining the family business, being surrounded by businessmen clearly had an influence. “Being in a family home with uncles, a father and key figures in the household for whom business was a way of life, and discussion in the house [about business strategy], I feel, must have in some way informed the way he thought about his opportunity when it came along,” said Somerville. “[Thinking about] how to sustain and remain relevant and how to find your clientele, and keep them.” The next room showcases the brand’s Australian connection – and it is a significant one. A year after his landmark 1947 showing, the designer sent his first collection abroad, to David Jones in Sydney. The fashion house repeated the exercise in 1957, this time sending a contingent of house models to showcase the collections. Reportedly there was much excitement in Sydney and Melbourne at the time, as the glamorous women arrived to present the dresses to Australian society. The final room filled with gowns in the NGV’s House of Dior: Seventy Years of Haute Couture exhibition. Svetlana Lloyd was one of that select group of models. Now in her 80s and based in London, she remembers the trip as great fun. Speaking at the media event, she said: “Being the only model who spoke English, I was privileged in that I was entertained a lot, and therefore feted – and I enjoyed every minute of it.” The final room is the most spectacular. In the centre, three levels of gowns are set on a circular platform, revolving slowly to showcase the storied history. The centrepiece is an instantly recognisable crystal-encrusted midnight-blue gown. Around the room, the oldest gowns sit alongside those straight from the 2017 presentation. In one corner is a short black velvet gown with lace detail designed by Monsieur Dior in 1957, while directly opposite is Miranda Kerr’s white satin wedding dress, designed by Chiuri and worn only a few months ago. Designer Maria Gracia Chiuri has an entirely different approach to designing for Dior. Seen together with their peers, it’s clear the early designs are still as elegant and covetable as those created this year. On Saturday night, there was a fundraising gala at the gallery to celebrate the opening of the exhibition. The well-heeled, including Nicole Kidman, Elizabeth Olsen, Rachel Griffiths, Tina Arena, Kate Cebrano and Kimbra, turned out in full force. Models, bloggers, fashion editors, designers and the fashion-intrigued mingled, admiring and critiquing their fellow partygoers’ outfits over the rims of their champagne glasses. There were short, tight frocks, frothy creations of tulle and lace, towering heels and occasionally treacherous satin trains, offset by men in black tie. A blogger in tiny sequinned shorts stood back to back with an older man in top hat and tails. Yet for all the star power in the room, it was the gowns on display that commanded the most attention. Throughout the night, the guests drifted away from the party and wandered through the exhibition just one more time, standing to gaze at the real stars of the night as they silently held court. • The House of Dior: 70 Years of Haute Couture is on at the NGV International now until 7 November"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/aug/28/pelvic-mesh-victims-disgusted-at-suggestion-of-sodomy-as-solution","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-28T07:05:38Z","webTitle":"Pelvic mesh victims disgusted at suggestion of anal sex as solution","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/aug/28/pelvic-mesh-victims-disgusted-at-suggestion-of-sodomy-as-solution","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/aug/28/pelvic-mesh-victims-disgusted-at-suggestion-of-sodomy-as-solution","fields":{"headline":"Pelvic mesh victims disgusted at suggestion of anal sex as solution","bodyText":"Australian victims of faulty pelvic mesh implants have expressed disgust at doctors’ suggestions of anal intercourse as a solution to their ruined sex lives. A disturbing email exchange between doctors emerged earlier this month as part of a federal court class action in Australia, which was launched by hundreds of women who had the devices implanted to treat common childbirth complications. The devices, manufactured by pharmaceutical giant Johnson &amp; Johnson, caused chronic and debilitating pain, including during intercourse. The emails reflected a callous attitude towards women among French gynaecologists involved with the company. In the emails, doctors talk about alternatives to sex for women suffering painful intercourse. “It is no less true that sodomy could be a good alternative!” one doctor wrote. Another discussed the difficulty of raising sexual matters with his patients. “I said to myself, there you go, for your next prolapse [patient], you talk to her about orgasms. OK! But also about fellatio, sodomy, the clitoris with or without G-spot etc,” he wrote. “I am sure of one thing: that I would very quickly be treated like some kind of sex maniac (which, perhaps, I am) or a pervert, or an unhealthily curious person.” The attitudes accord with evidence before the current Senate inquiry into the devices, which has heard women were advised to consider anal intercourse as a solution to the extreme pain caused by intercourse. The comments outraged members of the Australian Pelvic Mesh Support Group, which sent Guardian Australia a collection of anonymised responses from women to the revelations. Many of the women said they had encountered similar attitudes from their own doctors. “My husband and I were given advice [about] sexual activity,” one woman said. “We were gobsmacked. The whole sexual deviation thing is supposed to make the pain and complications from mesh go away. I find this type of advice disgusting.” Another woman said the comments were demoralising and devalued women. She said they represented another form of abuse. “Our vaginas have been abused by mesh and now doctors are suggesting our anus be abused. Despicable! Only a misogynist could think this way,” she said. A third woman wrote that the “appalling” comments showed a complete lack of respect to the women involved. Another wrote that they suggested women were nothing more than a receptacle to satisfy men. “The suggestion that women who are unable to have vaginal intercourse should practise anal instead completely devalues a woman’s right to a full and healthy sex life as an active, empowered and fulfilled participant,” she said. “It suggests that a woman is nothing more than a receptacle to satisfy men and that ‘any hole will do’. I’m appalled that anyone, particularly a woman’s treating medical practitioner, would be so thoughtless and arrogant as to suggest that anal sex is an adequate solution to sexual dysfunction.” Greens senator Rachel Siewert is chairing the senate inquiry into the devices. Siewert described the treatment of many of the women as appalling. “The way many women have been treated when trying to get treatment and support when they have had bad outcomes from mesh implants is appalling, including suggestions by medical professionals that anal intercourse is an alternative to vaginal intercourse after mesh implants have gone terribly wrong,” she said. “We have heard a lot of harrowing evidence during the inquiry – so many women have been horribly impacted by mesh implants. There is a clear pattern emerging of poor processes and advice which is leading to women having their lives severely impacted.” The class action is continuing in the federal court."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/aug/29/plummeting-childrens-bike-imports-spark-fears-exercise-in-decline","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-28T18:01:40Z","webTitle":"Plummeting children's bike imports spark fears exercise in decline","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/aug/29/plummeting-childrens-bike-imports-spark-fears-exercise-in-decline","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/aug/29/plummeting-childrens-bike-imports-spark-fears-exercise-in-decline","fields":{"headline":"Plummeting children's bike imports spark fears exercise in decline","bodyText":"The number of children’s bicycles imported into Australia for sale has fallen by 22% in the past decade, prompting concern that children are not being encouraged to be active. The data shows that 492,000 child bikes were imported by wholesalers in 2007-08, compared with 382,000 in 2016-17. Bicycle Industries Australia’s general manager, Peter Bourke, has been compiling the data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics for the past 20 years. He said the numbers were concerning when considered alongside data from the Australian Cycling Participation survey, which found modest declines in cycling participation among children under 10 in particular in the past two years. “There’s certainly a number of challenges to children cycling, especially to school, with kids perhaps not living close to their school or having to cross major roads on their route which their parents believe are unsafe,” Bourke said. “There are also a lot of other barriers including in the way we build our communities, which are not always welcoming to people walking and riding, even for those making a short trip to school or the shops. There might be a lot of traffic or a lack of bike paths, and if parents don’t feel safe cycling then they probably won’t let their kids cycle either. “We need to start designing cities for people to be able move and not just for cars to be able to move. And we have to design for children, and for mothers and fathers.” Bourke said the import data was the best reflection of how many children were taking up cycling, as less than 0.01% of bikes sold were made in Australia. “We don’t actually have data on sales of the bikes from the retailer but we do know that 99% of bikes imported by the wholesalers are sold, whether it be within one week or several months,” he said. “We have also seen a decline in the number of adult bicycles being imported into Australia but the decline is nowhere near as severe.” Prof Chris Rissel from the University of Sydney’s school of public health co-authored a national report on barriers to cycling participation . He said learning to ride a bicycle should be “a basic rite of passage for children”. Rissel said cycling was also an easy way for children to be active. “While there has been a steady decline in bicycle sales over the years, what we are now seeing is a drop that is dramatic,” he told Guardian Australia. “This is most likely to be due to concerns around cycling safety, which is the biggest deterrent for adults, who are then reluctant to let their kids participate in what they perceive as being a risky environment.” He added that cycling laws in New South Wales were among the most onerous in the world, with cyclists facing hundreds of dollars in fines for riding without a helmet or failing to stop at a pedestrian crossing. “The penalties are out of proportion and create a hostile environment for cycling,” Rissel said. “We do know that what we need to do to make cities more cycle-friendly is build bike lanes and make cars slow cars down.” However, he said the plus side of more cars on the road was heavy congestion that slowed traffic or brought it to a halt, making roads safer for cyclists. On Tuesday the Australian Health Policy Collaboration and the Heart Foundation will hold a roundtable to discuss a national approach to active travel to and from school for children, as 71% of children and 92% of those aged between 12 and 17 do not meet the recommended guidelines for physical activity. The National Heart Foundation chief executive, adjunct prof John Kelly, said children should get one hour per day of exercise. “It is vital we encourage daily physical activity for all our children and the daily trip to school is one of the best value investments we can make for their future health,” Kelly said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/aug/28/malcolm-turnbull-pledges-more-funds-for-snowy-hydro-20-as-labor-attacks-gas-crisis","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-28T05:19:38Z","webTitle":"Malcolm Turnbull pledges more funds for Snowy Hydro 2.0 as Labor attacks 'gas crisis'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/aug/28/malcolm-turnbull-pledges-more-funds-for-snowy-hydro-20-as-labor-attacks-gas-crisis","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/aug/28/malcolm-turnbull-pledges-more-funds-for-snowy-hydro-20-as-labor-attacks-gas-crisis","fields":{"headline":"Malcolm Turnbull pledges more funds for Snowy Hydro 2.0 as Labor attacks 'gas crisis'","bodyText":"Malcolm Turnbull has announced a further $8m in federal funds for the Snowy 2.0 pumped hydro energy storage scheme and promised to put further pressure on electricity retailers to reduce prices. At a press conference in Cooma on Monday, Turnbull revealed the Australian Renewable Energy Agency would contribute the funding towards the scheme’s $29m feasibility study, to be completed by the end of the year. Turnbull also shrugged off attempts by the opposition leader, Bill Shorten, to link the citizenship controversy to power prices by suggesting that Barnaby Joyce’s eligibility issue could imperil the government’s attempt to impose gas export controls. At the press conference the chief executive of the Snowy Hydro scheme, Paul Broad, said the total timeframe for the project would depend on the results of the feasibility study but suggested it would take about six years to complete. In its first stage of construction, the Snowy 2.0 project would create 2,000 megawatts of underground hydro power generation, or a total of 350,000 megawatt hours a week. Turnbull said the Snowy Hydro 2.0 scheme would “contribute to more affordable, more reliable electricity in the future” but conceded its impact would be “some years” away. “We’re also taking action right now, to ensure electricity prices are lower right now for Australian families,” he said. Turnbull confirmed the government would hold a further meeting with power companies this week after a meeting in early August at which the companies committed to give customers on expired discount deals information on more favourable plans. Earlier on Fox FM Radio, Turnbull suggested the meeting would reinforce those commitments and said that at least 1 million Australians were paying too much for their electricity . Guardian Australia understands Turnbull will also push for further measures including companies reducing hurdles to changing electricity plans, such as red tape and fees. Turnbull suggested that government pressure had already resulted in “people being offered 25-27% discounts” worth more than $2,000 a year to the average household. At a press conference in Melbourne, Shorten said the Snowy Hydro 2.0 scheme was “a good idea in the future but that’s going to take years to come online – we have a gas crisis right now”. He called on the Turnbull government to “pull the trigger on [gas] export controls”, warning of potential job losses due to gas prices. In April the government announced it would impose export controls if there was a shortage of gas in the domestic market. Shorten said this was “the right law” but gas prices had increased because the threat had not been activated. Shorten said there was an “added complication” because of questions over the eligibility to sit in parliament of the former resources minister Matt Canavan and the deputy prime minister, Barnaby Joyce, whose ministerial decisions could be subject to challenge if he is found ineligible. “With a cloud over [Joyce’s] eligibility to hold office, what the government’s done is given the big gas companies a beautiful volley back if the government tries to stand up for Australian jobs in Australian industry.” Asked about Shorten’s claim, Turnbull said: “No, don’t you worry about that – be absolutely assured that the domestic gas mechanism is all in hand. “We will ensure there are adequate supplies of gas for the domestic market.” Turnbull said the government was still working through the Finkel review’s recommendation for a clean energy target. He said the government was first waiting for a report from the Australian Energy Market Operator about the amount of dispatchable, baseload power needed in the system."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/aug/29/who-needs-a-statue-in-australia-guardian-readers-respond","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-28T18:00:40Z","webTitle":"Who needs a statue in Australia?

Guardian readers respond","bodyText":"When we asked Guardian readers which forgotten heroes they thought deserved to have statues erected in their honour, a strong thread developed arguing that no new statues should be erected; that statues in themselves were anomalies. Those that did suggest new statues often put forward strong calls to properly acknowledge Australia’s past including its impressive Indigenous history and its brutal frontier wars. Who needs a statue anyway? JCollins3 wrote: “I’m not a fan of monuments; elevating one thing over another just reminds me of what was ignored.” Another reader, Josue_Taylor, put it this way: “The whole idea of putting up statues is very European and the idea that we are going to put up statues of the Indigenous is somewhat awkward and condescending. Why are we only commemorating the Indigenous who helped Europeans? Shouldn’t the Indigenous have a right to memorialise their own who fought off colonisers and defended their home? I’d like to see a resurrection of the Indigenous cultural artefacts that were up before colonisation. An Indigenous cultural re-colonisation of their homeland is a far more tasteful than a tacky statue.” Adding to that sentiment, BGreaves wrote: “The article implies monuments as a didactic collective memory. Monuments are static and isolated. Perhaps recognise and commemorate song lines that trace our whole nation, some underlying key arterial routes today. “A much more dynamic way to learn about the landscape where we live, about a culture that lived so long in the landscape it became part of it, and possibly understand and evaluate the changes that have occurred.” Jack Latimore, Guardian contributor and editor of IndigenousX, also felt there were more pressing issues in Australian history than who gets his or her own statue: “The return of sacred and significant landmarks to their traditional names and the care of local mob is more important than any manufactured edifices,” he wrote. One suggestion to overcome this problem was a new walk of fame for different cities. “Statues represent a moment in history, mostly marked by the winners. Could our towns and cities each have a ‘walk of fame’ comprised plaques referring to significant First Nation people? Imagine, it could become a unique lesson in history for New Arrivals, from which respect and greater understanding could grow,” wrote aquariann. Mabo and Whitlam the popular picks Of the more than 500 responses the Guardian received to our call out, however, strong themes did develop among a field of contenders. Eddie Mabo, the Indigenous land rights activist, and Gough Whitlam, the Labor prime minister toppled by Malcolm Fraser and the governor-general Sir John Kerr, stand out as having the most support. Mabo’s grave was visited by Tony Abbott in the Torres Strait when he was prime minister; and there is already a bust of Whitlam on Prime Ministers Avenue at the Ballarat Botanical Gardens in Victoria. And there was certainly a strong case for more monuments and memorials to represent the country’s Indigenous history. sydneyiskyblue wrote: “I suggest a statue of the local Guringai men who scared the Europeans due to their Manly appearance as they sailed by what is now known as the Manly peninsula. These locals are deserved of a strong bronze sculpture peering out fearlessly to the sea with the Corso in the background.” Other than Whitlam and Mabo, the most commonly cited heroes included: Frontier war warriors including Pemulwuy, Windraydyne, Jandamarra, Yagan, Tunnerminnerwait and Maulboyheenner. H V Evatt, former president of the United Nations general assembly David Unaipon (born David Ngunaitponi), preacher, writer and inventor The artist Albert Namatjira Olympic gold medallist Cathy Freeman Opthamologist Fred Hollows Les Murray, the poet Caroline Chisholm, 19th century welfare worker The journalist, anthropologist and welfare worker, Daisy Bates Dorothy Tangney, the first female member of the Australian Senate Aboriginal rights activist, Vincent Lingiari Faith Bandler, an Indigenous civil rights activist Edith Cowan, the first Australian female MP Among sporting greats Shane Warne, Sir Donald Bradman and David Boon were high among the mentions, not always with the same degree of gravity. And it wouldn’t be Australia without quite a few votes going the way of Steven Bradbury. But it was Charles_Maine’s concept that really caught our eye: “A statue of US speed skater Apolo Ohno, but at the unveiling it falls over and cracks open to reveal a statue of Steven Bradbury.” Give the dog a bronze Our readers seem to be fond of dogs, with Guardian cartoonist First Dog on the Moon (not a real dog) receiving numerous nominations, as well as the esteemed former resident of Ramsay Street, Bouncer. Of course, it wouldn’t be a Guardian Australia comment thread without some #auspol banter. Tony Abbott and Alan Jones were both subject to numerous nominations, although more to remind us #neveragain than to honour their great deeds. Readers also seemed to get behind an idea to erect a monument of the political foursome Kevin Rudd, Julia Gillard, Tony Abbott and Malcolm Turnbull – which consensus decided would sit quite nicely outside Parliament House: “to remind politicians what their job is NOT”. But the final word goes to ifyousay: “I’d like to see a statue commemorating all of those who perished fighting section 44 of the constitution.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"money/2017/aug/28/viagogo-accc-legal-action-misleading-ticket-reseller","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-28T03:29:30Z","webTitle":"Viagogo: ACCC launches legal action against 'misleading' ticket reseller","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2017/aug/28/viagogo-accc-legal-action-misleading-ticket-reseller","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2017/aug/28/viagogo-accc-legal-action-misleading-ticket-reseller","fields":{"headline":"Viagogo: ACCC launches legal action against 'misleading' ticket reseller","bodyText":"Ticket reselling website Viagogo has been taken to federal court by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, in an unprecedented move that could have wide implications for the Australian ticketing industry. Based in Switzerland, Viagogo is a secondary ticketing site that operates in a similar way to Ticketblaster and Ticketmaster Resale: in theory, they provide a platform for people to on-sell tickets to events they can no longer attend; in practice, they can facilitate scalping, while profiting from hefty fees attached to each purchase. Referring to its Australian activity between 1 May and 26 June, the ACCC alleges Viagogo failed to disclose its “significant and unavoidable” fees upfront in the ticket price, including a 27.6% booking fee for most events on top of a handling fee; Viagogo claimed tickets were scarce (“less than 1% of tickets remaining”), without disclosing that it was referring only to tickets held by Viagogo; and Viagogo promoted itself through the use of the word “official” which, coupled with Google ads that placed it higher than actual official sellers in search results, gave consumers the impression it was the primary ticketseller. Viagogo has been approached for comment. In March, Viagogo was accused in the UK of “contempt for parliament” and a “lack of respect” when representatives failed to show up for a select committee hearing into ticketing fraud – part of a battle against “ticket touts” that has been watched closely by the Australian industry. ACCC deputy chair Delia Rickard told Guardian Australia she hoped the Australian court case would increase awareness among consumers. “We hope that people become more aware of the existence of the secondary ticketing industry, and learn that it’s advisable to deal with the authorised seller for tickets instead,” she said. “We really want to get the message out: don’t just automatically click on the first thing that comes up on the Google search bar ... look for the authorised seller, and purchase through them. “From Viagogo, we hope that they stop misleading consumers; they stop pretending they are the official seller; that they disclose the full price upfront or as soon as it’s possible.” Other sites including Ticketmaster Resale and Ticketbis operated in similar ways, Rickard said, but “from what we’ve seen so far, Viagogo are the worst of them”. The ACCC has received 473 contacts about Viagogo from consumers this year. In March, the consumer advocacy group Choice referred Viagogo and Ticketmaster Resale to the ACCC. On Monday Choice welcomed the legal action, saying it “highlights the need for urgent reform in the industry”. A Guardian Australia investigation last year revealed further allegations against secondary ticketing outlets. Within hours of tickets for Jerry Seinfeld’s first Australian tour going on sale in November, and before the show had sold out, resale site Ticketmaster Resale was asking up to $2,298.85 for a ticket. Later that month, tickets for Adele’s shows in Australia – which were sold through Ticketek for less than $310 – were immediately being resold for more than $5,000 through Viagogo..The sites take fees based on the percentage of a sale. In the extreme example of a $2,300 Seinfeld ticket, Ticketmaster Resale stood to make at least $575 just for handling the deal. Scalpers are facilitated by bots that rapidly buy up tickets in bulk, then flip them on resale sites at inflated prices. The UK and US have both recently passed laws to stop the use of bots, and small business minister Michael McCormack has indicating Australia may follow suit. Scalping and bots are covered by state legislation, so do not come under the purview of the federal regulator. “There is a discussion around at the moment whether more needs to be done in this area,” Rickard said. Also at issue are the Google “Adwords” that the secondary ticketing sites purchase, which place their listings above primary sellers such as Ticketek and Ticketmaster, and often give consumers the impression that the resale listing and inflated price is the official one. To make matters worse for consumers, many venues refuse to accept resold tickets. Across 14 events held over the past five months, Perth Arena turned back 354 people at the gates. Many of the tickets sold through secondary sites are not legitimate and some tickets are sold more than once. Many listings do not specify where you will be seated. And while many resellers, including Viagogo, guarantee a 100% refund if a ticket is not accepted, they don’t refund the fees. In March Nick Xenophon – who has long campaigned against the industry – brought forward a motion in the Senate calling on the government to protect consumers against ticket touts, which was passed with the help of Labor, the Greens, Jacqui Lambie and Derryn Hinch. “Ticket scalpers are no longer the shadowy figures with long overcoats and tickets attached to the inside of their coats,’’ he said. The technology available to scalpers had overtaken consumer laws which, he said, were “stuck in the 19th century’’."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"uk-news/2017/aug/29/englands-fire-services-suffer-25-cut-to-safety-officers-numbers","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-29T05:00:54Z","webTitle":"Revealed: England's fire services lose a quarter of safety officers since 2011","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/aug/29/englands-fire-services-suffer-25-cut-to-safety-officers-numbers","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2017/aug/29/englands-fire-services-suffer-25-cut-to-safety-officers-numbers","fields":{"headline":"England's fire services suffer 25% cut to safety officers numbers","bodyText":"Fire services in England have lost more than a quarter of their specialist fire safety staff since 2011, a Guardian investigation has found. Fire safety officers carry out inspections of high-risk buildings to ensure they comply with safety legislation and take action against landlords where buildings are found to be unsafe. Figures released to the Guardian under the Freedom of Information Act showed the number of specialist staff in 26 fire services had fallen from 924 to 680, a loss of 244 officers between 2011 and 2017. Between 2011 and 2016, the government reduced its funding for fire services by between 26% and 39%, according to the National Audit Office, which in turn resulted in a 17% average real-terms reduction in spending power. Warren Spencer, a fire safety lawyer, said the figures showed a “clear culture of complacency” about fire safety. “The government has tended to take the view that fewer people are dying in fires, fires occur less frequently, and therefore there’s no need to invest in fire prevention. So there’s been a total brain drain in fire safety knowledge and many experienced specialist officers have left the force,” he said. “But fire safety officers have been saying to me for years that one day, there would be a big fire in a multiple occupancy building, which would make everyone sit up and take notice of the lack of fire safety provision. Tragically, that’s what happened at Grenfell Tower.” David Sibert, a national fire safety adviser at the Fire Brigades Union (FBU), said the figures demonstrated the need for an urgent review of fire safety enforcement. “The government’s current approach to fire safety is business-friendly and very soft-touch. We are saying that this is wrong, and that we should be enforcing safety legislation on behalf of the people who live and work in these buildings, not on behalf of those who are making money out of them,” said Sibert. Fire services in Gloucestershire, Cumbria, Avon, County Durham and Darlington are among the worst affected; staffing has been cut by more than half. The figures come after the government’s announcement of an independent review of building regulations and fire safety after the Grenfell Tower disaster in June, where police believe at least 80 people died as fire engulfed the block of flats. “Grenfell showed us that our system of building and fire safety regulation is broken. And fixing this system requires more money, more officers and more inspections to catch out landlords who are trying to cut corners,” Sibert said. The fall in the staffing in fire services has been mirrored by a decrease in the number of inspections and enforcement notices, which are issued when a building violates safety regulations. In 2010-11, there were 84,575 audits in England, compared with 63,201 in 2015-2016 – also a drop of 25%. The number of enforcement notices fell at a much faster rate, with fire services reporting a 45% reduction over the same period, according to Home Office figures. The Surrey branch of the FBU last month passed a motion of no confidence in the county council over funding cuts to the fire service. The motion highlighted the 66% reduction in fire safety audits carried out by Surrey since 2010 as evidence that the cuts were “putting lives at risk”. Figures released to the Guardian show Surrey has lost 17% of its fire safety staff over the same period. Richard Jones, an FBU representative for the south-east region, said: “We brought the motion to the council because the service has been cut to the bone – way beyond the bone, in fact, it’s losing its limbs. We have to jump through so many hoops to enforce safety regulations, and it’s incredibly expensive to take someone to task. Certainly, there are a lot of violations which will simply never be tackled because we just don’t have the funds to do it. “If we find buildings that have major problems we will pursue landlords, all the way to court if necessary. But with the smaller things, we find it’s just not economical, and that’s a real problem.” A Surrey fire and rescue service spokesman said: “The safety of Surrey residents is paramount in all decisions that are made and, despite the huge financial pressures we face due to the rising need for services such as social care for children and adults and school places, we’re confident we’ll still be able to provide an effective and efficient fire and rescue service to keep them safe.” The Guardian sent FoI requests to all 45 fire and rescue services in England and received data from 31 fire services on the capacity of its fire safety department. Of those which reported data back to 2011, 13 fire services lost more than a third of their staff and a further six lost more than 40%. Only two fire services who responded increased their number of fire safety officers. A further four services, which reported figures as far back as 2013, lost a fifth of their fire safety officers, a reduction of 82 to 66 officers in the past four years. The cuts were also roundly criticised by Unison. “Fire safety staff do vital work protecting people from harm, and cuts undermine this important public service,” said the union’s assistant general secretary, Christina McAnea. “Reducing staff numbers puts intolerable pressure on those employees who remain and could put the public at risk.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/blog/2017/aug/27/england-women-heartbreak-sevens-rugby-world-cup","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-27T08:00:02Z","webTitle":"England Women find heartbreak at end of road as sevens focus returns | Ian Malin","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2017/aug/27/england-women-heartbreak-sevens-rugby-world-cup","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/blog/2017/aug/27/england-women-heartbreak-sevens-rugby-world-cup","fields":{"headline":"England Women find heartbreak at end of road as sevens focus returns","bodyText":"It had all the drama of the women’s cricket final at Lord’s last month. But this time there was no happy ending for England. The Red Roses learned New Zealand can always spoil that beauty with plenty of thorns of their own. For the fourth time the Black Ferns have overcome England in a World Cup final. England’s powerful pack were more than a match for New Zealand and their wing Lydia Thompson scored a brilliant second-half try that on any other day would have won the World Cup but England, a dozen points ahead at one stage in the first half, were overrun after the break. The New Zealand prop Toka Natua scored a hat‑trick of tries and Simon Middleton’s side, whose flankers Marlie Packer and Alex Matthews grafted tirelessly, were second best to a team they had beaten in New Zealand earlier this summer. England looked crestfallen at the final whistle in Belfast. They had been favourites to hold on to their World Cup crown but were blown away in the last quarter of the game . For what was billed as the “biggest women’s rugby game in history”, the Kingspan Stadium, a world away from the old Ravenhill, was packed to the rafters for a game that had a slot on primetime television. It was a gripping spectacle and intensely physical, with some hurtful hits by New Zealand. After a haka that seemed to go on all night the Black Ferns showed England, as if they needed reminding, that they would provide a kind of opposition they had not faced in this tournament. When Selica Winiata, the pint-sized but very quick New Zealand full-back, out-sprinted Thompson to score the first try and Emily Scarratt limped off with an ankle injury, the size of the champions’ task became more apparent. But Scarratt, at full-back in an England shirt for the first time in a couple of years, returned and landed a penalty. The England pack began to rumble forwards but the New Zealand defence was brutally effective. Too much so for the Irish referee, Joy Neville, who showed a yellow card to Sarah Goss, the New Zealand flanker, for upending Katy McLean. The seven women in the New Zealand pack could not stop the England eight from steaming forwards at a scrum and Neville awarded a penalty try. When Thompson took McLean’s pass to score in the corner England and Scarratt converted from the touchline, England sensed this could be their night. Natua stretched to narrow the gap just before half-time. She scored a second just after the break and Kendra Cocksedge landed the conversion that drew New Zealand level. Women’s rugby in England now stands at a crossroads. Three years ago after World Cup glory in France, the team knocked on. Gary Street, the amiable Brummie who had coached them to that second World Cup victory, walked away amid talk of a rift between him and the players. The team stagnated for a while and now a pay dispute that has been a spectre at this particular feast threatens to disrupt the future of Sarah Hunter’s side. After the Rio Olympics 16 players were given full-time contracts to prepare for Ireland. Now the Rugby Football Union has decided not to renew those contracts and concentrate on funding England’s next Olympic sevens side. That decision has been roundly criticised, one Labour MP Tonia Antoniazzi calling the RFU’s stance “an affront to women’s sport”. A lot of the outrage has been confected, as this England team was aware that the contracts were only for a year and money is being used to boost the women’s club game. It does seen illogical, though, to fund a sevens squad. How much time and money does it really need to prepare a sevens team, for goodness sake? A new-look domestic Premiership will, however, only improve the chances of England repeating their World Cup triumph of 2014. And if Packer, for instance, is miffed at having to return to her day job as a plumber, it did not show on Saturday night. England have stood toe to toe with New Zealand in the best organised Women’s Rugby World Cup. The benefits of their 12 months of professionalism were evident in their second-half display against a France side who refused to lie down in Tuesday’s semi-final. England simply got stronger against the French amateurs as the game wore on. There have been a few grouses. The hosts, whose seventh place means they at least qualify for the next World Cup, never really clicked through their gears and there were the usual mismatches, the 121-0 win by the Black Ferns against Hong Kong being particularly cringe worthy. But Saturday night in Belfast saw the two best women’s rugby teams in the world convert a few more armchair supporters. It was certainly a lot better viewing than what passes for entertainment on television on most Saturday nights."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/2017/aug/26/andy-murray-pulls-out-us-open-hip-injury","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-26T20:02:46Z","webTitle":"Andy Murray pulls out of US Open because of ‘too sore’ hip injury","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/aug/26/andy-murray-pulls-out-us-open-hip-injury","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/aug/26/andy-murray-pulls-out-us-open-hip-injury","fields":{"headline":"Andy Murray pulls out of US Open because of ‘too sore’ hip injury","bodyText":"All the woes and pain of Andy Murray’s troubled season hit a dramatic pitch on Saturday when he withdrew from the US Open. Citing the hip pain that has dogged him for several months, he said he was unsure if it will require surgery – having already had an operation on his back four years ago – or if he will play again this season, but his mood was decidedly downbeat. The recently dethroned world No1 said he would discuss with his team in the next few days how much time he needs to recover before resuming tennis. There is a distinct possibility he could follow the example of last year’s finalists, Novak Djokovic and Stan Wawrinka, who have quit the tour through injury until the start of next season. Murray, who last missed a slam four years ago at Roland Garros, was still hobbling slightly at practice earlier in the day but not with the pronounced inconvenience that cut him down when he lost to Sam Querrey in the quarter-finals at Wimbledon. He has not played in the six weeks since. In a brief and emotional statement to the media, Murray said: “This is actually why I didn’t want to come in here. I have had the issue with the hip since my match with Stan in Paris. I did pretty much everything I could to get myself ready and took a number of weeks off after Wimbledon. I spoke to a lot of hip specialists, tried resting, rehabbing, to try to get myself ready. “I was actually practising OK the last few days but it’s too sore for me to win the tournament and, ultimately, that’s what I was here to try to do. Unfortunately, I won’t be playing .” Asked if he had considered having an operation, he said: “I spoke to a number of specialists about it to get the best advice possible. When you speak to a lot [of specialists], there are different views and opinions on what the best thing to do is moving forward. I’ll definitely make a decision on that in the next few days. “I certainly wouldn’t have been hurting myself more by trying to play. It was more a question of whether it would settle down. I kind of ran out of time. Maybe if I’d been able to take a little bit more time off …” Pausing as he contemplated the seriousness of his predicament, he added: “I have never had to take any time off because of my hip before, so we were hoping that by taking a few weeks off and really reducing the load I was putting through it, that I would be OK by the time the US Open came around. Unfortunately that’s not been the case.” Murray’s announcement, which came as a shock to all but those closest to him only a week after Rafael Nadal ended his 41-week reign as the No1, has thrown this tournament into disarray before it starts on Monday. Marin Cilic, the fifth seed who has had his own injury problems recently, takes Murray’s spot as the second seed, according to grand slam rules, and will play Tennys Sandgren on Monday. Querrey moves into Cilic’s position, with Philipp Kohlschreiber replacing the American. The lucky loser Lukas Lacko joins the main draw. Earlier, Roger Federer, who is a slight favourite ahead of Nadal to win the title, commiserated with the growing number of players who have been cut down by injury in the late stages of this season. “I didn’t foresee that the defending champ [Wawrinka] and the finalist wouldn’t be here, and that Andy was going to struggle this year,” Federer said. “The guys who are hurt lately, it’s mostly because they are 30-plus. Wear and tear takes its toll. Maybe some players have just had enough of playing hurt and told themselves: ‘When I come back I just want to be 100%, not always playing at 85, 90 or 95%.’ “When somebody is injured, somebody else wins. We saw that last year when Rafa and me weren’t around; somebody else stepped up. Always somebody seems to take advantage. You have got to be in the right place at the right time, and be healthy and fresh. It’s a huge opportunity for guys ranked outside of the top 10.” The Swiss, who turned 36 this month, took a week off after losing to Alexander Zverev in the Rogers Cup final in Montreal to ease his aching back, then missed Cincinnati as further insurance; neither would have happened a couple of years ago, before he went all mortal on us and twisted his knee while turning a bath tap for one of his four children in Melbourne. In an effort to comfort the multitudes, Federer said on Saturday: “I have been on the practice courts since last week, playing sets the last few days, and I’m really happy how I’m feeling.” On Wednesday, however, he described the nagging back pain as merely “much better”. There is sufficient grey in his pronouncements to encourage hope in those rivals still standing. Murray agreed that Federer’s six-month break to recover from knee surgery last year, before coming back to win the Australian Open then Wimbledon, was a comfort and inspiration to him. He would do his best to emulate him, he said. “If I get myself fit and healthy, there is no reason why I can’t,” Murray said. “I have been practising here and have been competitive in practice, but I’m not moving close to how I can when I’m healthy. Obviously there has been a lot of players with injuries this year. Roger and Rafa last year had a few problems. “I want to be back on court as soon as I can. If it means that I can play before the end of the year, then that’s what I would love to do. I miss competing. I’ll try to get myself back on court as soon as I can. But I’ll need to make the correct decision and really think it through these next couple of days with my team, and then make that decision.” Nadal, speaking before Murray’s withdrawal, blamed the switching of balls from one tournament to the other as a contributory factor in the mounting injuries among leading players. “It is a very bad decision to play Montreal, Cincinnati with one kind of ball and play here with a different kind of ball. They are not even similar. That’s very bad for the wrist, for the elbow, for the shoulder, seriously. “When you come from clay to grass, of course it’s different. But if we are playing at the US Open with the Wilson [ball] why don’t we play the whole part of this season with the same ball? That’s something that will help in terms of health.” Nadal added: “Don’t forget we are not 21 any more. Stan is 32, I am 31 and a half almost. Novak is 30. Andy is 30. It’s normal we have had some [problems]. Don’t forget that [Pete] Sampras probably at my age was not playing tennis, [Bjorn] Borg was not playing tennis. A lot of great players were not playing tennis at our age. “It’s new for them – for Novak and Andy, who have missed a couple of tournaments, and for Stan the same. But I tell you one thing: I missed much more than them.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"money/2017/aug/26/childcare-free-hours-hmrc","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-26T21:00:46Z","webTitle":"Tory pledge on more free childcare in disarray","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2017/aug/26/childcare-free-hours-hmrc","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2017/aug/26/childcare-free-hours-hmrc","fields":{"headline":"Tory pledge on more free childcare in disarray","bodyText":"Tens of thousands of parents are still waiting to find out if they can take up a government offer of 30 hours’ free childcare days before the scheme is due to be launched. According to the latest figures, revealed in a letter sent by the Department for Education to local authorities and seen by the Observer, 82,000 parents entitled to the extra childcare have not yet secured a place for their three and four-year-olds. The offer, which doubles the current government-funded allowance, was a flagship Tory election pledge and is due to be implemented on Friday. But the policy appears to be mired in confusion amid claims of a funding shortfall and technical hitches. According to new research given to the Observer by the early years shadow minister Tracy Brabin, three-quarters of childcare providers expect the policy to have a negative impact on their business and fewer than 7% say it will be positive. The same research claims that the scheme is underfunded, and that as many as one in three nurseries have not yet decided to offer any free places. “I’m deeply concerned that many children won’t have access to the quality childcare they deserve – and that parents were promised,” said Brabin, who received 660 responses after she set up an online survey of childcare providers over the summer. The Pre-School Learning Alliance estimates there is a 20% shortfall between the amount the government is giving local authorities to fund the scheme and the actual cost to nurseries. It said that some nurseries will have to close as a result, and some have already gone under. Eve Wort has recently shut down her village nursery in Hampshire after running it for more than 20 years. She said she could not afford to take part in the scheme and knew she would lose children as a result. “I knew parents would have an expectation in September that they could get 30 hours for free, and there might be a stampede, in the short term, to nurseries which joined the scheme. Then I might have been left without enough money to pay my staff redundancies. I can’t bear it. I feel absolutely devastated.” To add to parents and providers issues, the HMRC-operated childcare website is causing huge headaches. Parents need to apply for a code proving they are eligible before Wednesday or they will have to wait until January. In a letter to the chairwoman of the Treasury committee, Nicky Morgan, published on Wednesday, HMRC revealed that one in 20 parents who have used the service since April have suffered at least one technical problem during their application, and 45% of callers to the helpline have needed to call more than once. The codes have also been supplied for two and five-year-olds, neither of whom qualify, while some parents in receipt of housing benefit and childcare and working tax credits have pulled out of places, unsure if they will be better or worse off. A Department for Education spokesman said: “We are determined to support as many families as possible with access to high-quality, affordable childcare, which is why we are investing a record £6bn every year by 2020 and doubling the free childcare available to working parents, saving them up to £5,000 a year per child. “This funding includes an additional £1bn a year by 2019-20 to pay for the free offers and to raise the national hourly rate to local authorities for three and four-year-olds to £4.94.” HMRC said anyone in receipt of tax credits who is concerned about the scheme should check its online childcare calculator. A spokesman said: “Parents who apply in time and who get their code after 31 August will still be able to use it. Nobody need lose out as a result of the technical issues.” He added that parents can seek compensation if they suffer unreasonable delays."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"business/2017/aug/27/firms-facing-revolt-over-executive-pay-to-be-named-on-public-register","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-26T23:01:49Z","webTitle":"Firms facing revolt over executive pay to be named on public register","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/aug/27/firms-facing-revolt-over-executive-pay-to-be-named-on-public-register","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2017/aug/27/firms-facing-revolt-over-executive-pay-to-be-named-on-public-register","fields":{"headline":"Firms facing revolt over executive pay to be named on public register","bodyText":"A new register naming firms that find themselves under shareholder pressure over executive pay is to be launched later this year as part of government plans aimed at curbing boardroom excess and increasing transparency. In what was described by the government as a world first, the new register will name firms where a fifth of investors have objected to proposed executive annual pay packages. However, the unveiling of the policy marks a retreat from the much more radical approach which had originally been touted by Theresa May in the form of promises to increase the frequency of binding shareholder votes on corporate pay policies. The policies of listed British companies are currently subject to a binding vote every three years. The Liberal Democrat leader, Vince Cable, accused the prime minister of capitulating to pressure from her own party and watering down the original proposals. “The fact that even these fairly unadventurous measures are now being dropped shows just how frightened this government is of its own backbenchers,” he added. Companies named on the register – which is to be run by the Investment Association, a trade body that represents UK investment managers – will be obliged to detail how they intend to address investors’ concerns. Greg Clark, business secretary – who is expected to unveil the new measure on Tuesday alongside other plans for new laws to improve corporate governance, said: “Most companies are proactive and thoughtful when it comes to responsible business practices. “But there are a small minority of firms that threaten the reputation of business with their behaviour, including ignoring shareholders’ concerns about executive pay packages.” Clark’s department said that the reforms are designed to ensure that employees’ voices are heard in the boardroom of listed companies by either assigning a non-executive director to represent employees, nominate a director from the workforce or create an employee advisory council. The initiative comes in the wake of a revolts over boardroom pay, and moves by May to put corporate reform on her agenda during her campaign to become prime minister in the wake of the Brexit vote. She later spoke of how many voters saw “the emergence of a new global elite who sometimes seem to play by a different set of rules and whose lives are far removed from their everyday existence”. Chris Cummings, chief executive of the Investment Association, said that its members, who manage the pensions of 75% of UK households, believe that not all company boards that receive big shareholder dissent are currently doing enough to address investor concerns. He said: “This public register will help sharpen the focus on the those who must do more, enabling our members to hold the country’s biggest businesses to account and leading to better-run companies.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2017/aug/26/maria-sharapova-us-open-johanna-konta","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-26T21:30:47Z","webTitle":"Maria Sharapova straight in at the deep end after free pass to US Open","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/aug/26/maria-sharapova-us-open-johanna-konta","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/aug/26/maria-sharapova-us-open-johanna-konta","fields":{"headline":"Maria Sharapova straight in at the deep end after free pass to US Open","bodyText":"When the wise citizens who run the US Open risked public outcry by giving Maria Sharapova a free pass into their 2017 tournament, they can hardly have anticipated the Russian would be thrown in against the world No2, Simona Halep, in the first round. In a way the gamble paid off, because this is the sort of first-up match that makes TV executives drool: the drug-busted villain up against the volatile Romanian, who blew her shot at being the world No1 in Cincinnati last week when she lost to the tournament favourite Garbiñe Muguruza. Sharapova is 6-0 against Halep. What could possibly go wrong? Well, she could lose, and that would take the air out of their audacity in a twinkling. Or she could win and a tournament slotted into one of the few downside gaps in the American sporting calendar – the McGregor-Mayweather boxing extravaganza this weekend notwithstanding – would receive a significant buzz. Not that anyone seriously expects Sharapova, a 2006 champion here, to win her second US Open title. She is 30. She has done nothing since returning from a 15-month ban in April to suggest she can revive a career that had already shown signs of creaking before drug testers found the banned meldonium in her system at the 2016 Australian Open. She did not get into the French Open this summer. Wimbledon refused her a wildcard. Her stock has been falling with slightly less impact than that of Donald Trump’s. But Sharapova is a bundle of paradoxes. This is a player who exudes glowing health and beauty, while selling sugar sweets to kids. She moves like a puppet on a string, looks like a ballerina and fights on court like a heavyweight boxer. The former world No1, with five majors to her name since her stunning debut at Wimbledon 13 years ago, holds a world ranking of 147. In Stanford before the US Open, she took three sets to beat the American world No93, Jennifer Brady, then pulled out of the second round when a left-arm injury flared. It had not healed sufficiently for her to play in Cincinnati, a crucial warm-up tournament. As she admitted on the tournament’s Periscope channel: “I haven’t had the best preparation, if I am honest. The tournaments I was supposed to play, I had to withdraw with injury, which was quite disappointing.” True to her penchant for massaging uncomfortable realities, she says she “skipped” Wimbledon, although rarely has there been a more mutually beneficial ‘skip’ after the All England Club slotted her into the qualifying tournament and she pulled out injured at the last minute. The last time she played at Flushing Meadows, in 2014, Caroline Wozniacki beat her 6-4, 2-6, 6-2 in the fourth round. Yet they gave Sharapova a wildcard into the final slam of the season. There is no escaping it: she matters. At least at the turnstiles. Local tennis fans already have plenty to cheer about: 23 American women in the draw, the most in 12 years, and some sort of compensation for the absence of Serena Williams. With 19 Americans in the men’s draw, this US Open should hit a lot of TV buttons, at least in the opening week. Sharapova is the sugar on their cake. For Johanna Konta, she is a potential roadblock. Britain’s best player in a generation came out of Friday’s draw in good shape and should have few problems with the 77th-ranked Aleksandra Krunic, a 24-year-old Russian based in Serbia. Konta’s rise of 140 places in two years has been stratospheric by any standards but she takes it in her measured stride, housing her emotions in an hermetically sealed bubble. It has served her well, and it may pay a serious dividend in a tournament that throws up this odd bauble: any one of eight players could finish the fortnight as the world No1, a position currently held by Karolina Pliskova. Konta will never be as famous as Sharapova – nor is that an ambition – but she has grown used to rolling acclaim for her methodical and precise tennis. She relishes the openness of this Open, and regards herself as good “a contender” as any of the other aspirants. “I think it’s a great thing,” she said. “From the very first rounds of tournaments there are great matches. I think that was showcased at Wimbledon. In the women’s draw, every round there were incredible battles. So I think that’s quite exciting, knowing that when you go to watch an event, from the get go, it will be exciting. You don’t have to wait until the semis.” Nor does Konta believe the absence of her sport’s outstanding champion, Serena Williams, will figure in the equation. “I don’t think so. You have to remember these players were around alongside Serena. Garbiñe won alongside Serena [beating Williams in the 2016 French Open final], Flavia [Pennetta] won here. There have been champions alongside her. “Obviously Serena has been a massive presence in our sport. And what she achieved in our sport might not happen again, certainly not in my lifetime. Going from where she started, her career as a teenager, it’s just incredible. But I think it’s like being in the men’s game and living in the time of [Roger] Federer. It’s just one of those anomalies. Will it ever happen again? But Serena is away making a baby; there’s more attention on who’s around now and the quality of players who can come up alongside her.” Konta had an unexpected and unwanted brush with notoriety when John Humphrys brought his acerbic interviewing style to bear in a weird interview with her on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme shortly after Wimbledon, although she left it more amused than bruised. “He maybe forgot I wasn’t a politician. He maybe never really interviewed an athlete,” she said. “I think I basically didn’t answer like a politician does to him [to questions about her Hungarian and Australian background]. The interview ended and I looked across to Vicky [her agent] and thought: ‘That was a bit bizarre, a little bit of a strong interview.’ Going through this career with all the experiences, it won’t be the last strong interview I will have. “A few people [from the show] did come up to me to apologise, because it did go down an angle that probably was not intended, but it happened. I was very keen to move on as well.” And she has done that in a most satisfactory manner. This could be the tournament that makes her – whatever the hype about Sharapova."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/2017/aug/26/england-west-indies-second-test-match-report-shai-hope-kraigg-brathwaite","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-26T18:03:39Z","webTitle":"Kraigg Brathwaite and Shai Hope put West Indies on top against England","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/aug/26/england-west-indies-second-test-match-report-shai-hope-kraigg-brathwaite","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/aug/26/england-west-indies-second-test-match-report-shai-hope-kraigg-brathwaite","fields":{"headline":"Kraigg Brathwaite and Shai Hope put West Indies on top against England","bodyText":"Headingley has a bit of form in the upset department and while only two days of this Test have been completed that reputation may be enhanced. When West Indies arrived in Leeds the general consensus was they did so with no hope alongside the brothers Kyle and Shai. Now they are, rather brilliantly, in charge of the game. They may not win it, but they are the strong favourites to do so. In a nutshell that is one good reason why we keep turning up. With a composure that belies West Indies’ recent record and in stark contrast to their efforts at Edgbaston Kraigg Brathwaite and Shai Hope compiled a superb fourth-wicket partnership of 246, which enabled their side to be 71 runs ahead with five wickets in hand when a weary England side withdrew to their dressing room for some chastened contemplation. This was not in the script. Brathwaite, resolute and organized in defence and occasionally impish against the spinners, posted his sixth Test century in a manner that must make England’s selectors envious. They would readily settle for him as Alastair Cook’s opening partner. While Brathwaite’s qualities as a gutsy opener are well-established, Hope has only flickered in the past. A touch of class has always been evident but the figures have not matched that impression – a batting average of 18 after 11 Tests. Yet here he hit his maiden century in some style. Hope crunched a pull to the boundary on one leg in the manner of Gordon Greenidge to reach 99 before nonchalantly flicking the single, which took him to three figures. This felt like a landmark innings. No doubt there will be hurdles ahead but he can play. The technique is sound enough but more impressive than that was his calmness in the face of adversity. When he joined Brathwaite the score was 35 for three and everyone was preparing for more of the same: Edgbaston – rather than paradise – revisited. Four hours later, this pair were still together with centuries to their names and Joe Root was running out of ideas despite using six bowlers. In the morning, this state of affairs had seemed highly unlikely. There was some cloud cover, a newish ball and Jimmy Anderson on song. The nightwatchman, Devendra Bishoo, was stranded at Anderson’s end and he swished and missed at a long sequence of deliveries, which, as one old Headingley hero often observed, were “far too good for thee”. Eventually, Anderson’s worst ball of the morning, a little short and a wide, induced an edge and Bishoo was out for a plucky one from 33 balls. Then Kyle Hope, Shai’s older brother, was superbly held at second slip by Root diving to his left off Anderson, who was still doing his Richard Hadlee impersonations: the run-up was smooth and purposeful, the seam high and the length unerring. Once again Anderson operated on a different level from the other England pacemen, who had an exasperating day. Stuart Broad strove hard with a hint of impatience and nothing much happened. He was replaced by Chris Woakes, who looked more threatening. The Warwickshire all-rounder conjured more pace and swing and beat the bat several times with the ball often thudding into the upturned gloves of Jonny Bairstow. This looked terrific but there were no wickets and gradually his line deteriorated so that the batsmen could frequently allow the ball to pass harmlessly by. Likewise, Ben Stokes began with more vim than accuracy. England needed to strike more than twice throughout that morning session since the clouds were dispersing and the ball was ageing. Root tried Moeen Ali who almost had Brathwaite lbw – the umpire’s finger was raised but the batsman’s review was successful and he celebrated by hitting the next delivery for six. It was a minor triumph for the tourists that they could have lunch at 109 for there. By the time they resumed the sun was out and even Anderson yielded a few boundaries in his afternoon spell. Hope soon started to catch up with Brathwaite, his easy swing of the bat more pleasing to the eye and a source of joy for those such as Jeffrey Dujon and Stuart Law, who have been patiently championing his talents. If this is a landmark innings for Hope in his 12th Test he will be in good company. Great batsmen who have averaged way under 30 after 11 Tests include Dennis Amiss (19), Martin Crowe (20), Jacques Kallis (23) and Graham Gooch (26). Brathwaite reached his 50 and his 100 with a six, an oddity since before this match he had hit three sixes in Test cricket. Here, he revealed himself to be partial to off-spinners, Moeen in the first instance and then Tom Westley, who was deposited into the rugby stand when bowling his first over in Test cricket. Suddenly, Brathwaite comes out of his shell when the spinner emerges as if he has made a study of the batting of Misbah-ul-Haq. England, now labouring in the Headingley sunshine, limped to the second new ball, which eventually delivered another wicket after a barren four and a half hours. Broad finally pierced the defence of Brathwaite with a delivery that jagged back between bat and pad. But Hope kept going, striking two crunching boundaries against Woakes, whose brief evening spell suggested that either he has a phobia of bowling up the hill here or has yet to readjust to the rigours of the five-day game after such a long lay‑off. Stokes promptly replaced Woakes and soon dismissed Roston Chase, who has surely never sat with his pads on for so long in his brief Test career. Hope remained strong while Jermaine Blackwood came out playing enough exotic strokes to suggest that it might be worth turning up on time on Sunday morning. England are going to have to battle like fury to avoid defeat – just as no one predicted on Friday morning."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"politics/2017/aug/28/divorce-bill-remains-sticking-point-brexit-negotiations-resume","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-28T05:00:25Z","webTitle":"Divorce bill remains sticking point as Brexit negotiations resume","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/aug/28/divorce-bill-remains-sticking-point-brexit-negotiations-resume","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/aug/28/divorce-bill-remains-sticking-point-brexit-negotiations-resume","fields":{"headline":"Divorce bill remains sticking point as Brexit negotiations resume","bodyText":"Britain’s talks on leaving the European Union will resume on Monday amid a deepening standoff over the UK’s financial obligations. As the Brexit secretary, David Davis, calls for “flexibility and imagination” to break the deadlock, senior EU diplomats say their chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, will find it difficult to make progress until they have agreed how to calculate the amount Britain must pay to leave. Three and a half days of talks resume against the backdrop of a shift in policy from Labour and with both sides saying there is unlikely to be a major breakthrough. Brussels is infuriated at Davis’s refusal to spell out how the UK’s liabilities to the EU should be calculated, let alone put a figure on the final bill estimated at €75bn. Reports have suggested that ministers are ready to pay up to €40bn (£36bn) as the price of getting on with trade talks. The EU has said any attempt by the British to defer a deal on Brexit money could lead to the collapse of the talks. “If you leave big, sensitive political issues to the end of the negotiations – such as the financial settlement – you increase the risk of failure,” a senior official said. One EU diplomat told the Guardian that money was “the major sticking point and the biggest obstacle to making progress”. The diplomat said: “The UK government does not want to be too clear because they are afraid of the hard Brexiteers.” Despite the EU’s warning, Davis is expected to refuse to go into details before the EU places its own analysis of the expected bill upon the table. UK sources said Barnier’s team has produced a paper outlining the basis for a Brexit payment but has not yet said on what this is based. “We are waiting for them to produce a proper legal analysis that can be interrogated line by line,” a UK government source said. “Fundamentally, this is a negotiation – we don’t want to pay anything more than what we owe – but it’s a discussion that needs to be based on the facts. “They produced a paper. We want analysis, justification and facts,” the source added. EU officials said they were looking forward to hearing the UK team’s legal analysis on the Brexit bill but voiced their frustration. “We are not yet in a situation where lack of time would prevent us from advancing, so far it is a lack of substance,” said one official. The EU is also resisting attempts by the UK to change the sequencing of the Brexit talks. EU leaders have agreed on addressing the financial settlement, citizens’ rights and the Irish border before talks move on to trade. Davis acceded to the timetable, but a blizzard of position papers from Whitehall in the last 10 days underscores that the UK is keen to discuss the future. UK officials hope to discuss “technical issues” around the Irish border, customs issues and data protection. Davis is expected to say on Monday that he wants to agree a deal which is in the best interests of both sides, and expects the talks to be “constructive”. He will say: “For the UK, the week ahead is about driving forward the technical discussions across all the issues. “We want to lock in the points where we agree, unpick the areas where we disagree, and make further progress on a range of issues. “But in order to do that, we’ll require flexibility and imagination from both sides.” So far the bloc of 27 countries remain united, including on money. At a preparatory meeting last Thursday, France and Germany stuck to their position that the UK should pay its share of the EU’s 2014-20 budget, agreed by the then-prime minister David Cameron. The UK has accused the EU of “overegging demands” on the divorce bill, which also includes a share of EU pension liabilities and unpaid bills. Money is shaping up to be the biggest stumbling block in the talks, though there was a sharp exchange on Ireland after London was accused of “magical thinking” with proposals for an invisible Irish border, which will be the UK’s only land frontier with the EU. Citizens’ rights is less contentious, with agreement on half the issues, though the role of the European court of justice continues to be a sticking point. The latest round of talks comes as the government is under pressure to clarify its position on any transition period after Labour made an important shift in its Brexit policy. Labour’s Brexit spokesman, Keir Starmer, wrote in the Observer that the party was backing membership of the customs union and single market during a transitional period of two to four years. The move is a recognition of the fact the EU will not agree to any special or “bespoke transition” that does not respect its rules, including free movement of people and the jurisdiction of the European court. Negotiations resume at 5pm Brussels time on Monday and are expected to conclude on Thursday."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2017/aug/27/renewable-energy-generates-enough-power-to-run-70-of-australian-homes","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-27T18:09:47Z","webTitle":"Renewable energy generates enough power to run 70% of Australian homes","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/aug/27/renewable-energy-generates-enough-power-to-run-70-of-australian-homes","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/aug/27/renewable-energy-generates-enough-power-to-run-70-of-australian-homes","fields":{"headline":"Renewable energy generates enough power to run 70% of Australian homes","bodyText":"Australia’s renewable energy sector is within striking distance of matching national household power consumption, cranking out enough electricity to run 70% of homes last financial year, new figures show. The first Australian Renewable Energy Index, produced by Green Energy Markets, finds the sector will generate enough power to run 90% of homes once wind and solar projects under construction in 2016-17 are completed. The index, funded by GetUp through supporter donations, underlines the advance of renewables, despite Australia’s electricity markets still leaning heavily on carbon-emitting coal and gas-fired generation. Renewables, which made up just 7% of national electricity output a decade ago, accounted for 17.2% last financial year. This jumped to 18.8% last month. This is saving the power sector from carbon pollution equivalent to taking more than half of all cars in Australia off the road, according to Green Energy Markets. The biggest single source of renewable power remained hydro-electricity (40%), followed by wind (31%) and rooftop solar (18%), the index found. Less than 2% came from large solar farms, suggesting the best is yet to come from this arm of the renewables industry which has an array of large-scale projects underway. Green Energy Markets analyst Tristan Edis said the emergence of renewables, in particular wind and solar, as a “significant source of power” had ushered in a “construction jobs and investment boom”. “The renewable energy sector has staged a remarkable recovery, after investment completely dried-up under former prime minister Tony Abbott,” Edis said. He said investors had “recovered their confidence under Malcolm Turnbull”, with help also from “a range of state government initiatives”. Edis said the renewables sector was on track to meet the federal government’s renewable energy target of 20% of total generation by 2020 over a year early, by the end of 2018. However, the renewable jobs boom underpinned by the RET could “soon turn to bust”, he said. Renewable investment beyond the RET risked collapsing without the Turnbull government moving forward on chief scientist Alan Finkel’s recommendation for a future “clean energy target”, he said. At least 46 large-scale energy projects under construction by the end of June were providing enough work to employ 8,868 people full-time for a year. This figure had surged to 10,000 by July. Most jobs were in NSW (3,018), thanks largely to wind farms, while Queensland (2,625) was next, with 70% of its jobs coming from solar farms. Rooftop solar installations supported a further 3,769 full-time jobs across Australia in 2016-17. With most projects underway in Queensland, large solar farms still generated less than 2% of renewable energy in 2016-17, the index found. Generation from rooftop solar, which was “back in 2008 little more than a rounding error”, had “grown spectacularly”, Edis said. More than 150,000 systems installed in the last year alone would produce enough energy for 226,000 homes, he said. “Meanwhile these solar systems will also save consumers $1.5 billion off their electricity bills over the next 10 years.” Miriam Lyons, GetUp’s energy campaigns director, said that “everyday Australians are voting with their rooftops” in a move that “heralds the end of the era of big polluting energy companies dominating the market and manipulating prices to fill their own pockets”. “Who do we have to thank for the renewables boom? Certainly not the federal government,” she said. “Instead we can thank the thousands of everyday Australians who stood up and defended the national [RET] from Tony Abbott’s attacks, who saved [the Australian Renewable Energy Agency] from federal government budget cuts, and who pushed their state governments into showing some leadership on clean energy.” The Australian Renewable Energy Index will be published monthly."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"global/2017/aug/26/labour-calls-for-lengthy-transitional-period-post-brexit","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-26T20:00:45Z","webTitle":"Labour makes dramatic Brexit shift and backs single market membership","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2017/aug/26/labour-calls-for-lengthy-transitional-period-post-brexit","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global/2017/aug/26/labour-calls-for-lengthy-transitional-period-post-brexit","fields":{"headline":"Labour makes dramatic Brexit shift and backs single market membership","bodyText":"Labour is to announce a dramatic policy shift by backing continued membership of the EU single market beyond March 2019, when Britain leaves the EU, establishing a clear dividing line with the Tories on Brexit for the first time. In a move that positions it decisively as the party of “soft Brexit”, Labour will support full participation in the single market and customs union during a lengthy “transitional period” that it believes could last between two and four years after the day of departure, it is to announce on Sunday. This will mean that under a Labour government the UK would continue to abide by the EU’s free movement rules, accept the jurisdiction of the European court of justice on trade and economic issues, and pay into the EU budget for a period of years after Brexit, in the hope of lessening the shock of leaving to the UK economy. In a further move that will delight many pro-EU Labour backers, Jeremy Corbyn’s party will also leave open the option of the UK remaining a member of the customs union and single market for good, beyond the end of the transitional period. Permanent long-term membership would only be considered if a Labour government could by then have persuaded the rest of the EU to agree to a special deal on immigration and changes to freedom of movement rules. The announcement, revealed in the Observer by the shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, means voters will have a clear choice between the two main parties on the UK’s future relations with the EU after a year in which Labour’s approach has been criticised for lacking definition and appeared at times hard to distinguish from that of the Tories. The decision to stay inside the single market and abide by all EU rules during the transitional period, and possibly beyond, was agreed after a week of intense discussion at the top of the party. It was signed off by the leadership and key members of the shadow cabinet on Thursday, according to Starmer’s office. The new policy will inevitably be presented by Brexit supporters as evidence Labour is ready to betray the will of the people as expressed in last year’s referendum, which delivered a narrow victory for Leave. And it sets the stage for incendiary arguments with the government on 7 September, when the European Union (withdrawal) bill returns to the Commons for its second reading. Pro-EU Tory MPs, who also support remaining in the single market, will be put under intense pressure by Labour to fall in behind its position and rebel against their own party. If significant numbers were to do so, Theresa May’s already shaky grip on power would be seriously threatened. Liam Fox, the international trade secretary, and Philip Hammond, the chancellor, recently made clear that the UK would leave the customs union, as well as the single market, during a transitional period immediately after Brexit. Starmer says the time for “constructive ambiguity” is over. “Labour would seek a transitional deal that maintains the same basic terms that we currently enjoy with the EU. That means we would seek to remain in a customs union with the EU and within the single market during this period. It means we would abide by the common rules of both.” He says the Tory position of leaving the single market and customs union would be “unnecessary and a highly risky path to take”. Starmer adds: “We will always put jobs and the economy first. That means remaining in a form of customs union with the EU is a possible end destination for Labour, but that must be subject to negotiations. It also means that Labour is flexible as to whether the benefits of the single market are best retained by negotiating a new single market relationship or by working up from a bespoke trade deal.” Starmer has been coming under ever increasing pressure from a group of pro-EU MPs and activists within his party. MPs Heidi Alexander and Alison McGovern have launched an online campaign demanding unequivocal support, launched a website and published a motion for members to submit for debate at next month’s party conference in Brighton, via their constituency Labour parties. “The Labour party is serious about protecting jobs, tackling austerity and defending the rights of workers and consumers, so staying part of the customs union and in the European Economic Area is a no-brainer,” said the two MPs. “Labour must be able to deliver the ambitious programme of investment in public services which we put to the electorate in 2017.” Labour’s new approach was announced as Brexit secretary David Davis prepared for the latest round of talks on the UK’s departure with his EU counterpart Michel Barnier, which will take place in Brussels."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2017/aug/26/manchester-united-leicester-city-premier-league-match-report","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-26T18:47:56Z","webTitle":"Marcus Rashford makes instant impact as Manchester United defeat Leicester","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/aug/26/manchester-united-leicester-city-premier-league-match-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/aug/26/manchester-united-leicester-city-premier-league-match-report","fields":{"headline":"Marcus Rashford makes instant impact as Manchester United defeat Leicester","bodyText":"Marcus Rashford had been in the contest only two minutes when he sparked Manchester United’s third successive league victory.

Then from Henrikh Mkhitaryan’s delivery Rashford hit an instant finish beyond the Leicester City goalkeeper, Kasper Schmeichel, for his first goal of the season. This followed Romelu Lukaku’s saved penalty just after the break and when fellow substitute Marouane Fellaini doubled the advantage eight minutes from time, United were heading for a two-point lead over Huddersfield Town and Manchester City at the top of the table. The performance had José Mourinho purring about his side’s resilience. “Normally when you miss a penalty with half an hour to go there is a little collapse,” the manager said. “We kept playing today.” Despite having started the campaign with two 4-0 wins, Mourinho indicated that each player has to perform to retain their place as he dropped Rashford for Anthony Martial. With Craig Shakespeare opting for the same XI that beat Brighton &amp; Hove Albion 2-0 last Saturday and lost 4-3 at Arsenal the week before that, both sides could be viewed as settled. What Leicester hoped to do was stymie any early United pressure, having conceded here in the 22nd minute in last season’s corresponding fixture. Mourinho’s team went on to win that game 4-1 and here began by hitting Schmeichel’s area with crosses from Martial and Antonio Valencia. The response was a 20-yard Matty James sighter that David de Gea watched roll wide. Of note during the early exchanges was Martial’s willingness to rove infield to take the ball and drive at the visitors. United were superior in possession, taking residence in Leicester’s half and moving the blue shirts expertly around. When Jamie Vardy threatened to break towards De Gea at speed, Eric Bailly’s assurance in killing the danger underlined United’s control. Just before the 20-minute mark United appeared to have a fair goal scrubbed out. Lukaku swivelled and fired at Schmeichel. The Dane saved well but the ball rebounded to Juan Mata, who finished having pounced from a seemingly onside position but the assistant referee’s flag was raised. After last year’s two trophies Old Trafford is a more vibrant arena. So it was that the noise ratcheted up when they next attacked. Lukaku threaded a clever pass to Martial along the left, he flipped a cross to the far post and Paul Pogba’s diving attempt went wide of Schmeichel’s right post. A breathless couple of minutes was completed when the keeper’s athleticism was again required to repel an effort from Mata. Leicester offered flashes of quality in the rare openings they had. Shinji Okazaki’s sudden shot from 25 yards had to be monitored by De Gea but this was as close as the visitors were allowed to the Spaniard’s goal. Most of the action was at the other end. Twice Pogba unloaded at Schmeichel from long range and Mourinho will have been pleased by how his midfielder bossed proceedings. He will be less happy with United’s inability to make their domination count. The sense was that a first strike might again herald a few goals for the home side, yet as half-time neared the game remained deadlocked as a 35-yard free-kick from Pogba smacked the wall and landed safely in Schmeichel’s hands. Mourinho’s instruction for the second half might have been to be more ruthless. His team’s opening gambit was to pepper Schmeichel’s area again. Mata and Pogba aimed in crosses but both failed to find a team-mate. Martial was one of United’s better performers and it was his darting run that came close to prising Leicester open. He passed to Lukaku, who tried to turn but went down when tussling with Harry Maguire. Next Martial won the penalty from which Lukaku missed. The forward’s attempted delivery from the left hit Danny Simpson’s arm and Michael Oliver pointed at the spot. After Schmeichel debated the decision with the referee, Lukaku smacked the penalty to his right and the keeper made yet another fine save. Moments later frustration for United nearly became despair when Riyad Mahrez bamboozled Phil Jones and skipped in along the right but De Gea saved his fierce drive. Next Mkhitaryan spurned a golden opening from Mata’s balletic twirl and pass. Instead of shooting straight away, his elaboration led to the chance vanishing. When Shakespeare brought on Andy King and Demarai Gray for Okazaki and Marc Albrighton before the hour, Mourinho responded by bringing on Rashford for Mata in what proved a decisive move. Almost instantly came Rashford’s moment, as he was left unmarked to volley home. “Set pieces are our achilles heel at the moment,” Shakespeare said. From here United closed the match down, Fellaini’s point-blank finish after some good work by Jesse Lingard – another replacement – sealing victory. United have nine points, have scored 10 times and are yet to concede. It is an excellent beginning to their tilt at claiming a 21st title. Mourinho: I am happy for Marouane, for Jesse, for Marcus José Mourinho praised his substitutes after they were key in maintaining Manchester United’s 100% start to the season in the 2-0 win over Leicester. United head into the international break with nine points from their opening three matches and at the top of the Premier League. They have scored 10 times and are yet to concede. After facing stiff resistance from the visitors and seeing Romelu Lukaka’s penalty saved Mourinho brought on Marcus Rashford, who put United ahead, and Marouane Fellaini, who scored shortly after coming on, having been set up by another substitute, Jesse Lingard, to seal United’s third victory in as many fixtures. The 54-year-old refused to take credit for his substitutions but said: “This is about the quality of the players, the players are good, and not just good, they are motivated to help the players. It doesn’t matter if they play from the beginning, if they come from the bench. The group is solid, very, very friendly in between games and [there’s] great empathy. I’m really happy, not for me. When [managers] make changes, we always make the right changes, sometimes it works against us. I’m happy for them, for Marouane, for Jesse, for Marcus.” Mourinho then turned to those critics who argue his tactics are overly defensive. “Maybe they are going to say that [I am defensive] because my team is not conceding goals,” he said. “Maybe they say I am defensive. We are playing well. Maybe in some matches we are going to be defensive and if the opponent is playing better than us we have to be pragmatic and defend but today we didn’t need that. I am not carried away, three matches, nine points is good, 10 goal difference is good.” He added: “We are playing well. We didn’t have many matches last season where we played 90 minutes with the control we had today. Is [Jamie] Vardy a very dangerous player? I would say one of the most dangerous in the Premier League. Was he dangerous today? I would say no because we played very well to control that. Were Leicester very dangerous against Arsenal [in a 4-3 defeat]? Yes, I watched the match three times. Were they dangerous against us? No.” Mourinho believes United’s work during the summer is key to the flying start. “We had a very good pre-season,” the manager said. “We worked really well. We had great conditions to work together, to be together in a beautiful atmosphere. We played against good teams, the best team in Europe [Real Madrid] twice. The pre-season was very complete and then we start the Premier League. We are playing well.” Jamie Jackson"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2017/aug/26/japan-brexit-concessions-theresa-may-visit","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-26T20:00:45Z","webTitle":"Japan to seek Brexit reassurances from Theresa May","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/aug/26/japan-brexit-concessions-theresa-may-visit","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/aug/26/japan-brexit-concessions-theresa-may-visit","fields":{"headline":"Japan to seek Brexit reassurances from Theresa May","bodyText":"Theresa May is under pressure to reassure Japanese companies over the likely impact of Britain’s exit from the European Union on their UK investments when she visits Tokyo this week. The prime minister will arrive on Wednesday on a three-day trip that is expected to include a meeting with Emperor Akihito and free-trade talks with her Japanese counterpart, Shinzo Abe. Under EU rules, official free-trade negotiations cannot begin until after Britain has left the trading bloc. But the prospect of informal discussions will boost claims by May and other pro-Brexit politicians that exiting the EU will leave Britain better placed to trade freely with major economies such as Japan and China. While details of her itinerary have yet to be made public, May will be accompanied by a delegation of business leaders that will “showcase the strength of British business, the shared confidence in the UK-Japan economic relationship as we leave the EU, and the potential for future growth,” a Downing Street spokesman said. Her visit comes soon after the foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, promised Japanese officials that Britain was eager to reach an “all-singing, all-dancing” post-Brexit free-trade agreement with Tokyo. However, trade aside, analysts warned that Japanese firms could reduce their investments in Britain if they feel Brexit would hamper their ability to operate across the EU. “An increase in costs following Brexit could lead to a decline in Japanese investment in the UK and the relocation of production bases to other EU countries,” said Katsunori Kitakura, lead strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui Trust International. “As such, the ongoing negotiations between the UK and the EU will be crucial for the future investment relationship between the UK and Japan. “Japanese companies want to continue their investments in the UK after Brexit. However, the UK government will need to respond to their requests and take measures to maintain the same business environment that is currently in place as far as possible.” Despite Downing Street’s assurances that Britain will remain open for business after Brexit, Japanese manufacturers and financial institutions have voiced concern about their future investments if it leaves the single market. Britain would have much to lose from even a partial Japanese withdrawal. Companies such as Nissan and Hitachi have invested more than £40bn in the UK, and Japanese firms together employ a total of 140,000 people in the country. “Now that Japan is close to the final deal [on a free-trade agreement] with the EU, the Japanese government would want Britain to form a customs union with the EU so that Japanese businesses can maintain de facto single-market access,” said Takashi Miwa, chief economist for Japan at the investment bank Nomura. Miwa was confident companies such as Hitachi would remain committed to Britain, but said that they would seek concessions on “[more] flexible and privileged treatment with regard to hiring and firing employees, and on taxation than the continental EU countries”. In recent months major Japanese banks have announced plans to scale down their presence in London in anticipation of more political uncertainty over Brexit negotiations. Chief among their concerns is the potential loss of the “EU passport”, which enables banks based in London to operate freely across Europe’s financial markets. Daiwa Securities, which has its headquarters in London, this year announced that it would open a subsidiary in Frankfurt. Nomura Securities, Japan’s biggest brokerage, is reportedly planning to make Frankfurt its post-Brexit base, but will retain a large number of staff at its current EU headquarters in the City. And last month it was reported that Mitsubishi UFJ, Japan’s biggest financial group, is to base its investment banking business in Amsterdam. Abe and Japan’s biggest business lobby, Keidanren, have not attempted to hide their fears that Brexit could be a “huge negative” for Japanese companies in the UK. In an unusually frank statement issued at last year’s G20 summit in Beijing, Japan set out a list of demands that included May negotiating a deal that keeps Britain in the EU customs union and single market, and guarantees the free flow of workers between the UK and the rest of the continent. A Japanese government official said Abe and business leaders would “reiterate what they have said a number of times so far – that is, to request that Japanese business and financial interests should in no way be jeopardised by the Brexit and its consequences”. The official, who asked not to be named, told the Observer that, while Abe – who last year implored Britain to vote Remain – was not seeking specific reassurances from May, Japanese businesses could reconsider their investment in the UK if they believed Brexit would be detrimental to their long-term interests. “If the UK business climate becomes unfavourable for Japanese companies, as a natural consequence they will disinvest from Britain and put more investment into the continent – and that is a development on which Tokyo will be able to exert little influence,” the official said. The business secretary, Greg Clark, has secured commitments from Nissan and Toyota that they will continue to make cars in Britain after Brexit – but only after offering assurances in letters whose contents remain secret. “The Japanese business community might push for similar secret assurances, but they also know that such a one-sided promise from the UK government will not guarantee a continued trade relationship unless it’s agreed to by their EU partners,” said Osamu Tanaka, chief economist at the Dai-Ichi Life Research Institute in Tokyo. Tanaka, though, believes May’s visit has come at just the right time. “Now that the Brexit discussion is at a critical juncture, Japanese business leaders want to hear clear assurances from her,” he said. “Many Japanese firms use the UK as a headquarters for their European businesses, and as an export and sales hub to the EU. They want clarification that the business environment will not change after Brexit.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2017/sep/04/sparrowhawks-play-hard-to-get-country-diary-sheffield","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-04T04:30:03Z","webTitle":"Sparrowhawks play hard to get","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/sep/04/sparrowhawks-play-hard-to-get-country-diary-sheffield","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/sep/04/sparrowhawks-play-hard-to-get-country-diary-sheffield","fields":{"headline":"Sparrowhawks play hard to get","bodyText":"A new noise stopped me dead in my tracks; a sort of pulse-quickening, primitive shriek, more banshee wail than bird call. Through the still-bare March treetops I saw the source of the sound barrel straight overhead – my first thrilling glimpse of sparrowhawk in this neck of Ecclesall Wood, near my home. In the long light of a clear May evening came a second sighting, not far from the first; a revelatory 10 minutes of spectacular aerobatics in the full view of Ecclesall Road South, the bird’s fluidity of movement spellbinding. More recently, when the woods were muffled and dense with August foliage, I heard those sounds again, but more frequent and insistent, and produced by at least two birds. I waded towards them into the bramble-tangled understorey, but the calls simply receded as I pushed onwards, always one effortless step ahead of me, like a rainbow. A few days later I managed a frustratingly obscure glimpse, but a close-up look at these birds – which have, after all, evolved to be invisible in domains such as this – was proving elusive. That night I dreamed a huge sparrowhawk flew over me in a field, so close I could clearly make out the bright yellow of its irises and the horizontal bars of its plumage – distinctive features that, having recognised sparrowhawks previously by sound, I had not consciously memorised. The birds were eluding me in the day but somehow invading my nights. The following day I resolved to try one last time. After an hour of waiting, scanning the foliage, the sound began again. I lifted my binoculars, more in hope than expectation, but landed straight on a sparrowhawk, poised with disarming stillness on a conifer branch. I had the nape-prickling feeling of looking at a ghost. A little later I located the juvenile, the source of all that noise. I watched both for half an hour, the three of us silent and still. Only after they moved on did I see the messy scattering of pigeon feathers on the ground. All that time I had been searching in the trees, while a tell-tale sign had been unnoticed at my feet."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/sep/02/my-autism-hasnt-stopped-me-connecting-with-my-sister","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-02T05:29:06Z","webTitle":"My autism hasn’t stopped me connecting with my sister","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/sep/02/my-autism-hasnt-stopped-me-connecting-with-my-sister","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/sep/02/my-autism-hasnt-stopped-me-connecting-with-my-sister","fields":{"headline":"My autism hasn’t stopped me connecting with my sister","bodyText":"My sister, Kirsten, spent most of 2014 and 2015 sectioned on a psychiatric ward. While in hospital, she stuck a sign on her bedroom door. “Please don’t ask me how I am or how my day has been,” the sign said. “I really struggle with such vague and open questions.” Kirsten is 33 and has autism spectrum disorder, as well as obsessive compulsive disorder, severe anxiety and depression. The path to finding this diagnosis has been complicated. Over the years, medical professionals posited that my sister may have had schizophrenia or borderline personality disorder, among other things, but for a long time, there was no definitive answer. Finally, in 2014, aged 30, Kirsten was tested for autism, and the results have enabled her to access the appropriate support. Before I began to understand my sister better, I found it hard to know how to behave around her. She cried often, yelled if I asked what was the matter, and grew agitated by – what were to me – tiny things. Our relationship was particularly troublesome when we were teenagers and in our early 20s. I am a year and a half older than Kirsten, and as her big sister, have always felt protective, but have not always been a good influence. I have also had depression and anxiety, and, for a long time, I used alcohol as a coping mechanism. As we have grown up, Kirsten and I have started to find ways to connect that work better for us. The first positive step we took was to handwrite letters to each other, and we have kept this up for more than a decade. Since the autism diagnosis, we have begun to communicate in all sorts of new ways. This past week, using a mix of letters, WhatsApp messages, phone calls and emails, we have chatted about the way we interact, and how it has changed over the past 30-odd years. What follows is a condensed version of our conversation. By sharing it publicly, we are by no means providing a blueprint for how to talk to anyone who has autism or a mental-health condition, but we hope our story inspires other people to work on their communication with a range of people with different conditions. Anneliese: Thank you for agreeing to do this with me. Kirsten: That’s OK. I’m anxious in case I don’t do it right, but it’s exciting to do something together. A: If there’s anything you can’t answer, that’s fine, or if you need me to rephrase anything, let me know. Let’s get straight into it. How well do you think we communicate with one another? K: Quite well, I think. You’re patient with me, and give me time to think. You used to get panicky if I didn’t respond to your questions straight away, so you’d ask me more, but I can’t answer more than one thing at once. Also, you know I hate open questions, so instead of saying “How are you?”, you ask me what I’m up to. I think you can tell how I’m feeling from what I’m doing. Sometimes I don’t know what to say to you. It would feel hypocritical for me to ask how you are when I don’t like being asked myself, so I forget to ask you questions. A: It’s good that you feel our communication is working these days. What was it like when we were younger? K: When we were children, playing a lot of games together, I think we were fairly good at communicating. Except when we argued. You used to hate it when I copied you. A: You used to eat every mouthful of every meal in exactly the same order as me! K: I didn’t like making decisions, so I’d just do whatever you did. A: One of my earliest memories is walking into the bathroom, with you clamped on to my shoulder by your teeth. Mum and Dad had to unclamp you, and there was a bloody bite mark on my skin. K: You used to do psychological experiments on me. You said I was your guinea pig. A: Sorry about that. K: Sorry for biting you. A: I used to feel really jealous of you. You had so many illnesses when you were little and Mum and Dad seemed so concerned every time you had so much as a cough. And I was jealous of your imagination. All your imaginary friends, and the strong connections you had with your dolls. That’s why I crept out of bed in the middle of the night and cut off Raggy’s hair. [Raggy the ragdoll had long, pink, woollen hair, until I chopped it all off.] K: Mum got me a new Raggy, but it wasn’t the same. Anyway, I’ve got Frobisha. [Frobisha is a doll that Kirsten has had since she was one. He has been patched up and re-skinned numerous times.] Frobisha helps me communicate by saying the things I can’t. He tells my carers when I’m not feeling well, if I’m too scared to say it myself. He’s also allowed to be naughtier than me! [Kirsten makes the doll speak in a high-pitched voice, often saying very outspoken things. The psychologist who helped diagnose Kirsten with autism told us that the doll is an important tool for her.] You and Mum have got better at tolerating Frobisha. I think you recognise that I struggle to talk without him. You used to be embarrassed of me playing with him, but now you join in! A: Let’s think about when we were teenagers, and we started to struggle with communication. What sort of things did I do that upset you? K: When you became a teenager, you didn’t want to play Sylvanian Families any more, and it was harder to find things to talk about. You used to ask me what was the matter all the time, but I couldn’t respond because I didn’t have a concrete idea of what was wrong. And you’d tell me off a lot, to “stop being so attention-seeking”. Do you remember Uncle Roddy’s funeral? We were sitting in the car park before going in and you told me to pull myself together. A: I don’t remember telling you that. K: I was admitted to hospital the next day. A: I was anxious at that time too because Dad was ill. That was the year before he died. I’m sorry I wasn’t more of a support for you, though. Did you ever think I said things like “snap out of it” because I love you? Even though the way I communicated it to you was misguided? K: I used to think you were angry with me. You wanted to change me, but I couldn’t change. You used to try to bully me into doing more sociable things, especially when you were at university. You’d get annoyed if I didn’t want to go out to loud places. You’re a lot easier to talk to since you gave up drinking, as you’re less erratic. I found it hard when you used to phone me up drunk and lost in different cities in the middle of the night, and I was powerless to help you. I sometimes dreaded your phone calls because I didn’t know which “you” I would get to talk to. That’s why we wrote so many letters to each other around that time. A: I wonder if it would have helped if you’d got your diagnosis sooner. I might have found it easier to have some guidelines to refer to. Not that I’m trying to excuse my past behaviour. K: Things have improved astronomically since my diagnosis. It helps me, too, to know my brain is wired differently. That there’s a reason I feel like I do. But it’s also a life sentence, as I know that I won’t grow out of it or find pills or therapy that will cure me. I hate it when people say everyone is “a bit on the spectrum” or “a bit autistic”. By the same token, we are all a bit dying. A: What other things do people say that you find difficult? K: How are you? What are you thinking? Why are you sad/anxious/stressed? What do you want to eat/drink/do? I don’t really like questions that are open to interpretation because I feel like there are too many options. I find it easier to be physically shown a selection of things to choose from. Something else I struggle with is I misread facial cues a lot, so I don’t like making eye contact unless I’m with someone I feel safe around, like you and Mum and my carers. I like doing craft activities while I’m sitting with other people, but I can’t concentrate on craft as much since I had ECT [electroconvulsive therapy], and my medication makes me feel out of it. A: Do you think your experiences have made you more sensitive when talking to other people with mental health conditions? K: I hope so. I don’t negate what a person says even if it sounds like paranoia, for example. Instead of saying “That’s not real”, I’ll try to say, “That must be really scary/worrying for you.” I try to be compassionate and not pry. I try to prompt people to talk about things that will make them happy. A: What are your favourite ways for us to communicate? K: That’s a tricky question. It’s different for different circumstances. I like talking to you on WhatsApp because it keeps a record of our old conversations, and you can send pictures and funny voice recordings and use lots of emoticons. I like emoticons because I understand what they mean and they can set the tone. You send me flower emoticons a lot. I send you animal ones, mainly bees. They always cheer things up. A: Do you think emoticons in texts function a bit like the stickers and doodles in our handwritten letters? K: Yes. Also, the visual elements stop letters from feeling overly formal. When I get a letter from you, and I see how colourful it is, I can feel the love in it straight away. A: Same here. That Kirsten and I were able to have this conversation with such openness and warmth shows how far we have come. My sister is, and always has been, one of my best friends. Best friends – and indeed siblings – do not always get on. But now that Kirsten and I are able to talk without regularly risking upsetting each other, our relationship is more trusting and peaceful. Of course, things are not perfect. Our communication is a work-in-progress, in need of frequent readjustments. However, reminding myself to put care and thought into the way I interact with my sister, because her needs are different from mine, is a crucial lesson that has taken me decades to learn, and I will keep practising. • Anneliese Mackintosh’s debut novel, So Happy It Hurts, is published by Jonathan Cape, £14.99.

The shock of that realisation, which perhaps comes to us all in early adolescence, is the drama of Messud’s fifth novel, The Burning Girl. The book dwells on the unravelling of a lifelong friendship between two teenage girls in small-town Massachusetts. It is a distinctive and subtle fable of lost innocence told in the voice of one of the girls, Julia, whose middle-class shyness and prized sensitivity prove inadequate as the more disturbed family and life of her wilful friend Cassie violently capsizes. “My mother assures me that it happens to everyone, sooner or later, for reasons more or less identifiable; everyone loses a best friend at some point,” Julia tells herself. But the reassurance isn’t quite up to the reality. In an office at her publisher, Fleet Books, Messud and I compare notes on how we have experienced something of that reality, first in our own teenage years and then in those of our children. Messud, and her husband, the New Yorker critic James Wood, have a daughter aged 16 and a son, 13. “I remember the brutal friendship break-ups from my own youth, and I’ve watched it again,” she says. “The strangeness is a bit like a relationship with an ex-lover, in that you know everything about your friend, but you suddenly don’t know their daily life any more.” That we can’t fathom other people, or ourselves, is the engine of fiction, and Messud, who teaches creative writing at Harvard, has an emotional intelligence steeped in that literary history. She is at once a bold and careful writer, whose previous novels have taken her in unexpected directions and to diverse tones. Most recently they include The Emperor’s Children (2006), a telling dissection of the lives of a group of friends in uptown New York in the years leading to 9/11, and 2013’s The Woman Upstairs, a tale of jealousy and betrayal between a frustrated artist and her younger, talented friend. The books are linked by Messud’s forensic eye for the small currents of tension in human relationships; her first novel was titled When the World Was Steady, but the present of her fictional worlds never quite holds still. The daughter of a Canadian mother and a French father who worked for a multinational corporation, Messud lived on three continents as a child. The story of The Burning Girl, she says, is rooted in one of the first real-life stories that affected her, and made her want to write. When she was nine she moved from Australia to Canada and kept in touch with her best-friends-forever by sending airmail letters. A girl who had been part of their group went through a disturbing series of events like Cassie in the novel: she grew up not knowing who her father was, and then found out and ran away to meet him, a story that ended in tragedy. “The thing about it, though, was that I didn’t experience it first-hand,” Messud says. “I had three or four friends who wrote me their versions of it. It was like the gospels or something.” In many ways, she suggests, it was her first experience of unreliable narration. “Girls, in particular, use storytelling to establish hierarchies, a pecking order. There is a sort of jockeying of who is in charge of shared history.” As a novelist, Messud dramatises that tendency, and points out the cracks in it. She gives the impression of writing being a vocation, a way of finding her voice. Can that be taught, I ask, thinking of her day job at Harvard? “No,” she says, “but there are things about writing that can be taught. I would say there are fewer people who want to read seriously now, and more people who want to write. But if you can use writing to get people reading, that is exciting.” Teaching also means that her own creative space in the year is quite limited. She laughs. “I think there are eight weeks when I am not teaching and the children are in school, which narrows it down a bit, but also concentrates the mind.” Does it still feel as necessary as ever to do it, in our world of distractions? “In the last few years I have come to feel that maybe in 50 years there won’t be novels, that people won’t have the attention for it,” she says. “Then you feel like it’s like a last trace of a culture, like the Lascaux paintings or something. When I am teaching, I first give out Tolstoy’s Childhood, his first published book. It is so transparent. It gives you exactly what it was like to be on a Russian estate in 1830. You are there. And that is the hope when you sit down and write still, I think – that you can transmit something of what life is like now.” Her most successful book, The Emperor’s Children, was a big social novel, reflecting New York at the turn of the millennium. Since then she has narrowed her focus. I wonder if the current politics at home are something she would like to address directly in her fiction? “There’s too much,” she says. “One of the things that seems difficult at this point is that the pace of the madness seems so intense. We are all like Linus and Snoopy in front of the TV with our hair blowing back. It is somewhat sapping.” For her, though, fiction remains the best means we have of understanding that madness, the ways in which we fail to connect. “If you took my reading and writing out of my head,” Messud says, “I don’t know who I would be. The people who don’t read, who are they? How do they make sense of things?” She references a pivotal passage in her novel, which sounds as good an explanation as any of divisions in our world: “All those years we’d been friends, since forever, we’d used the same words and perhaps meant different things – sometimes slightly different, but other times radically dissimilar; and we’d never known it. As if I’d been holding an apple and thinking it was a tennis ball, all this time.” “That is like the people who don’t read,” she says. “I don’t know what they mean when they say things.” The Burning Girl by Claire Messud is published by Little Brown (£16.99) on 7 September.

Britain needs leaders not clowns","bodyText":"Please, Theresa May, for the sake of our country’s future, sack Boris Johnson. His continued presence as foreign secretary is a national humiliation. The influence of a leftwing Guardian columnist over the prime minister is, to put it mildly, rather limited. It is up to Conservative members and supporters to come to the conclusion that Johnson’s continued tenure as Britain’s representative to the wider world is a risk to the future of this country. Political journalist Rachel Sylvester has a piece in the Times today which is as devastating as it is frightening. It languishes behind the paywall, so let me offer some choice highlights. Even Donald Trump’s officials regard Johnson as a joke. “Not a single foreign minister” in Europe takes him seriously. He leaks information given to him confidentially by other governments. He is variously considered by EU states as “totally unreliable”, a “liar” and “dangerous”. He is “ramshackle” and so lacking in concentration span that civil servants have to bypass him and consult his deputy, Alan Duncan, instead. If you are a British citizen, this man is your face to the world. We are in the midst of our greatest national crisis in peacetime, partly because Boris Johnson used his now-diminished star power to support a leave campaign which peddled lies about the NHS and stoked fears about immigration. We are where we are now, and we have to make the best of it. It is beyond reckless right now to have as foreign secretary someone who might seem a bit over the top to be hired as a clown at a kid’s birthday party. The economy, living standards, jobs – the whole shebang is at risk in these negotiations, and we have an Etonian David Brent at the helm. He thinks he’s Winston Churchill, but he’s really just whatever “a chilled-out entertainer” is in Latin. The charge sheet against Johnson was extensive before he was appointed. Here was a man who described black people as “piccaninnies” with “watermelon smiles”, who suggested Barack Obama’s opposition to Brexit was driven by his “part-Kenyan” ancestry, and who celebrated President Assad’s murderous offensives with “hooray” and “bravo”. As editor of the Spectator, he published articles describing black people as having smaller brains and lower IQs and blaming Liverpool fans for the Hillsborough disaster. If equal marriage should be permitted, he once wrote, then why not allow “three men, as well as two men, or indeed three men and a dog” to get hitched? He was sacked twice – once by his editor, the other by his then party leader – for lying. He was once recorded having a phone conversation discussing the possibility of beating up a journalist. He was bankrolled by the Barclay Brothers – “chicken feed” is how he described his £250,000 salary – to churn out thesaurus-swallowing defences of the interests of Britain’s shameless booming elite in the Telegraph. May knew the score and only appointed him as foreign secretary to manage the internal schism of her chronically divided party. Clearly the prime minister is in a weak position when it comes to reshuffling her cabinet – especially the most prominent members. Throwing away your political capital in an unnecessary general election, and reducing yourself to a humiliated laughing stock in the process, somewhat limits your room for political manoeuvre. But really, enough is enough. Britain is a great country, and it deserves better than being diminished to the status of international punchline. Our European neighbours are starting to treat us like that bloke in the pub at the end of the night who you avoid making eye contact with. It used to be said that Johnson is a bit of a laugh, a joke, or a “LEGEND!” as his most devoted fans in Clapham’s wine bars used to describe him. But the joke is on us. The Tories’ disastrous partisan scheming is responsible for plunging Britain into its current political turmoil. Sacking this clown wouldn’t rectify this Conservative-manufactured mess. But goodness me, it would be a start. • Owen Jones is a Guardian columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/sep/03/jean-georges-at-the-connaught-london-my-love-remains-restaurant-review","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-03T05:00:35Z","webTitle":"Jean-Georges at the Connaught, London restaurant review","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/sep/03/jean-georges-at-the-connaught-london-my-love-remains-restaurant-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/sep/03/jean-georges-at-the-connaught-london-my-love-remains-restaurant-review","fields":{"headline":"Jean-Georges at the Connaught, London: ‘The prices are stupid’ – restaurant review","bodyText":"Jean-Georges at the Connaught, Carlos Place, London W1K 2AL (020 7107 8861). Full meal for two, including drinks and service: £175 - £275 It’s the ease with which they do it, this blazered and Louboutined throng. With an airy wave of a manicured hand they order a £29 pizza as if it was the most normal thing in the world; as if it wasn’t an outrageous act, which deserved to be prosecuted as a crime against good sense. Here too am I, preparing to be just like them. Do I need to be here? I suppose not. There’s always another place that could be reviewed. I could be purring over some gap year traveller’s take on the obscure foods of Cambodia. But sod that. The truth is, I very much want to be here. The newly opened restaurant on the conservatory side of the Connaught hotel with its stained-glass windows like sweet-wrappers and its irritatingly low, badly engineered tables, belongs to Alsatian-American chef Jean-Georges Vongerichten. And I like him. I try to avoid the flouncier excess of chef worship and napkin sniffing, but with Vongerichten I fail. I have spent atrocious amounts of my own money at his flagship high-end restaurant in New York, simply called Jean-Georges, chasing the moment. Other chefs have attempted to marry French classical cooking with Asian flavours. Vongerichten has succeeded. He has a blissful way with acidity and chilli heat. One of the single best mouthfuls I have ever eaten is his: an oblong of black bread, spread with cold salted butter, topped with a single raw sea urchin and on top of that, a ring of pickled jalapeño. Reminisce. And then breathe. The room is high-windowed and populated with characters written by Tom Wolfe, those women in their sunglasses like hub caps. Unfortunately, it is in the base of the Trump Tower. That used to be hilarious. Now it isn’t. The curious thing is that while my love for Jean-Georges New York remains undiminished, I have always been disappointed by his diffusion lines. I actively hated Spice Market in Leicester Square, with its mushy overpriced violation of a laksa. ABC Kitchen in New York, which tried hard to work the peasanty farm-to-table vibe, was clumsy. And now here he is with this new place in the Connaught called, bravely, Jean-Georges, as if it were a direct sibling of the Trump Tower site. To be fair the prices here are of a similar magnitude. They are stupid in the way Donald Trump is stupid. It’s a kind of aggressive stupidity. The cheapest bottle of wine is £39. I ask the sommelier if that really was the cheapest they could find. “This is Mayfair,” he says. “You will find nothing cheaper here.” Not only is this not true of Mayfair; nearby Sexy Fish and Scott’s have bottles in the £20s. It’s not even true of the same building. On the other side of the Connaught, Hélène Darroze’s restaurant has a cheaper bottle. For this money, you get a symphony of grey and battalions of waiters who don’t talk to each other. One tells us the kitchen is going to send out a caviar freebie. I decline it. Only what we order, please. They send it anyway. Sharply, I send it back. It’s that kind of place: in this dining room you have to be aggressive to avoid being pelted with caviar. Really, people, it’s hell out there. But sit back for a moment, and try to imagine that you are there only as eye-candy; as the lucky, depilated guest who will never see inside the paper folder holding the bill. What do you get? Butter is good, big on buttercup yellow, whipped fats and salt crystals, though the accompanying sourdough is tired, with a soft crust. But don’t pout too much about that my love, because look: here are warm beignets of Comté cheese and black truffle to make things better. So that’s mini doughnuts of seriously pokey cheese and truffle dredged through the deep fat fryer? Get in. One starter, tuna tartare on avocado with a spicy ginger sauce, is a Vongerichten classic. In New York the tuna comes as ribbons. At Spice Market they seemed to have put it through the blender. Here it’s a halfway house. There is bite to the tuna. What matters is the broth: a liquor full of depth and acidity, fire and vivacity. It is all there. By contrast salmon sushi “improved” by deep frying the lozenges of rice is no improvement at all. It’s all kinds of wrongness in four easy mouthfuls. We order the fontina cheese and black truffle pizza as a kind of mid-course. It is small; Domino’s still win the “feel the width” contest. But it is also rather beautiful on its metal frame. There is a blistered crust, a shade of granite that co-ordinates nicely with the other guests’ pallor, and then there’s the hot cheese, drawing out to ribbons as you lift each piece. The truffle comes in waves. It’s preposterous, of course, the item I will be eating as western civilisation collapses. But ask me if I could image eating it again and sheepishly, I would say yes: if I was drunk enough in Mayfair, I would come here and drop the stupid money. And in the morning, I would hate myself. But we’ve all been there, eh? The £25 hamburger would make me hate myself more. It’s served medium rare if you wish, despite Westminster Council’s threat of legal hellfire should you do so. There’s black truffle mayo, because any amount of black truffle justifies a price tag. There’s a slab of stinky Somerset brie and some pickles. Pull out a bit of the beef and it turns out to have something to say for itself, but it’s silenced by the haughty, bellowing company. By comparison a dish of two fat fillets of John Dory, with a fiery ginger chilli dressing, almost feels like good value at £28. It isn’t. For dessert, somebody has made a leaf out of chocolate, because playing with food is required at £12 a pop. They’ve filled it with caramel and nuts. It’s a Snickers for someone who wouldn’t dream of being seen eating one. The other dish brings meringue and lime and raspberry and is rather lovely. Back home I’m asked how dinner was. I say it was really nice at £120 for two. “Unfortunately, it cost £275.” Oh, and that was after they remembered to put on the two glasses of champagne they had somehow forgotten. Jean-Georges, my friend, there are still things about you I love very much. But boy, do you make it tough. Jay’s news bites ■ If £25 for a glass of champagne is too rich for your blood, where else to go? The best deal in the capital I’ve found is at The Heights, the bar on the 15th floor of the St George’s Hotel by BBC Broadcasting House. A glass will cost £8.90. Plus you get one of London’s great secrets: an astonishing view across the capital, presided over by lovely staff. ■ Any news involving legendary Edinburgh restaurateur David Ramsden is worth reporting. His bistro- come-shambolic meeting house, The Dogs, has long been an institution in the city. Now he’s launching a sibling, The Fat Pony, on Bread Street. It’s a wine bar with small plates, including rabbit terrine with pistachio and toast, and pork belly with ginger and soy (thefatpony.com). ■ File this under ‘It’s the thought that counts.’ Currently, the most gifted grocery item at Amazon – ahead of Bollinger and a sweetie assortment – is a 5-litre bottle of Golden Swan White Vinegar.

By the time students arrive we are slumped in the corner, already exhausted. Do we pause long enough to question the efficiency of all this activity? Do we consider what impact doing less might have on young people’s learning? Minimalism involves the deliberate and frequent rejection of all that is unnecessary: an essential practice in seeking to find ways to thrive in the impossibly busy life of a teacher. Using some of the principles of minimalism has certainly helped my work in school have more impact, and enabled a calmer and more reflective professional life. The minimalist classroom The classroom is a teacher’s arena; it projects powerful subliminal messages to the young people in it. Its make-up will, in part, influence their responses to our teaching and their motivation in our subjects. One of the issues in the modern classroom is the ubiquity of stuff that dominates every spare inch. Resources, workbooks, equipment and increasingly elaborate visual displays all vie for limited space. Inevitably, this results in an environment that is distracting, loud, and that can easily become disorganised. Not the best mix when trying to inspire the calm and focus of 30 boisterous adolescents. There is also the impact of all this additional stuff on our own emotions in the classroom: is it feeding any anxious thoughts we might have about our jobs? Would a more streamlined approach help us to feel less stressed, and aid our clarity of thought in the environment in which we spend an inordinate amount of our time? We may believe that our classrooms are organised and project clarity, but are we secretly teacher magpies? Take 15 minutes to look at your room from a renewed perspective and think: what image am I projecting? How much of the environment is helpful to enable young people to learn and concentrate? We all know the wonderful lightness of spirit we experience after doing a spring clean. This image of renewal and serenity should be kept in mind to encourage a minimalist review of your classroom. Be ruthless: what isn’t having a transferable impact on students’ ability to learn? The best place to start is to tackle the clutter: what is lurking in corners of the room that can be removed? When was the last time it was used? What are the pieces of paper that can be scanned and saved to that wonderful de-cluttering enabler: the trusty memory stick? Once you have adopted this purging mindset, apply it to the equipment and to the dusty posters: are they enabling learning, or a distraction? Some of us don’t have the pleasure of ownership of our own rooms. Here, it is about travelling light with the bare essentials and seeking to encourage colleagues to see the value of adopting the minimalist attitude. Once we model the way and highlight the impact on our students, our colleagues will embrace the less-is-more approach. The minimalist planner Once we’ve adopted a streamlined mindset to our environment, ruthlessness filters through into all aspects of our teaching. Minimalist planning is not about laziness: it is about efficiency. It seeks to refine the content of lessons to cut out waffle, gimmicks and activities that are not directly correlated to its focus. Time should instead be invested in planning for efficient direct instruction, challenging questions, and deliberate practice for students. The minimalist planner rejects elaborate PowerPoints and the addictive call of the time-thieving photocopier. Instead, they will look at ways to harness memory tools to plan for retaining skills over the long-term: focusing more on the big picture and working backwards. There will be fewer activities, but real clarity about learning that is covered in depth. As Peps Mccrae highlights in the excellent Lean Lesson Planning, “what is the least that needs to happen for my students to make progress towards their next learning milestone?” The minimalist marker A revolution is starting in the marking wars; an understanding that, in reality, less is more when it comes to written feedback. Rather than repetitive comments, minimalist marking involves reflecting on impact and action – only what will move learning forward. Reducing our time puts the onus on where it should be: what students use the marking for. The minimalist marker also adopts one of the principles of Shaun Allison and Andy Tharby’s Making Every Lesson Count, using time to write, share and deconstruct model answers with students. The result is an improved understanding of what excellence looks like in our subjects. Sustain the habit We may glow with joy as we look around our sparse and organised classrooms, reflect on our capacity to manage our time more efficiently and generate real learning progress with young people. But sustaining this new minimalist habit is challenging. I have found that a 10-minute daily investment in de-cluttering maintains the clarity of a classroom. In the face of management workbook reviews and learning walks, let the quality of the work in students’ workbooks and the calm focus that radiates from your classroom answer any scepticism. In the face of stress and exhaustion, this year should be one in which we do not think about how much we are doing, but about how efficiently we are doing it. Embracing a minimalist attitude might well be the best place to start. Jamie Thom is an English teacher. He blogs at www.teachergratitude.co.uk and tweets @teachgratitude1.

The tropical storm continues to batter south-eastern Texas, where it has so far claimed at least nine lives, and is expected to reach southern Louisiana. Thousands of homes have been flooded, forcing residents to seek emergency shelter. US authorities estimate 30,000 people will need shelter. So far, predictions of the final cost of the damage vary widely, although Harvey is expected to be one of the costliest storms in US history. Some analysts are putting the likely damage at $30 to $50bn – but point out that not all of this sum will be covered by insurance. However, David Havens, an insurance analyst at Imperial Capital in New York, told Bloomberg News the final bill could reach as much as $100bn. This compares with economic damage of $176bn inflicted by hurricane Katrina in 2005, which included $82bn of insured losses, and the $75bn economic losses caused by Hurricane Sandy in 2012, of which $31bn was insured. The figures are from Swiss Re Institute. Chuck Watson, of US data analytics firm Enki, said: “Harvey is so destructive not because it was a category 4, but because of the rain and flooding … I would not be surprised to see numbers approaching $42bn, which would put the storm in the top 10, and at the fringes of the top five, most costly storms in US history.” As personal insurance policies tend to exclude flood cover, most of the flood-related claims will be borne by the US National Flood Insurance Programme. However, many people in eastern Texas have failed to buy coverage from NFIP or have let their policies lapse, the New York Times reported. It said many never had to buy flood insurance because their property was not listed as being on a 100-year floodplain. Donald Trump said the cost of recovery from Harvey – the first natural disaster during his presidency – would be “very expensive” but pledged that “the federal government stands ready, willing and able to support that effort”. Barrie Cornes, a London-based analyst at Panmure Gordon, said the wind damage and flooding, which was showing no sign of let-up, was likely to cause total economic losses of $30 to $50bn. As for how much of this is insured, Edward Morris and Michael Huttner, insurance analysts at JPMorgan Cazenove, said: “At this stage, it remains early to provide reliable loss estimates, but something in the $10bn to $20bn range appears likely, and could easily be exceeded given the extent of flood damage.” Lloyd’s of London firms Lancashire, Beazley and Hiscox are expected to be the worst-affected UK insurers. Cornes estimates they face bills of at least £100m each. Harvey has swamped the Texas oil industry, which processes a third of America’s oil. Companies including Exxon Mobil have shut down their facilities and it will be weeks before refineries return to full operation. This is likely to push up gasoline prices at the pump. Goldman Sachs estimates that refinery shutdowns have affected 3m barrels a day, about 17% of refining capacity. “The slow-moving nature of the storm will likely lead to these shutdowns continuing in coming days and may generate persistent damage as well,” Damien Courvalin, the head of energy research at Goldman Sachs, said in a note on Monday morning. Apart from energy, the construction and shipping industries will bear the brunt of the commercial damage, according to the Lloyd’s of London insurance market. It said it was too early to put a figure on the likely damage. A spokesman added: “In terms of Lloyd’s exposure, which in Texas includes the construction, energy, marine and hospitality industries, we’ll likely play a key role in the restoration of damaged businesses and communities. In the last five years, the Lloyd’s market has paid out $6.3bn in catastrophe claims payments in North America, so this is an area where we have deep experience.” Andreas van Embden, an analyst at Peel Hunt, said the US flood programme bears all homeowners’ losses up to $4bn and only transfers 25% of the next $4bn to the private reinsurance market. So if Harvey triggers an $8bn flood loss, reinsurers would face a $1bn claim. He estimates insured losses of up to $12bn. “Whilst Harvey is a major event we do not see this as being the size of a Katrina or Sandy,” he said.

Ferran Soriano, the City chief executive, spoke to his Arsenal counterpart, Ivan Gazidis, on Tuesday and after weeks of dancing around he put forward the official bid. It was not to alter Arsenal’s resolve over the player. They are determined to hold Sánchez to the final year of his contract, even though he has made it clear he will not sign a new one and, as such, would stand to leave for nothing next summer. Moreover, it is his preference to join City before the transfer deadline on Thursday. Arsenal continue to believe he would apply himself in their colours after 1 September and give his best for one last season. The situation is delicate and complex and there is the acceptance at Arsenal that every player has his price – even Sánchez, who is undeniably the club’s biggest star. Were City to come back with an offer that located the tipping point, the saga could twist again. City have the time to do so before deadline. But, as things stand, that has not happened. Arsenal have had an interest in the Monaco attacking midfielder Thomas Lemar throughout the summer – Liverpool are also now in for him – but the French club have indicated it would cost €80m (£74m) to get him. In other words he is not for sale. It is safe to assume Arsenal’s tipping point for Sánchez would, at the very least, be equal to this figure. During the conversation between Soriano and Gazidis, the City forward Raheem Sterling emerged as a potential makeweight in the deal for Sánchez. City contend it was not Soriano who suggested this. The club went to great lengths to prise Sterling from Liverpool for £49m in 2015 and he has started the season with vital goals against Everton and Bournemouth. But it is unclear whether Pep Guardiola counts on him. Mixing players into deals is notoriously complicated and City would prefer a straight cash transaction for Sánchez. Arsenal know that selling their best player to City and, in effect, getting an unwanted one back from Guardiola would not wash with their supporters. Perhaps, if they could add Lemar as well, it would be more palatable. But they are acutely aware of the difficulties, at this late stage, of the practicalities of getting a replacement or replacements for Sánchez. The 28-year-old is in Chile preparing for his World Cup qualifier against Paraguay on Thursday. Were there to be a breakthrough over his move, City would get a doctor out to him to supervise the medical. Arsenal are interested in the West Bromwich Albion centre-half Jonny Evans, who is also wanted by Manchester City and Leicester City, as they consider whether to move Shkodran Mustafi out to Internazionale. Mustafi wants to leave Arsenal. The club are also in talks with West Brom about selling Kieran Gibbs to them for £7m. Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain is primed to complete his £40m switch to Chelsea. City have a potential problem over Sergio Agüero, with the feeling within the club being that the Argentina striker might pursue a move away in January. He was dropped by Guardiola for the Premier League win at Bournemouth on Saturday and there has been tension between the player and manager. Agüero is determined to play regularly in World Cup year."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"society/2017/aug/30/study-shows-millions-children-uk-worried-crime","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-30T05:00:21Z","webTitle":"Study shows millions of children in the UK are worried about crime","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/aug/30/study-shows-millions-children-uk-worried-crime","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2017/aug/30/study-shows-millions-children-uk-worried-crime","fields":{"headline":"Study shows millions of children in the UK are worried about crime","bodyText":"The wellbeing and happiness of millions of children is being affected by concerns about crime in their local area, according to a study. The Good Childhood report 2017, based on a survey of 3,000 10- to 17-year-olds and their parents, found that two in five teenagers in the UK worry about anti-social behaviour and other crimes. The Children’s Society, which published the report, used Office of National Statistics data to extrapolate how many people across the population as a whole were affected by the concerns listed. The report found that young people’s happiness with their life was its lowest since 2010 and revealed that more than 1 million children experience at least seven serious problems in their lives – such as a fear of crime, domestic violence and bereavement. It was worse among girls, with a 52% rise in those who reported being unhappy between 2009-10 and 2014-15. For boys, reports of low wellbeing rose by 3% across that period. The report said: “It cannot be acceptable that so many children and young people in this country are experiencing serious problems that are leaving them unhappy. It is only possible to improve the wellbeing of children and young people across the country by correctly resourcing and prioritising the service which help children before they hit crisis point.” One in three teenage girls surveyed said they were concerned about being followed by a stranger and one in four boys were worried they would be assaulted. Other top concerns for children were their parents being unable to pay bills, which affected 36% of respondents, an estimated 2.1 million teenagers. Matthew Reed, chief executive of The Children’s Society described the findings as “alarming”. The charity called for more funding to help families. “Teenagers are coming under pressure in all areas of their lives, whether it’s being afraid to walk down their street, worrying about money, or having a parent who’s seriously unwell and this is damaging their well-being. Sadly we know many of these teenagers will only get help if they reach crisis point – such as running away from home, or abusing alcohol or drugs,” Reed said. One teenage girl interviewed by the charity said she was concerned about men beeping, whistling, shouting and stopping vans next to her. Another 13-year-old boy said: “You’ve got to fight to, like, kind of survive around this area. You have to stick up for yourself the whole time.” Child Poverty Action Group’s chief executive, Alison Garnham, commenting on the scale of hardship and its corrosive impact on children, said the findings about the number of families struggling financially was “shocking”. “Even with the best and most loving parenting, the effects of poverty harm our children,” she said. She added: “The autumn budget is an opportunity to deliver much-needed extra help for struggling families. Without action to improve family incomes, we risk setting up our youngsters to fail, especially when it is feared that child poverty will rise from 4 million to 5 million in the next few years.” Labour MP Karen Buck said the study was a “welcome, albeit disturbing” reminder that we need “to understand young people’s perceptions of their lives and neighbourhoods, and respond accordingly.” Natasha Devon, former government mental health champion said: “When I was a teenager in the 1990s, I was aware that we had invaded Iraq and that Princess Diana had died. That was about the extent of my knowledge of current affairs because, like most teenagers, I didn’t watch the news or read newspapers. “Today, young people have all the most terrifying aspects of the world reported in a never-ending deluge, straight to the palm of their hand. Arguably, the world is no less unsafe than it was 20 years ago, but we simply know more now, which makes it seem scarier,” Devon said.Luciana Berger MP, president of the Labour campaign for mental health and a member of the Commons healthselect committee, said: “These troubling findings demonstrate how our young people are facing a myriad of hardships which are seriously compromising their wellbeing.” She added: “In the past, children and teens could get support from youth centres, mental health services or via pastoral care provided in schools and colleges. Now, many of these vital programmes are under unprecedented pressure because of government cuts – if they exist at all.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"fashion/2017/aug/29/the-millennial-pink-pound-a-right-on-fashion-phenomenon","type":"article","sectionId":"fashion","sectionName":"Fashion","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-29T16:14:00Z","webTitle":"The millennial-pink pound: a right-on fashion phenomenon","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2017/aug/29/the-millennial-pink-pound-a-right-on-fashion-phenomenon","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/fashion/2017/aug/29/the-millennial-pink-pound-a-right-on-fashion-phenomenon","fields":{"headline":"The millennial-pink pound: a right-on fashion phenomenon","bodyText":"Babe Power is the fastest-selling female fragrance of 2017. It comes in an 80ml rose gold “can”, costs £28 and claims to smell of absinthe, moss and candy floss. It’s the honk of the candy floss that stays with you, though, clinging to your sleeve with resolve hours after application. The debut perfume from British brand Missguided, it describes its wearers as “babes!”. A more accurate description may be “anosmic”. Babe Power might smell of cake, but it is also the smell of modern girl power – and money. The first run of stock sold out in three hours. Missguided launched as a clothing brand online in 2009, although it barely registered until earlier this year. A steady barrage of TV ads, tube posters and odd tie-ins later – such as handing out free cans of Lucozade to commuters – saw sales rise by 70% last year. In the past year, it expanded from a website to actual stores, opening its first concession in Manchester in late 2016 and a flagship branch at Westfield Stratford, in east London, later that year. Love Island contestants do in-store appearances. Model Jourdan Dunn has just designed a line and the brand collaborated with Barbie for a sold-out collection. The whole enterprise is now worth more than £200m, propelling its founder, Nitin Passi, a thirtysomething internet entrepreneur, into the Sunday Times Rich List. You may have heard of the millennial pound and the pink (gay) pound – but this is the millennial-pink pound. A new demographic defined by a colour that has become ubiquitous in the past 12 months – as well as the politics of the age. Missguided and others have tapped into a curious territory of twentysomething customers with an ethos that is new to the fashion industry. They see themselves as modern, independent, Insta-savvy would-be feminists – which is why Missguided’s greatest triumph is probably its slogan tees. The message of female empowerment might be a little muddied – a “free the nipple” vest uses a nipple ring attached to the T-shirt in lieu of an actual nipple – but, for young women, it straddles the difficult territory between fashion, feminism and social media. At the Stratford store, millennial pink is a dominant theme, seen on everything from the stairs and the curtains in the changing rooms to the walls and even mannequins’ wigs. Cavernous and cluttered, this huge two-storey floorspace is filled with vinyl dresses, logo swimsuits and other paraphernalia. It’s an intimidating shop full of club-intensity music and unicorns. Today, a Frank Ocean remix plays loudly. In the centre, a giant pink flamingo looms over the swimwear section – to the left, above a sale rail, sit three gold pineapples. One T-shirt reads “Feminist AF”. On every wall, and every T-shirt, empowerment is writ large. Often in the ubiquitous Avante Garde font. The entire place is both designed to be documented on social media and inspired by the motifs of the medium. Then there are the clothes. Slogan tees are one thing. Longline T-shirts with cyrillic slogans quite another. Off the catwalk, Russian street-wear is a leftfield trend and yet here Russian phrases are on T-shirts (roughly translated, they say “girl power”). Elsewhere, bra tops with Roman numerals on the straps echo the current season of Dior. This filleting of high fashion into something mass, younger and wearable is smart, surprising – and deeply ironic. To wear it shows you get it. Cod empowerment or not, its heart is in the right place. But the idea of millennial pink is a loaded concept itself. Birthed, arguably, by hip Swedish label Acne – with its shopping bags and hip androgynous clothes that made us rethink gender – this shade came to symbolise a period in which both men and women could wear pink. In the space of months, the colour has become a shortcut to self-awareness and brands and marketing companies have been quick to jump on that fact. Wear the millennial-pink T-shirt sold by Boohoo – another e-tailer based, like Missguided, in Manchester – and you’re a modern guy. The hue has quickly become so heavily co-opted that it barely carries its original meaning – rising, as it did when, in the age of Trump, a new generation of men and women suddenly saw a backwards turn in gender and identity politics. Like the invention of the teenager in post-Depression USA, millennial-pink customers have been invented to sell stuff to. They are quantifiable, with their own style, social awareness and money to spend. The millennial pound is now stronger than the grey pound – 16- to 24-year-olds spend £826 per head a year on clothes compared to £565 for over-65s. The commodification of socially enlightened young adults may be gross, but it provides rich pickings for brands such as Boohoo and Missguided. This year, companies have fallen over themselves chasing the pink pound. Boohoo’s “sponsorship” of Pride was a publicity colossus. Petah Marian, an editor at trend forecasting firm WGSN Insight, is rightly suspicious. “The level of corporate involvement in Pride this year would have meant that it would have been stranger if Boohoo hadn’t done something,” she says, noting that HSBC, Tesco, Skittles, Disney and Starbucks were among the names associated with the celebrations. Given that less than half of millennials identify as straight, “tapping into Pride makes good business sense,” she says. Back in the Missguided store in Stratford, it is hard to swallow your cynicism. Alongside the tween patois and rainbow T-shirts is an incredibly canny business model. It encourages e-receipts, presumably to track trending products and purchase history, while the tills are chocka with little extras to slip into your bag. The sizing is generous, too, which may encourage you to buy things you may not have done. It also whips up competition between shoppers – perusing certain items at the online store, the cursor tells you how many people are looking at or buying an item. Many high-street brands send spies to the catwalk shows in order to sketch out trends, and quickly get them into shops within a few weeks. Missguided, meanwhile, drops 300 new products every week. These companies are competitive but also codependent, and collectively are starting to suffocate rivals such as New Look and Topshop. The issue with Boohoo et al is that they are still very young: “We don’t have a real sense of what their values as businesses are,” says Marian. They are moving faster than the media. The expectations of this generation have evolved faster than other retailers can handle. Online shopping might be entrenched, but it is Instagram that sells the clothes. Almost 90% of 15- to 24-year-olds use social media, according to GlobalData research. In March 2017, 30% of Instagram users had either bought products advertised on it or used the app’s “shop now” button. A PR at a major high-street shop says that influencers wield far more power than the retail industry is “prepared to accept”. In one instance, she says, a summer dress worn by a handful of influencers on Instagram sold out – despite zero advertising. A bricks-and-mortar shop aimed at this demographic might seem a peculiar move, but these are shops built for social media. While Missguided feels edgiest, Boohoo appears to be capturing the market. Last year, it bought the site Nasty Gal for $20m (£15.5m) after it fell into bankruptcy, and the company is now valued at £2.8bn – four times as much as Debenhams. The curious twist in all this is the price. These brands are cheap, but not that cheap. Not Primark-£2-a-T-shirt cheap – but £18-for-a-swimsuit cheap. Dresses mainly cost between £10 and £50. They claim to make a lot of their products in the UK, a fact which you shouldn’t pooh-pooh given the economic and ethical benefits. Meanwhile, Boohoo Premium launched earlier this year, selling £79 dresses. Insiders claim that this is simply the pattern of consumerism – once a customer-base has been established, they will return regardless of the fact that they can get a dress for the same price at a more traditional store such as Topshop. Asos, its main rival, still rules the game, although it is skewed towards household incomes of £40k or more. Missguided opened with a pink monster truck installed in the entrance, angled to encourage you to lean against it and be photographed. Beside the changing room sits a vending machine of canned water called Mermaid Tears. The empowering quotes on the walls are in a font large enough to show up on social media posts. The whole place is designed to be documented. Despite my cynicism, like a sucker, I buy a swimsuit that is supposedly inspired by Love Island.

But after the Ethiopian government stung him with a more than 300% tax increase last month, Abdella says he was left with no option but to close the business. Like many low-income traders in the country’s Oromia region, the family didn’t keep accounts, meaning the authorities based their annual tax demand of 7,000 Ethiopian birr (£231) on an estimate of income. “It’s beyond my capacity to pay. I will have to hand in my business licence,” Abdella says. The hikes on grocers, barbers and cafes were met with widespread anger and protests in parts of the volatile state, which has endured unrest and fatal clashes during the last two years. The situation creates a dilemma for a government that is desperate to increase income tax and reduce its reliance on aid, but is also wary of further instability. Ethiopia’s parliament only lifted a 10-month state of emergency earlier this month following protests over land disputes and alleged political marginalisation. The unrest since November 2015 involved security forces killing at least 600 demonstrators and tens of thousands being jailed, according to the government. Although still one of world’s least developed countries, Ethiopia’s economy has grown rapidly in the last decade, as the government used loans, aid and tax revenue to build clinics, universities, roads, railways and hydropower dams. Its budget has increased roughly in line with gross domestic product. Ethiopia’s tax revenue is around 14% of output, according to the International Monetary Fund, which is lower than the sub-Saharan African average. This financial year, almost a third of the federal budget of 321bn birr (£10.6bn) is projected to come from aid and loans. Ethiopia’s ruling coalition has been credited for overseeing growth and improving infant mortality and life expectancy, but it is also blamed for suppressing democratic rights, maladministration, increasing corruption and, now, the draconian tax swoop. The root of the dispute is a sizeable semi-formal economic sector – around 80% of the workforce is still employed in smallholder agriculture – entrenched mistrust between the state and traders, and an estimation system for small businesses. Enterprises with an annual turnover of less than 500,000 birr are not required to produce audited accounts. Instead, officials visit each premise to make an income assessment. That has set up a game of cat-and-mouse with many vendors running down stock in anticipation of the visits. The result has been a large discrepancy between what traders say they earn and what their assessments are based on, even if they made an accurate verbal declaration. “What most people tell the government is too low, so the officials don’t believe anybody. Honesty does not work,” says one Burayu business owner, who also requested anonymity. Oromia revenue officers take the estimation and multiply it either by 300 days for goods retailers or 360 days for services to produce a turnover estimate. Profits are calculated by applying a standard margin for each type of business, which is then taxed at marginal rates from 0% for profits of less than 7,200 birr to 35% for those earning more than 130,800 birr. “The assessment has basic technical problems. From the selection of people to assess, to the criteria used for assessment, it does not fit into any objective presumptive tax assessment methodology. It’s just an ad hoc categorisation of taxpayers,” says business consultant Getachew Teklemariam. At Burayu town revenue department, deputy head Samuel Tadesse explains that business owners were shocked at the new evaluations because the government hadn’t carried out an assessment for seven years. Annual inflation shot up to 40% in 2011, but has been hovering near 10% recently. Also, last year, the tax thresholds increased. For example, the tax-exempt portion rose from 1,800 birr to 7,000, while the upper margin was previously 60,000. “They are confused because for six years they paid a similar amount,” Tadesse says. By Lake Hora in Bishoftu town, about 50km south-east of Addis Ababa, a man in a bright yellow T-shirt and matching sunglasses repairs a door with a soldering iron and angle grinder amid a shower of sparks. He’s given up on his business after a 13,000-birr tax bill that he believes was four times what it should have been, and is using a friend’s workshop. “It’s better to be mobile, going here and there. That is better than being licensed,” he says. Others in the area say the levies on small businesses are another example that the system only works for the rich, who receive favours and tax breaks. Another small business owner believes access to jobs, land and controlled commodities such as sugar requires loyalty to the ruling party. The welder thinks the government wants the extra revenue to buy weapons – one of a number of conspiracy theories about the tax policy, testament to the extent of Oromo discontent, and the difficulty the authorities will have implementing unpopular policies. Protests over the tax, which closed businesses in July, have merged with other grievances and led to widespread strikes in Oromia last week. Back in Burayu, rather than risk an unaffordable tax demand next year, Abdella says he will try to support his family by working in the construction industry. He has no faith that the ruling coalition will change its ways to make life easier for small businesses. “I don’t think there will be a solution if this government stays,” he says. *Name changed to protect identity"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/sep/03/tales-of-the-unexpected-grape-varieties-in-surprising-locations","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-03T04:59:34Z","webTitle":"Tales of the unexpected: grapes on tour | David Williams","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/sep/03/tales-of-the-unexpected-grape-varieties-in-surprising-locations","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/sep/03/tales-of-the-unexpected-grape-varieties-in-surprising-locations","fields":{"headline":"Tales of the unexpected: grapes on tour","bodyText":"Domaine Gayda Figure Libre Cabernet Franc, France 2015 (from £13.32, Cambridge Wine Oxford Wine) In European wine, there is always a tension between the indigenous and the incomer. I’m talking about grape varieties, although there is a flavour of the nativist v cosmopolitan culture war in discussions about which varieties producers should be using. Such arguments are rather less pressing in the Languedoc-Roussillon, where the region-wide IGP Pays d’Oc has always encouraged a more liberal approach to varieties and winemaking than the smaller, more tradition-minded appellations. One of the best producers in the region, Domaine Gayda, makes full use of the flexibility, making two superb wines from grape varieties most associated with the Loire Valley for its Figure Libre brand: a pitch-perfect Chenin Blanc 2015 dry white (from £14.46, Cambridge Wine), and a deeply satisfying, Bordeaux-esque red Cabernet Franc. Anette Closheim Savvy, Nahe, Germany 2016 (£12.75, Oddbins) Riesling has been the white wine queen of German vineyards and, for its fans, there’s a feeling that nothing else in the country can match it for scintillating steeliness in styles from bone dry to sweet. Certainly, purists will wince when they see the name of that modern success story sauvignon blanc (and in an antipodean abbreviation at that), on the label of a wine from one of riesling’s great territories among the forests and orchards along the Nahe River. But they really shouldn’t. Anette Closheim’s Savvy sauvignon blanc is no me-too, could-be-from-anywhere version of the variety. It has the same kind of appetising mineral freshness as Closheim’s rieslings, combined with a delicate, verdant elderflower and gooseberry fruitiness that suggests the region is every bit as important in shaping the wine as the variety. Quinta de Aves Aluada Chardonnay, Castilla, Spain 2013 (£11, Marks &amp; Spencer) Chardonnay is to white wine what the croissant and baguette are to baking: a French export that is now found pretty much everywhere. It’s for that reason the variety became the anti-hero of wine’s anti-globalisation activists and shorthand for the standardisation of the world’s vineyards. If chardonnay’s remorseless expansion has somewhat slowed in the past decade, it continues to produce superb wines from all kinds of unlikely places. The heat and dust of central Spain, for example, may not seem a logical spot for great white wine of any kind. But the cool of Quinta de Aves’s high altitude vineyards have produced a gorgeously, exotically ripe but balanced Iberian take on chardonnay.

She was a strong advocate of single-sex schools for girls, believing that for them to achieve their full potential, particularly in subjects areas such as maths and science, it was important for girls to be taught separately. She was born in Helensburgh, Scotland, to George Haydock, a professor of philosophy at Glasgow University, and Cora (nee Mackenzie), a teacher. When the second world war broke out George sent Barbara and Cora to South Africa to escape the German bombing of the Clyde. She spent much of her teens in Cape Town, while Cora ran a nursery school in Muizenberg, a suburb of the city. When the war ended Barbara returned to Britain and began nursing training at St Mary’s hospital, Paddington, where she met a patient there, Les Webb, a fitter who later became a teacher. Barbara’s father retired from Glasgow University in 1948 and he and Cora moved permanently to South Africa. In the early 1950s Barbara and Les married, and were asked by her parents to move to Somerset West, near Cape Town, to help run the primary school they had set up there. It was meant to be a short assignment but lasted more than 20 years. While Les played the role of inspirational teacher, Barbara, the titular “matron”, focused on making sure everything ran smoothly. During this time she enrolled in the University of South Africa (the equivalent of the Open University) and was awarded a BA in history. With this qualification behind her she started her new career as a history teacher. At the beginning of the 70s it looked as if their dream of returning to the UK was about to be fulfilled. But Les died suddenly, and my mother had to start her new life back in Britain alone, with her youngest child, Kate, who was then only four. My sister, Amanda, and I had already gone ahead to study in the UK. Her first job was at Bicester school, Oxfordshire, teaching the sons and daughters of local farmers and those working on the nearby RAF base. Before long she was appointed deputy head at Overstone school, a PNEU school for girls, near Northampton. In 1979, after four years at Overstone, she was appointed headteacher of Burgess Hill school for girls, West Sussex, another PNEU school, where she remained until 1992. She enjoyed a long retirement, first on the Isle of Wight, where she spent some time as a schools inspector, served on the board of a housing association and painted seascapes. She then moved to the village of Stanton St John in Oxfordshire. She is survived by Amanda, Kate and me, and by her grandchildren, David, William, Jamie, Iona and Tom."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/football-league-blog/2017/aug/28/leeds-united-nottingham-forest-championship-match-report","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-28T09:00:29Z","webTitle":"Leeds United show Nottingham Forest there is life after the loss of Chris Wood | Nick Miller","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/football-league-blog/2017/aug/28/leeds-united-nottingham-forest-championship-match-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/football-league-blog/2017/aug/28/leeds-united-nottingham-forest-championship-match-report","fields":{"headline":"Leeds United show Nottingham Forest there is life after the loss of Chris Wood","bodyText":"There is a line of thinking that if a team is particularly reliant on one player, if all of their goals or creativity comes from that one part of the team, then getting rid of that player might actually be a good idea. The theory is that without the key performer a greater sense of collective responsibility takes over the team, that they don’t turn their lonely eyes to the star and that the unit becomes stronger. Of course, that might be complete nonsense. Ask most managers whether they would rather have a striker who scores loads of goals or not, and the only pause might be to peer at you slightly curiously. But after losing Chris Wood to Burnley last week Leeds, who moved to third place in the Championship with their 2-0 win against Nottingham Forest on Saturday, are not suffering excessively at the moment. Wood scored 27 in the league last season. The rest of the Leeds squad got 32 between them. And yet, since Wood made his last appearance, Thomas Christiansen’s side have played three games, won all of them and scored nine goals. Four have come from Kemar Roofe, who thanks to Wood’s success spent most of last season on the wing, but started as a centre-forward at the City Ground. That’s already one more than he managed in 47 appearances last term. The group, as former manager Garry Monk was so fond of calling them, are coping pretty well. “Here there is no player who is more important than the others,” Christiansen said after the game. “Everyone has to take their responsibilities: the strikers to score goals, to work for the team, the midfielders to work and assist, to work back and defend, the defenders to defend. Everyone has responsibility, and I don’t give more to one.” Wood’s sale has handed Christiansen a bag of lemons, and at the moment he’s making some pretty sweet-tasting lemonade. “Chris Wood helped the team as long as he was here,” he said, a note of exasperation in his voice at still being asked about a striker that no longer plays for him. He was a typical No9. But [his departure] gives me options to do some other things. What I like is to have players who can play in several positions.” Christiansen started his playing career at Barcelona, back in the days of Johan Cruyff’s Dream Team. Admittedly, Christiansen was not exactly a key cog in that particular side, but he has spoken of the things he learned about the game from Cruyff. It might be a little optimistic to try total football with Eunan O’Kane and Pablo Hernández rather than Michael Laudrup and Romario, but Christiansen can at least apply some of its fundamental aspects: positional flexibility, tactical fluidity, the idea that the collective will always trumps the individual. This isn’t to say that Wood was selfish, a man only out for himself, but when one player scores nearly half your goals in a season it is inevitable that a team will start to lean on him. With Wood now gone, goalscoring must become more of a team pursuit. A similar thing has happened to Forest, who sold Britt Assombalonga to Middlesbrough, and while this performance was, to say the least, not their best (the manager Mark Warburton called it a “shocker” and said “no positives” could be taken from it), they have also started the season in good order, with three wins and eight goals from five games. But Forest have conceded as many as they have scored, whereas Leeds have been tight at the back too. Saturday was their fourth successive clean sheet in the league: they haven’t let in a Championship goal from open play since the 39th minute of the opening day. Pontus Jansson and Luke Ayling in particular stood out on Saturday, but again Christiansen looked to share the praise around. “It’s not only the defenders: it’s the work of the strikers, the wingers, the midfielders,” he said. “This was probably our best game... We neutralised a very good attacking team who’s just beaten Middlesbrough and Newcastle. I’m not only happy, but very proud.” Scoring goals is a team effort, as is not conceding them. It isn’t a new principle, but it’s certainly one that will help a team get over the loss of a star player. “We have to be calm,” Christiansen said. “We have to be realistic, and we won’t win every week. There will be moments when we have bad times.” He might therefore need to have a word with the fan who yelled “see you at the Bernabéu” at the chairman, Andrea Radrizzani, as he posed for photographs after the game, but you cannot blame the fans for being optimistic. Talking points • “I’ve asked for certain people who would have brought in the experience and quality we require. Unfortunately we have not been able to get them over the line.” It won’t be a crashing surprise to learn that those passive-aggressive words of blame-shifting came from Harry Redknapp after Birmingham shuffled to a 2-0 defeat against Reading, their third in five games so far this season. Redknapp’s squad is not stuffed with world beaters, but neither is the cupboard as bare as Redknapp’s consistent carping would have you believe. But then again what did anyone expect? Redknapp is a fine coach, but more often than not his solution to any problem is a transfer, and his excuse for any failure is a lack thereof. Birmingham hired him to get them out of trouble last season because of his coaching pedigree and man management skills. Redknapp might need to show a bit of that rather than blaming an apparently deficient squad for their struggles. • The theory was fine, but Norwich’s attempt to recreate Huddersfield’s success by hiring the Borussia Dortmund reserve manager hasn’t started well in practice. Daniel Farke’s men shipped four goals for the second Saturday running, a 4-0 defeat to Millwall coming after last weekend’s 4-2 defeat at Aston Villa. Farke speaks very well, and comparisons to David Wagner are a little specious since the two men have very different playing styles and personalities, but the Huddersfield manager’s results feel a long way off at the moment. • If Barnsley manage to stay up this season, then there should not be much contest for the Championship manager of the year award. Paul Heckingbottom is a Tyke to his bones, which is probably just as well since anyone else probably would have walked by now. Barnsley had a hugely promising young team when they won promotion from League One in 2016, but they’ve almost all gone now, leaving Heckingbottom with a patchwork side of off-cuts and the untried. Saturday’s 3-0 win against Sunderland should be cherished not just because it might be relatively rare this season, but also because it was achieved against significant odds. • Bradford City’s players might want to think twice before chirping up in training this week. Four minutes after half-time in their game against Walsall life seemed fairly sweet, 3-0 up and cruising to a third win of the season. But two rapid goals shortly after, followed by an 87th-minute equaliser by Amadou Bakayoko, saw them throw away the advantage and their players face the wrath of the manager, Stuart McCall. “There are a lot of angry people in the dressing room and so there should be,” he said. “We can look at ourselves for decisions we made but sometimes players have to take responsibility. We were weak in certain areas.” He’s not angry, he’s just disappointed, which as any child in trouble will tell you, is a lot worse. Well, actually, he’s angry and disappointed. Which is even worse. • Finally, a win for Harry Kewell and Crawley. Appointing the former Leeds and Liverpool forward seemed a slightly risky move for Crawly, given that he was sacked from his job at Watford Under-23s last season after some desperate results, and it looked even more problematic after Crawley lost their opening three games and only managed a single goal in the process. But Saturday’s 3-0 success at Swindon provided some sweet relief. “It’s a great feeling but we’re not getting carried away, it’s only one game,” Kewell said. “What this can do is change a lot of things for us.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"education/2017/aug/27/journalism-must-pay-more-attention-to-the-voices-of-the-people","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-27T16:59:45Z","webTitle":"Journalism must pay more attention to the voices of the people | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2017/aug/27/journalism-must-pay-more-attention-to-the-voices-of-the-people","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/education/2017/aug/27/journalism-must-pay-more-attention-to-the-voices-of-the-people","fields":{"headline":"Journalism must pay more attention to the voices of the people","bodyText":"Well said, Jon Snow (In fractured Britain the media are part of a distant elite, 24 August)! I have been delivering the same message to WI meetings, Rotary dinners, village halls and anyone up ’ere in’t north who would listen ever since the British press retrenched to London and I retired to oblivion. Peopling journalism with home counties-bred, middle-class varsity types whose family incomes and proximity to London enable their offspring to fulfil the required “zero pay” contract for a couple of years is a poor way to build a campaigning, popular press; so is recognising an army of gossipy, untrained bloggers as a reasonable alternative to news. An excellent alternative is offered by former leading regional and international editor Neil Fowler, who proposes a national network of (hopefully profitable) local newspapers run by universities and major journalism colleges offering student journalists a two-year course/contract. Learning local journalism on the job would take the accidents of both birth and geography out of the business of producing fine, trustworthy journalists, as was the training regime when I was a junior on a Warrington weekly. David Banks (editor, Daily Mirror, 1992-94) Crookham, Northumberland • Jon Snow is quite right about the decline in local newspapers breaking an essential link between media and public. When I was news editor of the Kensington and Chelsea Post in the 1970s, we worked all hours cultivating contacts in the area to produce a paper of 48 pages or more a week packed with local news, competing with the equally vigorous Kensington News for the latest shock revelations. Privileged backgrounds and degrees were a rarity among the dozen or so editorial staff, most of whom, like me, started working on local papers in their teens. They went on to other jobs in the wider media, taking their grassroots experience with them. Hugh Closs London • I suspect part of the problem is that print journalism has become respectable, and has lost its spark. Where are the outsiders now that once made newspapers so special, like James Cameron, Claud Cockburn, John Pilger or Alan Watkins? Journalism has never been the same since it left Fleet Street. It might be better if it returned to its grubby but sometimes glorious roots. If/when established institutions collapse they will be replaced by a fractured, murky, digital media landscape; but that might not be a bad thing. A noble profession might also be reborn. Joe McCarthy Dublin, Ireland • Jon Snow’s call for greater diversity within the media is valid but still leaves journalists as the gatekeepers of ideas. We need a mechanism to enable the public to put issues of concern on to the national agenda. Asking questions in parliament, or on Question Time, has little effect and never results in a proper debate on any issue because of lack of time and respondents generally fighting their own corner. We need a different format to give a voice to stakeholders from all around the country. The BBC and C4 could broadcast in-depth programmes dedicated to single issues as proposed by the public; they would be presented and prepared by a diversity of journalists and editors, but the choice of topics would be citizen-led. Academics would be engaged for their expertise to moderate the discussions, and expose any outrageous and inaccurate claims. Politicians would not be involved. They should instead be listening. Thus could the Grenfell residents have initiated a debate on the state of public housing and attitudes towards tenants, and the public have been properly informed about the issues surrounding Brexit before voting in the referendum. Open this idea to the public and I think there would be a steady stream of subjects suggested for discussion. Susan Roebuck London • Journalists’ preoccupation with the affairs of government, parliament and the mainstream parties seems to leave them with little time and interest in the realities of life in the rest of the country. During parliamentary breaks, for example, BBC2’s Daily Politics programme closes down, as if problems freeze when politicians go on their holidays. When it returns, it predominantly features MPs, allowing space for “outsiders” only when a thinktank issues a report or some tragedy like Grenfell Tower hits the headlines. It should be the mission of journalists to seek out and give voice to the mass of people suffering from deprivation, inequality and injustice. Instead we have a mogul-controlled media mostly concerned with distracting viewers and readers into a kind of virtual world. Derek Heptinstall (retired journalist) Westgate-on-Sea, Kent • I admire Jon Snow and his journalism. I also acknowledge his declaration that “we [the media] have to widen both our contact with and our awareness of those who live outside and beyond our elite”. Yet open the pages of the 2018 edition of the Writers’ and Artists’ Yearbook and we find listed 104 regional and local newspapers plus a reference to 40 BBC local radio stations and more than 300 commercial stations up and down the country. So, what is this “virtual collapse of local journalism” Snow is lamenting? I accept – and I too lament – that the number of local papers has declined over the past 50 years or so. But there are hundreds of local journalists still digging out the stories from Inverness to Cornwall, from Bolton to Banbury. They are in touch with their communities. They are not members of “a distant elite”. They are the reliable disseminators of local news. And they work for wages Snow should consider unacceptable. Jack Thompson (former BBC correspondent in south-east Asia and Cairo) London • While I accept that the failure of the national media to accurately predict Brexit and the general election result shows a disconnect with the mood of the country, Jon Snow should refrain from self-flagellation over his personal responsibility in this and his inability to prevent the Grenfell Tower fire. Channel 4 bends over backwards to highlight minority and diversity issues, something he should be proud of. But I do agree that we should make a real effort to provide news literacy and create a society that is as connected to what it reads and views as with what it eats. The success of the 12-year-old Grenfell victim Firdows Hashim in winning the school debating competition judged by Snow and Bill Gates, and described as being “poised, confident and with a beautiful use of language”, suggests that this process has already begun. Stan Labovitch Windsor, Berkshire • Concerns similar to those expressed by Snow led to the growth of the British Workshop movement, a network of small, local media enterprises in towns across Britain in the late 70s and 80s. The individual enterprises were very varied but most filmed local issues, ran community film shows and provided media training for people other than the BBC’s public or grammar school. This network, although partly self sustaining, relied as well on the kind of local authority and central government cultural and social funding that no longer exists. Its reach was limited but impressive given that it was never more than modestly funded and existed for a fairly short period. Change needs to come from outside as well as inside the established media.

Canada and Mexico were being “very difficult” over the renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement, or Nafta, the president wrote, threatening to terminate the deal instead. Trump also demanded that Mexico pay for his border wall “through reimbursement/other”, signalled a visit to Missouri designed to pressure a Democratic senator, and praised a book by a controversial law enforcement official. Trump was at Camp David, the presidential retreat in Maryland. He spent most of the morning tweeting about rescue efforts in Texas as the Houston area was hit hard by flooding caused by Hurricane Harvey, which also devastated coastal communities. “I will be going to Texas as soon as that trip can be made without causing disruption,” he wrote. “The focus must be life and safety.” Referring to a Democratic senator up for re-election in 2018, Claire McCaskill, he added: “I will also be going to a wonderful state, Missouri, that I won by a lot in ‘16. Dem C.M. is opposed to big tax cuts. Republican will win S!” Nafta has been a target for Trump since the presidential campaign. Shortly before writing that he was “going to a cabinet meeting (tele-conference) … on #Harvey”, he tweeted that it was the “worst trade deal ever made” and added: “May have to terminate?” The US, Mexico and Canada have begun formal negotiations to rework the 23-year-old trade deal that Trump blames for hundreds of thousands of lost US factory jobs. The US has raised tariffs on Canadian lumber. Trump has also said: “Canada, what they’ve done to our dairy farmworkers is a disgrace.” At a rally this week in Phoenix, Trump said he would “end up probably terminating” Nafta “at some point”. Trump also used Twitter on Sunday to press the need for his promised wall on the US southern border. “With Mexico being one of the highest crime nations in the world,” he wrote, “we must have THE WALL. Mexico will pay for it through reimbursement/other.” In July, leaked transcripts of a January phone call showed that Trump told his Mexican counterpart, Enrique Peña Nieto, his promise that Mexico would pay was merely a political move. “From an economic issue,” he said, “it is the least important thing we were talking about.” He added: “Psychologically, it means something.” Trump also said: “The fact is we are both in a little bit of a political bind, because I have to have Mexico pay for the wall – I have to.” Trump has recently tied funding for his wall to domestic politics and an impending deadline for the funding of government. At his Phoenix rally, he threatened to prompt a government shutdown unless Congress agreed to fund the wall. Democrats do not agree it should do so. On Sunday, two days after issuing his pardon of former Phoenix sheriff Joe Arpaio, Trump also recommended a book by another controversial hardline sheriff, David Clarke of Milwaukee. In June, Clarke withdrew from consideration for a post in the Department of Homeland Security, amidst criticism of his behaviour in office and reports that he allegedly plagiarised parts of an academic thesis, which he denied. “A great book by a great guy,” the president wrote of Clarke’s tome, Cop Under Fire. “Highly recommended!”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2017/aug/27/john-abercrombie-obituary","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-27T15:34:58Z","webTitle":"John Abercrombie obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/aug/27/john-abercrombie-obituary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2017/aug/27/john-abercrombie-obituary","fields":{"headline":"John Abercrombie obituary","bodyText":"Since hipsters appropriated the word “cool” in the 1940s, it has come to mean anything from cutting-edge musical insight to sartorial style – a catholicity that spilled over into jazz culture, so that artists of ferocious intensity and reserve could equally qualify for the description. But some of the most beguiling meanings of “cool jazz” are about power without bravura, seductive ideas left glimmering in shadows, phrasing that is insinuated rather than explicit. Miles Davis, the saxophonist Lee Konitz and the pianist Bill Evans have been luminaries of those methods, and very close to their podium stood the guitarist John Abercrombie, who has died at the age of 72. Abercrombie was an understated, delightful performer throughout a career that took off in the 70s, and after an early period in which the rawness of rock and jazz-fusion were still evident in his sound, he moved toward the more fragile chamber-jazz dynamics that shaped his mature style. He was one of a gifted generation of young guitarists influenced by rock, Latin, country and electronics as much as by bebop or swing. But Abercrombie, whose long-lined fluency sometimes suggested the sensibility of a pianist more than a guitarist, would avoid making the fierce chime of a blues chord as explicit as his contemporary, John Scofield, or the sway of a country song as open-handedly amiable as Pat Metheny. His improvisations combined melodic unpredictability and a quietly purposeful momentum, and a typical Abercrombie set would mix unhurried, ruminative drifts into free jazz, elegaic ballads, and a characteristic brand of now-you-hear-it-now-you-don’t swing that could be as toe-tappingly infectious as versions that came much more explicitly to the point. In his early years, Abercrombie played with many of contemporary jazz’s most influential stars, including the drummers Chico Hamilton, Jack DeJohnette and Billy Cobham, saxophonists Gato Barbieri, Michael Brecker, Joe Lovano and John Surman, and the trumpeter/composer Kenny Wheeler over the course of a four-decade career with the German label ECM. The self-effacing Abercrombie was fond of joking that he wanted to feel like a sideman in his own bands, and many of his ECM sessions were discreet masterpieces of ensemble improvisation and empathy. But his work never retreated into cerebral privacy, since it always retained lyricism, narrative shape and the distant heartbeat of the groove. John was born in Port Chester, New York, the only child of John and Elizabeth Abercrombie, two emigre Scottish domestic workers. He grew up in Connecticut, and learned the guitar from the age of 14 on an acoustic given to him by his parents. He was hooked on country music and the R&amp;B of Chuck Berry at first, but turned to jazz when he heard the sleeker lines of the bebop guitarists Wes Montgomery and Barney Kessel. In 1962, he enrolled on the famous jazz course at Boston’s Berklee College of Music and performed with the soul-jazz organist Johnny “Hammond” Smith. After postgraduate studies at North Texas State University, he moved to New York in 1969 and worked with two influential genre-bridging groups, Hamilton’s innovative band and the pioneering jazz-rock ensemble Dreams, with Brecker, his trumpeter brother, Randy, and Cobham. In 1973, Cobham formed a high-energy fusion band of his own, and their exciting debut album, Spectrum, turned out to be a resounding and unexpected commercial success. Abercrombie joined for the group’s subsequent releases (Crosswinds, Total Eclipse and Shabazz), his sound growing harder and more insistent to suit the rock-fuelled agenda, his skill and power bringing him a fast-expanding international reputation. But it was a session for ECM in the same year that revealed where the newcomer’s real sympathies lay. The trio recording Timeless, with fusion keyboardist Jan Hammer and drums star DeJohnette, established Abercrombie’s low-key approach to an ensemble-oriented chamber-jazz, in which his airy lines, wide cultural references and subtle contrasts of electric and acoustic sound were counterbalanced by the more muscular methods of his partners. In 1975, Abercrombie developed the trio approach further, with DeJohnette and the bassist Dave Holland in the Gateway ensemble, a slowly evolving and popular collaboration that would reconvene sporadically for almost 20 years. From 1978 to 1982 Abercrombie also played in a powerful quartet including the pianist Richard Beirach and bassist George Mraz, and worked with DeJohnette, Scofield and the elegant acoustic player Ralph Towner. He had a flirtation with the synthesiser in the 80s, but though he sparingly used electronics and effects pedals, he never sacrificed his clarity of line and delicacy of tone colouration to the temptations of technology. He showed himself to be a free-jazz player of empathy and resourcefulness with the magisterial pianist Paul Bley in 1986, and worked in Wheeler’s groups, and with the bassist Marc Johnson and the drummer Peter Erskine. He lectured periodically at Purchase College, New York, and from the early 2000s released a succession of fine ECM recordings, including Class Trip (2004), the brilliant album The Third Quartet (2007) and last year’s softly rapturous Up And Coming. Abercrombie is survived by his wife Lisa (nee Abrams), whom he married in 1986. • John Laird Abercrombie, jazz guitarist, born 16 December 1944; died 22 August 2017 • This article was amended on 1 September 2017.

Italy is bearing the brunt of the European migration crisis, having seen almost 100,000 people arrive between January and June. Authorities are struggling to cope and efforts to promote integration have become strained. The prime minister, Paolo Gentiloni, is due to meet the French president, Emmanuel Macron, and counterparts from Spain and Germany, as well as leaders from Chad, Niger and Libya, on Monday for talks aimed at cutting illegal migration from Africa to Europe. The ongoing influx is deeply dividing Italy’s ruling centre-left Democratic party, while rightwing parties have seized on the issue as Italy prepares for a general election expected to be held before May 2018. In scenes that were widely condemned last week, police armed with batons fired water cannon at a group of around 100 refugees, mostly from Eritrea, who for several days had been camped out in a square in protest against their forced eviction from a nearby office building where they had been squatting. Some refugees hurled bottles, rocks and gas canisters as officers tried to clear the camp from the square near Rome’s central Termini station. “Unfortunately, these things happen ahead of elections,” Cécile Kyenge, an MEP and Italy’s former integration minister, told the Guardian. “In my opinion, good migrant reception needs to be a priority [in the campaign] – if reception and integration are done well, it would prevent conflicts like the one in Rome and benefit everyone. There are many examples of good integration in Italy, mostly in small towns, but there are also many examples of bad practice.” The refugees, many of whom had been granted asylum and who have jobs in Rome and children enrolled in schools there, were among a community of 800 who had been squatting in the six-storey building for five years. Authorities said they were evicted after refusing to accept alternative accommodation, and justified clearing the camp by pointing to the risks posed by the gas canisters the squatters had been using for stoves, in an area surrounded by residential buildings. Human rights advocates and the UN refugee agency protested that the eviction had been conducted without warning. Many asylum seekers sleep on the streets of Rome for lack of housing. On Saturday, thousands of asylum seekers, other migrants and supporters marched through the Italian capital carrying banners saying “refugees not terrorists”, calling for evictions to be halted and for refugees to be properly housed. As images of last week’s clashes spread across the world, Rome’s city council, which is led by the populist Five Star Movement, relented on Friday and allowed a group of 40 elderly, sick and young refugees to return to the building for six months after brokering a deal with SEA, the company that owns the block. The interior ministry is now reportedly drafting new guidelines stipulating that any future evictions must include relocation proposals for the most vulnerable. But the incident has highlighted the fact that 200,000 people are currently housed in state-run shelters as they await asylum applications. Disillusioned by their government’s inability to manage the situation, some Italians are also beginning to revolt. “If you look at the comments on news sites or on Facebook in response to what happened in Rome, you see that people are very passionate about migration and were mostly in favour of the police,” said Giovanni Orsina, a professor of political science at Rome’s Luiss University. Though the numbers of people arriving in Italy by sea fell in July – stymied by a crackdown on NGO search and rescue ships operating off the coast of Libya in the Mediterranean – around 140,000 migrants are projected to reach the country by the end of the year. In what was seen as a final political litmus test ahead of next year’s general elections, centre-right parties scored victories in local elections in June. The centre-right triumphed in mayoral votes in 15 of the largest cities, including Verona, Monza, Piacenza and the border town of Como, where migrants prevented from entering Switzerland have been sleeping rough in parks and outside the train station. Last week in the Tuscan town of Pistoia, which in June elected its first rightwing mayor since the second world war, a priest sparked controversy merely by taking a group of migrants to a local swimming pool. Members of the far-right Forza Nuova party said on Friday that they would “control” this week’s Sunday mass in retaliation. The biggest surprise of the June elections was in Lampedusa, the Sicilian island that has been at the centre of the migration crisis. The Unesco peace prize-winning former mayor Giusi Nicolini resoundingly lost to Salvatore Martello, a hotel owner who ran independently from Italy’s main parties and who said he “cannot stand seeing migrants swarming everywhere”. Daniela DeBono, a research fellow and senior lecturer at the European University Institute and Malmö University, said Italians were mostly frustrated at “the outcome of the gross mismanagement of the secondary reception system”. “Asylum processes can take up to three years, integration programmes are poor and then, of course, migrants are frustrated and are not allowed to be autonomous …that is quite rightly bothering Italians, especially bearing in mind the high rates of unemployment and precariousness at work,” she said. Orsina said: “People can’t stand this situation any longer, they don’t perceive it as something that is being well-governed. It’s beyond racism and fear – Italians might even allow half a million more migrants in, but they want to be able to decide rather than have it imposed on them.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"}]}}
