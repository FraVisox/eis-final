Carson, Donald Trump’s secretary for housing and urban development (Hud), faced sharp criticism at a hearing of the Senate banking committee in Washington. Sherrod Brown of Ohio, the committee’s senior Democrat, said Carson was filling positions at Hud “based on patronage rather than competence”, after the Guardian revealed that Carson’s chief information officer hired as an adviser a friend who has been repeatedly accused of fraud. Brown also lambasted Carson for ordering a $31,000 dining set for his Washington office while overseeing deep cuts to public spending on services aimed at helping Americans in poverty. “Under your leadership, Secretary Carson, Hud has decided a wobbly chair in a private DC dining room requires the urgent attention of no fewer than 16 staffers and thousands of taxpayer dollars,” Brown said in his opening remarks. Robert Menendez of New Jersey accused Carson of making “unbelievable” false statements, after the secretary this week blamed his wife for ordering the dining set despite internal emails stating that he was involved in selecting it. The Hud chief information officer, Johnson Joy, resigned this week after the Guardian reported that he and the adviser, Naved Jafry, ran an opaque charity. Jafry had already resigned following questions about his past. Brown asked Carson: “Do you think it would be better to advertise and compete for these jobs rather than hiring cronies through a subcontractor?” Carson denied doing so and laughed. Asked why Joy had left Hud, Carson said: “I lost confidence in his ability to lead.” Asked why he only learned of these issues from reports in the Guardian, Carson said: “As soon as I found out about the problems, we dealt with them.” Reminding Carson that he had cautioned against making public housing so pleasant that people might want to stay in it, Menendez told him: “Apparently your aversion to comforts and extravagance don’t flow to your office.” Last month it emerged that the $31,000 dining set had been ordered after another senior Hud official, who refused to exceed a $5,000 legal spending cap on redecoration, was reassigned to a more junior position. Carson’s spokesman, Raffi Williams, who first falsely said the dining set did not exist, then issued a statement claiming Carson and his wife, Candy, had no involvement in the ordering of the furniture. But in an August 2017 email subsequently released under freedom of information laws, a Hud staffer said Carson and his wife had “picked out” the furniture. Carson continued to make contradictory comments on the subject at Thursday’s hearing. Earlier this week, in testimony to a committee of the House of Representatives, he both blamed his wife for the purchase and then gave a new explanation: that the existing furniture had been dangerous and injured someone. “People had been stuck by nails, a chair had collapsed with somebody sitting in it,” he said. No references to such incidents appeared in the dozens of pages of released emails relating to the furniture purchase. One official mentioned that chairs were loose and said she did not want any to break. Asked if Carson’s testimony to Congress had been accurate, Jereon Brown, a Hud spokesman, said: “We’ll decline comment.” Asked again if he was really refusing to say whether Carson had told the truth, he said: “We’re declining comment to you on the testimony.” Joy was also accused of firing his executive assistant after she alleged to Hud’s internal watchdog that she had found corruption in the office’s contracting of staff from a private company. Brown reminded Carson on Thursday that he was one of five Democrats who voted to confirm the former brain surgeon as Hud secretary last year. “I’m not sure I made the right decision,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/mar/22/back-pain-drugs-scans-fixes-treatment-lancet","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-22T16:20:21Z","webTitle":"The hard truth about back pain: don’t rely on drugs, scans or quick fixes | Ann Robinson","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/22/back-pain-drugs-scans-fixes-treatment-lancet","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/22/back-pain-drugs-scans-fixes-treatment-lancet","fields":{"headline":"The hard truth about back pain: don’t rely on drugs, scans or quick fixes","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Back pain is the biggest cause of disability globally, and most of us will have at least one nasty bout of it. But treatment is often wasteful, wanton and wrong, according to a series of papers in the Lancet . “Worldwide, overuse of inappropriate tests and treatments such as imaging, opioids and surgery means patients are not receiving the right care, and resources are wasted,” it says. It’s perfectly understandable to want a quick-fix solution to make the pain go away and maybe a scan to set your mind at rest. But there isn’t a reliable instant solution. Scans don’t make you better, and painkillers can be harmful. The vast majority of low back pain is musculoskeletal – caused by damage to ligaments, joints and muscles surrounding the spine. A tiny percentage is due to a serious or dangerous underlying cause that needs specific diagnosis and intervention – such as cancer, infection or a fracture. An underlying cause is more likely if you have so-called red-flag symptoms; previous or current diagnosis of cancer, fever, unexplained weight loss and sweats, night pain, pain in the middle of your back rather than lower, inability to stand, urinate or open your bowels, or severe and unremitting pain that is getting worse. The good news is that if your backache is musculoskeletal – and it usually is – 90% of cases will be better within six weeks. And that is irrespective of what you do. There’s no good evidence that interventions, ranging from Tens machines (which use a mild electric current), acupuncture, physio, osteopathy and chiropractic to epidural injections and surgery, significantly affect the outcome. Prolonged bed rest – still advocated in some countries – is positively dangerous, as it can cause blood clotting (thrombosis) and makes recovery from back pain less likely. It’s tempting to want a scan or special investigations if you develop back pain. But scans don’t correlate well with symptoms; you can have a dire-looking scan with no symptoms or a fairly normal-looking one with dreadful pain. A scan is useful for surgeons if you need an operation, and other imaging is important if an underlying fracture is suspected. If your back pain is associated with an underlying inflammatory condition like Crohn’s, ulcerative colitis or psoriasis, you will need investigation and referral to a rheumatologist. The key to recovery is to try to keep walking and working. Different approaches help different people; it’s good to find the least risky option that suits you. My own favourite is a Tens machine: the evidence may not be great, but it’s cheap, safe, and happens to work for me. Painkillers can be useful in the short term, if that’s the only way you can keep moving. There are two main groups of effective painkillers, and they both come with health warnings: non-steroidal anti-inflammatories, (NSAID) such as ibuprofen, and opioids such as tramadol. There is already an epidemic of opioid overuse and addiction in the US, with Europe and lower-income countries catching up fast. NSAIDs are less addictive but can cause heart, kidney and gut damage if used for more than a few days at a time. Prof Nadine Foster of Keele University, one of the authors of this series of papers, says: “In many countries, painkillers that have limited positive effect are routinely prescribed for low back pain, with very little emphasis on interventions that are evidence-based, such as exercises. As lower-income countries respond to this rapidly rising cause of disability, it is critical that they avoid the waste that these misguided practices entail.” One in three people who has an episode of low back pain will have a recurrence in the following year. So it is important to look at adaptations to the workplace, avoiding heavy lifting and concentrate on core muscle strengthening with pilates, swimming and some types of yoga once you recover from the acute attack. Prof Jan Hartvigsen, of the University of Southern Denmark, who also contributed to the Lancet series, says: “Millions of people across the world are getting the wrong care for low back pain. Protection of the public from unproven or harmful approaches to managing low back pain requires that governments and health-care leaders tackle entrenched and counterproductive reimbursement strategies, vested interests, and financial and professional incentives that maintain the status quo ... Funders should pay only for high-value care, stop funding ineffective or harmful tests and treatments, and importantly intensify research into prevention, better tests and better treatments.” He’s right, of course, but there is no point withdrawing funding without any explanation. Healthcare professionals need to take the time to explain to patients that it’s not vindictive cost-cutting that is behind the restriction of access to scans and drugs. It’s in everyone’s best interests that we stop pursuing bad medicine and invest in finding better and safer solutions to this global problem, which is likely to affect all of us sooner or later. • Ann Robinson is a GP"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"music/2018/mar/23/classic-brit-awards-ceremony-return-june-after-five-year-absence","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-23T00:01:39Z","webTitle":"Classic Brit awards to make comeback after five-year absence","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/mar/23/classic-brit-awards-ceremony-return-june-after-five-year-absence","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/mar/23/classic-brit-awards-ceremony-return-june-after-five-year-absence","fields":{"headline":"Classic Brit awards to make comeback after five-year absence","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"After a five-year absence the Classic Brit awards, originally founded in 2000 in an attempt to create the same buzz for classical music as the Brits have for the pop industry, will return to the Royal Albert Hall this summer. It will be hosted by the musician and television presenter Myleene Klass and the actor Alexander Armstrong. Damned by one critic as “fundamentally tacky”, the ceremony with its glitzy set, amplified music and celebrity presenters, and past awards including a best album prize to Sir Paul McCartney for his Ecce Cor Meum, was regarded by many of the more highbrow classical fraternity as a celebration of crossover rather than true classical music. In 2008 the violinist, Nigel Kennedy, who is a previous winner of the award for outstanding contribution to music, condemned the organisers as “old farts” after they fell out over the choice of music he had intended to perform. This year’s ceremony on 13 June will certainly raise the same eyebrows. It will feature a performance by Andrea Bocelli, who recently topped the charts duetting with Ed Sheeran on the song Perfect Symphony. Tokio Myers, who won last year’s Britian’s Got Talent for a routine that included segueing Debussy’s Clair de Lune into a Rihanna song, will be a guest performer. The former Classic Brit-winning opera singer, Sir Bryn Terfel, is also on the bill alongside Ball &amp; Boe – Michael Ball and Alfie Boe – who have been touring the world playing sold-out stadiums. The ceremony will also feature the winner of the newly announced Sound of Classical poll for artists under the age of 30: the first entrant confirmed is Jess Gillam, 19, who became the first saxophonist to win the woodwind final of the BBC Young Musician of the World in 2016.

Most if not all of the clubs in the top half of the Premier League will be left with only a handful of players who are not on international duty but at Brighton and some other clubs a large percentage of us remain and have a full two weeks and in some cases three without a competitive match. I have read that this is the perfect opportunity for those players to go on a “mid‑season jolly” and fly to exotic destinations without a care in the world, let our hair down, top up our tans and in some cases drink more than we should be doing, heading off on almost a mini-stag do. Given the recent and understandably negative coverage of the taxi episode involving some West Bromwich Albion players, supporters and journalists can be forgiven for believing this to be the case, with the stereotypical perspective of a top-class group of footballers being immature, spoiled and unaware of the privileges of their profession being reinforced by tales of tawdry episodes while abroad. But these trips can be crucial in terms of the rejuvenation of the physical capabilities of players – helping them to train and afterwards recover with the health benefits of vitamin D from the sun. And perhaps more important is the opportunity for players to sit together, to have meals in a completely different environment and to have shared experiences as a group – something that is so important for the team dynamic and, if done sensibly and within the boundaries of acceptable behaviour, can have remarkably positive results in the improvement of that vital if intangible component, team spirit. I have been on mid-season breaks and sensed a complete change in the standard of performance both in training and matches, alongside an increase in the sense of the importance of the team group. By going away you end up sitting with players who you normally would not have time to socialise with amid the day-to-day demands of training, matches and family time at home. This is fantastic for group morale, with players finding not only common ground with each other but also having time to discuss their own performances with their peers and what needs to be done for the team to be successful for the remainder of the season. Players who are new to the club are afforded the chance to get to know their team-mates on a more personal, relaxed level and in turn the players they will have to rely on week in, week out in order for them to achieve positive performances on the pitch – individually and collectively. This time last year we went to Valencia for four days just after losing a crucial game away at Leeds in our quest for promotion to the Premier League. We feared at the time we were tiring and running out of steam but had a fantastic time together, training properly in the sun, recovering by playing cards or golf together and laughing as a group. When it came to our evening meals the topic spoken about every night and at length was how we could improve and how we needed to stick together. A real bond, already strong between us as a group, was further strengthened and the result when we got back was five wins in a row and an unbeaten run that took us to our wonderful position in the Premier League. Was that trip the sole reason for that run? Of course not but it didn’t adversely affect our performances and a lot of the players still at the club attribute that four-day period as having a crucial part in our success in achieving promotion last season. If done professionally and properly, without excessive drinking or behaviour, these trips can be hugely beneficial for teams either fighting for promotion or battling relegation. During the run‑in it is not only the technical and tactical side that will be important in gaining crucial results under severe pressure, it is also the psychological aspects such as resilience, togetherness and selflessness that are just as crucial, if not more so. These are not qualities that can be solely or artificially improved at the training ground but require the right environment. With the correct degree of professionalism they can be nurtured by being away together as a group, having shared experiences and strengthening the bond of a group immeasurably. That is why right now – although points are not being played for and performances are not being analysed – could be a crucial time in determining the outcome for many clubs come the end of the season. It is those teams and players that are training together in more exotic climes and spending important down-time with each other that will set the tone for the ever-important run-in. How they act, behave, train and socialise on such trips could either be a huge advantage or disadvantage come the season’s day of reckoning in May."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2018/mar/23/trust-review-danny-boyle-getty-fx","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-23T10:00:52Z","webTitle":"Trust review – Danny Boyle's Getty drama offers shallow pleasures","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/mar/23/trust-review-danny-boyle-getty-fx","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2018/mar/23/trust-review-danny-boyle-getty-fx","fields":{"headline":"Trust review – Danny Boyle's Getty drama offers shallow pleasures","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"It is not necessarily to the new FX series Trust’s misfortune that it should be aired in such close proximity to All the Money in the World, Ridley Scott’s big-screen take on the same material. While both works center on the 1973 abduction of heir John Paul Getty III in Italy and the desperate efforts to retrieve the 16-year-old, they represent these events with diametrically opposed styles. Scott’s film drew criticism for a certain matter-of-factness in its relation of the narrative, failing to deliver anything that a quick scan of the Wikipedia article would not. Creator Simon Beaufoy and director Danny Boyle, conversely, return to the hyperkinetic aestheticizing that enlivened their earlier collaborations Slumdog Millionaire and 127 Hours. If Scott did not do enough, Beaufoy and Boyle do the most. Trust may not have an Academy-caliber performance from Christopher Plummer, but it does have Donald Sutherland receiving penile injections and then baring his mighty erection before his spring-chicken Italian girlfriend while bellowing, “I. AM. MAGNIFICENT!” It has the gauzy color-streak interludes for which Boyle has made himself known, slow-motion/fast-motion juxtapositions, multiple exposures, just about everything but the formalist sink. It has some of the most vivid cocaine montages that television has produced in recent memory. It has a lion, for no reason in particular (aside from the fact that lions are cool). And it has a resurgent Brendan Fraser, bursting through the fourth wall like a cowboy-hatted Kool-Aid Man. There’s a whole lot going on in this supercharged soap opera, and fully embracing a hectic atmosphere suits the living Dynasty episode that is the Getty clan nicely. That the miserly J Paul Getty (Sutherland) would refuse to pay ransom money for his own grandson (Harris Dickinson, doing a dirtbag Jim Morrison) out of pure penny-pinchery hints at a deep vein of family psychosis further supported by generations of submission to vice. Something about being obscenely wealthy makes people behave theatrically, and Beaufoy gives his characters lots of scenery to chew: they make dramatic entrances, bursting into rooms to deliver soliloquies with Shakespearean grandeur (if not always with Shakespearean eloquence). Getty the elder makes the Bard comparison himself over dinner in one of the early scenes, name-checking King Lear and Richard III in case the audience is a little slow on the uptake. Even when Trust manages to be a good time, it’s not always good TV. Beaufoy errs on the side of obviousness, whether that’s the played-out soundtrack cuts (Ballroom Blitz soundtracks an impromptu riot), his characterization, or the plainly stated dialogue. Sutherland has a ball playing Getty as a Scrooge for the corporate era, but the leaden lines articulating his money-hunger narrow the range the actor can access. As the younger Getty’s concerned mother, Hilary Swank fares substantially better, but her anger and concern get sidelined while more sensational components command the run time. Gunplay, infighting among the terrorist kidnappers, and all manner of drug escapades detract from the human element of a portrait of a complicated dynamic between relatives. Perhaps it’s specifically because of his isolation from the Getty bloodline and its attendant melodrama that J Paul Getty’s fixer James Fletcher Chace emerges as the show’s standout character. Fraser plays the grownup country boy as half man-of-action and half boob, the kind of guy who can deliver a serious-minded monologue on Big American Themes without realizing he’s got a milk moustache. Though he commands the second of the three episodes provided to critics in advance, he remains an unknown (and possibly unknowable) quantity in the show’s moral calculus. A CIA operative turned glorified errand-runner, Fletcher has conflicted ideas about his duty to his employers and the riches that make him uncomfortable even as he comfortably benefits from them. If Fraser wants to make the comeback that the magazine profiles have predicted, this performance provides a compelling opening argument for it. Chace acts as the audience’s compromised guide through this lurid account of true crime, adjoining the procedural elements of investigation and lead-chasing to the family discord at the heart of the show. That all gives Beaufoy plenty to work with, and yet the sum total of his efforts lacks a certain substance. Getty’s world-class greed scans as a scripted character trait more than a bone-deep pathology, just as Li’l Getty’s hard-partying ways suggest another unruly youth rather than a victim of his own corrosive fortune. The familial unit is a hotbed of psychological unrest and simmering neuroses, and neither Trust nor its silver screen cousin have fully engaged with the warped thinking that could engender a situation so thoroughly depraved. Chekhov said every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way; if that’s true, then why is all their misery so banal?

Now comes the author of that study, Harvard geneticist David Reich, with his book that gives us, at last, the first draft of a true history of the last 5,000 years. Genetics first started to complement the work of archaeologists and linguists in the 1990s in the work of Reich’s mentor, the Italian-born population geneticist Luca Cavalli-Sforza. But genetics was the poor relation at the time because its data was so thin. Not any more. The genome is a palimpsest that retains strong traces of the past, so current populations can reveal something of previous population movements. What has changed everything has been the ability, beginning as recently as 2010, to sequence DNA directly from ancient human remains, sometimes as old as 40,000 years. Reich revisits recent breakthroughs in charting the early history of humans, but his most dramatic discoveries have been made in the more recent past. Most significant developments in human history have happened in the last 10,000 years since the retreat of the great ice sheet, and for Europe the past 5,000 years are crucial. Although studies in ancient DNA have now leapfrogged archaeology and linguistics to become the best source of knowledge on prehistoric human populations and migrations, they dovetail with those disciplines in a three-way corroborative process. Reich’s work can finally answer the tantalising question first posed by an British civil servant, Sir William Jones. In 1786, he discovered the kinship of Sanskrit and ancient Greek. This led to the recognition of the vast Indo-European language family – which includes the Germanic, Celtic, Italic, near eastern (Iranian) and north Indian languages (Hindi, Urdu, Bengali, Punjabi, Marathi, etc) – but not to any consensus on how this might have occurred. Reich has now shown that the Indo-European languages and the largest single component of the genetic makeup of Europe and north India today stem from migrations around 5,000 years ago from the vast Steppe, the grass plains bordering the Black and Caspian seas. These people were pastoral nomads who drove wheeled vehicles, rode domesticated horses and began to use dairy products – a package that was to guarantee their dominance wherever they went. Their migrations were the engine that powered the bronze age. Homer described a society in which warlords gained prestige and wealth through plunder and rape. It is not pretty, but is highly congruent with what we now know of the Yamnaya (the Beaker people represented the far western wave of Yamnaya migrations). Of theirs and other such male-dominant migrations, Reich drily comments: “Males from populations with more power tend to pair with females from populations with less.” He deals commendably with the abuses that have been made of stories of origins – notably Nazi ideology – and recognises that some ideologues will want to exploit and contest his findings, too. It’s intriguing to know that most people of European descent have close genetic and linguistic ties with near eastern and north Indian peoples, but what is the global picture and what are the implications of these new findings? The overriding lesson ancient DNA teaches is that the population in any one place has changed dramatically many times since the great human post-ice age expansion, and that recognition of the essentially mongrel nature of humanity should override any notion of some mystical, longstanding connection between people and place. We are all, to use Theresa May’s derisive label, “citizens of nowhere”. The Beaker people replaced 90% of the population of Britain around 4,500 years ago. Related to this is the knowledge that all life, from its beginnings, has been an essentially improvisatory, impure process. As Reich puts it: “Ideologies that seek a return to a mythical purity are flying in the face of hard science.”His findings have important medical implications, too. For instance, his research in India has shown the profound consequences of caste-system inbreeding. There is an abundance of recessive diseases – both partners in some couples carry mutant genes from way back in the lineage. In fact, such populations make gene hunting easier because genes causing recessive conditions come with characteristic markers. Reich’s overall picture will, in time, acquire much greater detail – just as Darwin’s great study was a beginning not an end – but we should be grateful to him and his large team of co-workers (including his wife, science writer Eugenie Reich, who had a big role in the book’s creation) for putting the essential story before us now. It is thrilling in its clarity and its scope. • Who We Are and How We Got Here: Ancient DNA and the New Science of the Human Past is published by Oxford University Press.

The head of the riverine communities of Montanha e Mangbal had been tipped off that assassins were preparing an ambush. They wanted to end his resistance to mines, deforestation and dams that threaten the Tapajós river. It was not the first narrow escape. Two of his friends, Francisco Firmino da Silva and Pedro Braga da Silva, have also been on the hitlist of a notorious local businessman since they allied with indigenous groups to demarcate their territory. The authorities have been notified of the attacks. Police know the name of the mafia-like boss who wants them dead. The community leaders have requested guards from a federal protection programme. But so far, the law has been absent, leaving the villagers vulnerable to more violent, economically powerful and environmentally destructive forces. The case - which was related to the Guardian ahead of World Water Day on Thursday - highlights one of the biggest problems facing conservation: impunity and a lack of protection for water defenders in traditional communities. The subject has received little attention at this week’s World Water Forum, the pre-eminent global talking shop for management of sanitation, drinking supplies, hydropower, irrigation, watershed management and a host of other related issues. Tens of thousands of statesmen, corporate executives, investors, government officials, engineers, academics and NGO representatives have gathered in Brasilia for this triannual event, which aims to push forward the UN goal of providing clean water and sanitation to everyone on the planet by 2030. There is a growing sense of urgency. A UN report on Monday warned that 5 billion people could face water stresses in the coming decades as a result climate change, pollution and rising demand. At the an opening of the conference, Brazil’s president, Michel Temer, said the world must race to avert disastrous loss of water supplies. “There is simply no time to lose,” he said. Yet in Brazil, the world’s most water-rich country, hundreds of cities face drought and many more communities are afflicted by contamination of supplies, while those that try to defend these resources are often murdered or criminalised. These concerns are raised at an alternative forum in the park outside the main conference hall, where representatives of riverine and indigenous communities have joined workshop and discussions with anti-fracking campaigners, anti-dam groups and opponents of water privatisation. The assaults on Brazil’s rivers are far more evident here than in the main forum. Activists from the Krenak indigenous group describe how livelihoods have been destroyed along the Rio Doce in the wake of the 2015 collapse of a tailings dam owned by a subsidiary of Brazilian mining giant Vale and the Anglo-Australian multinational BHP Billiton. Nineteen people died in that accident - Brazil’s worst environmental disaster - but many more are still suffering because the river is contaminated. They cannot fish and have to rely on water truck for drinking supplies. “When the river died, we died with it,” said Daniel Krenak. From the Xingu river, campaigner Antonia Melo described how traditional residents are struggling to cope with environmental and social damage caused by the huge Belo Monte dam, which has been followed by Brazil’s worst levels of deforestation and crime. From the Tapajós, Francisco Firmino described his own narrow escape from hitmen hired by the same boss who targeted the village chief, Pereira. “We have been fighting for water, for the forest and for our grandchildren for many years,” he said. “But things have got worse because even the states seems to be against us.” His life, he said, was saved not by police but by allies from the Munduruku indigenous group, which is campaigning against dams, mines and a series of soya ports, which would add to the river traffic and pollution. Alessandra Munduruku described how women have moved to the forefront of the community’s campaign to protect territory. “The government doesn’t care for us, only for agribusiness so our struggle is very difficult. We are up against illegal mines, loggers, ports, roads, agribusiness and investors from China and Canada,” she said. “The men are weak, but we have a different vision. We think more about our children and grandchildren. The best thing for them is to protect the river and forest.” In their call for more legal support, the campaigners also noted the contamination of rivers and groundwater around the Norwegian-owned Hydro Alunorte alumina refinery in Barcarena, northern Pará state, and the murder last week of local community activist Paulo Nascimento, who had been receiving threats. Although such cases are primarily aired outside the conference halls, the World Water Forum has for the first time invited judges and prosecutors to underscore the importance of rule of law in conservation and sustainable use of water. Senior UN officials and the head of the World Water Council have also urged wider adoption of nature-based solutions (wetlands and forests rather than dams and reservoirs), indigenous knowledge and sustainable small-scale farming. Yet for all the talk of “sharing” (the principal theme of the forum), business still rules. This is evident in the exhibition centre, which prominently features Nestle, Suez, Eletrobras, Brazil’s National Confederation of Agricultural Workers and various national trade and technical organisations. The only civil society representatives are a handful of global NGOs. The top-down approach is evident in the recommendations of the World Water Council’s high-level panel - chaired by the United Nations secretary-general António Guterres and president of the World Bank Group, Jim Yong Kim - which focus on the need for more infrastructure investment to overcome a growing crisis. Without better water management, it says national growth rates could fall by 6% of GDP. “If actions are taken sooner rather than later and decision-makers invest in water security, our water resources can be managed more effectively, and communities will be better protected from crises,” explains World Water Council president, Benedito Braga. The forum highlights how water security is rising up the political agenda, with more groups involved, a wider set of solutions discussed and a greater sense of urgency. But, while the river defenders and community activists are left outside, the focus is still on exploiting nature rather than protecting it."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/mar/22/story-one-mans-pregnancy-trans-jason-barker","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-22T06:00:17Z","webTitle":"The story of one man’s pregnancy: ‘It felt joyous, amazing and brilliant’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/mar/22/story-one-mans-pregnancy-trans-jason-barker","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/mar/22/story-one-mans-pregnancy-trans-jason-barker","fields":{"headline":"The story of one man’s pregnancy: ‘It felt joyous, amazing and brilliant’","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"It’s hard to perform a somersault at 36 weeks pregnant. Towards the end of his debut feature film, Jason Barker is swimming in the London Fields lido in east London, a short walk from the flat he shares with his partner, Tracey. The screen is rinsed blue. Barker dances, makes a star. And then, very slowly, he turns full height in the water, his Hawaiian swim shorts flapping, his stomach a perfect, firm dome. This is the viewer’s first sight of Barker’s pregnant belly in A Deal With the Universe, which premieres at the BFI Flare festival next week. And after seven years in which he and Tracey tried to conceive, it is a moment of pure levity and joy. “That swimming stuff that you see?” he says. “It felt like the first time I could ever say, ‘Yeah! I actually like this body. Love it. It’s brilliant.’” Barker was born female. He transitioned roughly 20 years ago, at 26, soon after he met Tracey – though, as Barker says, before and after don’t really work in this story. The process of transitioning was gradual, “without hard edges”. The two of them hoped to start a family, but after a few years of Tracey trying to conceive with her own eggs, in 2003 they resorted to “plan B”. Tracey would be impregnated; Barker, who had undergone chest surgery but kept his ovaries, would supply the eggs. He bought a new camera to document it. Soon they would have a baby – and a film. So Barker stopped taking testosterone. He delayed an appointment to discuss a hysterectomy. Well, it was just a short film. Not too disruptive. But the filming went on and on – and Barker ended up telling a very different story to the one he planned. The pregnancy he chronicled was not Tracey’s, but his own. And it changed his sense of who he was. Pregnancy among transgender men is increasingly common. Sally Hines, a professor at the University of Leeds who is leading a three-year research project into the subject, says: “In the UK, if you look at how many people are accessing blogs and online forums and support groups, asking about healthcare because they are pregnant, or young guys thinking about the future … There is lots of anecdotal evidence that more people are doing it. When something becomes visible, more people think it’s possible.” But 10 years after Thomas Beatie, from Hawaii, made headlines with his combination of beard and baby bump – the first publicised case of a legal male, in a traditional marriage to a woman, to give birth – the data remains scant. In Australia, 54 people who identified as men gave birth in 2014, according to Medicare statistics. In the UK, the Office for National Statistics collects no information on the gender of the birthing parent; neither does the NHS. Last year, British newspapers including the Sun and the Independent hailed Hayden Cross as “Britain’s first pregnant man”. Soon afterwards, they had to hail another man, Scott Parker, after he got in touch to say that he had given birth a few months earlier. “There have been about six first pregnant men,” Barker notes wryly. His son turns eight this year. And yet the idea of transmasculine pregnancy as a novelty holds sway. Each birth is greeted as the first. It is perennially surprising, and I wonder if this is because it is conceived by cis people as a double-edged contradiction that undermines both the common conception of pregnancy as inherently female and the sense of a completed transition – as if a trans man carrying a child constitutes a sort of U-turn. But, as Hines says, “Transition is not a straightforward A to B … Pregnancy is not an interruption, just another part of a long and complex journey.” Barker’s film begins with him prizing a state of heightened masculinity. When Tracey can’t conceive, he longs for “a penis and testicles”. He strikes muscular poses while washing the windows of their caravan, and the thought of his eggs entering her makes him feel like “cock of the walk”. He says it in a way that emphasises the pun. But, as the film progresses, a subtler story emerges. “I had this fantasy picture,” he says. “I thought, I’ll have a baby, and that night I’ll go and have a pint, and about two weeks after that I’ll start on the testosterone again … Job done.” Pregnancy was a transient state, “a strange bit of my life”, after which normality would be restored. But, pretty quickly, the film begins to transmit more mixed messages. As soon as he is pregnant, Jason appears in a pair of denim dungarees, that classic of 1970s maternitywear. In labour, he looks forlorn in a cerise nightie with a cute animal motif. He laughs when I ask why, in pregnancy, he resorted to these conventional cues for femininity. “You just grow so massive and you’ve got nothing!” he says. Retailers of pregnancy clothing aren’t exactly teeming with options for trans men. Tracey went to New Look and bought a load of maternity trousers, but even the combats were embroidered with flowers. She had to get a needle and unpick them. In pregnancy, Barker mostly passed “as a fat bloke”. No one offered him a seat on the bus. No one batted an eyelid when, dressed in jeans and a cardie, he walked along the canal towpath to Nando’s two days before giving birth. He was both in plain sight and, owing to the relative rarity of pregnant men, hidden. In an antenatal class, when the teacher instructed all the pregnant folks to feel their hips, and he obeyed, the man beside him gave a nudge and said: “I don’t think we have to bother, mate!” For as long as he could remember, Barker had had a body that didn’t fit. “And now you’re here,” he tells his son in the film, “and I can’t think like that any more.” It would be easy to imagine pregnancy as a time of heightened gender dysphoria for trans men. “I had expected most people to have more dissonance with their body during pregnancy,” says Alexis Hoffkling, a researcher and medical student at the University of California, San Francisco who is trans herself. A few years ago, she started interviewing trans men who had been pregnant and found that while “some had a lot harder time with their bodies … [others] felt empowered”. Some found it masculinising. “They were more like a fat dude than they had ever felt before. As their body got bigger, they felt stronger.” When Barker began to piece together the 25 hours of tape he had recorded over eight years of trying to start a family, a worry began to form. “The proper story,” he thought, “would be that somebody keeps their gender identity regardless. ‘I’m a man and I’m pregnant but I’m still a man, and this is a man’s pregnant tummy.’ But for me, it felt really different.” Barker says he is naturally a very binary person. “I’ve been ever so serious about gender in my life. That it’s this thing you have to be fully committed to. Because my generation of trans people had to be fully committed in order to access treatment.” It took a while, but slowly he began to let go of his self-interrogation, what he calls “the whole pregnant man thing”. He stops to think. The closest comparison, he says, is that being pregnant was like watching Mo Farah run. “He is so graceful. He’s not having to go, ‘I’m trying to run!’ like the rest of us. And that’s how it felt for me: ‘Wow. I’m just doing this.’ It felt joyous and amazing and brilliant.” In the same way that Barker would always stand up for his friends against transphobic strangers, now he felt compelled to protect his pregnant body against his own sense of incongruence. “I would defend that body. That body is a beautiful thing because of what it’s doing and what it’s done,” he says. The body was “all about my kid”. So, in a way, it was a selfless body? It didn’t feel right when Barker was its sole occupant, but when it acquired another, an other, it became a better fit? I wonder if Barker felt less male when pregnant. But he says only: “Honestly, I had a really lovely time.” “I’m going to ask you a very personal question,” he says, leaning forward. “When people talk about getting broody again, it’s pretty ick, isn’t it? It’s icky because none of us likes to think we are ruled by our hormones?” That’s true, I say. But, speaking personally, I did get broody again. “Yes, so did I!” he exclaims, delighted. He and Tracey knew that they wouldn’t try for another child, because it had taken them a decade to conceive and they didn’t want to lose their son’s infancy in endless rounds of IVF. But for a long time after the birth, Barker lived with a sort of second, shadow baby. “I’d have these fantasies that somehow, a few months later, they’d say, ‘Just a minute! We think there’s a twin in there!’ I’d think about it all the time, that I was somehow accidentally pregnant and nobody knew. ‘Kangaroos do it,’ I’d think. Would there possibly be a way? They’d say, ‘We don’t know how it’s happened but it’s like your body stored it.’ And I’d be, ‘Well, there you go! A miracle!,’” he says. He never had the hysterectomy. He hasn’t taken testosterone in 15 years, since he and Tracey embarked on their plan B. There is, as yet, no guidebook to pregnancy for trans men, though Barker’s film will fortify others who wish to follow in his footsteps. There is a memoir, Where’s the Mother? Stories from a Transgender Dad, by Trevor MacDonald, who lives in Manitoba, Canada, and who carried his own children, now three and seven. MacDonald founded a Facebook group on birthing and breast- or chestfeeding for men. The questions that come up repeatedly are practical ones. What is the impact of testosterone on a trans man’s chances of conceiving? (Barker took it for three years.) How does chest surgery affect lactation? (This subject is off-limits for Barker, but MacDonald fed his own children and became the first openly trans volunteer at La Leche League, the breastfeeding support group, after they initially told him it was “inappropriate” for them to help him. From his own research conversations with trans men, he knows that some found nursing reduced their experience of gender dysphoria around their breasts: “It seemed to have to do with those body parts serving a purpose that they otherwise didn’t,” he says.) Once, in hospital, the nurses called Barker ‘Mum’. But after racking his brains, that is the single misstep he can recall. MacDonald says he is amazed that Barker had such a smooth experience with his healthcare providers. There are plenty of stories of those who don’t – specimen bottles routinely given to thin female partners instead of the pregnant man, and so on. Registering the birth was a hurdle, though. Barker had no choice but to officially be his son’s mother. As well as his name, he included his birth name under the designation “AKA”, because he dreaded “some kind of clerical error that would make the baby not mine”. That sounds “completely paranoid”, he says, but growing up with section 28 had given him the idea of “not thinking that you deserve to be spoken about, do certain jobs or have certain things”. And those things included, presumably, a child. Mostly, though, parenthood has been free of administrative challenges. In fact, “Being out and about as a dad with a small baby attracted more attention than being a ‘pregnant man’ did!” he says. Barker is a writer, but he is also his son’s prime carer. “I remember him crying on a bus and a woman shouted, ‘Not as easy as you thought, was it?’ Also I once shocked the whole Stay and Play when I told them that my partner had gone back to work two weeks after the baby was born.” Their little boy has grown up with an understanding of his family, how he came about. Ever since he was born, they have told it to him almost like a bedtime story. (He has heard it so often, he sometimes rebukes his dad for “boasting about being trans”.) Discussing Harry Potter one day, Barker’s son wanted to know which of the characters Barker would be if he could choose anyone. “Hagrid,” Barker replied. In the films, the hirsute, giant gamekeeper is played by Robbie Coltrane. “Well, you’ve already got the beard,” his son said, appreciatively. A film needs an arc, of course – to end somewhere other than where it started. Barker’s worry about this, when he began to edit the footage last year, was, “My God, will somebody think I’m cured [of being trans]? It’s a horrible thought,” he says. It’s all right for Tracey, his indomitable partner, whose eyes continue to sparkle even through a mastectomy for breast cancer. She didn’t need an arc. She could just be brilliant all the way. “I think my arc,” he says, “is going from somebody who thinks being an ordinary man is the best thing you can be to somebody who sees a different way of being. To a certain extent it’s about femininity,” he says, tapping the table as if he’s put his finger on it. “I’d pushed [it] away from a really young age, and I think it’s about bringing some of that back. And you realise how undervalued this work is … And it does make you think, ‘What was I pushing away? What was I scared of?’ “It’s about vulnerability, I think,” he says, and it is a surprise to hear him say it, because the quality he most wants to surface in the film is resilience. Of course, the two go together, and Barker’s story is about both of those things, and the personal regrowth that can come from giving birth. He not only challenged boundaries in the world around him, but in his own understanding of himself.

Researchers found tiny amounts of the illegal substances on 13% of volunteers who took part in a study after declaring they did not take the drugs. Rather than suspecting dishonesty, the scientists believe the participants became contaminated from banknotes, tables and other surfaces. “We were quite surprised. We thought there might well be cocaine knocking around in the environment, but we did not expect to pick up these drugs at the fingerprint level,” said lead author Melanie Bailey, a lecturer in forensic analysis. “The people we took samples from were at the university, so it is possible they knew others who were taking substances, or had been in an environment where these substances were taken,” she added. In 2011, an official investigation for the Home Office found that 11% of banknotes were contaminated with cocaine. The Surrey team recruited drug users and non-users to help them develop a forensic fingerprint test for class A drugs. The test exploits the fact that while innocent people can have traces of illicit drugs on their skin, users secrete the drug and its breakdown products in their sweat. For the study, scientists analysed fingerprint swabs from 50 people at the university who claimed not to use class A drugs. They next swabbed 15 patients seeking help at drug rehabilitation clinics who testified to using either cocaine or heroin in the previous 24 hours. Writing in the journal Clinical Chemistry, the researchers describe how their test picked up marked differences in the levels of cocaine and heroin found on the fingertips of drug users compared with non-users. The best results came when people washed their hands, because this removed any environmental contamination and made the real drug users stand out. After hand-washing, the test identified 87.5% of cocaine and 100% of heroin users. The forensic test could now find its way into prisons and workplaces to crack down on illegal drug use. Because the test requires a person’s fingerprint, it is hard to fake and comes with built-in personal identification, Bailey said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2018/mar/23/this-weeks-new-tracks","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-23T11:00:02Z","webTitle":"This week’s tracks reviewed: Halsey, 2 Chainz and Seinabo Sey","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/mar/23/this-weeks-new-tracks","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/mar/23/this-weeks-new-tracks","fields":{"headline":"This week’s tracks reviewed: Halsey, 2 Chainz and Seinabo Sey","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Seinabo Sey I Owe You Nothing You know what they say about Seinabo Sey songs: you wait two years for one and two come along at once.

Pop songs are only cool when they have rappers on them, and thankfully 2 Chainz had space in his schedule.

Facebook provided the dataset of “every friendship formed in 2011 in every country in the world at the national aggregate level” to Kogan’s University of Cambridge laboratory for a study on international friendships published in Personality and Individual Differences in 2015. Two Facebook employees were named as co-authors of the study, alongside researchers from Cambridge, Harvard and the University of California, Berkeley. Kogan was publishing under the name Aleksandr Spectre at the time. A University of Cambridge press release on the study’s publication noted that the paper was “the first output of ongoing research collaborations between Spectre’s lab in Cambridge and Facebook”. Facebook did not respond to queries about whether any other collaborations occurred. “The sheer volume of the 57bn friend pairs implies a pre-existing relationship,” said Jonathan Albright, research director at the Tow Center for Digital Journalism at Columbia University. “It’s not common for Facebook to share that kind of data. It suggests a trusted partnership between Aleksandr Kogan/Spectre and Facebook.” Facebook downplayed the significance of the dataset, which it said was shared with Kogan in 2013. “The data that was shared was literally numbers – numbers of how many friendships were made between pairs of countries – ie x number of friendships made between the US and UK,” Facebook spokeswoman Christine Chen said by email. “There was no personally identifiable information included in this data.” Facebook’s relationship with Kogan has since soured. “We ended our working relationship with Kogan altogether after we learned that he violated Facebook’s terms of service for his unrelated work as a Facebook app developer,” Chen said. Facebook has said that it learned of Kogan’s misuse of the data in December 2015, when the Guardian first reported that the data had been obtained by Cambridge Analytica. “We started to take steps to end the relationship right after the Guardian report, and after investigation we ended the relationship soon after, in 2016,” Chen said. On Friday 16 March, in anticipation of the Observer’s reporting that Kogan had improperly harvested and shared the data of more than 50 million Americans, Facebook suspended Kogan from the platform, issued a statement saying that he “lied” to the company, and characterised his activities as “a scam – and a fraud”. On Tuesday, Facebook went further, saying in a statement: “The entire company is outraged we were deceived.” And on Wednesday, in his first public statement on the scandal, its chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, called Kogan’s actions a “breach of trust”. But Facebook has not explained how it came to have such a close relationship with Kogan that it was co-authoring research papers with him, nor why it took until this week – more than two years after the Guardian initially reported on Kogan’s data harvesting activities – for it to inform the users whose personal information was improperly shared. And Kogan has offered a defence of his actions in an interview with the BBC and an email to his Cambridge colleagues obtained by the Guardian. “My view is that I’m being basically used as a scapegoat by both Facebook and Cambridge Analytica,” Kogan said on Radio 4 on Wednesday. The data collection that resulted in Kogan’s suspension by Facebook was undertaken by Global Science Research (GSR), a company he founded in May 2014 with another Cambridge researcher, Joseph Chancellor. Chancellor is currently employed by Facebook. Between June and August of that year, GSR paid approximately 270,000 individuals to use a Facebook questionnaire app that harvested data from their own Facebook profiles, as well as from their friends, resulting in a dataset of more than 50 million users. The data was subsequently given to Cambridge Analytica, in what Facebook has said was a violation of Kogan’s agreement to use the data solely for academic purposes. In his email to colleagues at Cambridge, Kogan said that he had created the Facebook app in 2013 for academic purposes, and used it for “a number of studies”. After he founded GSR, Kogan wrote, he transferred the app to the company and changed its name, logo, description, and terms and conditions. CNN first reported on the Cambridge email. Kogan did not respond to the Guardian’s request for comment on this article. “We made clear the app was for commercial use – we never mentioned academic research nor the University of Cambridge,” Kogan wrote. “We clearly stated that the users were granting us the right to use the data in broad scope, including selling and licensing the data. These changes were all made on the Facebook app platform and thus they had full ability to review the nature of the app and raise issues. Facebook at no point raised any concerns at all about any of these changes.” Kogan is not alone in criticising Facebook’s apparent efforts to place the blame on him. “In my view, it’s Facebook that did most of the sharing,” said Albright, who questioned why Facebook created a system for third parties to access so much personal information in the first place. That system “was designed to share their users’ data in meaningful ways in exchange for stock value”, he added. Whistleblower Christopher Wylie told the Observer that Facebook was aware of the volume of data being pulled by Kogan’s app. “Their security protocols were triggered because Kogan’s apps were pulling this enormous amount of data, but apparently Kogan told them it was for academic use,” Wylie said. “So they were like: ‘Fine.’” In the Cambridge email, Kogan characterised this claim as a “fabrication”, writing: “There was no exchange with Facebook about it, and ... we never claimed during the project that it was for academic research. In fact, we did our absolute best not to have the project have any entanglements with the university.” The collaboration between Kogan and Facebook researchers which resulted in the report published in 2015 also used data harvested by a Facebook app. The study analysed two datasets, the anonymous macro-level national set of 57bn friend pairs provided by Facebook and a smaller dataset collected by the Cambridge academics. For the smaller dataset, the research team used the same method of paying people to use a Facebook app that harvested data about the individuals and their friends. Facebook was not involved in this part of the study. The study notes that the users signed a consent form about the research and that “no deception was used”. The paper was published in late August 2015. In September 2015, Chancellor left GSR, according to company records. In November 2015, Chancellor was hired to work at Facebook as a user experience researcher. Neither Facebook nor Chancellor has responded to numerous queries about his knowledge of Kogan’s and GSR’s activities."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/mar/21/salisbury-britain-friends-europe-eu-allies-defence","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-21T18:37:07Z","webTitle":"After Salisbury, Britain must realise its true friends are in Europe | Martin Kettle","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/21/salisbury-britain-friends-europe-eu-allies-defence","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/21/salisbury-britain-friends-europe-eu-allies-defence","fields":{"headline":"After Salisbury, Britain must realise its true friends are in Europe","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Of all the vacuous slogans generated by the entire Brexit campaign and process, “Global Britain” is the most vacuous of all. Not before time, the phrase is being called out for what it really is. Last week the Commons foreign affairs select committee dismissed it as meaningless, the former head of the Foreign Office trashed it as “mushy thinking”, while the Economist scorned it as “globaloney”. Yet still Theresa May presses on with using it. She was at it again today in prime minister’s questions. After a sycophantic backbencher had suggested to her that leaving the EU provided “Britain’s greatest opportunity”, May responded that “a truly global Britain” would soon be able to “forge its own way” in the world. The operative word there was “forge”. For this is dishonest nonsense on stilts. Global Britain is a slogan masquerading as a policy. Predictably, it therefore appeals to Boris Johnson. The foreign secretary has said it shows that Britain is not “some bit-part or spear carrier on the world stage”. In fact, as the Economist’s columnist rightly pointed out, it is three foolish ideas rolled into one: complacent grandiloquence about Britain’s standing, dismissive perversity towards Europe, and post-imperial fantasy about the English-speaking “Anglosphere”. Over several months, the Tory MP Tom Tugendhat and his foreign affairs committee colleagues have been asking ministers and diplomats to clarify what exactly Global Britain is supposed to mean. The diplomats’ offerings, the MPs’ report last week confirmed, consisted of confusion and platitudes. The Foreign Office’s memo to the committee was little more than a detail-free restatement of what the department is doing already. The Salisbury attack on Sergei and Yulia Skripal ought to be a national wake-up call about such muddled, lazy thinking. Whether it was carefully timed is unclear. But it was certainly much more than an attempted spy-on-spy murder attempt. It was a state-on-state declaration. The attack on the Skripals, coming on top of several other mysterious deaths of high-profile Russians, proclaimed to the world that Britain is a weak country, and getting weaker. At the start of this year a senior British diplomat told me that, post-Brexit, the big message he got when he talked to opposite numbers was that the world sees Britain leaving the EU as a step away from reality. It sends them, he said, an unmistakable signal that Britain does not matter as much any more and that it is turning inward. And this has happened just at a time when the US is ruled by a compulsive disruptor and China by a strategic autocrat. Yet behind the rhetorical flatulence, something interesting may nevertheless be happening. That something is the very opposite of what the Global Britain fantasists either want or intend. For at precisely the time when Britain still remains bent on leaving the EU, many of the UK’s policymakers are cleaving ever more determinedly to Europe in other ways. The most striking of these moves is in the UK defence world, and it has permission from the very top. May often says that Britain wants a “deep and special security” relationship with Europe after leaving the EU. The words often seem ridiculous in a Brexit context. But in defence, they describe something increasingly real. Malcolm Chalmers of the Royal United Services Institute wrote recently that on most of the issues facing European nations, “the UK is now closer to its main European allies than it is to the US”. This week, in a rare on-the-record speech, the permanent secretary for the MoD, Stephen Lovegrove, put a name to it. He called it a policy of “leaning to Europe”. Lovegrove’s speech on Tuesday to King’s College London’s Strand Group was very clear. It was an “absolute priority” to be a partner in continuing European defence projects. In the task of defending the nation and in defence planning, “We’re not going to do ourselves any favours if we pretend we can row our own boat.” Britain’s allies saw it the same way. “You can’t optimise European defence without Britain,” he added. In defence terms, this is not really new thinking. Along with France, Britain has long been the highest spending and best equipped of the western European Nato states. What makes it new, though, is the context. In the age of Trump and Brexit, these assertions that Britain intends to continue to treat collective European security as an absolute priority inevitably seem freshly freighted. They have nothing to do with the Global Britain claptrap. They have everything to do with a hard-headed recognition that, when the chips are down – as they are in the Skripal case, for instance – Britain is a European nation and a European partner. It would be extremely surprising if they were not reflected in the outcome of the current strategic defence and security review. The Skripal case has underlined this in many ways. What did May do after the attack? She didn’t pretend to be leading a superpower. She didn’t threaten war. She didn’t adopt the inane approach of blowing raspberries at Russia, as Johnson and the new and unimposing defence secretary, Gavin Williamson, did. Instead she stayed on the moral high ground. She turned to Britain’s allies on the basis of their shared values. Understanding alliances is just as important for political leaders as understanding threats. Britain’s allies are in Nato and, for another 12 months, the EU. Both have responded decisively to UK calls for solidarity in the last week, and for good reason. Any state that decides it can murder people in our country will ultimately be prevented from doing so only by the opposition of a collective security alliance that efficiently penalises those who ignore international rules. That is why these alliances exist, and it is why Britain should continue to be part of both of them, especially now. • Martin Kettle is a Guardian columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2018/mar/25/the-week-in-radio-archive-on-4-king-and-kennedy-assassinations-perfect-husband-pitiable-artist","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-25T05:59:44Z","webTitle":"The week in radio: The King and Kennedy Assassinations; Perfect Husband, Pitiable Artist","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/mar/25/the-week-in-radio-archive-on-4-king-and-kennedy-assassinations-perfect-husband-pitiable-artist","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2018/mar/25/the-week-in-radio-archive-on-4-king-and-kennedy-assassinations-perfect-husband-pitiable-artist","fields":{"headline":"The week in radio: The King and Kennedy Assassinations; Perfect Husband, Pitiable Artist","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Archive on 4: The King and Kennedy Assassinations: If the Dead Could Speak (Radio 4) | iPlayer Perfect Husband, Pitiable Artist (Radio 4) |iPlayer Hasn’t it been interesting to hear how BBC radio has dealt with the Facebook-Cambridge Analytica scandal? Well, no. Because the BBC hasn’t, not really. Our national broadcaster has gone with the polite auntie approach: it’s picked up the story with cake tongs, given it a little nibble and put it back down on the plate. The Today programme spoke to Aleksandr Kogan on Wednesday, The Media Show got the Observer’s fantastic Carole Cadwalladr on, but there hasn’t been the quick-reaction programming that you would expect. Perhaps it’s coming next week. Never mind. Obsessing over news isn’t the best way to live, no matter how thrilling the idea that your Facebook updates might have been used to change politics (in favour of happy dogs, judging by my feed). So let’s be positive about the BBC’s approach, and turn to Radio 4’s antidote to all this history-unfolding-in-front-of-us stuff. What is this antidote? Actual history. Last night’s Archive on 4 gave us The King and Kennedy Assassinations: If the Dead Could Speak, Michael Goldfarb’s hour-long in-depth look at the USA in 1968 – the year of the murders of Martin Luther King and Robert Kennedy. Oooh, it was fascinating. From the opening archive – a news announcer live at the King assassination: “He’s pointing the gun at me!” – to the end speech, from Kennedy’s daughter Kerry, this was an absorbing, revelatory programme. In the first few minutes, Goldfarb deftly described the US of 50 years ago – “like a developing country” – and then settled in to weave past events with contemporary analysis, relevant archive winding around interviews with living friends and children of the two politicians. I found the testimonies of King’s close colleague, Andrew Young, and Kerry Kennedy the most moving. Kennedy was hopeful for those fighting for human rights today. “There are thousands and thousands and thousands of kids demonstrating after the school shooting in Florida...” she said. “They didn’t just sit home and say: ‘This is a rotten system.’” Young was there when King was shot. “The bullet knocked him out of his shoes,” he said. Archive on 4 is an interesting slot: in it, clever producers and presenters such as Goldfarb and Phil Tinline (who produced last week’s episode Disinformation: A User’s Guide) are allowed to really get to grips with the past, to delve deep, think hard, offer an educated take. The result is complex, nuanced broadcasting. And, of course, history gives us insight into what’s happening today. There are poignant similarities, there are aching differences. One of the latter: how politicians spoke. King, obviously, drew on the raise-the-roof sermons of the American black church to great effect, but Kennedy was no mean orator either. We heard part of his off-the-cuff speech to a vast crowd in Indiana, on the day of King’s death. “He dedicated his life to love and justice between fellow human beings,” said Kennedy. “He died in the cause of that effort.” Compare such dignity with the illiterate tweets of the current US president, or the cowardly stonewalling of our own prime minister. We’re living in a time of ferment and fervour, of radicalism and revolution. If only someone in power would (could?) speak properly about it. Another historical take: Perfect Husband, Pitiable Artist gave us an insight into the French composer Claude Debussy. Pianist Lucy Parham proved a lovely presenter, illustrating her Debussy roundup by playing short phrases of Clair de lune on the piano. Debussy, in essence, was an amazing musician but a rubbish husband. Not a surprise, really. What was a surprise was how this story was intercut with the musings of Lætitia Sadier of the band Stereolab. Gradually you realised that this wasn’t yet another tale of a dead white male artist, but the story of the women who find themselves living around such a man. The story of domesticity, as well as genius. Excellent. Fab film podcasts that aren’t Wittertainment The Cinemile I’ve written about this lovely podcast before, but they’re now on the 100th episode, and I’m happy to celebrate. It’s a simple premise: husband and wife Dave and Cathy go to see a film in the cinema and then talk about it on the walk home. For the special milestone episode, they went to Spain, just so they could review The Shape of Water in water (and not to have a holiday or anything). They walk in the sea – it’s a bit cold - and deliver their usual funny arguments and insights into Guillermo del Toro’s latest. Switchblade Sisters From podcasting colilective maximumfun.org, this show “provides deep cuts on genre flicks from a female perspective”. This means we get films like The Shining, Invasion of the Body Snatchers, Rosemary’s Baby, plus other, less well-known, movies, each one wittily and thoughtfully analysed by journalist April Wolfe and a female film-maker, actor or producer. Loads of information and insight make this one of the best film pods around. Links on the website lead you to the films if you haven’t already seen them. Smersh Pod For fans of James Bond – or indeed, non-fans of the daft old sexist – John Rain’s podcast delves into a different Bond film every episode. Sometimes the sound needs sorting out (as in the Licence to Kill episodes), and I could do with the show being 20 minutes shorter, but the general campery and ludicrousness of 007 and his silly celluloid life prove an excellent source of jokes and fun. Also, it’s amazing how many Bond films you know, without even meaning to. They’re like Beatles songs."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2018/apr/06/getting-curious-with-jonathan-van-ness-queer-eye-star-explains-it-all-podcasts-of-the-week","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-06T11:10:21Z","webTitle":"Getting Curious with Jonathan Van Ness: Queer Eye star explains it all - podcasts of the week","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/apr/06/getting-curious-with-jonathan-van-ness-queer-eye-star-explains-it-all-podcasts-of-the-week","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2018/apr/06/getting-curious-with-jonathan-van-ness-queer-eye-star-explains-it-all-podcasts-of-the-week","fields":{"headline":"Getting Curious with Jonathan Van Ness: Queer Eye star explains it all - podcasts of the week","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Picks of the week: Getting Curious with Jonathan Van Ness and Meat Getting Curious with Jonathan Van Ness If you’ve seen Netflix’s Queer Eye, you will know Jonathan Van Ness for his unending positivity and blowdrying skills.

Small Changes Amnesty International’s deputy director of communications, Thomas Coombes, says that the old way of appealing for help during a human rights crisis – simply by telling people all that is wrong in the world – risks making the public fearful and hopeless. The solution, he says, is to offer hope. Asking people fleeing war and persecution to tell their own stories is the best way to forge a direct emotional connection and reach out to people watching an appeal.

The 68-year-old was found dead at his home in New Malden, south-west London, on 12 March and a postmortem showed he died from compression to the neck, suggesting he was strangled. Police ruled out suicide and launched a murder investigation last Friday. “We, the family of Mr Nikolay Glushkov, are very grateful for the messages of sympathy received,” his relatives said in a statement issued through the Metropolitan police, using an alternative spelling of his first name. “A special thank you goes out to the Metropolitan police and the emergency services for their rapid response and assistance on the night. “We are devastated at the loss of Nikolay and are coming to terms with our grief. We are assisting the counter-terror command with their investigation. As a result we will not be making or releasing any further public statements at this stage of the investigation.” Detectives have appealed for any footage or images that motorists or cyclists may have captured on dashcams or headcams in Clarence Avenue on Sunday 11 March or Monday 12 March. At the time of his death, Glushkov was about to defend himself against a fraud claim brought by the Russian airline Aeroflot at the commercial court in London. In 2017, during a trial in absentia in Russia, he was sentenced to eight years in prison for stealing $123m (£87m) from the airline, which then pursued the case in London. Glushkov failed to arrive at court in central London on 12 March and his body was discovered that evening. He was a friend of the oligarch Boris Berezovsky, a critic of Vladimir Putin who had clashed in court with Roman Abramovich. Berezovsky was found hanged at his ex-wife’s home in Berkshire in 2013. Police said they believed he killed himself but a coroner recorded an open verdict. Police have said that at this stage there is nothing to suggest any link to the attempted murders of Sergei and Yulia Skripal in Salisbury this month, nor any evidence that Glushkov was poisoned. “Detectives are retaining an open mind and are also appealing for anyone with information that could assist the investigation into Mr Glushkov’s murder to contact them in confidence,” Scotland Yard said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/mar/21/boris-johnson-compares-russian-world-cup-to-hitlers-1936-olympics","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-21T16:40:48Z","webTitle":"Boris Johnson compares Russian World Cup to Hitler's 1936 Olympics","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/mar/21/boris-johnson-compares-russian-world-cup-to-hitlers-1936-olympics","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/mar/21/boris-johnson-compares-russian-world-cup-to-hitlers-1936-olympics","fields":{"headline":"Boris Johnson compares Russian World Cup to Hitler's 1936 Olympics","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Boris Johnson has predicted Vladimir Putin will revel in the World Cup in Russia this summer in the same way that Adolf Hitler did in the Olympic Games in Berlin in 1936, and suggested the UK may advise English football fans to avoid travelling to the tournament for their own safety. The foreign secretary said about a quarter of the number of fans who travelled to watch England in Brazil in 2014 were currently expected to go to Russia. He said 24,000 people had purchased tickets, as opposed to 94,000 at the same point in the run-up to the tournament in Brazil. Johnson revealed that the British diplomat responsible for liaising with UK fans had been thrown out as part of the diplomatic expulsions in the wake of the poisoning of a Russian former spy, Sergei Skripal. Russia has also said it is closing the British consulate in St Petersburg, restricting the ability of the UK embassy to help visitors in the event of violence. Johnson said he would be seeking urgent assurances from Russia that it would fulfil its obligations under the World Cup contract to ensure the safety of fans. “I think it is up to the Russians to give us an undertaking that they will be safe,” he said. Both Russia and England have a history of violent football fans, and the risk of fierce fighting between the two sets of fans appears to be higher given the political tensions. The Russian foreign ministry responded to Johnson’s remarks by saying he was “poisoned with venom of hate, unprofessionalism and boorishness”. It said: “It’s scary to remember that this person represents the political leadership of a nuclear power.” Johnson was speaking to the all-party foreign affairs select committee and responding to remarks from the Labour MP Ian Austin, who called for England to pull out of the World Cup altogether. “Putin is going to use it in the way Hitler used the 1936 Olympics,” Austin said. Johnson replied: “I think that your characterisation of what is going to happen in Moscow, the World Cup, in all the venues – yes, I think the comparison with 1936 is certainly right. It is an emetic prospect of Putin glorying in this sporting event”. However, he said he did not think it would be fair to ban the England team from competing. Austin described Putin as a KGB “thug” who had enriched himself. Johnson said he did not believe Putin had been re-elected in a free and fair election, saying there had been no true competitive choice. Johnson again rejected Moscow’s assertion that it had nothing to do with the attack on Skripal and his daughter, Yulia, on 4 March. He said: “No matter how exactly it came to be done, the pathway, the chain of responsibility seems to me to go back to the Russian state and those at the top.” A Russian official said on Wednesday that Moscow would not accept the results of an inquiry into the source of the poison being undertaken by the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons. At a televised briefing to Moscow-based diplomats, Vladimir Yermakov, a deputy head of the foreign affairs ministry’s department for non-proliferation, said: “It is not possible to evaluate what happened in Salisbury within the framework of the [chemical weapons] convention and within the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons. Deeper expert evaluations will be needed, and in any case we need to conduct our own investigations for Russia to be able to draw any conclusions.” He suggested the UK was “hiding facts” about the case that may later “disappear”. A sometimes flustered Yermakov was confronted at the briefing by diplomats from the UK, France, the US, Slovakia and Sweden all separately challenging the Russian handling of the case. The British diplomat, Emma Nottingham, accused the Russians of having “a record of state-sponsored assassinations”. Yermakov responded: “Aren’t you ashamed of yourself? Pull yourselves away a little bit from your Russophobia and your island mentality.” EU heads of state will meet on Thursday and express solidarity with the UK over the Skripal attack but will not directly ascribe responsibility to Russia. The EU council president, Donald Tusk, said the EU would agree “to increase our resilience to hybrid threats such as undermining trust in our democracies through fake news or election meddling”. He said he was in “no mood to celebrate Putin’s election” – remarks designed to contrast strongly with a gushing letter of praise to the Russian leader from the EU commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker. Differences across the EU mean no new Russian sanctions will be proposed at least until clearer liability emerges from either the British police or OPCW investigations. Johnson said he had been struck by “the mountain of disgust globally” directed at Russia and claimed the UK had been picked on for standing up to Russia on human rights, Syria and Ukraine. Russia for its part suffered “a revanchiste bitter feeling about the way the cold war ended”, leading Putin “to want to cause trouble wherever he can”, he said. He said the UK would crack down on Russian oligarchs living in “big schlosses in fashionable districts of London”, so long as there was evidence that their funds had been gained illicitly or corruptly. Johnson said he was prepared to investigate whether wealthy Russians were sending money back to Moscow through Russian debt bond auctions. Russia raised $2bn in a debt auction in London last week."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/mar/21/manchester-students-jailed-selling-800k-drugs-dark-web","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-21T16:47:22Z","webTitle":"Manchester students jailed for selling £800k of drugs on dark web","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/mar/21/manchester-students-jailed-selling-800k-drugs-dark-web","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/mar/21/manchester-students-jailed-selling-800k-drugs-dark-web","fields":{"headline":"Manchester students jailed for selling £800k of drugs on dark web","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"A gang of students from the University of Manchester who funded a luxury lifestyle by selling more than £800,000 worth of drugs on the dark web have been jailed for up to 15 years. The men partied in the Bahamas, Jamaica and Amsterdam and boasted of their fondness for Veuve Clicquot rose champagne before they were intercepted by the FBI. One student claimed to have bought a Manchester city centre flat and paid off his student loan with some of their $1.14m (£812,000) sales. The gang, who compared themselves to the Breaking Bad character Walter White, included undergraduates studying pharmacology, computer science, petrochemical engineering, geology and marketing. Sentencing the group on Wednesday, the judge, Michael Leeming, said the five “intelligent and personable” students operated a one-stop shop for drug-dealing on the dark web marketplace Silk Road. The ringleader, Basil Assaf, 26, a former grammar school pupil from Buckinghamshire, was sentenced to 15 years and three months in prison. Family members of Assaf, a petrochemical engineering student who had no previous convictions, cried and hugged each other as he was led to the cells. Manchester crown court heard how the group sold drugs to fellow students to fund their own habits before expanding their operation, selling ecstasy, LSD and ketamine across Europe, the US, Australia and New Zealand on Silk Road using the cryptocurrency bitcoin. At one point the group was nominated for drug dealer of the year on the site, leading Assaf to boast to his accomplice Jaikishen Patel: “Nominated for shotter of the year haha on SR. Someone posted a thread and prof nominated us. TBF if they knew what we did IRL we do deserve it.” The value of their sales was at least £812,000, the court heard, but their profits are likely to have grown exponentially due to the rise in the value of bitcoin over the period. Prosecutors have so far been unable to trace Assaf’s bitcoin. Between May 2011 and October 2013 the group sold 16.7kg of ecstasy worth $750,000, as well as 1.23kg of 2CB, a a psychedelic drug more potent than ecstasy, and 1.46kg of ketamine in more than 6,300 transactions with buyers across the world. Sentencing the group, the judge said use of the dark web was an aggravating factor and that the harmful and dangerous class A drugs wrought misery on society. “As intelligent men, you will each appreciate the misery that is caused and contributed to by people like you,” he said. “My duty is threefold: firstly, to protect the public from people like you. Second, to punish you, and third, to deter those who may be similarly minded to act this way in the future.” He added: “These offences are so serious that only immediate custody and sentences of some length can be considered.” James Roden, 25, who read computer science, and Patel, 26, who studied pharmacology, were both involved with the Silk Road account and the buying and supplying of drugs. Roden received a 12-year prison sentence and Patel was jailed for 11 years and two months. Elliot Hyams, 26, a geology student who had been at Dr Challoner’s grammar school in Amersham, Buckinghamshire, with Assaf, was involved in the underworld startup but was thrown out after Assaf “lost patience” with him, the judge said. Hyams was jailed for 11 years and three months. Marketing student Joshua Morgan, 28, who the judge accepted played the smallest role in packaging drugs for the group, was jailed for seven years and two months. Assaf and Roden were arrested at their Manchester city centre flat on the day the FBI shut down Silk Road in October 2013. Officers found laptops used to access the dark web, thousands of pounds in cash, a baseball bat next to the front door and drugs including LSD, ecstasy, ketamine and diazepam. A picture of a flask recovered from Roden’s phone featured an image of Walter White, the Breaking Bad chemistry teacher turned crystal meth dealer, which the court heard was a “running joke” between the defendants."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2018/mar/21/this-is-just-fracking-by-another-name","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-21T17:35:27Z","webTitle":"This is just fracking by another name | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/mar/21/this-is-just-fracking-by-another-name","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/mar/21/this-is-just-fracking-by-another-name","fields":{"headline":"This is just fracking by another name","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The threat that you refer to (National parks land faces new oil threat, campaigners warn, 16 March) actually looms over a great swathe of south-east England, not just national parks. And the plethora of promised wells will not be “conventional” as your article states – at least not in the scientifically accepted meaning of the word. A new, political definition of “conventional” was inserted into national minerals planning guidance in March 2014 by the then Department of Energy and Climate Change. It declared “conventional” all sources of oil and gas in limestone and sandstone. This is not true. Both limestone and sandstone, geologically speaking, can be conventional or unconventional. The scientific divide between the two pivots on permeability – how freely oil or gas can flow through the rocks. And, deep within the shale under the Weald, the thin, muddy limestone layers that are currently the target of oil companies have low permeability. They are unconventional. It is convenient for the oil industry to be able to claim its drilling to be conventional. To the public, media and planners it makes oil wells seem a more minor issue. But the industry’s plans are major. Precisely because of the low permeability of the target rocks (now muddy limestone, soon no doubt the surrounding shale), there will be a need for a great many wells. You can extract oil only by getting up close to each bit of “unconventional” rock, and dissolving it with acid or cracking it open. Stephen Sanderson, CEO of UK Oil and Gas, said of his plans for Surrey and Sussex: “This type of oil deposit very much depends on being able to drill your wells almost back to back.” In the north and the east Midlands, they call a frack a frack, in both scientific and political-speak. For the moment, here in the south-east, the presence of the limestone “impurities” within the shale, along with the devious government definition of “conventional”, allow oil companies to avoid the F-word while getting their drills into the ground across our land.

This Saturday, Yoshi’s mother, Mieko Hattori, will again make a call for action in the US when she speaks at a March for Our Lives rally in the Japanese city of Nagoya. She wants to show solidarity with Florida’s Marjory Stoneman Douglas high school students, who have pleaded for “sensible gun control” after the 14 February attack in which 17 people were killed and 17 wounded. “I was moved by the high school students challenging the government on the gun control issues,” she told the Guardian. “I felt something was changing at the bottom. I hope adults who have common sense take actions with them for the US to be safer country. The future is for the young.” Mieko Hattori and her husband Masaichi Hattori added in an emailed statement: “Adults should treasure the wish of young people for their peaceful future.” After Yoshi’s death, his parents gathered about 1.7 million Japanese and 250,000 American signatures on a petition calling for action. President Bill Clinton met the Hattoris in November 1993, and their campaign helped to build momentum for the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act, which introduced background checks for people buying firearms. The Hattoris still recall Yoshi’s fascination with US culture – and his hope that America might one day become his “second home”. His student exchange experience was meant to last for a year, but was cut short after just two and a half months. During his trial, Peairs testified that Yoshi – dressed as John Travolta in Saturday Night Fever for the Halloween party – didn’t stop approaching when Peairs said “freeze”. Peairs claimed he had used his .44 Magnum equipped with a laser sight in self-defence when Hattori failed to stop. It was unclear whether Hattori understood Peairs’s command. The case attracted wide coverage in Japan, where guns laws are much stricter than in the US. In an attempt to build something positive from the tragedy, the Hattoris set up a scholarship scheme bringing high school students from the US to Japan on exchange. It was funded by proceeds from a civil lawsuit against the shooter. So far, 25 students have travelled to Japan for placements with a homestay family for about a year at a time. They commute to local schools and learn about Japanese customs. “They experience Japan life with no fear of guns,” the Hattoris said. “They learn we Japanese do not have the idea to protect ourselves by guns but are safer than the USA. Of course it is not perfect safety as there are some violence from illegal guns, [but] through their experience here in Japan we hope they could look over the situation of the US.” In 2014, there were just six gun-related deaths in Japan, a country of 127 million people, according to figures compiled by GunPolicy.org, a resource affiliated with the University of Sydney, Australia. In the same year there were 33,599 gun-related deaths in the US. It is estimated that civilians in Japan hold a total of 710,000 guns, including legal and illegal weapons. The equivalent estimate for the US, according to GunPolicy.org, is between 270m and 310m. The Hattoris are sensitive to differences between Japanese and American attitudes towards guns. They said they understood many Americans viewed guns as a form of self-protection, but added an important caveat: “If they desire to have guns at home and in their areas they have to accept stronger gun control laws because it is very easy for we human beings to make a mistake.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/mar/22/europe-collective-defence-strategy-counter-russia-putin","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-22T10:04:46Z","webTitle":"Europe needs a collective defence strategy to counter Russia | Guy Verhofstadt","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/22/europe-collective-defence-strategy-counter-russia-putin","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/22/europe-collective-defence-strategy-counter-russia-putin","fields":{"headline":"Europe needs a collective defence strategy to counter Russia","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"On Tuesday, Jean-Claude Juncker wrote to Vladimir Putin to congratulate him on his electoral success, presumably taking inspiration from the list of global demagogues and dictators who were also quick to send their congratulations, from President Nicolás Maduro of Venezuela to President Alexander Lukashenko of Belarus. President Trump followed, but at least his advisers had given express instruction: “DO NOT CONGRATULATE”. Which, of course, the American president ignored. Shamefully, neither Juncker nor Trump mentioned the deployment of Russian-made chemical weapons in Salisbury, nor did they raise concerns about the legitimacy of the so-called “election” we have just witnessed in Russia. Michael Link, the German MP who led the independent OSCE election-monitoring mission to Russia, has been clear that they found there was no “real choice” for voters. Voters were herded to polling booths, and ballot boxes stuffed, while the main opposition leader Alexei Navalny was banned from standing. So, no, this is no time for congratulations. Yes, we will always need dialogue with Russia, but closer ties must be conditional on respect for the rule of law. Too often, the west has rolled over while the Russian bear mauls our liberal democracies, corrupts our political systems, hacks our political parties, pollutes our online ecosystems, and seeks to drag European countries back to a violent and divided past. While European leaders have responded with warm words of support for Britain in the wake of the Salisbury incident, we need to deliver a serious collective European response that can be framed as part of a new EU strategy towards Russia. With this new strategy we should show to Mr Putin that his violations of international law have clear consequences, but also open up the perspective of cooperation and engagement, provided Russia starts delivering on its commitments under international law and starting with the implementation of the Minsk agreements. Instead of sending congratulation letters, EU leaders, and in particular high-representative/vice-president Federica Mogherini, should therefore come up with such a proactive strategy. First of all she should push for clear EU-wide sanctions in response to the Sergei Skripal case. If there is one thing that truly alarms the mafia elite surrounding Putin, it is the prospect of being denied access to their European villas. It is essential that Brexit does not weaken foreign policy and security cooperation across Europe. The European parliament’s proposal for an umbrella EU–UK Association Agreement sets out a framework for delivering this. We must ensure security and defence agreements are in place before the end of the transition period. We need a comprehensive, Mueller-style, EU-wide investigation into the extent of Russian influence on our democracies, economies and political systems, which can set out credible responses. It is wrong that Russian billionaires can buy EU citizenship in Malta, launder money in London property through shell companies and seemingly donate to European political parties at will. At the same time we have to overcome the current stalemate where EU-Russia contacts are frozen, but member states continue developing bilateral channels with Russia, often serving narrow national interests. The EU and Nato need to reopen channels of communication to reduce the risk of misunderstandings and miscalculations – as was the case during the cold war. A new strategy could be built on the logic of the Helsinki process of the 1970s. A Helsinki 2.0 would strengthen European security architecture through opening up the perspective for a political and economic engagement with Russia. In exchange for full respect of the Minsk agreements, compliance with international law and also progress when it comes to free and fair elections and respect for human rights inside Russia, the EU would not only lift economic sanctions but progressively deepen political and economic cooperation. This strategy would also make clear that our dispute is with the current Russian government, not with the Russian people. We should therefore open our universities and labour markets to the best and brightest young Russians citizens and unilaterally facilitate visas for Russian citizens. Support for independent civil society activists, the free media and NGOs in Russia should be enhanced. Most importantly, we have to swiftly build a Defence Union, as a European pillar of Nato. For decades, we have relied on the US and failed to invest in modern defences and the integration of our capacities. Many European politicians refuse to make the case to the people for a European defence and security capacity, for fear of falling foul of the Eurosceptics that Putin sponsors; we find ourselves trapped in a vicious cycle. I hope the younger generation of current European leaders, from Emmanuel Macron to Leo Varadkar, will have the courage to be bolder and make the case for an integrated European defence. Many don’t want to accept the truth because it means hard choices have to be made, but the reality is that the Kremlin is again at war with our liberal democracies. If we don’t respond with a new long-term strategy, Putin will be emboldened. • Guy Verhofstadt is chief Brexit representative for the European parliament"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"us-news/2018/mar/21/mississippi-first-woman-congress-senator-cindy-hyde-smith","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-21T18:44:33Z","webTitle":"Mississippi sends first ever woman to Congress (yes, it's 2018)","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/mar/21/mississippi-first-woman-congress-senator-cindy-hyde-smith","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/mar/21/mississippi-first-woman-congress-senator-cindy-hyde-smith","fields":{"headline":"Mississippi sends first ever woman to Congress (yes, it's 2018)","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Mississippi is sending its first ever woman to Congress – a fan of Donald Trump. Governor Phil Bryant, who on Monday signed the nation’s strictest anti-abortion law, on Wednesday appointed state agriculture official Cindy Hyde-Smith to the US Senate. Hyde-Smith will succeed fellow Republican Thad Cochran, 80, who is stepping down on 1 April because of poor health. Hyde-Smith, 58, would be the first woman to represent Mississippi in Washington and she will immediately begin campaigning for a November special election to serve the rest of Cochran’s term, which expires in January 2020. Hyde-Smith, the state’s agriculture commissioner, thanked Bryant and said: “I pledge to you to serve all of our citizens with dignity, honor and respect.” She is keen to work closely with Mississippi’s other Republican senator, Roger Wicker, she said, and to promote the president’s agenda. In 2016, she was one of many agriculture advisers to Trump’s presidential campaign and she praised his administration for cutting regulations on businesses. Bryant is also a Trump supporter and has said he believes the president will campaign for Hyde-Smith in the special election, which could attract several candidates in the conservative, deeply Republican state. Chris McDaniel, a Tea Party-backed state senator who nearly unseated Cochran in a bruising 2014 Republican primary, said last week that he is running in the special election. Democrat Mike Espy, who was President Bill Clinton’s first agriculture secretary, also intends to run. Espy in 1986 became the first African American in modern times to win a congressional seat in Mississippi, and he has publicly supported both Democrats and Republicans in various races. Cochran’s resignation creates two Senate races this year in Mississippi as Republicans are trying to maintain their slim Senate majority. Hyde-Smith grew up in the small town of Monticello in southern Mississippi. She served 12 years as a Democrat in the state senate from her rural district before switching to the Republican party in late 2010."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/mar/29/high-street-closed-betting-shops-york-back-from-dead","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-29T05:00:07Z","webTitle":"How to bring a high street back from the dead","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/mar/29/high-street-closed-betting-shops-york-back-from-dead","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/mar/29/high-street-closed-betting-shops-york-back-from-dead","fields":{"headline":"How to bring a high street back from the dead","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"It’s the stuff of nightmares. You wander down a road where most of the shops are boarded up. The bookmakers is open, but reeks of desperation, with gamblers hunched over fixed-odds machines. Next door, the payday loans place looks quiet, as does the pawnbroker. Moving on swiftly through a rising tide of discarded takeaway food containers, you reach the only entertainment in town: the tanning parlour. You start running now. Even the charity shops have closed down. The pound shop has a sale. You wake in a mucksweat, praying that this is not a vision of the future for the British high street. The figures, however, suggest these dystopian scenes are uncomfortably close to reality. According to the Centre for Retail Research, more than 11,000 major high street outlets have gone bust since 2008, affecting almost 140,000 employees. And, although the years 2008 and 2012 were the worst, the last 12 months have been traumatic, too. Agent Provocateur, Jaeger and Store Twenty One have gone under, and it’s not only clothing retailers: photo studios, ice-cream parlours, pet-grooming centres, toyshops and bike shops have all buckled. Even the sex-toy industry is feeling the pinch: the Warrington-based chain Nice ’n’ Naughty briefly went into administration in January 2018. The latest victims, not unexpectedly in business circles, have been Toys R Us and Maplin. Mothercare is restructuring its finances, Debenhams is considering closures, Claire’s has declared bankruptcy and Jones Bootmaker has closed branches and been rescued for the second time in a year. The one consolatory note of recent times has been that cafes and restaurants were doing well. No more. Earlier this year, it was reported that Jamie’s Italian and Byron Burgers are losing a third of their roster, more than 30 outlets. That news was quickly followed by the announcement that Jamie Oliver’s Barbecoa had gone into administration, as has Square Pie. Prezzo is closing 94 restaurants. The accountancy firm Moore Stephens reports more than 1,500 restaurant insolvencies in the UK in 2017, and says that almost 15,000 others are under threat. One group not going out of business appears to be the experts commissioned to report on the decline. The average British high street would sink under the weight of all the pie charts and sage advice. A typical comment goes: “Higher spending can be generated by a diverse town centre which can satisfy customers’ needs for immediate purchase of the goods they want.” In other words: if it’s in stock, people might buy it. Among all the reports on high streets, the one that stands out for its clarity and intelligence comes from the retail guru Mary Portas. In 2011 she laid out the problems – supermarket sprawl, out-of-town shopping, the internet, and poor communication between councils, traders and landlords. She concluded, in a typically forthright manner: “We have sacrificed communities for convenience.” What is certain is that the traditional high street of the last 50 years, founded on chain stores and well-known brands, is undergoing a brutal transformation. There are also, however, signs of what might emerge from this period of revolutionary change. In York’s Bishopthorpe Road – Bishy Road to the local community – I settle down in the window of a high-street cafe-restaurant-bakery. Beppe Lombardo’s Sicilian food outlet, Trinacria, is full of people having a mid-morning coffee; some are sampling the impressive range of homemade pastries and cakes, while a clutch of small children linger near the ice-cream display. “When I came to York in 2001, there was no good ice-cream,” says Lombardo, his expression hinting at the profound shock he had felt. “Not like proper Sicilian ice-cream.” He waves to a friend outside on the pavement. Lombardo waves a lot. He not only brought Sicilian ice-cream to York, he also brought a high standard of sociability and friendliness. He is involved in plans to stage a street Olympics and a dog show, and to use street art to engage with visitors. Does he worry about the economic downturn? “We are doing OK here. I don’t think we need any more cafes and restaurants, but things are OK.” Bishopthorpe Road is one of a few high streets around the country that have bucked the downward trend, managing to revive and reinvent itself during one of the harshest retailing recessions ever. That is in stark contrast to York’s premier shopping strip, Coney Street, where 20% of units lie empty. What really hurts is that some of these outlets are the most beautiful storefronts in England: when Jones Bootmaker closed nearby, it shuttered the windows on the magnificent, gabled birthplace of explorer Thomas Herbert, a man who witnessed another brutal revolution in his time, standing behind Charles I on the scaffold in 1649. Less than a mile away, a stroll down Bishopthorpe Road reveals many of the elements that are on everyone’s wishlist for a decent local high street: a handful of excellent cafes and restaurants, hardware shop, chemist, baker, two greengrocers, a brace of small supermarkets, pub, bike shop, deli and butcher. Most are independent, and many have won awards. The street was voted Britain’s best high street in 2015. “Bishy Road fully deserves the title,” said Marcus Jones, minister for high streets at the time. “We’ll be sharing Bishy’s top tips with other high streets across the country to make sure others learn from their success.” What is really fascinating about this success is that it is not a glamorous location, a street laden with tourist attractions or backed by upmarket housing; it is a socially mixed area and, at first glance, a very ordinary British shopping street. How did it pull off such a trick? I go to see Johnny Hayes, local councillor and co-owner of Frankie and Johnny’s kitchenware shop, and Andy Shrimpton from the Cycle Heaven bike shop. Both have lived and worked in the area for more than 30 years and were instrumental in turning Bishopthorpe Road around. “It was quite depressed back in the late 70s,” says Hayes. “The council had a plan to bulldoze a dual-carriageway ring road through the area – you know, the car was the undisputed king in those days. The plan was never implemented, but it created uncertainty.” By 2008 a fifth of shops were empty, several others were hanging on, and even the bargain booze shop was struggling. “When the post office closed, I really thought we were in trouble,” says Hayes. “In fact it was the start of the upswing. Two things happened. We got the Pig and Pastry cafe opening – local owners who knew everyone and worked damn hard to make a brilliant little place to eat – and then in 2010 Andy came to me with an idea.” “I was inspired by cycling trips to Copenhagen,” says Shrimpton. “There was a sense of neighbourhood and community … I thought, why can’t all cities be like this?” It was a simple plan. Gather all the shops together under one banner, or more precisely one website, and launch it with a street party. “It was a eureka moment,” says Hayes. “At 6pm we closed the road to traffic. There was hardly a soul about. We put up some bunting and set out a few stalls. By 6.20 there were 3,000 people out there. The butcher gave away burgers, there were bands, people were dancing. I could not believe it. I realised there was so much goodwill. I thought, ‘We are going to be all right.’” What Hayes was witnessing, on a grand scale, was the creation of what urban planners call “a sticky street”. The phrase was popularised by the Canadian planner Brent Toderian, who has helped redesign cities all around the world. “Our conversations about streets were always about movement for cars, or movement for people,” Toderian says. “The measurements for success from engineers were about how many cars or people we could move through a space as quickly as possible. But there was very little conversation about how people actually use, enjoy and love streets, and how lingering should actually be a measurable definition of success for a great street.” Toderian has a refreshing, real-world practicality. He cites the visionary Danish architect and designer Jan Gehl, who in the early 1960s synthesised psychology and architecture to reboot the planners’ approach to city living. Gehl railed against “bird shit” architecture and towers dropped in from the heavens by globe-trotting architects, and championed the pedestrian and the cyclist. A couple of years ago, back on Bishopthorpe Road, the cafe owners had spotted a bit of potential “stickiness” for themselves. The Victorian architects who had raised the terraced houses here back in the 1860s had given each property a forecourt garden. The houses had soon become shops and the gardens were lost to the pavement. Now the cafes claimed it back, putting in chairs and tables to create an opportunity for visitors to stick around. Something about this reminded me of old Calcutta. Amid the exuberant vitality of that city, cars and people certainly move slowly, but the space is often creative, sociable and hugely enjoyable. In comparison, I recently sailed down the Thames through London, noting the sterile apartment towers thrown up by speculative builders. At the foot of each was an empty space – clean, manicured and without any human presence. Dr Johnson needs rephrasing: when London is tired of man, London is tired of life. Of course, nostalgia for a supposed golden age of the high street could be misleading. But, I wondered, was there ever a heyday for the high street? Local York historian Sue Major is cautious about suggesting Bishopthorpe Road street life was better in Victorian times. But, she says, “It might be argued that with heavier traffic along the street in the last 50 years, people have been less likely to spend time there for leisure.” Looking through the pages of the York Herald newspaper, there are plenty of suggestions that street life was more colourful and boisterous than today. In the narrow streets behind Bishy Road you could find a brewery, a dye works, a shipbuilding yard, a steam-powered chocolate factory, a candied-peel maker, and a wooden type manufacturer. There were regular galas, parades and occasional trips over the river to witness a hanging. At Martinmas, every November, Wombwell’s menagerie would come, the wagons full of wild beasts hauled by elephants. Some of the lion collection had been born in York’s Parliament Street in 1856. The whole panoply of Dickensian street life was present, including the threat of “pocket pickers” and the possibility of destitution. One local musician, Joseph Sherwood, kept a diary that shows how, struggling to make ends meet during the 1880s, he turned his Bishopthorpe Road house into a newsagents, which is now the Pig and Pastry cafe. High streets may have been livelier back then, but they were a school of hard knocks for business. The photo record for Bishopthorpe Road shows how shops were founded, thrived and foundered in an endless bout of retail creation and destruction. The piano-dealer and beer-seller became an estate agent, then a florist; the Dainty cafe became a baker, then a hairdresser. Others have stood the test of time: the fish and chip shop, for example, is Victorian vintage. Pete Kilbane, manager of the Angel on the Green bar and restaurant, is a stalwart of the social-ownership movement, having started a community garden, cinema and nightclub, as well as the Golden Ball pub (which has over 180 local shareholders). He thinks social ownership has a part to play. “It takes away some financial pressure and means we can have events that are beneficial, but not money-making.” The bar at the Golden Ball tells its own story, selling eggs, bread and pies from local suppliers as well as real ales. Some locals have been coming to the folk music sessions for over 45 years. Kilbane knows the importance of preserving an area’s informal spaces. “We’re slow to get to know one another, aren’t we? So people need places where they have a valid reason to be. Working together on the community garden, doing the composting – that created the relationships that went on to buy the pub.” Having spent years creating venues for interaction, he is now eyeing up the newly available empty shop across the road from the Angel – a rare occurrence on Bishopthorpe Road. “I want it to be another bar,” he laughs. “Then we’ve got a scene, haven’t we?” In the past people went to the high street for shopping and work, just like today, but they also went for entertainment and leisure. That state of affairs may be returning. York’s smaller shopping streets, once shabby and depressed compared with the centre, are now in better shape than ever. With support from the council on road closures, historic streets like Micklegate and Fossgate are holding events that attract crowds. The independent movement has spawned a city map and website. The strength of smaller high streets has not gone unnoticed. Figures from business research analysts LDC show that the number of independent outlets has risen all over England in every region during the past year, while chain stores have declined. When Portas wrote her report in 2011 she highlighted the lamentable case of Ely, a Cambridgeshire town that seemed to be deliberately strangling its own high street, building out-of-town shopping with a free bus service. But since then independent shops have moved in, accounting for 89% of retail growth, and making Ely high street a success story akin to York’s Bishopthorpe Road. Gehl’s influence is apparent in healthy cities all around the world. After his redesign of Melbourne, the number of street cafes rose 12-fold. “A good city,” he says, “is like a good party – people stay longer than really necessary.” On a smaller scale, applying that motto to British high streets appears to be bearing fruit. Portas came to similar conclusions. “We need,” she declared, “to put the heart back into the centre of our high streets, reimagined as destinations for socialising, culture, health, wellbeing, creativity and learning.” This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems.

That's one nostalgic indulgence to cheer","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"If your 90s memories revolve around TGIF programming and sneak-watching episodes of 90210 because your parents told you it was too “adult,” much of your youth was also likely defined by the characters of Melissa Joan Hart. Whether as Clarissa Darling (the precocious, inquisitive, star of Clarissa Explains It All) or Sabrina Spellman (the witch who lived with her aunts on Sabrina the Teenage Witch), Hart staked a claim on our PG-rated cultural landscape. Her characters were smart, they were quirky, and they tried their best. And now they’re staging a comeback. Following news that Netflix greenlit a ‘dark’ Sabrina reboot starring Mad Men’s Kiernan Shipka last year, Nickelodeon has recently announced plans to breathe new life into Clarissa, going so far as to re-cast Melissa Joan Hart as Clarissa herself, now grown-up and the mother of her own family. And it has potential: breathing new life into old franchises has helped build the foundations of many powerful film and television empires. Plus, a character like Clarissa embodies many of the traits we truly celebrate in strong leads: she’s confident, flies her public radio flag proudly (shout-out to that WFMU sticker), and breaks the fourth wall with abandon. She’s no-bullshit and unabashedly herself. Which aren’t horrible traits to resurrect, particularly in terms of tween and teen-centric programming. Both Clarissa and Sabrina hinged on its main character walking to the beat of her own drum and showing everyone who watched that following one’s own compass was fine and great. Frankly, seeing more of the same would be refreshing -- especially now, since the current cultural, political, and social climate has finally come to prioritize and celebrate uniqueness and originality. On paper, Clarissa explaining things in 2018 is both the hero we need and deserve. On paper. Thanks to Clarissa – and later Sabrina – Hart became synonymous with the young women she played. She seemed accessible, friendly, and helped make “gotta go” a Sabrina catchphrase. So for those of us who grew up watching her, Hart was so tied to her TV shows that to separate them was impossible. But separating is crucial to the success of both. After all, Hart is also an actor whose political leanings have come under scrutiny (in addition to a recent film choice that aligned with them) and whose reaction to Hurricane Maria was less than ideal. She isn’t Clarissa or Sabrina, she is a person we grew up linking to traits that made our favourite characters so beloved. Outside of those roles, she is a stranger; an adult who marches for gun control and supported Mitt Romney in the 2012 presidential election. We have no idea who her characters would grow up to support politically, but if Roseanne is anything to go by her leanings could make it on to the small screen. So while it may seem like we’re ushering in the era of a Melissa Joan Hart comeback, we’re not. Instead, we’re resurrecting the characters she helped bring to life and who will now morph into their own (fictional) beings that reflect this decade -- not the 1990s. And their staying power is a testament to how we still need characters who are quirky and weird and willing to sit their audiences down to explain the minutiae of being alive. And that’s the thing about being the face of something: eventually, you aren’t anymore. That’s a good thing. Because while that face may be attached to a franchise, the best reboots launch characters who go on to eclipse it."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/mar/22/mohammed-bin-salmans-talk-reform-smokescreen","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-22T12:35:52Z","webTitle":"Mohammed bin Salman's talk of reform is a smokescreen | Moustafa Bayoumi","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/22/mohammed-bin-salmans-talk-reform-smokescreen","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/22/mohammed-bin-salmans-talk-reform-smokescreen","fields":{"headline":"Mohammed bin Salman's talk of reform is a smokescreen","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The crown prince of Saudi Arabia, Mohammed bin Salman, has arrived in Washington. Jared Kushner must be very excited! Prince Mohammed and Kushner are said to be very close, though plotting the future of the Middle East during late-night gab sessions – behavior the two thirtysomethings have been reported to engage in – must be much harder now that Jared has been stripped of his top-secret security clearance. But the excitement over the Saudi’s visit isn’t limited to Jared. Beginning with a splashy interview on CBS’s 60 Minutes, the crown prince is in the United States to sell the American people on the idea that a new, liberalizing Saudi Arabia is dawning. But is it true? There is some justification for optimism. Key reforms have been promulgated, including a royal decree stating that women will be allowed to drive, beginning in June. Uber and Careem, a Dubai-based ride-booking app, have already begun recruiting female drivers. Women can now also join the military, start a business without first obtaining the permission of a male guardian, attend sporting events and retain custody rights over children after divorce more readily. With the new General Entertainment Authority, the crown prince is also dramatically expanding the Saudi entertainment sector. There are now dance performances, comic book festivals, and monster truck festivals in the kingdom. Greek composer and pianist Yanni performed a series of concerts across the country late last year, and a 35-year ban on cinemas has ended. The government expects 300 movie theaters with 2,000 screens to open by 2030. Already, a public screening of The Emoji Movie has taken place in Jeddah. (I feel bad for Jeddah.) With driving and entertainment on his mind, it should come as no surprise that Prince Mohammed is slated to meet with both Hollywood producers and Uber executives during his time in the United States. And that’s the problem. While Prince Mohammed’s limited reforms are fundamentally about liberalizing the social and economic realms of Saudi Arabia, the political realm remains completely off-limits. What this means is that the reforms on women’s rights, though significant and certainly long overdue, are incomplete. The guardianship rules – whereby a woman requires a male guardian’s approval to travel abroad, obtain a passport, or get married – are still in place, and they remain the most significant impediment to the advancement of women in the kingdom. This half-measure on women’s rights allows Prince Mohammed to essentially co-opt the courageous movement built by female Saudi activists for women’s rights in the kingdom. This is unsurprising, really. Saudi Arabia remains an absolute monarchy, and political expression is severely curtailed. Since mid-September of last year, more than 60 prominent activists, clerics, journalists and intellectuals have been detained in what a United Nations panel called a “worrying pattern of widespread and systematic arbitrary arrests and detention”. The government continues to discriminate against its Shia minority. The criminal justice system still fails to provide due process, especially for its foreign migrant workers. And then there’s the public purge against corruption, when 11 Saudi princes were held last year at the Riyadh Ritz-Carlton on charges of stealing from the public coffers. No one can doubt the need of rooting out graft, but serious questions linger not only about how the detainees were treated but also if the whole affair was more about consolidating the power of Prince Mohammed than anything else. How Saudi Arabia runs its own affairs is one thing. How it intervenes in the lives of others is another. And since the de facto ruler also holds the portfolio of minister of defense, Prince Mohammed can be held directly accountable for Saudi Arabia’s foreign policy, which is disastrous. From Palestine to Qatar and beyond, the grand Saudi plan for the Middle East is failing. Nowhere is this more devastating than in Yemen. A UN official has described the situation in Yemen as looking “like the apocalypse”. The three-year war between Houthi rebels and forces loyal to the exiled president has killed more than 10,000 civilians, including 68 killed in two air raids carried out by Saudi-led forces in one day last December. The Saudi-led coalition has at times blockaded the ports of the country, depriving its people of humanitarian aid. More than a million people are suffering from cholera, provably the worst outbreak of the disease the world has ever known. Around 8.4 million people, about a third of Yemen’s population, are starving. Prince Mohammed has come to the United States not to seek political solutions to this crisis but to buy more weapons to prosecute his war. And the Trump administration is fully behind his decision. How can we expect Trump to care about poor Yemen, anyway? Rather than compassion over Yemen, the administration doles out fear. Yemen, of course, is one of the countries currently on the Muslim travel ban list. Saudi Arabia often comes up for criticism, and frankly some of it is grossly Islamophobic, demonizing the country as a way of vilifying all Muslims. As with any other nation, Saudi Arabia should be judged on what it does, not on what it may symbolize to the critic. And what Prince Mohammed is now doing in Saudi Arabia, besides following a disastrous foreign policy, is consolidating his power while hoping the spectacle of entertainment will keep his people from demanding deeply needed political change. In too many ways, Prince Mohammed sounds suspiciously like Jared Kushner’s father-in-law. No wonder Kushner and Prince Mohammed are friends."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2018/mar/22/thursday-best-tv-contagion-martin-luther-king-civilisations","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-22T06:00:18Z","webTitle":"Thursday’s best TV: Contagion!; Martin Luther King by Trevor McDonald","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/mar/22/thursday-best-tv-contagion-martin-luther-king-civilisations","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2018/mar/22/thursday-best-tv-contagion-martin-luther-king-civilisations","fields":{"headline":"Thursday’s best TV: Contagion!; Martin Luther King by Trevor McDonald","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Contagion!

The 38-year-old, whose real name is Ronaldo Assis Moreira, officially joined the Brazilian Republican party on Tuesday afternoon. Known as the PRB, the party was set up with help from the Universal Church of the Kingdom of God – an influential evangelical church with operations worldwide – and defends family values. “Many political parties are seeking out famous persons who are famous in other areas, like football, to become candidates,” said David Fleischer, emeritus professor of political science at the University of Brasília. “The PRB is an evangelical party.” Wanderley Tavares, the PRB’s president for the Federal District of Brasília, said he talked Ronaldinho into joining after an introduction from a mutual friend. “He said to me, ‘I have already realised many dreams in my football career here in Brazil and abroad,” Tavares said, explaining that this was his way to repay the affection of the Brazilian people. The star remained silent during a 90-minute affiliation ceremony on Tuesday in Brasília, according to local media reports. Tavares said the Universal Church of God helped gather signatures when the party was being founded over a decade ago but is no longer directly linked. The party’s most famous politician is Marcelo Crivella, the mayor of Rio de Janeiro, and the nephew of the Universal Church’s controversial founder, Bishop Edir Macedo – who has faced down a number of scandals and was briefly jailed in 1992. In 2011, São Paulo federal prosecutors charged Macedo and three other church bosses with money laundering, illegally sending money abroad, racketeering, embezzlement and misrepresentation. Macedo is yet to be tried for the charge of money laundering, the other charges have since expired or rejected in court, a spokesman for the prosecutors said. Crivella, also a bishop, has been loudly criticised for slashing funding for Rio carnival, with samba schools and revellers using costumes and chants to attack and ridicule him during this year’s festivities, which he did not attend. In contrast, Ronaldinho so much enjoyed Rio carnival that in 2011, while playing for the Rio club Flamengo, he created his own samba street party. His Rio mansion featured a full-sized bar and stage. “His life is a party,” said Juca Kfouri, a celebrated football commentator. “I have never heard an idea from him for the [benefit of the] country.” Tavares discounted local media reports that Ronaldinho would stand as senator or federal deputy for the party in October’s elections, saying his sponsorship and World Cup commitments would not allow it. “But nothing is impossible,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"higher-education-network/2018/mar/22/higher-educations-most-inspiring-leader-2018-the-shortlist","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-22T14:13:08Z","webTitle":"Higher education’s most inspiring leader 2018 - the shortlist","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/2018/mar/22/higher-educations-most-inspiring-leader-2018-the-shortlist","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/higher-education-network/2018/mar/22/higher-educations-most-inspiring-leader-2018-the-shortlist","fields":{"headline":"Higher education’s most inspiring leader 2018 - the shortlist","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The Guardian Higher Education Network is delighted to reveal the shortlist for the Inspiring Leader 2018 award. This award recognises a leader who has brought out the best in the people they work with to achieve exceptional results. They champion innovation and collaboration, deliver real change for their institution and the sector, and inspire the higher education community. The five names below were selected by our expert judging panel and shortlisted by the Guardian, but the winner will be chosen by you, the readers. Voting is now closed. Anne-Marie Canning, director of social mobility and student success, King’s College London Anne-Marie Canning is the director of social mobility and student success at King’s College London. After spending many years widening participation she now also has responsibility for student success initiatives and research into what works in social mobility. Anne-Marie is the independent chair of the Bradford opportunity area, a Department for Education initiative to help the 12 areas of the country that are most challenged in terms of social mobility. She has also served as a member of the Universities UK ministerial social mobility advisory group. What the judges said: Many universities talk about widening participation but King’s stands out as an institution that has really worked to achieve it, with Anne-Marie at the forefront. She has a gift for a colourful quote and a good tweet, which also helps keep widening participation high up the higher education agenda. Professor Alec Cameron, vice-chancellor and CEO, Aston University Alec has been vice-chancellor and chief executive of Aston University since 2016. Prior to this he was deputy vice-chancellor (education) at the University of Western Australia (2013-16) and dean of the Australian School of Business (2006-13), overseeing its emergence from the integration of academic units at the University of New South Wales. Alec has also held the position of deputy vice-chancellor (resources and infrastructure) at UNSW, and several senior corporate positions in the IT and telecommunications industry. What the judges said: Although a newcomer to Birmingham, Alec has embraced the city, its goals and ambitions. He is recognised as an influential leader within the West Midlands. Alec is redefining the university’s strategy to have maximum impact, marking a significant change of perspective. He takes equality seriously – particularly gender equality – and has been striving to have a more even gender split in the university leadership teams. Professor Craig Mahoney, vice-chancellor, University of the West of Scotland Craig is an internationally recognised psychologist and academic. He has been principal and vice-chancellor at the University of the West of Scotland (UWS) since 2013. Previous roles include CEO at the Higher Education Academy (2010-2013) and deputy vice-chancellor at Northumbria University (2007-2010). Craig currently serves on the boards of Sportscotland, the Leadership Foundation for Higher Education, the Quality Assurance Agency, Glasgow City of Science, and is a trustee on the Carnegie Trust for Universities of Scotland. What the judges said: In the past few years, Craig has done a great job in advancing UWS. Previously languishing, it has really begun to rise up the rankings. He has demonstrated an unstinting commitment to the role and has been a passionate advocate for the university as well as for the economically challenged town of Paisley. Professor Mary Stuart, vice-chancellor, University of Lincoln Mary Stuart grew up in apartheid South Africa and emigrated to the UK for political reasons. Like many migrants she initially had some challenges. Having become pregnant with twins, Mary and her partner were evicted from their rented flat, meaning her twins started life in a hostel for homeless families. Determined to make some sort of success of their lives, Mary studied for a degree with the Open University and after a career as a social scientist she went on to become vice-chancellor at the University of Lincoln. While at Lincoln she has emphasised staff and students coming together to make the university a single community. What the judges said: Mary has managed to turn around the university and has never lost sight of what the university is about, its mission and widening participation. A post-92 institution that gets a gold in the Tef should gain recognition – especially its leader. Professor Debra Humphris, vice-chancellor, Brighton University Debra took up post as vice-chancellor at the University of Brighton in December 2015. In 2017 she was elected to chair the Universities UK student policy network and was subsequently returned in March 2018 to serve a further three years. In addition, she chairs the UCEA clinical academic staff advisory group (CASAG), is a member of the Coast to Capital LEP Board and is treasurer to the University Alliance. Debra joined the University of Brighton from Imperial College in London, where she held the position of vice-provost (education) between 2012 and 2015. As an openly LGBT senior leader in higher education, Debra is passionate about equality and diversity. What the judges said: Debra is an inspiring and inspirational leader whose focus on issues of equity, diversity and social justice underpin her approach to leading and managing. Voting is now closed.

The year is 1985, race riots are on the news, and, in this small corner of Hackney, the penny has yet to drop among some white residents that Africa is not a country. A labour of love for its creator and star, Idris Elba, In the Long Run tells the tale of an immigrant family making its way in Britain and is based on Elba’s own childhood. While viewers might be surprised to find the words “sitcom” and “the former Stringer Bell” in such close proximity, more remarkable is that it features a majority black cast. Not since Desmond’s and The Crouches have we seen so many black characters at the centre of a British comedy rather than residing ignominiously on the fringes as best friends and neighbours. That, in 2018, this is deemed unusual should see all senior TV commissioners forced to wear hair shirts as a public act of penance – I’m thinking a week for every series commissioned with all-white leading characters. Elba plays factory worker Walter, who we first find reading a letter from back home in Sierra Leone. Walter’s mother is concerned about his younger brother. “[Valentine] has become unruly,” she complains. “I am too old to be chasing him around with my shoe.” And so he is dispatched to live in London with Walter, his wife Agnes and their son Kobna. A professional footballer turned DJ, Valentine isn’t keen on hard work – “People work nine to five here,” says Walter. “That’s a very long time,” replies Valentine in alarm. Instead, he likes to party hard. As well as igniting a carnival atmosphere in local pubs, he sends delighted ripples through the uteruses of all women within a three-mile radius. No wonder Walter’s friend Bagpipes (Bill Bailey), already punching above his weight with his young wife Kirsty, is looking worried. In the Long Run is stylishly shot; bathed in oranges and ochres, it basks in the fabrics and furnishings of the era. The show also manages to make high art out of estate living, dwelling on the light reflected in the puddles on the walkways and on the tower blocks that glow with activity at night. Even the pub looks like an excellent place to be, with its swirly carpet, flock wallpaper and the abandoned sofa by the front door where kids wait for their parents to stagger out at closing time. Matters of racial politics are deliberately kept on the down-low here, though the ingrained prejudice on the estate is clear. When an elderly neighbour complains to Agnes about the proliferation of “coloureds” in the community, she hastily adds, “No offence, love. I know you’re not like that.” In the Long Run is less likely to prompt belly laughs than instil a warm glow, and has the unmistakable feel of a comedy still finding its feet. At its heart, however, it’s a joyful portrait of community and camaraderie, of home and belonging, of dreams and joie de vivre. “I’m going to make my mark here,” Valentine tells his nephew. He’s already on his way.

Why would liberals defend it?","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The Home Office doesn’t often get it right – but by declining to indulge the muddled preciousness that surrounds the freedom of speech debate, it has done so. In the space of a fortnight, four extreme-right figures have been turned away at the UK border. The latest was the founder of the German far-right group Pegida. On Monday Lutz Bachmann was denied entry to the UK, and deported. He had been due to give a speech at Speakers’ Corner in London’s Hyde Park in London, but his presence was deemed “not conducive to the public good”. Bachmann was to have addressed a “free speech” rally. It’s not clear how this was different to any other rally, other than by framing any opposition to it as censorship. Characters such as Bachmann are no innocents practising their freedom of speech: they are cynical exploiters of it. They’re little better than loiterers waiting round the corner to jump on your windshield, pretending to be hurt, shaking you down for money. It’s a scam, trading notoriety and worse for attention. Why do we fall for it? Most freedom of speech debates now start on the false premise that denying someone a platform is censorship. So we must begin with the correct one, which is that freedom of speech is freedom from punishment. If you are not being convicted and penalised by the state for speaking, then you have freedom of speech. If just one channel of speech has been denied to you, you still have freedom of speech. We’re not talking pulping Lady Chatterley’s Lover here. The disappeared of Egypt, the jailed and flogged blasphemers of Saudi Arabia, the arbitrarily detained bloggers and journalists of China are being denied freedom of speech. It’s an insult to their ordeals that we equate them with shutting down Milo Yiannopoulos’s Twitter account. Over the past month, while travelling in north Africa, I was unable to access a host of mainstream news sites that had been blocked by national governments. That is censorship. This is not that complicated. But it’s the “thin end of the wedge”, we’re told. If we start banning those whose views we don’t like, what next? In general, one should be suspicious of “what next?” arguments, because they assume that humans are incapable of behaving in calibrated ways that don’t inevitably lead to some future state of fascism. We could extend the right to platform and rally to all, but what next? Paedophile rallies? That’s obviously absurd, but it highlights the fact that there are limits, and they are broadly dictated by how much certain values are coded within society. The reason free speech proponents are not out there fighting to hear from child abusers or some radical Muslim clerics is because society or the law regulate the more unpalatable or illegal views away before we have to deal with them at Speakers’ Corner. In On Liberty, John Stuart Mill, one of the great defenders of free speech, says a struggle always occurs between the competing demands of authority and liberty. He argues that we cannot have the latter without the former: “All that makes existence valuable to anyone depends on the enforcement of restraints upon the actions of other people. Some rules of conduct, therefore, must be imposed – by law in the first place, and by opinion on many things which are not fit subjects for the operation of law.” But we’re far from that. Freedom of speech is no longer a value. It has become a loophole exploited with impunity by trolls, racists and ethnic cleansing advocates. They are aided by the group I call useful liberals – the “defend to the death your right to say it” folk. The writer Mari Uyehara calls them the “free speech grifters”, those “who flog PC culture as a singularly eminent threat to the freedom of expression”. To them, the “what next?” argument foresees apocalyptic harm that might befall liberal values. It cares much less about speech we can link to violence, or that which compromises the safety of others. Last Sunday Tommy Robinson, the former leader of the English Defence League whose social media posts were cited repeatedly in the trial of the Finsbury Park terrorist Darren Osborne, gave the speech at Speakers’ Corner that would have been delivered by one of those denied entry – the Austrian Martin Sellner, a leader of the white supremacist group Generation Identity. Useful liberals have swallowed two freedom of speech myths whole: the redefinition of the term to encompass not only freedom from persecution but the right to a platform; and the delusion that freedom of speech is a neutral principle uncontaminated by history or social bias. There are hard choices here. Too often, those who should know better argue for the wrong ones. They fight to their deaths to defend the rights of Bachmann, Sellner and the other peddlers of hate – but not mine. • Nesrine Malik is a Guardian columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"society/2018/mar/22/social-mobility-commission-needs-beefing-up-say-mps","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-22T00:01:10Z","webTitle":"Social Mobility Commission needs beefing up, say MPs","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/mar/22/social-mobility-commission-needs-beefing-up-say-mps","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/mar/22/social-mobility-commission-needs-beefing-up-say-mps","fields":{"headline":"Social Mobility Commission needs beefing up, say MPs","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The government body which promotes social mobility should be given “teeth”, in the shape of additional resources and increased powers, to help drive forward the fight against social injustice, MPs have said. The Commons education committee warned that without greater powers the Social Mobility Commission (SMC) could “do little to tackle social injustices and give the most vulnerable in society the chance they deserve to climb the ladder of opportunity”. To beef up the SMC, the committee called on the government to appoint a Cabinet Office minister with specific responsibility for social mobility who would be able to “hold ministers’ feet to the fire” on the issue. It also suggested renaming it the Social Justice Commission. In its report looking into the future of the SMC published on Thursday, the committee also suggested that a new delivery body should be set up alongside the commission to drive forward and implement proposed changes. The work of the SMC reached a standstill last December after all four board members, led by the chair, former Labour minister Alan Milburn, resigned in protest at the government’s lack of progress on social justice. During an appearance before the committee, Milburn said although the government proclaimed its commitment to social mobility, in reality ministers seemed incapable of delivering meaningful change in the face of the demands of Brexit. Following on from his evidence, the committee also expressed concern at the “farcical” appointments process at the SMC which saw the number of commissioners drop from 10 to four over time, and recommended a minimum of seven. The committee has drawn up a draft bill detailing all its proposed changes. The committee chair, Tory MP Robert Halfon, said: “It’s crucial that a new body is created inside government with the levers and powers to co-ordinate and drive forward initiatives across Whitehall and ensure social justice is delivered across the country. “We need a commission which has the teeth to undertake objective assessments of the implications for social justice of government policies and is properly equipped to hold ministers’ feet to the fire on social mobility.” He added: “The prime minister sent a strong message when she spoke on the steps of No 10 about the importance of fighting against the burning injustice in our society, setting out a commitment to ensure our country works for all, not just the privileged few. “But if we are to tackle the social crisis in our country, we must devote far greater energy and focus to the social justice agenda.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/mar/21/chemical-weapons-inspectors-begin-work-at-scene-of-salisbury-attack","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-21T16:15:49Z","webTitle":"Chemical weapons inspectors begin work at scene of Salisbury attack","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/mar/21/chemical-weapons-inspectors-begin-work-at-scene-of-salisbury-attack","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/mar/21/chemical-weapons-inspectors-begin-work-at-scene-of-salisbury-attack","fields":{"headline":"Chemical weapons inspectors begin work at scene of Salisbury attack","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Inspectors from the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) have begun working at the scene of the nerve agent attack on the Skripals. A team started work on Wednesday at the Mill pub in Salisbury, which the former Russian spy, Sergei Skripal, visited with his daughter, Yulia, before they collapsed on 4 March. The inspectors arrived in unmarked vehicles and street clothes before disappearing behind metal police barriers at the back of the pub. Ambulance incident support vehicles arrived and stood by. Theresa May has asked OPCW to investigate the use of the nerve agent novichok in the attempted murder of the Skripals. The OPCW chief, Ahmet Üzümcü, said it would take two to three weeks to complete laboratory analysis of samples. He said they would be sent to the organisation’s main laboratory in The Hague and then to designated labs for analysis. Elsewhere, concerns that the city’s trade is being badly hit by the attack on the Skripals has prompted Wiltshire council to make its car parks free from Saturday. Baroness Scott, the leader of the council, said: “We know people are rightly concerned about Salisbury, and it is important we encourage residents and visitors to enjoy our beautiful and historic city and to promote that it is very much business as usual. “We are working diligently with local and national agencies and the local MP, John Glen, to support the local community and businesses. We recognise that providing free car parking will help to increase the number of visitors and shopper footfall in the city centre. We will be doing everything we can to assist and support Salisbury through this extraordinary situation.” Visitor numbers at Salisbury cathedral are down this month by more than a third compared with last year Jane Morgan, director of communications and development said: “These are provisional figures and cover the periods of disruption due to snow and ice, as well as the recent incident. “The downturn hasn’t taken us by surprise. Similar falls have been seen by colleagues at cathedrals in London when there have been major incidents there. “The message that we do need to get out there is that whilst a small part of the city has been affected, the city centre and the cathedral, which is at some distance from the sites under investigation, are both functioning normally.” The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said it was monitoring wildlife in Salisbury following concern that a swan had died on the river Avon. A spokesperson said: “Wildlife in the area has been closely monitored and there have been no unusual reported deaths. No wildlife has been removed from the area. While a dead swan was found some distance from Salisbury, we can confirm this was not connected to the incident. We are clear the risk to the public remains low.” Public Health England has also reassured the people of Salisbury that the nerve agent is unlikely to have been carried around the area by rats. NHS England said the Skripals remained in critical but stable condition in intensive care. The police officer who was injured, Det Sgt Nick Bailey, is conscious and in a stable condition – but is no longer critical. Wiltshire police refused to comment on a suggestion that Bailey is expected to leave hospital soon."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"culture/2018/mar/21/trevor-noah-trump-gollum-late-night-tv","type":"article","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-21T15:12:42Z","webTitle":"Trevor Noah on Trump's dialogue with himself: 'It's like America elected Gollum'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2018/mar/21/trevor-noah-trump-gollum-late-night-tv","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/2018/mar/21/trevor-noah-trump-gollum-late-night-tv","fields":{"headline":"Trevor Noah on Trump's dialogue with himself: 'It's like America elected Gollum'","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Late-night hosts on Tuesday discussed Facebook’s data breach, continued personnel shakeups at the White House, and the Trump administration’s approach to the opioid epidemic. Trevor Noah: ‘Teenagers think Donald Trump is totes lame’ Trevor Noah discussed Trump’s plans to combat drug trafficking and the opioid crisis. He began with footage of the president doubling down on his proposal to execute drug dealers; in the clip, Trump says he can understand if “our country is not ready for that,” but then says he “personally can’t understand it”. “One of my favorite things about Trump is that he inner-monologues out loud,” Noah joked. “It’s like America elected Gollum.” Noah continued: “Today’s epidemic is complicated in many ways. Let’s say you kill all the drug dealers. In this opioid crisis, that’s hardly the only kind of person involved. Do you also kill doctors who overprescribe painkillers? Do you kill family members who buy opioids for their addicted loved ones? Do you kill the people who sell drugs to pay for their own addiction?” “I’m not saying all of Trump’s plans are bad, but some of these drug-fighting ideas seem to come straight out of the 80s,” Noah added, referencing Trump’s idea of airing commercials that will “scare” kids away from using drugs. “Again, I see why Trump thinks that this idea makes sense,” Noah said. “If the president of the United States believes everything he sees on TV, then why wouldn’t teenagers?” The host explained, though, that America has spent money on ad campaigns of this sort before. “They weren’t just corny,” he noted. “Studies have shown that those commercials didn’t actually work.” Noah referenced one from the National Institutes of Health that showed kids were no less likely to use drugs after seeing the commercials. “I believe that the president sincerely wants to keep young people away from drugs. You see, typical anti-drug PSAs don’t work on the kids. What Trump needs is a way to make drugs seem really uncool to young people,” Noah suggested. “And for once, I think he’s the right man for the job. Because according to polls, two-thirds of American teenagers think Donald Trump is totes lame. So to keep them off drugs all the president needs to do is pretend that he takes drugs, which shouldn’t be that hard.” Stephen Colbert: ‘Wear hat, yell at wall’ “Does anybody here use Facebook?” began Stephen Colbert. “Because the company is reeling from revelations that they allowed the private information of 50 million Americans to be harvested by the Trump campaign’s consulting firm Cambridge Analytica.” Colbert then explained that Cambridge Analytica, partly owned by Trump donor Robert Mercer, acquired its data from personality quizzes that claimed to be for research purposes and harvested psychological data from Facebook users and those users’ friends. “People are blaming Facebook for this because they handed over all your data willingly; after this revelation, Facebook’s stock value dropped by $36bn,” Colbert explained. “It seems like now would be a very good time for some damage control from Facebook CEO and guy-who-wants-you-to-play-a-complicated-board-game-he-invented Mark Zuckerberg.” Colbert then showed investigative footage acquired by the UK’s Channel 4. In it, Cambridge Analytica CEO Alexander Nix can be seen detailing his firm’s involvement in the Trump campaign, which he says included handling all research, data, analytics, targeting, and digital and television advertisements. In the footage, Nix says the candidate is “always” the puppet. “Wow, so it was their meticulous data and analytics that informed Trump’s strategy of Wear Hat, Yell about Wall,” the host joked. He then showed more of the undercover video, including a section in which a Cambridge Analytica staffer explains the origins of the nickname “Crooked Hillary”. “Wait, they made up Crooked Hillary?” Colbert responded. “Coming up with demeaning nicknames was the one skill we knew Trump had!” Jimmy Kimmel on the ‘secretary of interior decorating’ Jimmy Kimmel addressed the revolving door of employees in the Trump administration. “As all this sex stuff is going on,” he began, “here’s what’s up with our secretary of interior decorating, Dr Ben Carson.” Kimmel showed Carson addressing the reports, including several from the Guardian, that he has spent lavish amounts of taxpayer money to furnish his office at the Department of Housing and Urban Development. “I love that with all this madness going on, Ben Carson is being grilled about a dinette set,” Kimmel joked, referencing the Carson’s $31,000 payment. “Ben Carson, by the way, is one of the few remaining members of Trump’s original cabinet.” “Last week, he fired his body-man, his personal assistant, and his secretary of state Rex Tillerson,” the host explained. “Rex Tillerson had a two-hour meeting with his replacement yesterday, Mike Pompeo, who currently runs the CIA.” “If you’re Mike Pompeo, do you even do anything to your new office?” Kimmel quipped. “You put up pictures or just live out of a banker’s box and gather your stuff when it’s time to go?”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"artanddesign/2018/mar/21/anthea-hamilton-review-the-squash-duveen-commission-tate-britain","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-21T16:24:18Z","webTitle":"Anthea Hamilton review – gourds move in mysterious ways at Tate Britain","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/mar/21/anthea-hamilton-review-the-squash-duveen-commission-tate-britain","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2018/mar/21/anthea-hamilton-review-the-squash-duveen-commission-tate-britain","fields":{"headline":"Anthea Hamilton review – gourds move in mysterious ways at Tate Britain","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Nicely grouted white tiles cover the floor, giving the Duveen sculpture galleries at Tate Britain a blank, hygienic air. It’s wipeable. Sharing both the clean look of minimalism (Sol Lewitt comes to mind) and vaguely medical spa-centre swank, Anthea Hamilton’s The Squash, her 2018 Duveen commission, has an air of unreality. Gridded by the square tiles, the space has the appearance of a computer-generated model. The same tiles provide the module for various pieces of plinth-cum-furniture that rise from the floor, creating sofas, chairs, posing platforms, a shallow double bathtub and, at the far end of the gallery, a sort of plunge-pool. Except there is no pool. If Topps Tiles clad a Lego version of the Pergamon Altar, it would look like this. In one of the pair of shallow, empty bathtubs, Henry Laurens’ 1948 bronze female figure Autumn reclines, as though waiting for a sluice-down and a full colonic at the hydrotherapy wellness clinic. The sculpture doesn’t look too happy about it. Perhaps it drowned. A Henry Moore sits on a plinth with legs. Under glass, Bernard Meadows’ 1953 Crab has nowhere to scuttle. Its legs look like high-heeled shoes. Rounded things with pointy extrusions – FE McWilliam’s daft, Jean Arp-ish Eye, Nose and Cheek; Jean-Robert Ipoustéguy’s Earth, a sort of dumb earth mother – lurk by one of the gallery’s columns. Nearby, Frederic Leighton’s The Sluggard (1885) has a yawn and a stretch. Dumb and dumber, most of these sculptures look like they were made by men who wore chunky-knit jumpers and wished they were in Paris. Arnold Machin’s terracotta Spring faces away from us, looking into what appears to be a huge tiled fireplace. The rear of the sculpture (which was never intended to be seen in the round) is, in any case, much more interesting to look at than the young woman and cherubs he sculpted on the front. Atop the fireplace stands François Stahly’s Growth, a nasty slithery thing from 1963 I wouldn’t put on my mantelpiece. Or perhaps I might. Hamilton treats all these sculptures with a mixture of pleasure and derision. They serve as mute actors, or witnesses, to the live performers who, one or perhaps two at a time, will occupy the space over the next six months, lounging and posing, moving about artistically and looking as decorous and meaningful as anyone can look while wearing a pumpkin on their head. Hamilton’s gourd-headed commedia dell’arte dancers are the main event. One of the pair I saw this morning wore a sort of black-and-white striped butternut-squash-meets-badger head, striped trousers and a padded black leather bolero that would be perfectly acceptable to the stringent dress codes in force at Torture Garden. Ruffles, sequins, silks, codpieces, trails of seaweedy green fabric, outfits reminiscent of biker gear with bulbous helmets, the outfits are wonderfully perverse and androgynous. Hamilton cites Antonin Artaud as an influence, but this is all less a theatre of cruelty than of the absurd. The big heads are carnivalesque rather than sinister, though one can imagine them in some Hieronymus Bosch themed fashion show. Hamilton designed the outfits with Jonathan Anderson, creative director at fashion house Loewe. The work’s inspiration, we are told, was a found photograph that Hamilton has now lost. This adds a tantalising, if spurious, level of mystery to the whole conceit. And conceit the whole thing is. Hamilton is all for interpretation, as much for ourselves as for her troupe of performers. The live participants are no more or less peculiar than their sculpted counterparts. They are certainly more colourful, and their actions, at least today, had a delicacy and occasional poignancy the sculptures entirely lacked, with their varying degrees of realism and deformation, their lumpen pomposities and their approximations of movement and grace. The setting certainly made me approach the sculptures differently. They looked out of place and out of time. A few yards from the Duveen sculpture court, Hamilton showed a huge pair of buttocks, modelled after a never-constructed door for a New York apartment block, designed by Gaetano Pesce, in the 2016 Turner prize show. The Squash is no less arresting, funny and infuriating in its refusal to explain. There is a lesson here about the living and the sculpted, expression and presentation – I just wish I knew what it was. If only she hadn’t lost that photograph."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"sport/2018/mar/21/scotland-west-indies-cricket-world-cup-rain-lbw-dls","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-21T15:16:03Z","webTitle":"Rain, a controversial lbw and DLS: Scotland miss out on Cricket World Cup","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/mar/21/scotland-west-indies-cricket-world-cup-rain-lbw-dls","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/mar/21/scotland-west-indies-cricket-world-cup-rain-lbw-dls","fields":{"headline":"Rain, a controversial lbw and DLS: Scotland miss out on Cricket World Cup","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Scotland suffered a heartbreaking end to their hopes of playing in the 2019 Cricket World Cup as rain in Harare ruined a promising run chase and ensured qualification for West Indies instead. Kyle Coetzer’s side were chasing 199 for victory in their final group game and a guaranteed place in the 50-over showpiece next year following a fine bowling performance, reaching 125 for five from 35.2 overs when the deluge struck. With play not resuming before the 5pm cut-off time and no reserve day scheduled, it meant a five-run victory for West Indies via the Duckworth-Lewis-Stern calculation that booked a World Cup berth for the two-times winners. It left Scotland with a profound sense of what if. This primarily surrounded the lack of a decision review system in this ICC qualifying tournament. Had Richie Berrington not been wrongly adjudged lbw on 33 to the spinner Ashley Nurse in the 32nd over – and Scotland been just four down for the same total come the rain – victory and qualification would have been theirs. Scotland, who had earlier bowled out Jason Holder’s side for 198 thanks to three wickets apiece from Safyaan Sharif and Brad Wheal, will now finish outside the top two, with the second‑placed Zimbabwe needing victory against the United Arab Emirates on Thursday to go also through. A defeat for the home side would open it up for the winner of Afghanistan versus Ireland on Friday. The England and Wales Cricket Board, meanwhile, has introduced concussion substitutes for its domestic tournaments from this year onwards as part of a new set of playing regulations that also include measures to tackle on-field breaches of discipline. Teams in the County Championship, Royal London Cup and the Vitality Blast – as well as the women’s Kia Super League – will now be allowed to swap a player who sustains concussion or suspected concussion during a match for a “like for like” replacement, subject to sign off from the cricket liaison officer. In keeping with changes to the Laws of Cricket by the MCC last autumn, teams will be subject to a five-run penalty if they commit two level‑one disciplinary offences, or one level‑two offence, during a match. Such breaches include offensive language, showing dissent to an umpire or deliberate physical contact with a player. The more serious level three and four charges will also invoke the five-run penalty but under new powers officials could also eject the offender from some or all of the remaining play."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/mar/21/why-have-we-given-up-our-privacy-to-facebook-and-other-sites-so-willingly","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-21T17:43:48Z","webTitle":"Why have we given up our privacy to Facebook and other sites so willingly?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/mar/21/why-have-we-given-up-our-privacy-to-facebook-and-other-sites-so-willingly","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/mar/21/why-have-we-given-up-our-privacy-to-facebook-and-other-sites-so-willingly","fields":{"headline":"Why have we given up our privacy to Facebook and other sites so willingly?","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Facebook is on the ropes. A week of revelations about Cambridge Analytica’s use of data gleaned from the social network has left the world demanding answers. The company can’t seem to decide: is it outraged that it was taken advantage of by an unscrupulous actor, or relieved that this is just normal use of tools that it made widely available for almost five years? Should Mark Zuckerberg come out front and centre leading the response, or should he hide in a cupboard until it all blows over? Faced with its first true crisis, the company is paralysed with fear. And that paralysis is, remarkably quickly, leading people to reassess their relationship with the site as a whole. The teens got there first, really. Facebook usage among younger people has been declining for years, in the face of competition from upstart rivals such as Snapchat, internal disruption from Facebook-owned Instagram, and a general sense that Facebook is full of old people and parents. But the backlash isn’t a generational thing any more. We’re all losing control of our data, both online and off, and we’re starting to kick back. Not only is the burgeoning #deletefacebook movement picking up steam (although it will take a few weeks before hard numbers are available about how many have followed through on their words), but people are also beginning to look up, as if from a daydream, to ask: how exactly did we end up in this situation? Why did we give up our privacy so willingly? And how can we get it back? The 50m profiles harvested from Facebook by a Cambridge Analytica partner under the guise of research are a huge data store, but they pale in comparison with the amount of information the company holds on its own users. At the same time that Facebook turned off the spigot that had been used to pump industrial quantities of data off its platform, the company opened up a second set of floodgates: the Facebook Audience Network, which allows third parties to track, profile and advertise to Facebook users wherever they find them on the internet. Facebook isn’t really a social network. It’s barely even an advertising company. It’s a data analytics firm, which manages to use its position as the middleman for a vast proportion of all human communication to find out everything there is to know about its users. Just as Cambridge Analytica claimed enormous powers of perception with a scant selection of personal information, Facebook also boasts to advertisers about how much it knows about its users – and how effective it can be at influencing their minds: it cites a games company that “made video adverts to match different gamer styles” for a “63% increase in purchase intent”; a clothes retailer that achieved “a dramatic increase in sales” with “richly personalised ads”; and a mobile network that scored “a major boost in awareness and purchase intent” by focusing on users with families. (Facebook used to have a similar page on which it showed off to politicians about how effective it was at swinging elections, but it quietly removed that in February.) If you think you’re a passive user of Facebook, minimising the data you provide to the site or refraining from oversharing details of your life, you have probably underestimated the scope of its reach. Facebook doesn’t just learn from the pictures you post, and the comments you leave: the site learns from which posts you read and which you don’t; it learns from when you stop scrolling down your feed and how long it takes you to restart; it learns from your browsing on other websites that have nothing to do with Facebook itself; and it even learns from the messages you type out then delete before sending (the company published an academic paper on this “self-censorship” back in 2013). This data life isn’t limited to Facebook. Google, famously, is in the same basic business, although the company is a bit more transparent about it (for a shock, try going to the “My Activity” and “Location History” pages to be vividly reminded that Google is tracking everything). And Amazon is building a modern surveillance panopticon, replete with an always-on microphone for your kitchen and a jaunty camera for your bedroom, purely to sell you more stuff. Avoiding the big players doesn’t help much. Large data brokers such as Experian and Equifax exist to collate information about everyone, whether or not they’re online. The security services continue to build their own surveillance databases, with powers strengthened in the UK through the recent Investigatory Powers Act. Even going to church now comes with the potential for a dose of surveillance: the Church of England has authorised the roll-out of 14,000 contactless card readers, to let parishioners give without carrying cash. Is it time to say goodbye to the anonymity of the collection plate, and hope you’re one of the more generous donors? Richard Stallman has been warning of this state of affairs since before Zuckerberg even touched his first computer. The veteran computer scientist, creator of the GNU operating system and leader of the Free Software Movement, warns that “the only database that is not dangerous is the one that is never collected”. “There is a limit on the level of surveillance that democracy can co-exist with, and we’re far above that,” he tells me on the phone from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. “We suffer more surveillance than the inhabitants of the Soviet Union, and we need to push it way down. “Any database of personal data will be misused, if a misuse can be imagined by humans. It can be misused by the organisation that collects the data. In many cases, the purpose of collecting it is to misuse it, as in the case of Facebook, but also in the case of Amazon, Google to some extent, and thousands of smaller companies as well. “It can also be misused by rogue employees of the company and it can also be stolen by some third party and misused. There’d be no danger of data breaches if a database doesn’t exist. And, finally, it can be taken by the state and misused.” Stallman has little sympathy for those who choose to use such services. “They’re foolish,” he says, when I ask him why he thinks data harvesting is tacitly accepted by so many people. “They’re accustomed to a certain kind of convenience ... they choose to ignore that it might be dangerous.” I’m less certain that there’s a choice being made at all, though. Yes, people may regularly be accepting terms and conditions that require them to give up their data, but that doesn’t mean they read them. I should know: I have. A few years ago, I decided to read, in full, the small print for every single product or service I used. I read almost 150,000 words of legalese – three-quarters of Moby Dick – in less than a week, from the 21,000 words required to turn off the alarm on my iPhone on a Monday morning to the 4,000 words required to browse BuzzFeed in my lunch break. The experience was gruesome. Legal documents are not written to be read by humans, and certainly not to be read back-to-back in a harrowing marathon of End-User Licence Agreements. But I did learn one thing, which is that the modern notion of consent upon which the entire data edifice is built has the shakiest of foundations. Lukasz Olejnik, an independent security and privacy researcher, agrees: “Years ago, people and organisations used to shift the blame on the users, even in public. This blaming is unfortunate, because expecting users to be subject-matter experts and versed in the obscure technical aspects is misguided. “Blaming users is an oversimplification, as most do not understand the true implications when data are shared – they cannot. You can’t expect people to fully appreciate the amount of information extracted from aggregated datasets. That said, you can’t expect users to know what is really happening with their data if it’s not clearly communicated in an informed consent prompt, which should in some cases include also the consequences of hitting ‘I agree’.” He adds that at many organisations, privacy was not being taken seriously, “except when there was a need to include the phrase ‘We take the privacy of our users very seriously’ following a data breach”. It doesn’t have to be like this. Doctors are required to demonstrate not just consent, but informed consent, from patients: the latter have to understand what they are agreeing to, or the agreement is moot. After years of mis-selling scandals, the same principle is slowly making its way to the financial industry. Logging in to check an ISA, you may be confronted with a 12-point questionnaire designed to check you understand the risks and are happy for the investment to continue. Yet online, the biggest companies in the world base their businesses around users hitting “I agree” on a dialogue box on a website once, a decade ago, and then never being told what their agreement entails, nor being offered any way to retract their consent and take back control of the information they gave up. Change is coming. In the EU, the General Data Protection Regulation – GDPR – overhauls a continent’s worth of rules around a clear principle that the only person who can ever own an individual’s data is that individual. Olejnik describes the law as a “good starter”, but notes that even it will still need to be “reviewed and updated on a regular basis”. Stallman wants to go one step further. “I recommend a law prohibiting any system that collects data,” he says, “no matter who runs it, whether it’s a company, some non-profit organisation, or a public agency, whatever, that they are not allowed to collect data unless they can justify it as absolutely necessary for the function to be done.” It would be a huge step, and one that is unlikely to come without a radical change in how the public views mass data collection. But he has hope, and rejects the label of a Cassandra, doomed with accurate predictions that will always be ignored. “I don’t know the future, because the future depends on you, so I’m going to try my damn best,” he says. “I’m a pessimist by nature. But just because things look dim, is no reason to give up. And that’s what I’ve been saying for many, many years.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/mar/31/being-ill-far-rom-family-friends-helping-out-bim-adewunmi","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-31T05:00:03Z","webTitle":"It’s difficult to be a continent’s distance from home – and ill | Bim Adewunmi","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/mar/31/being-ill-far-rom-family-friends-helping-out-bim-adewunmi","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/mar/31/being-ill-far-rom-family-friends-helping-out-bim-adewunmi","fields":{"headline":"It’s difficult to be a continent’s distance from home – and ill","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"When I am not in good health, what I require is tender handling, and to be indulged in the way that only family tends to do. If you’ve ever found yourself away from home – about a continent’s distance – you will recognise how difficult it is to be ill and not at home. But then, if you are lucky, a light appears in the gloom of healing. And then a series of lights follow. The first light after my emergency surgery was the homemade soup, hand delivered, with a hug and a kiss and the urgently stated instruction to “text if you need anything”. There followed, in no particular order: bread, grapes, smoothies, a bouquet of lilies, small tubs of pineapple and vanilla yoghurt, a little Peperomia ‘Rosso’ plant, housed in a cheery yellow pot. From my sickbed (aka the repurposed living room sofa), each care package looked like a tiny, tangible love letter. There was the friend who brought me home, woozy from anaesthetic; the sight of her shoes in the hallway for those first couple of hazy days was oddly reassuring. Another friend got the train from DC, arriving at 2am, to spend the weekend cooking, restocking my fridge and promising to read aloud to me, since screens were giving me migraines. Yet another arrived after work, bearing floury potatoes to make me mash, the core of my newly required soft-food diet. Texts flew in, as did direct messages; if we still used ravens, I think I would have got one of those, too. More than once, because I’m a sap, I cried. It’s been two years since I moved here. It has never felt more like home than when I was laid low, and the many lights of the proverbial village I had inadvertently built helped me back up.

Despite an overall increase in provision of tap water, the study - the State of the World’s Water 2018 - charts the gaps within and between nations, as poor communities face competition over aquifers and rivers with agriculture and factories producing goods for wealthier consumers. While recent headlines have focused on the drought in Cape Town, the NGO WaterAid, which published the report on Wednesday, noted that communities in many other regions have long been used to queues and limited supplies. By far the worst affected country is Eritrea, where only 19% of the population have basic access to water. It is followed by Papua New Guinea, Uganda, Ethiopia, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Somalia, all of which have rates of between 37% and 40%. It is no coincidence that many of these nations have large numbers of refugees living in temporary shelters. Within countries, there is also considerable variation linked to income and other factors. In Niger, only 41% of the poorest people have access to water, while 72% of its wealthiest do. In neighbouring Mali, 45% of the poor have access to water, compared to 93% of the rich. “Inequality in access to water is growing primarily as a result of a lack of political will,” said Lisa Schechtman, the director of policy and advocacy for WaterAid. “There is a risk of leaving people behind, particularly in remote rural areas and among displaced communities.” Most vulnerable are the old, sick, disabled and displaced people in remote or rural locations. Gender is also a key factor because woman bear the brunt of the burden of collecting water. The time-consuming task of fetching the UN-recommended 50-litres per day for a family of four takes the equivalent of two and half months each year, the report says. Collecting water time in school and raises the risks of disease. Children are often the victims, with close to 289,000 dying each year from diarrhoeal illnesses related to poor sanitation. There have been improvements. The proportion of the world’s population with access to clean water near their home has risen from 81% to 89% since 2000. But this leaves 844 million people with a journey and queues of at least 30 minutes to a safe source. The greatest progress has been seen in big, fast-growing developing nations. China has seen an extra 334 million people get access to water between 2000 and 2015, followed by India with 301 million. The biggest proportional gain was in Afghanistan, where a post-war reconstruction effort raised the proportion of people with access to water from 27% to 62% since 2000. Laos, Yemen, Mozambique and Mali have also seen rapid progress. However, the report notes the world still has much work to do to achieve the UN’s sustainable development goal 6, which is to provide safe water and sanitation to everyone by 2030. This summer, world leaders will meet in New York to review progress on this and other development targets. To close this gap, WaterAid is calling for more tax revenue to be mobilised to provide water for the poorest, improved environmental management and support for people who speak out on the UN-recognised right to safe drinking supplies and sanitation. The problem of access is increasingly complicated by climate change, pollution and a growing global population. A separate report by the UN earlier this week forecast that 5 billion people could face shortages for at least one month a year by 2050. Jonathan Farr, WaterAid’s senior policy analyst on water security and climate change, said recent droughts highlighted how extreme weather is adding to water stress on the poorest. “Cape Town is a wake-up call, reminding us that access to water, our most precious resource, is increasingly under threat. “Those marginalised by age, gender, class, caste or disability, or living in a slum or remote rural community, are hardest to reach and will continue to suffer as long as governments do not prioritise and fund access to water for all, and while disproportionate use of water by industry and agriculture continues.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2018/mar/21/hms-brexit-sticks-it-to-the-man-by-tossing-two-dead-fish-overboard","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-21T14:51:09Z","webTitle":"HMS Brexit sticks it to the man – by tossing two dead fish overboard | John Crace","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/mar/21/hms-brexit-sticks-it-to-the-man-by-tossing-two-dead-fish-overboard","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/mar/21/hms-brexit-sticks-it-to-the-man-by-tossing-two-dead-fish-overboard","fields":{"headline":"HMS Brexit sticks it to the man – by tossing two dead fish overboard","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"As the 10-metre fishing boat Holladays R8 – aka HMS Brexit – approached Embankment Pier on the Thames shortly after 8.30am, a Transport for London official came running down the jetty. “You can’t tie up here,” he yelled. “Why not?” the skipper shouted back. “Because you don’t have a permit.” “Oh.” No one had apparently thought of that when the protest against the government’s concession on remaining in the common fisheries policy for the best part of two extra years had been planned. After someone casually tossed two dead fish overboard to stick it to the Man, the boat motored back into the middle of the river and proceeded to potter round in circles for several minutes. As a metaphor for the futility of Brexit, it could hardly be bettered. Piss up. Organise. Brewery. On shore, Tory MP Jacob Rees-Mogg appeared rather relieved to see the back of the boat. Although the chair of the European Research Group has positioned himself as the country’s Defender of the Fish, he didn’t seem that keen on getting too up close and personal with a box full of smelly, four-day old haddock. That’s what staff are for. Looking every bit the City gent in his pin-striped suit, Rees-Mogg had repeatedly told a disappointed press pack that he wouldn’t be throwing any fish into the Thames himself. Or getting on the boat. There were only so many fish you could have out of water at any one time. Rather he was just there to make a few bad fish puns, to explain why the government’s inability to negotiate made it such a good negotiator and confer his blessing on the proceedings. And on the fish, to let them know their sacrifice had not been in vain. They were the glorious dead. Fallen in the service of Brexit. “The press conference will be starting in a few minutes,” said a harassed press office for Fishing for Leave. Moments after it had already ended. Rees-Mogg, along with Tory MPs Craig MacKinlay and Anne-Marie Trevelyan, who had also spent the whole time looking as if they wished they were elsewhere, was already beetling his way back to Westminster. Goodbye and thanks for all the fish. Just as it looked as if the whole morning was about to fizzle out, HMS Brexit headed up river to make an unscheduled stop at Westminster Pier, where Nigel Farage stepped out of a taxi and got on board. The former Ukip leader has never found a political stunt that he couldn’t hijack to get himself on TV. If the Tories had suddenly got cold feet about chucking some fish into a river, then he’d do it for them. For Farage this was not quite euphoric recall. Though it would have to do. Just under two years ago, he had captained a flotilla of fishing boats as they fought a running battle with Bob Geldof in one of the most surreal moments of the EU referendum campaign. It had been his finest hour. Now he was alone, forgotten, unloved. Abandoned even by Labour’s Kate Hoey, who had once stood proudly by his side on that joyous day. This was his chance to woo her back. After being whistled on board, Farage urged HMS Brexit onwards till it came to a halt in front of a handful of bemused MPs and researchers outside the terrace of the House of Commons. Then nothing much happened for about 10 minutes as Farage waited for a bigger crowd. And Kate. No one came, so he cut his losses, picked up a couple of fish and chucked them in the river. Then he went for broke and tipped a whole box full of fish overboard. Suck on that, EU and UK government. If that didn’t get their attention then he’d be back tomorrow, and the next day and the day after that to chuck more and more fish in the Thames until there were no fish left in British coastal waters. But he was going to have his work cut out. Not even the lone seagull that was following the boat could be bothered to swoop for a dead freebie. The fish were just too rank. Up on Westminster Bridge, a passerby asked what was going on. “Nigel Farage is throwing fish in the Thames,” I said. “Who’s that?” he replied. O tempora, o mores! As HMS Brexit rocked listlessly on the water a police boat appeared alongside. Farage was thrilled. Martyrdom awaited. Let him be arrested for fly-tipping. But the police seemed more concerned for the wellbeing of all those on board than about any illegality. Farage had fought the law and the law hadn’t really given a toss. Much like everyone else."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2018/apr/01/welcome-to-the-menopause-cafe-now-i-know-im-not-alone-im-not-going-mad","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-01T14:37:22Z","webTitle":"Welcome to the Menopause Cafe: 'Now I know I'm not alone.

I'm not going mad'","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"At a riverside deli in the East Ayrshire village of Catrine, about 20 women – some friends, some strangers – are arriving to spend the evening talking about the menopause. Amid an eye-popping selection of home baking, organiser Shiona Johnston explains the format for this Menopause Cafe, one of 14 that have taken place across the UK, from Perth to Petersfield, since the start of the year alone. “Most women know about hot flushes but don’t know about other symptoms which they might not even realise are related,” explains Johnston. “A lot are scared about HRT from things they’ve read in the papers. This gives them a chance to share information and what has worked for them.” The simple guidelines for the event – respecting one another’s confidentiality, not pushing any particular product or service, and encouraging participants to move tables regularly to speak to as many people as possible – were developed by Rachel Weiss, who launched the first Menopause Cafe in June 2017 in her home city of Perth, central Scotland. “My friends and I sat there waiting, thinking ‘will it just be us three?’”, says Weiss, “but 30 women turned up. After a few hours, people were buzzing: now I know I’m not alone, I’m not going mad. It’s a very human question: am I normal?” Inspired by the format of Death Cafes, a similar non-profit gathering to encourage people to talk about a previously forbidden subject, Weiss was galvanised into action after watching the Newsnight presenter Kirsty Wark’s very personal documentary on the menopause, Menopause and Me, which screened on BBC One last April. Wark is one of a number of high-profile women, including Lorraine Kelly and Dawn French, who have recently spoken out about their experience of menopausal symptoms. “Women all go through it, but we don’t get together and talk about it, so we come to it unprepared,” says Weiss, who runs her own counselling consultancy and, at the age of 51, has yet to go through the menopause. (The average age for a woman living in the UK to reach the menopause is 51, although individuals’ experience varies widely, with most finding that it occurs between 45 and 55, as oestrogen levels decline, periods stop and the body is no longer able to conceive naturally.) “It’s not just a support group for menopausal women,” Weiss adds, pointing out that attendees have been before, during and beyond the menopause, and included the occasional man wanting to learn how to support his partner. “It’s opening up conversations about the third stage in women’s lives, who am I if I’m not fertile or don’t look like a stereotypical sexy woman?” “But I’m also very keen that this doesn’t make it all sound dreadful,” Weiss insists. “It’s just enabling people to have conversations. If you are able to say the M-word then it’s also easier for you to go back to your 28-year-old male manager and say ‘I need to wear a cotton shirt with this uniform’ or ‘yes, I really do need a fan at my desk’.” Indeed, one project for this year, as the Menopause Cafe movement expands and women across the country take up the invitation to host their own events, is to encourage more workplace events, with Scottish and Southern Energy HQ in Perth blazing the trail last month. Weiss has also planned a series of Saturday afternoon Menopause Festivals (#Flushfest) in Perth, with speakers on health, wellbeing and body image, interspersed with chat and singalongs. Back in Catrine, what is noticeable is the amount of laughter in the room, which increases in volume as the evening wears on. In previous generations, the menopause simply wasn’t spoken about, the women agree, and in that sense it is different from childbirth, which was discussed, if only in private. Alex Gregory, the deli owner, shares stories of passersby sniggering at the poster in her window announcing the event – but also others doing a double-take and returning to jot down the details surreptitiously. Angela Milby, 47, a shop assistant, has not not yet reached this stage herself but has come with a friend and to “get some tips for later”. “It’s a taboo subject,” she agrees. “I certainly never heard my own mum speak about it. I do like the idea of talking with other ladies who have been through it.” Sharon Sym, 47, a Menopause Cafe veteran who runs a dog-walking business, believes that embarrassment holds many women back from seeking the help they need. “I wouldn’t talk about my menopause or ask for help until I hit rock bottom, and it started affecting my family life. But I’ve learned we’re all different and we all experience it differently.” “I’d become a bit of a recluse, but now I’ve got concert and book festival tickets booked all this year.” Her next date is a book signing with Judi Dench. “And if I sweat, I sweat!”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2018/mar/22/readers-recommend-playlist-songs-that-start-with-the-chorus","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-22T12:00:25Z","webTitle":"Readers recommend playlist: songs that start with the chorus","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/mar/22/readers-recommend-playlist-songs-that-start-with-the-chorus","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/mar/22/readers-recommend-playlist-songs-that-start-with-the-chorus","fields":{"headline":"Readers recommend playlist: songs that start with the chorus","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Here is this week’s playlist – songs picked by a reader from hundreds of your suggestions. Thanks for taking part. Read more about how our weekly series works at the end of the piece. Last week’s call out for songs that start with the chorus left wyngatecarpenter asking in the comments: “Can I suggest another topic – songs that you remember starting with the chorus until you listen to them and realise you were wrong?” Such is the power of the chorus. Little wonder then that another nominator, Clare Munks, noted the chorus was once more commonly known as “the burden”. Song structure has developed and altered over the centuries and differs between cultures, leading Mussoliniheadkick to ask: “When is a chorus not a chorus ... when it’s a refrain?” to which Lizzzie, not unreasonably, replied: “I’m hoping it’s the bit that’s repeated a lot that everybody knows.” To keep it simple, then, I took refrain to mean a repeated line rather than an independent section within the main body of a song. Let’s begin with the Beatles – prime exponents of chorus-first songs. Mario von Poppel aid in nominating She Loves You, “their career pretty much started with a chorus”. And who am I to disagree? There’s a thread in rock’s chorus-first evolution that could be said to go from the Beatles to Slipknot via the Kinks, ELO, Kiss, Cheap Trick, Twisted Sister and Guns N’ Roses. I chose Cheap Trick’s I Want You to Want Me next because it has a melodic, honky-tonk boogie and its refrain wonderfully draws in the listener – apologies to lovers of rock bands that wear big hair, daft masks and spandex. Pre-Beatles, tunes from musicals held sway. Reader ajostu remembers “taking a chorus” meant jazz musicians ripping away lead in verses “so that only the guts of the song – the chorus – was used.” Ella Fitzgerald’s version of All The Things You Are contains only its core and is deliciously “singable” for that reason. But it’s not only jazz repurposing choruses from musicals; Rammstein take the instantly recognisable thematic heart of Amerika from Leonard Bernstein’s America. Some songwriters, like Chic’s Nile Rodgers, specialised in chorus-first, he even emboldened David Bowie to open Let’s Dance chorus-first. Rodgers remembers in a Guardian piece from 2016: “I thought about my songs and how they all start with the hook because in the black world we don’t have many stations or chances to get a hit – you have to feed people dessert before the main course.” That need to create instant recognition means readers like YippeeYouCan’tSeeMe literally “woke one morning and remembered [a chorus-first] song” because it was so catchy – these next three are what RR regular DaddyPig calls “no nonsense, no tension building, just get cracking” tunes. First the funky disco of Odyssey’s Going Back to My Roots, then Sweet Sensation’s soulful Sad Sweet Dreamer and Little Esther’s jiving T’Aint Whatcha Say It’s Whatcha Do. Confusingly, the term “hook” is often used instead of chorus in hip-hop, but let’s embrace it. The World is Yours by Nas takes the guts of a jazz song – I Love Music by Ahmed Jamal Trio – and, as jazz musicians do, creatively uses it to grab your attention. However, chorus-first need not be easy listening; I doubt the chorus of the Fall’s Totally Wired was written for a sing-song down the pub. And though chorus-first songs often begin a capella, who says they need be singalong or have easily discernible lyrics, as is certainly not the case in the Bug feat. Daddy Freddy’s Can’t Take This No More. The chorus-first style isn’t of course an English language only phenomenon. Songs from India to Latin America were suggested, João Gilberto’s carnival favourite A Felicidade just one example. Sadly, chorus-first doesn’t guarantee popularity, otherwise the Triffids’ Bury Me Deep in Love would be better known. But playing with its conventions won’t lead to failure either; Tears for Fears demonstrated that in letting it all out memorably on Shout. I’ll end with three instantly recognisable chorus-first tunes – unforgettable, that’s what they are: Abba’s Dancing Queen; KC and the Sunshine Band’s That’s the Way (I Like It); and the Rolling Stones’ (I Can’t Get No) Satisfaction.

It was the issue to which most of her professional life had been largely dedicated and she spoke with eloquence and compassion of how the prime motivation of the trade union movement had been to remove the deprivation, degradation and misery that had been the lot of many working people throughout history. She could have added that it was a circumstance that still pertained in the years of her own childhood, growing up between the wars in a working-class household in Bromley, south-east London, a bright girl who longed for the university education her family were too poor even to consider. The sense of having herself been trapped by poverty provided her with a determination that became the mainspring of her career. She left school aged 16, initially to work in an insurance company, but already anxious to avoid a lifetime in the traditional female employment market it led her to become a clerk in the trade union ASSET, which represented supervisors and technicians in the engineering industry. Thereafter, she eagerly signed up for training courses offered by the union, including those offered by Ruskin College, Oxford, and became a specialist in the union’s industrial injury work. She won increasing regard for her negotiating skills and formidable authority in representing union members in disputed industrial cases, despite her lack of formal qualifications, and she always credited the labour movement for having provided her with the chance to extend her education. She was appointed personal assistant to the general secretary and, in 1961, when Clive Jenkins arrived to run the union, became national officer and then assistant general secretary. The merger that led to the formation of the white- collar union ASTMS,(Association of Scientific, Technical and Managerial Staffs), saw her remaining as Jenkins’ deputy – itself an unusual post for a woman at that time – and in an organisation with growing industrial clout in the labour movement. There were 65,000 members in 1970 when she took up the post and more than 500,000 when she retired from the office in 1987. Turner was good at her job. She was knowledgable and persuasive on the benefits of trade union membership for bank staff and other institutional office workers and it formed part of her lifelong mission to combat inequality and to give a voice to the powerless, particularly poorly paid women struggling with social disadvantage. It was a commitment she later took to the Lords. She had a sharp brain and, normally, a courteous manner, but she could be merciless when confronted by hypocrisy from those she felt did not consider the plight of the underprivileged. She was against what she termed “gesture politics” and said that “marvellous slogans” were never any good on their own. The elder of two daughters, Muriel was strongly influenced by her father, Edward Price, a machine fitter and an active trade unionist, whose family came originally from Builth Wells, Powys. She was not close to her mother, a convert to Roman Catholicism whose faith Muriel rejected as a teenager. She later became a humanist and a member of the National Secular Society and in the Lords campaigned against discrimination in faith schools and the imposition of collective worship, both of which she regarded as antipathetic to equality. By the same token she was an outspoken advocate of gay and lesbian rights, especially with regard to employment, and she sponsored a bill in 1996 to outlaw such discrimination at work. She had supported Stonewall since its foundation in 1989 and was recognised by members of the organisation as having been a pioneer on equality issues that are now taken for granted. A member of the Communist party until the invasion of Hungary in 1956, she had moved into the mainstream of the Labour party left by the time she joined the Lords in 1985. The following year she was appointed to the opposition frontbench to speak on social welfare and pensions and in 1987 added the employment portfolio to her political responsibilities. This highly successful second career ended in ignominy, however, in 1996. She had become a director of a company run by the Conservative political lobbyist Ian Greer five years earlier. This was a choice that itself exhibited an uncharacteristic lack of judgement for a Labour spokeswoman, and when Greer’s activities in the “cash for questions” scandal were exposed in the Guardian, Turner became an unwitting casualty of the political fall-out. She was obliged to resign from the frontbench, although there was no suggestion that she had acted improperly, and she was consequently denied the chance of ministerial office she would certainly otherwise have enjoyed when Tony Blair was elected prime minister the following year. Turner was a member of the TUC General Council (1981–87) and a member of the Equal Opportunities Commission (1982–88). She was a member of the Occupational Pensions Board (1977–93) and of the Occupational Pensions Advisory Service (1989–2007). She chaired the Personal Investment Authority Ombudsman Council from 1994 until 1997 and was deputy speaker of the House of Lords from 2002 until 2008. One of her proudest achievements was the award of an honorary doctorate of laws by the University of Leicester in 1991. After a short early marriage ended in divorce, in 1955 she married Reginald Turner, a wartime wing commander who became an artist. He died in 1995. She is survived by her two stepchildren, Richard and Gay, and two granddaughters, Ailsa and Lindsey. • Muriel Winifred Turner, Lady Turner of Camden, trade unionist and politician, born 18 September 1927; died 26 February 2018"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/apr/07/fit-in-my-40s-british-military-fitness","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-07T06:00:53Z","webTitle":"Fit in my 40s: ‘British Military Fitness reminded me of being in labour’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/apr/07/fit-in-my-40s-british-military-fitness","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/apr/07/fit-in-my-40s-british-military-fitness","fields":{"headline":"Fit in my 40s: ‘British Military Fitness reminded me of being in labour’","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"You’ll know British Military Fitness by its trail of shouting; hordes of the red-faced righteous chasing across parks after a tiny, hectoring man in camo. The instructors are probably not that small, they’re just farther away. It is, according to legend, a fantastically fast and effective way to get fit – some combination of the fresh air, the uncompromising style and the comradeship in adversity. It’s exercise as theatre, for people who love exercise and maybe don’t realise how much they love theatre: you engage in the group delusion that you’re actually in the army, and that makes you work harder. There’s lots of running – slow running at the start, a mile run in the middle, sideways running for warm-up purposes, sprinting at the end, jogging back to the finish. I thought I knew what kind of runner I was, until I did it with other people, when I realised I was rather easy on myself. I was second to last on every turn, until a split second before the end, when the super-competitive woman behind me would come beetling up and trounce me. I was a great motivator for her, put it that way. My instructor wasn’t a shouter; he was more like one of those teachers who knows you can do better, and you know you can’t, and you don’t want to disappoint him because he seems so nice, but also, what on earth is he on about? But the bit you’ll notice from afar, the bit that will have put you off if you are at all physically shy – which is to say normal – is the bit where you work in pairs. There is a tacit agreement that women work with women and men with men. When you’re an uneven number, the beta female has to work with the beta male, which is how I found myself doing press-ups into a stranger’s fist. He was lying face down with his fist up and my aim was to dip and touch it with my sternum; I wasn’t up to it and would just brush him with whatever body part landed first, inevitably some breast or other. He’d say motivational things, such as, “Don’t forget to breathe”, while I battled agony and embarrassment, and averted my eyes. It reminded me of something… it reminded me of being in labour. Two minutes felt like an hour. We did so many sit-ups that my abs went into a catatonic state and I finished using only two dusty vertebrae in my lower back. A long-forgotten song by the 90s indie band Salad started to pound my head, like the beginning of a traumatised state. We swapped partners; now I had a woman, except a tiny one, about the size of my 10-year-old son, and I had to put my full weight on her thighs and tricep dip. This felt morally wrong and physically appalling. Then I started to love everyone, which I know was chemical and not real, but what can you do? I love them.

Nacho Carretero’s Fariña, an expose of drug trafficking in Galicia, was published in 2015, but publication and sales were halted last month after the former mayor of O Grove in Galicia, Jose Alfredo Bea Gondar, brought legal action against Carretero and his publisher, Libros del KO. Bea Gondar is suing over details in the book about his alleged involvement in drug shipping. Describing the suspension of the book’s sale as a “disproportionate and anachronistic measure … to prevent people from reading the story”, the Booksellers Guild of Madrid has launched the website Finding Fariña, which uses a digital tool to trawl through the text of Don Quixote to find and highlight the 80,000 words that make up Fariña, allowing users to read the book despite the ban. As Fariña contains words that did not exist in the early 17th century when Cervantes wrote his novel, the tool assembles these syllable by syllable from combinations of words in Don Quixote. Carretero’s book alleges that Bea Gondar was involved in the shipping and unloading of cocaine and a negotiation between Colombia’s Cali cartel and local smugglers. Bea Gondar was found guilty by Madrid’s national court but the ruling was later overturned by the supreme court because one witness was disqualified – all of which is laid out in Carretero’s book. The guild said that its initiative was “our way of defending the freedom of the press and freedom of expression, and of reminding people of something that is very important: there are some books that can never be silenced … Because what they will never be able to censure are your rights as a reader. Nor words.

Leopards are often thought of as a threat to humans, but rather than being a problem in Mumbai, they may actually be helping their human neighbours – even saving their lives – as we argue in our paper published in Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment. Recent studies suggest there may be as many as 41 leopards roaming the 40 square mile park. That’s about two to three times the leopard density you’d find in some of the most productive savannahs in Africa or Sri Lanka. Mumbai’s leopards live alongside people, mostly in informal settlements, and they hunt and kill dogs in and around their villages. On average, dogs make up about 40% of a Mumbai leopard’s diet. So what, you might ask. Leopards are one of the world’s most adaptable big cats, feeding on more than 100 prey items worldwide, so aren’t they just doing what an opportunist would do? A city of dogs If you’ve ever visited Mumbai, you’ll probably remember a few incredible sights: the Gateway of India, Mumbai’s bustling city, teeming traffic – and its dogs. Hundreds and thousands of dogs. On every street corner, in every alley. Recent surveys have shown that about 95,000 dogs roam Mumbai. We wanted to delve deeper into the uncanny relationship Mumbai’s leopards have with the dogs. And what about bites, we asked. Do dogs bite people, and what about rabies risk? After sifting through about 40 newspaper articles and online reports, we found that nearly 75,000 bites are recorded annually in the city (although many more are likely unreported). More than 420 people in Mumbai have died from rabies as a result of stray dog bites over a 20-year period. It was at that point we wondered whether leopards help to protect people from dog bites by keeping the dog population down – especially around the park where their diet is dominated by dogs. Surveys performed by population biologist Lex Hiby and Nikit Surve of the Wildlife Institute of India around the park suggest that the answer is yes. Dog densities there are lower and, according to our analyses, citizens might experience only 11% of the bites compared with people who live further from the park. Moreover, by consuming between 800 and 2,000 dogs per year, we calculate that the leopard population saves the Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai about US$18,000 (£13,000) in sterilisation costs (or 8% of the municipality’s annual sterilisation budget). If you remove the leopards The final piece of the puzzle was to model what a park with no leopards would look like – a sad prediction if increased urbanisation, deforestation and conflict occur over future decades. Under one set of assumptions, we found dog bites could increase by between 140 to more than 5,000 per year as dog populations would grow in and around the park area. The medical costs for these bites could total as much as $200,000 per year. Our research puts a new twist on a large predator that has been persecuted for millennia, and which has generally been viewed as a nuisance to stock farmers globally and those living on the edge of Sanjay Gandhi National Park. Leopards are believed to have disappeared from about 63-75% of their global range. We have to think of large predators in a broader sense – they can at times be helpful to farmers, ecosystems and even insurance companies. The big challenge in Sanjay Gandhi National Park is not only leopard attacks on the odd pig or cattle calf – leopards here sometimes kill people. Leopard attacks on people peaked at 25 cases in 2002. Most of these were attributed to leopards who moved from other forest patches into Sanjay Gandhi, a kind of catch-and-dump scheme by local governments for problem animals. It’s thought this had a chaotic effect on leopard home ranges and social structures as leopards are territorial. But leopard attacks came to an almost complete halt for four years until 2017 when residents were angered by a spate of new attacks. The big challenge is to evaluate the benefits of these leopards and similar large carnivores; it’s equally important to assess the costs of these species to local communities. The real issue is navigating the costs with the benefits, and identifying those cases of net benefit.

It seems like a simple question, but the answer is a little more complex. In many ways, homes embody how we live and see ourselves. And these spaces evolve when we focus on what makes us happy. This is sometimes easier said than done, though. It requires reflection and thoughtful choices, but it is a rewarding process. When we create a place that meets our needs and expresses our character, we enrich our lives. When you walk into some homes, they instantly feel welcoming. And it’s not just because you enjoy the company or admire the decor – although both help. There’s something else. The space feels authentic, a genuine reflection of the person or family who lives there. The traditional way to design a house is from the outside in: starting with the walls and finding ways to fill the structure from a checklist of rooms, furniture and collections. The humanist approach puts a person at the heart of a space. As the designer Ilse Crawford says, we must ask the big questions first. What does our home mean to us? How do we want to feel in it? What do we value? It’s an inside-out approach that considers how we engage with and experience a space. That’s not to say you need lots of money or status to create a beautiful home. The people on the following pages – based in Italy, the Netherlands and Australia – have different needs and resources but have all created authentic homes where they can enjoy both the simplest and grandest gestures of life. One of them has built the foundations of a home quite quickly because it was important to be surrounded by pieces that had meaning and brought comfort after a move to a new country. Another has found unique solutions for their space precisely because they didn’t have an infinite budget, allowing themselves the luxury of time, slowly adding to their collections over the years – perhaps an item found while on travels or something that was saved for and happily moved from one dwelling to another. These homes also shine a light on what happens when we focus on what we value – we can create our best spaces. Katrin Arens: Bergamo, Italy “I was looking for a place where I could live and work, so I had my furniture production in the rooms below,” recalls designer Katrin Arens of her home in a former 15th-century monastery, which later became a mill house, near Bergamo, in the Lombardy region of Italy. She found the abandoned building on the banks of the river Adda when she was pregnant with her eldest daughter, Laura, who is now 18 (her younger daughter, Sofia, is 11). From the kitchen window Mount Resegone is visible in the distance. “The position of the house is perfect,” Katrin says. It was one of the attractions of the building, as well as the light and the big rooms. However, the site had been abandoned for about 10 years before they moved in. There was no electricity, hot water or heating. Windows were broken and swallows had built nests in the ceiling. While they cleaned out the residence and installed basic necessities, Katrin wanted to keep the place as close to its origins as possible. Most of the furniture is Katrin’s design, plus a few other pieces that the family have collected on their travels. “I like to have natural colours and white in the house – and allow objects to introduce colour,” she says. “We love travelling and always bring objects back with us. They have to be authentic and they have to tell a story or mean something to me.” Katrin was born and grew up in Germany (she moved to Italy after winning a scholarship at the Academy of Arts in Bergamo) and it was here that she started to become interested in old furniture. “In Germany, there used to be sperrmüll once a month: people put everything out on the streets in front of their house and big trash vans came early in the morning, picking up everything to throw it away. At night, people were looking with a torch collecting things, such as chairs. I remember I was so fascinated by what other people threw away – sometimes incredible, beautiful things.” Over the years, the main changes in the house have been to accommodate the needs of the girls: now her atelier has relocated to a nearby village and it is no longer the family’s primary home (they are based in town during the week, to be close to school). However, they return on weekends and school holidays (when the family is away Katrin gives the house to artists and, as an exchange, they leave a piece of their work). It’s where she likes to cook and entertain, and the girls can enjoy each other’s company. “It’s a great luxury having all this space without anybody living close by,” says Katrin. “We have freedom to do whatever we want – throw parties, listen to loud music – without disturbing anybody around. This house gives me the feeling of home: protection and freedom.” Kim Baarda: Amsterdam, Netherlands After 22 years of living overseas, Kim Baarda felt the call of home. “I wanted my sons to experience a slower pace of life, and more of the childhood that Amsterdam could offer us compared with the rushed lifestyle of London,” she says. In 2016, she moved into her apartment with sons David, 12, and Jeffrey, 9. Kim was drawn to the location as it was still quite central, but far enough away from the tourists who flock to the historical centre. The place had also been renovated and was ready for her to move in. “As we were coming from another country that was a big tick,” says Kim, who was drawn to the high ceilings, open-plan downstairs living and the small garden, which can be hard to find in the city. “It was easy to make it into a cosy home, so we could concentrate on settling into our new life.” A veteran of moving house, Kim has learned what should take priority when setting up a new home. “I always believe I can make any space into a homely home with the pieces I have collected over the years,” she says. “It is an organic process for me; some things will be replaced with new favourite pieces, but there are core items, such as an antique Dutch 400-year-old linen cupboard which was given to me by a dear friend, that I would love to keep for a long time to come.” Kim says that hanging favourite pieces of art and laying rugs can help to create a sense of home quickly. She finds the process quite instinctive. “I am very emotional,” Kim says. “So when I love a piece, I am convinced I will find a place for it.” However, she is sensitive to interior decor not working cohesively. “I get very obsessed if something does not look right, which can be even a small vase or some pieces of furniture together,” she says. “I will spend my weekend or evenings rearranging until I feel it works and flows.” She loves adding splashes of colour and playing with geometric patterns. “I embroider my own cushions, make headboards for my sons’ bedrooms, restore old furniture and bring pieces back to life. For me that gives a personal touch to what would otherwise be just any other home.” Ultimately, though, her priority is being with her boys. “We are big foodies,” says Kim. She often cooks and bakes with her eldest son, and the family eat at the dining table or outside when the weather is good. It’s even better if family or friends join them as that is her idea of a happy home. “Home is where my family is. I need my favourite furniture and art pieces – and it’s important they have the right space in our home – but above all home will always be a place where I can rest, laugh and spend precious time with my family.” Caroline Carter: Melbourne, Australia History weaves its way through Caroline Carter’s home in many ways. An unassuming 1970s house on the outskirts of Melbourne, it holds many special memories. The house belonged to her grandmother and it was here that Caroline spent a lot of her childhood. She and her husband, Darren, bought the three-bedroom house a decade ago with a view to creating their own family home for children Jett, 12, and Lila, 5, after Caroline’s grandmother died. She was attracted to the intimacy of the place. “I really love small, simple houses,” says Caroline. And the smaller home meant that the couple could live within their means, too. They had a tight budget and didn’t want to stretch to structural changes. “I just wanted a really simple white classic look that would work with any interior decoration,” she says. “I like a combination of industrial, rustic and natural elements, but I’m also attracted to modern, simple design.” Caroline’s love of vintage pieces is one of the defining features of the home. “I’ve always loved to collect, craft and decorate,” she says. About 15 years ago she started collecting vintage pieces seriously and had her own homewares shop. “My taste has changed since then, but my love of vintage hasn’t,” she says. “These days I look for impact. I enjoy making something from nothing.” Given the size of her collection, editing it regularly is essential. “I might find one new piece that will set the ball rolling,” she says. “I rarely go looking for anything. If it finds me it comes home and I make it work somehow – even if it means changing a room completely.” Caroline jokes that her family thinks she’s crazy. A common question is: “You want to do what?” But they are used to her rearranging the home, and expeditions to vintage shops, which they also enjoy. Patience is key for Caroline when it comes to adding layers to her home. The standing lamp in her living room, for instance, was purchased from a dealer in France. “I saved and saved for this piece,” she says. And she’s content to live with Ikea sofas until she can find her dream replacements, even though she’s not certain what they are yet. “I like to take my time and be sure,” she says. The home’s statement pieces, including the lockers and the tureen collection, are her favourites. “I love them and appreciate them so much because I saved so hard for them,” she says. “To me, home is a feeling. Without love it is just a house. I am lucky to live here, surrounded by my loved ones and beautiful things.” This is Home by Natalie Walton is published by Hardie Grant on 5 April at £30.

On the one hand, it plays into some conservatives’ increasing hostility to big tech firms, and social media companies in particular. Seeing Facebook in trouble has allowed many to vent some righteous fury. On the other, the story’s implicit suggestion that Trump’s victory was less than legitimate has led others to insist either that the problem of social media manipulation does not exist, or that Democrats are even worse. To understand the first response, remember that Facebook, Twitter and Google have recently rejigged their algorithms or tightened their rules in order to address a perceived extremism problem. But this has led to claims that the companies have skewed their platforms to penalize conservative speech. It’s also led some on the conservative and radical right to pursue legal action against Twitter, YouTube and others on free speech grounds. So no surprise that on the Drudge Report, the links page at the center of the conservative internet, there has been a gleeful curation of stories about Facebook’s troubles, with taunting link texts like “Facebook Freakout”, “Where’s Zuckerberg”, and “Busy Selling Shares”. Others have taken the opportunity to directly link the story to the perceived “viewpoint discrimination” against conservatives. On Gateway Pundit, in characteristic dot-point prose, Jim Hoft alleged that Facebook itself is biased against conservative viewpoints. He argued that Donald Trump and conservative sites have been targeted by algorithm changes, and have lost traffic, while liberal politicians have suffered no such hit. He wrapped it up with an increasingly common question among conservatives: “isn’t about time lawmakers take action to prevent Facebook from shutting down conservative voices?” On RedState, Seton Motley expanded the discussion to include the other three members of tech’s “big four”: Google, Amazon and Twitter. The fact that those companies “loathe conservatives and conservatism”, he claimed, was “the world’s worst kept secret”. Their power, he said, enabled them to “warp or silence our political communications”. He finished with some hand-wringing about how conservatives’ suspicion of regulation means that it’s difficult for them to imagine what to do about it. The second kind of response to the story involves those who, above all, are concerned that the Facebook caper will be folded into the broader narrative of Russian collusion. Those seeking to protect Trump at all costs were thrown a lifeline late on Monday. A former Obama campaign staffer, Carol Davidsen, put out a number of tweets seeming to indicate that in 2012, their organization had also been given broad access to Facebook user data. “Facebook was surprised we were able to suck out the whole social graph,” she wrote, “but they didn’t stop us.” For “alt-right” blogger and author, Vox Day, this was enough to confirm that “Facebook is in SERIOUS trouble”, and he did a back-of-the-envelope sum leading to the conclusion that the company may owe “$200bn in potential FTC fines”. Another part of Davidsen’s remarks, where she said that Facebook was “on our side”, became the basis of headlines from RT to ZeroHedge, and dutifully amplified by the likes of Infowars. The story was also covered by Breitbart, where schadenfreude led to a possibly unprecedented step: a straight and sympathetic rewrite of a Guardian column. Others tried to wave the whole thing away. In the New York Times, Ross Douthat claimed it was television, not social media, that was crucial in Trump’s election. On his radio show, Rush Limbaugh insisted that there was nothing to see. Facebook collects a lot of data, he argued, and “Cambridge analytics [sic] is like any other outfit that found a way to access it, and it’s not illegal.” Then, with trademark bluster, he pointed the finger of blame at a familiar party. “Google, the kings of data collection, Google, the kings of harvesting everybody’s personal data to use in advertising and who knows whatever else, practically had a White House relationship with Barack Hussein O,” said Limbaugh. More than a year since he left office, in times of trouble, conservatives are still using Obama as their most reliable punching bag."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"healthcare-network/2018/mar/22/when-end-terminally-ill-childs-life-agonising-decision-doctors","type":"article","sectionId":"healthcare-network","sectionName":"Healthcare Professionals Network","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-22T10:32:16Z","webTitle":"When to end a terminally ill child's life?

It's an agonising decision","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"My wife says my colleagues and I are the kind of doctors you never want to meet. It’s true. Having your child admitted to a paediatric intensive care unit (PICU) is a traumatic experience. However, most children admitted to a PICU pass through briefly; they may have acute infections or require surgery and are fixed in one visit. But some children return more frequently and yes, sadly, some die. We have many disabled children with complex needs who are alive and at the heart of loving families because of our help. When you have done this for a while you see teenagers you didn’t expect to get out of infancy. There is another increasingly common group of children, those with severe illnesses requiring not just frequent PICU visits but often never getting out of a PICU or only getting to another hospital ward before returning. For these patients, the skills and technology of a PICU are deployed to stave off death one more time. It’s a challenging situation for the kids, for the parents and for the staff. We greet them like old friends and, like old friends, we are sometimes shocked to see how diminished they are and sometimes surprised at how well they are holding up. The parents have usually been told to expect the worst and have seen their children pull through again and again. When they have been to the brink and walked back, they become sceptical about our predictions. They have a point. Doctors tend to paint bleak pictures. No one needs any help to prepare for the best outcome; they will be fine with that. But when we are wrong we share in their delight and smile at the perverse strength of the most fragile of human bodies and the astonishing persistence of the human spirit. We also feel uncomfortable about how much we have to do, how much pain and distress we have to inflict to get them back to where they were. We face agonising decisions. We share our perception of the future with the parents in an act of honesty and out of professional duty. Sometimes it is our duty to temper a parent’s relentless optimism with the truth, and that may seem cruel. But it doesn’t feel cruel to us, it feels necessary. There are parents who can’t forgive us for this, who will always believe that our giving up hope is an act of betrayal. It’s at times like these that we ask the courts to test our decision. My PICU has been to court only once. It’s not an easy experience and it does not bring peace. But it does bring resolution. There is no life that doesn’t contain some suffering, but at what point is that suffering intolerable? We endure suffering because it is inevitable or because it may represent a worthwhile sacrifice. What if it isn’t inevitable or if it is all sacrifice and no reward? We look into the future and see lives littered with pain and difficulty. Plenty of relationships don’t survive the trials of normal life so it is unsurprising to see the toll of looking after profoundly damaged children. You can’t be cynical about this. The wonderful secret of humans is that our capacity to love and to endure is our greatest strength. To be a witness to this is one of the great privileges of my job and a great source of comfort for me. But I also believe that this strength is expressed as much in letting go as in holding on.

Ushered in for the 1986-87 season, at a time of falling attendances everywhere, the reform was welcomed as offering ambitious non-league clubs a chance to crash a closed shop clogged up by teams routinely dismissed as deadwood but re-elected most years anyhow. It also promised an injection of extra tension to the season’s run-in – and, in its first season, how it delivered. Yet the “deadwood” club in most peril come the season’s concluding Saturday in 1987 were not one of the perennial strugglers – Rochdale, Crewe, Halifax, Torquay – but Burnley. Proud Burnley, two-time League champions, European pioneers, top-flight members only 11 years previously – and it would fall to the winger Neil Grewcock to score one of the club’s most important goals. How had it come to this? In truth the Clarets’ predicament had long been in the post. Relegation to the fourth tier two seasons previously, under a high-profile team built by John Bond, accelerated a long spiral of decline. Grewcock was one of Bond’s less heralded signings, arriving from Shepshed Charterhouse after three years at Leicester between 1978 and 1981, in which he made only eight first-team appearances, and two at Gillingham. “When I signed for Burnley in 1984, a lot of fans were blaming the board for taking Bond on and signing a lot of his old Man City players,” says Grewcock. “It sort of went from there. We had some good players when we got relegated in 85 – Micky Phelan, Wayne Biggins, Kevin Hird, Bryan Flynn, Tommy Hutchison – we thought we had a decent side. But that was when the slide began.” Departures and cost-cutting followed. A mid-table finish in 1985-86 was followed by a season from hell, with Grewcock’s form one of its few positives. By the final weekend Burnley had slumped to the bottom after a calamitous post-Christmas run that included a 6-0 home shellacking by Hereford in front of fewer than 2,000. Their manager, Brian Miller – a title-winner as a Burnley player in 1960 – had been unable to stop the rot, and his side found themselves duking it out with Torquay and Lincoln – above them by one and two points respectively – to avoid the one relegation spot, needing a win against Orient for survival. “We got sucked down,” Grewcock recalls. “We couldn’t attract people to the club, we were making no signings, we’d heard there was no money about, they were struggling to pay wages. There had been a sense that, as founder members of the league, they won’t let Burnley go down. But they would have. There was talk we’d go under – there was no money, and no backers that could have seen us through.” Burnley averaged 3,257 that season, yet in their hour of need the whole town turned out – officially, 15,781 were present for Orient’s visit but it looked like many more. Traffic into the town was jammed, kick-off delayed 15 minutes – and the atmosphere inside the ground frenzied. “Ooh it was a good atmosphere – I’d never played in front of that many people at Turf Moor before,” says Grewcock, “but the realisation that possibly you could be out of the league overshadowed everything, you couldn’t enjoy it.” Turf Moor was throbbing. Burnley’s Longside was a terrace nostalgist’s dream – cavernous and, on this occasion, cacophonous, crammed to the rafters along two-thirds with its final section reserved for the 800 or so Orient fans who’d travelled in the hope their side might clinch a place in the inaugural play-offs. Your correspondent, then a callow young teenager, was among them, in awe at, and intimidated by, the din. Outside the ground, we had been greeted by the standard pantomime-hooligan graffiti of the period (“Enjoy this game – it will be your last”). Inside it, a number of home fans had climbed into the roof struts of the stand and inched their way to positions on the stanchions above us. The Orient manager, Frank Clark, said he had been advised by police before the game that they would be unable to guarantee his team’s safety should the visitors win. Yet when the game started Orient were the better side, playing with a confidence born of an inspired second half of the season in which they rose from relegation bother to the play-off race. They had a soft centre though, and as the interval approached Grewcock would exploit it – and in style. He takes up the story: “I picked the ball up on the right, cut in, beat a couple of players, bent it with my weaker foot and it went in the bottom left-hand corner.” Bedlam ensued. “I wouldn’t say it settled the nerves, but it gave us something to build on.” Half-time elsewhere brought news that Torquay were 0-2 down at home to Crewe (David Platt among the scorers) and Lincoln behind at Swansea. Burnley went off at the interval with fresh confidence and soon doubled their lead, Ian Britton heading in Grewcock’s cross three minutes after the restart. But Orient responded within 10 minutes when their best player Alan Comfort (who would become a vicar after injury-enforced retirement) pounced on a loose ball inside the area and lashed home. Orient still needed two more for the play-offs but Burnley were hanging on again. Comfort missed a late chance. As time ticked by, fans began scaling the perimeter fences but the bravado could not conceal nerves. Final whistles went elsewhere – Lincoln had lost, and Torquay had grabbed a survival-clinching equaliser in time added on after their defender Jim McNichol had been bitten by a police dog. And Burnley hung on. The final whistle prompted the pitch invasion police had feared, but a joyful one. Orient’s players got off swiftly and safely; their fans meanwhile were assailed with handshakes and scarf-swaps between the fences. Instead Lincoln, who hadn’t been bottom all season, lost their League place. “We had no celebration,” Grewcock recalls. “We went to the players’ lounge, had a couple of beers, and everyone dispersed and did their own thing, I went out for a meal with friends. It was just a sense of relief. The buildup was horrible, not a pleasant situation to be in, I feel for every team now that’s in that position.” The introduction of one-up one-down brought assumptions that relegation would kill its victims but Lincoln returned as Conference champions the following season. It would take Burnley another five years to gain promotion from the fourth tier, a year after Grewcock’s departure, after which he was swiftly forced by injury to retire. It would be stretching it to say that his goal and Burnley’s nervy win on that breathless sunny afternoon laid the foundations for their current exalted status, but “the Orient game”, as it is still simply known among Clarets, remains as significant a part of the club’s folklore as any."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"business/2018/mar/20/bellway-on-track-to-build-more-than-10000-homes","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-21T07:19:06Z","webTitle":"Bellway on track to build more than 10,000 homes this year","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/mar/20/bellway-on-track-to-build-more-than-10000-homes","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/mar/20/bellway-on-track-to-build-more-than-10000-homes","fields":{"headline":"Bellway on track to build more than 10,000 homes this year","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"UK house builder Bellway said it was on track to build more than 10,000 homes this year for the first time, despite an industry-wide shortage of materials such as bricks and roof tiles. Jason Honeyman, Bellway’s chief operating officer, said the shortage was exacerbated by a higher demand for bricks in the wake of the Grenfell Tower fire, as construction firms sought alternatives to cladding. Materials are taking about three or four months to arrive – both from within the UK and overseas – instead of two to four weeks. Some roof tiles are in such short supply that they take five to six months to be delivered to building sites, Honeyman said. In addition, the weaker pound has pushed up the cost of imported materials. Bellway’s building costs rose 3% in the first half and this is likely to continue in the second half. Honeyman said bricks and roof tiles had risen even more in price, by 6-7%. He added that shortages of skilled builders – a perennial issue in the housebuilding industry – were less of an issue for Bellway at the moment. Overall, the company said it was benefiting from a “favourable” backdrop of low interest rates and mortgage availability, as well as a focus on homes priced in the middle-to-lower end of the market, predominantly outside London where demand is slowing. Newcastle-based Bellway sold 4,741 homes in the first half of its financial year to the end of January, an increase of 6.3% on the same period a year earlier. It has put the housebuilder on course to complete a record number of houses in the full year to the end of July, as consumer confidence is “seemingly unaffected by the ongoing uncertainty surrounding the forthcoming exit from the EU”, the company said. The average selling price of a Bellway home was £275,945 in the first half, up 7.7%. “The group has invested significantly in land to achieve future growth, in a market place in which customer demand is robust and mortgage availability remains good,” said John Watson, Bellway’s executive chairman. “This positive trading environment, together with a substantial order book, bodes well for the full year and should enable the group to complete in excess of 10,000 new homes.” The company said its nationwide presence and lower price had insulated it from the slump in London, where would-be buyers have found themselves priced out of the market. Aside from The Residence, its flagship development in Nine Elms in Battersea, Bellway has few sites in central London. The company’s focus is on outer London boroughs, where demand has held up better, and the commuter belt, Manchester, the Midlands and Scotland. Bellway has sold the majority of the 514 homes at The Residence, with 100 apartments left to sell before construction finishes next winter. Meanwhile annual growth in UK house prices edged down to 4.9% in the year to January from 5% a month earlier, the Office for National Statistics said. The weakest growth was in the north-east, at 0.7%, followed by London, where prices grew by 2.1%. Over the month, the average price of a home fell by 0.3% to £225,621. “House price growth remained steady, with prices increasing strongly across much of the country, although London and the north east are both lagging behind,” said Phil Gooding, a statistician at the ONS. Ed Stansfield, chief property economist at Capital Economics, said the latest ONS figures suggested that “prices will do little more than tread water this year and edge down in London”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"global/2018/mar/27/good-to-meet-you-julie-greenan","type":"article","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"Global","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-27T13:59:18Z","webTitle":"Good to meet you ...

Now it has had its lightbulb moment, it seems to be committed to making up for lost time. Nowadays, rarely a season goes by without several product launches aimed at the thirsty skinned, but rarely are they so broadly good. I’m mad about L’Occitane’s new Aqua Réotier collection – or more specifically, its two moisturisers – Ultra Thirst-Quenching Cream, and Gel, £28 each for 50ml. Both are instantly refreshing and visibly plumping of fine lines, while the cream (for drier types) is ungreasy and the gel (for combination skins), unsticky. Each layers perfectly under foundation primer and makeup with no pilling, peeling or sliding, and doesn’t wear off until one’s bedtime cleanse. There’s an accompanying “hydrating essence” to layer underneath before serum, but I prefer Vichy’s newish humectant Minéral 89 (£25, 50ml). La Roche-Posay’s Hyalu B5 serum is my new favourite next step. I balked at the price (at £37.50 for 30ml, it’s more expensive than anything else in the brand’s lineup by some distance) and moaned about the pipette-dropper packaging (seriously, can we retire these?), but my skin drank up this serum like a raisin in warm rum. Applied immediately after cleansing, it plumps, comforts, smooths and cushions the oiliest or most sensitive skin (including rosacea, despite the presence of alcohol) in readiness for moisturiser, leaving the complexion noticeably healthier and perkier. Much of modern hydrating skincare may not exist if it weren’t for Clinique’s Moisture Surge hydrator. Last month, this pink-hued moisturiser enjoyed a tune-up via sympathetic reformulation, relaunch and claims of longer-lasting (72-hour) hydration. I’ve worn it lots and can’t say I felt a huge difference, perhaps because I felt it unimprovable. I will continue to recommend this silky, cooling gel-cream to anyone who loathes the feeling of oiliness on dry or oily dehydrated skin, and to peri- or fully menopausal women who crave hydration while seeking to mitigate hot flushes.

Cuts","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The homelessness minister Heather Wheeler has admitted that she “doesn’t know” why rough sleeping has risen so much in the past seven years. As the chief executive of the YMCA in Birmingham, I can tell her: it’s because years of cuts to services for vulnerable people are adding up. Let’s start with housing benefit cuts for EU migrants. In 2015, the government changed the law so EU citizens would have to show they’d been in employment for at least six months before they were allowed to claim benefits. This change wasn’t a problem for most EU citizens, who either don’t need housing benefit, or claim it for short periods between paid employment. But there were some who paid their rent with housing benefit. It also affected EU workers in the informal economy doing cash-in-hand work that makes it hard to demonstrate a history of legitimate employment. Such people were in the country wholly legally and so couldn’t be deported, but were effectively rendered destitute. The street was the only option. Then there has been the cuts to the supporting people funding, which paid for services like support workers who could help the most vulnerable to sustain their tenancies, for example by signposting them to drug services, and helping them stick to their treatment. Rough sleeping reduced between 2003, when this funding was introduced, and 2011. It was the first time such services were properly and securely funded and it was phenomenally successful at getting – and keeping – people off the streets. But in 2009, the ringfence that protected it was removed. Wide-scale council cuts meant the grant has been used to plug funding gaps in other services with a higher political priority instead of being used to protect people from becoming homeless. Furthermore, while the government is right to say that it has not cut the number of bed spaces available to the homeless, that is not the whole story. Charities that have lost funding no longer have sufficient funding to offer support to the most vulnerable – their services are just too stretched. In 2003, we were funded to employ one support worker for every eight residents in our hostel in Northfield. Today, we have one worker for every 18 residents. That means we are unable to take on people with more complex problems like serious drug use or mental health problems, because it’s not safe for us to do so. The bed spaces are now available to different people, and people at a higher risk have nowhere to go but the street. And of course, the other organisations that support rough sleepers, including mental health services, police and probation services, have also been cut. In Birmingham, our teams used to include drug treatment workers, mental health workers and the police, as well as homelessness workers. Now the specialists have disappeared and the housing workers have to go out on their own. They can’t diagnose problems or prescribe medication so can offer no reassurance to hostels that it’s safe to house people. Hostels are far less likely to accept referrals because they know that rough sleepers will have to take their place at the back of a long queue before they are properly assessed and treated. Wheeler’s commitment to building more affordable homes is to be welcomed, but she shouldn’t be under any illusions that it will help solve the rough sleeping crisis. People don’t sleep rough because of a lack of housing – they might sleep on friends’ floors or in overcrowded accommodation, but they won’t usually end up on the street for any length of time. They sleep rough because of the lack of necessary support services that enable them to access the accommodation that is available and to sustain a tenancy. Alan Fraser is chief executive of YMCA Birmingham. The headline on this article was changed on Wed 21 March to reflect the fact that the cuts referred to were made by several different governments.

But data mining poisons our politics","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"It’s exactly the sort of conversation about politics that one would hope did not exist. Two suits, in a swanky restaurant, blithely boasting about exploiting fears buried so deep inside our subconscious that most of us don’t even know we have them; claiming that, for the right price, they can creep invisibly into your head. Channel 4’s sting, which showed executives at the digital marketing firm Cambridge Analytica telling undercover reporters what on earth it is they actually do, was just the final piece of this particular jigsaw. My indefatigable Observer colleague Carole Cadwalladr put in the hard yards, over months of investigating the firm that boasts of using a combination of data and behavioural science to laser-target voters and thus help put Donald Trump in the White House. But until now it’s been difficult for many people to visualise how the unauthorised use of our personal data, or the use of social media profiles to manipulate our votes, looks in practice. It sounds bad, obviously. We clearly should care. But it’s all so complicated, and life is busy. The risks of letting tech giants plough through our holiday snaps seem abstract and remote compared with the instant gratification of social media likes and shares and gossip. Well, it’s not so remote now. Facebook had $36bn wiped off its shares on Monday following Cadwalladr’s revelation that personal data from 50 million American Facebook users, obtained by an academic using privileged access granted for research purposes, was then passed on to Cambridge Analytica. And now we know what sort of hands it ended up in. When approached by undercover reporters, posing as wealthy clients seeking to get chosen politicians elected in Sri Lanka, Cambridge Analytica executives suggested all sorts of dubious miracles might be possible. Maybe a rival could be made a financial offer he couldn’t refuse, with the resulting incriminating film posted online. Or maybe some beautiful women could be sent to his house. But arguably more chilling was a conversation about just how deep its psychological profiling goes. Christopher Wylie, the whistleblower Cadwalladr worked with, has said the company used data harvested from prospective voters to “build models to exploit what we knew about them, and target their inner demons”. On camera we saw what that might mean: talk of operating subliminally, exploiting fears where “you didn’t know that was a fear until you saw something that just evoked that reaction”. Cambridge Analytica’s chief executive, Alexander Nix, one of those caught on camera, now insists his company was indulging in “a certain amount of hyperbole” – either exaggerating to impress the client, or perhaps even quietly probing their intentions. Like lobbyists, his company seems to spend half its time telling clients of its power to influence elections and the other half telling journalists those powers are wildly overstated. But at best, his company looks guilty of hype, and at worst, the months of legal threats and denials over Cadwalladr’s stories – not to mention the online abuse she got from people such as Arron Banks of the unofficial pro-Brexit campaign Leave.EU, said to have consulted Cambridge Analytica – stink. None of this means Britain would have voted remain or Hillary Clinton would be president if it hadn’t been for these pesky kids, just as “corporate lobbying” can’t explain every poor government decision. Voters’ anger was real, and this scandal doesn’t absolve us from asking the hard questions about why so many responded to extreme messages. Since Cambridge Analytica’s business model is arguably just a supercharged version of something political parties have done for years – identifying potential supporters, compiling detailed pictures of what makes them tick, then tailor-making messages to different groups depending on what they want to hear – it may also turn out that all sides have been busily scraping data behind our backs. But this feels like a tipping point. Britain’s information commissioner has a warrant to search servers. The Commons select committee inquiry into fake news will recall Nix, questioning whether he “deliberately misled” them in recent testimony on the use of the Facebook data, and seek fresh evidence from Facebook. The latter’s falling share price meanwhile reflects not just this scandal but a string of them, including its role in inadvertently spreading fake news. There is a growing sense that even if users don’t take fright, regulators are losing patience. And so they should. Like lobbying back in the days of cash-for-questions, data mining is a fast-growing business operating largely unseen on the fringe of politics, and while it can be used to respectable ends, it’s vulnerable to abuse. It clearly has the capacity to undermine our democratic process, even if it hasn’t done so yet. We should act before it’s too late. • Gaby Hinsliff is a Guardian columnist and former political editor of the Observer"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/mar/24/griff-rhys-jones-food-diary-how-i-eat","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-24T12:00:23Z","webTitle":"How I eat ... | Griff Rhys Jones","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/mar/24/griff-rhys-jones-food-diary-how-i-eat","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/mar/24/griff-rhys-jones-food-diary-how-i-eat","fields":{"headline":"Griff Rhys Jones: how I eat","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Breakfast It really depends on the day.

The Centre for Cities thinktank said urban renaissance in Manchester, Leeds, Birmingham and Liverpool had been so marked that problems of urban decay had been replaced by a need to find room for further expansion. Calling for changes to planning laws to permit commercial and residential development, the thinktank said the central districts of England’s big regional cities had all seen their populations grow more than six times as quickly as that of central London. When measured by a combination of jobs and population increase, Manchester had seen the fastest city centre growth in England and Wales in the period 2002-2015, followed closely by Leeds, Birmingham and Liverpool. London was in 20th position. The thinktank said the big regional cities were starting from a low base compared to London but were also benefitting from the desire of knowledge-based businesses to be based in city centres. Andrew Carter, chief executive of Centre for Cities, said: “30 years ago the centres of places like Manchester and Birmingham were run-down and struggling, but since then they have undergone a dramatic transformation and have become increasingly attractive locations for people to live and work in.” Britain has a distinct north-south economic divide, with the richer parts of the country lying below a line drawn from the Wash to the Severn estuary. London has been the fastest growing region over the past 20 years and led the way during the recovery from the deep recession of 2008-09, but the thinktank said the city centres expanding most rapidly were in parts of the country seeking to shake off their post-industrial hangovers. A separate report last week from Your Move – one of the UK’s biggest estate agency chains – showed that while property prices were falling in London they were rising in the north-west. The Centre for Cities warned that recovery in Manchester and elsewhere could be undermined by planning polices that prioritise residential development over commercial space in city centres. It said permitted development right, which allow commercial space to be converted for residential use without planning permission, posed a threat to commercial property needed to attract firms and jobs to city centres. The thinktank’s report recommended that the government should allow cities to exclude their centres from permitted development rights, and that cities should relax planning laws – including controlled development of green belt land – to allow more house building in other areas. “This urban renaissance has brought opportunities for people living across these cities and their surrounding areas, and it’s vital that it continues,” Carter said. “But for that to happen, cities need to take tough decisions on how to sustain the growth of their commercial centres, while also providing the homes their residents need.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/mar/27/italian-custard-tart-torta-della-nonna-recipe-rachel-roddy","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-27T11:00:05Z","webTitle":"A torta della nonna grandma’s tart recipe from Florence | Rachel Roddy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/mar/27/italian-custard-tart-torta-della-nonna-recipe-rachel-roddy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/mar/27/italian-custard-tart-torta-della-nonna-recipe-rachel-roddy","fields":{"headline":"Rachel Roddy’s Italian custard tart recipe","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"That making custard is said to require precision and skill and that said custard might impazzire (go crazy, ie split) are the two reasons I avoided making it for years. I stuck to my tin of Bird’s powder, which I liked even more once I learned from Simon Hopkinson that Mr Bird drove a custard-coloured Rolls Royce around town. But then I discovered a number of tricks that dispelled all those fears about making my own. First, it is perfectly acceptable – encouraged, even – to add a spoonful of flour; the custard equivalent of stabilisers on a bike. Second, once you have the hang of it, proportions of sugar and milk can be relaxed. And third, if it doesn’t thicken as it should, you can always melt some chocolate into the pan, to end up with something somewhere between a chocolate pud and one of those thick Italian hot chocolates you pay a fortune for at the bar at the top of the ski run. The custard today is for an Italian torta della nonna. Originally from Florence, torta della nonna – grandma’s tart – isn’t strictly an Easter treat, being found under the glass dome in trattorias alongside fruit salad, lasagne-sized tiramisu and crisscrossed jam crostata all year round. It nevertheless feels fitting at this time of year – symbolic even – its egg-rich custard scented with the eternally hopeful scent of lemon and a pine nut topping. First the pastry case, for which I suggest you use the recipe your fingers know best and the method of chilling and baking blind you are most comfortable with. I make a slightly sweetened shortcrust – 300g plain flour and 150g cold diced butter rubbed to breadcrumbs with cold hands, a pinch of salt, 80g sugar and two eggs added and everything brought into a dough, which is then wrapped and rested in the fridge for an hour. This quantity is more than enough for a 23cm tart, so you can make jam tarts the next day with what’s left, or stash it in the freezer for another year. Although not fussy, this tart is best with a crisp crust, so roll as thin as you dare, then line the tin with an overhang (to be snapped away once baked) and bake blind under a parchment circle weighted with beans until the pastry is the colour of a rich tea biscuit. When it comes to custard, recipes often suggest you begin in a bowl, but that means another thing to wash, so I whisk together five egg yolks and six tablespoons of sugar in a heavy-based saucepan off the heat. Once the mixture is pale and thick, stir in a heaped tablespoon of cornstarch or plain flour, then put the pan over a low heat and, little by little – and always whisking – add 600ml warm milk and the zest of an unwaxed lemon. Now comes the steady whisk, for about 10 minutes or so, over a low heat, so the mixture never so much as bubbles, until your custard is smooth, silky and thick enough to coat the back of a spoon. If it goes wrong, see the chocolate note above. Covered with cling-film, the custard will keep happily in the fridge for a couple of days. Otherwise, pour it directly into the tart case, then scatter over 50g pine nuts or flaked almonds that have been soaked in cold water for 10 minutes (a good way to stop hasty cooking). Bake at 180C/350F/gas 4 for 30 minutes, or until the custard is set and the pine nuts ever so slightly golden. Torta della nonna is better eaten when it is just warm, rather than hot, after Easter lunch – or any lunch for that matter. I think it is even better the next day, fridge-cold so the custard is set firm and fudgy, cut and eaten with no precision or skill but plenty of joy for Easter, or equinox, or simply for having made custard."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"us-news/shortcuts/2018/mar/20/vice-president-mike-pence-disappears-down-the-rabbit-hole","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-20T17:08:47Z","webTitle":"Vice-president Mike Pence disappears down the rabbit hole","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/shortcuts/2018/mar/20/vice-president-mike-pence-disappears-down-the-rabbit-hole","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/shortcuts/2018/mar/20/vice-president-mike-pence-disappears-down-the-rabbit-hole","fields":{"headline":"Vice-president Mike Pence disappears down the rabbit hole","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The nicest thing anyone can say about US vice-president Mike Pence – a man who vigorously opposed marriage equality and looks like an Action Man assembled from Play-Doh and cold cuts – is that he knows how to name a pet. Marlon Bundo is not only the first Botus (Bunny of the United States), but may be the first rabbit to: a) ride in Air Force Two; b) hold an official Instagram account that documents his every bemused lollop across a seemingly endless collection of Persian rugs; and c) have an unofficial Twitter account that reveals a much harder edge. “This is Harley after being swamped by a wave of liberal tears,” Bundo crowed in November, posting a photo of the Pences’ dog looking slightly damp. Now Marlon is also the first rabbit to inspire a political war via picture books. Marlon Bundo’s A Day in the Life of the Vice President, written by Pence’s daughter Charlotte and illustrated by his wife Karen, is a rather mild tale of a rabbit trailing Mike on his, as it turns out, rather boring average day (there are a lot fewer child sacrifices than you might think). But on Sunday, late-night TV host John Oliver announced that an alternative picture book, A Day in the Life of Marlon Bundo, by comedian Jill Twiss, would be coming out immediately – scooping the Pences’ book by a day – and would explore the rabbit’s struggle to marry a handsome bunny called Wesley. Armed with a much cuter picture book and an audio version narrated by Jim Parsons, John Lithgow and others, Twiss’s take on Bundo’s life was an immediate success, with physical copies selling out on Amazon immediately. The rabbit’s Twitter account, meanwhile, reacted as you might expect: poorly. A weird, loaded tweet objected that Bundo, “if he was gay”, would actually marry gay conservative pundit Chadwick Moore. (Jesus, Bundo.) In one fell swoop, that tweet perfectly encapsulated Pence’s attitude to sexuality and individual freedom: a dude marrying a dude is just as ridiculous as Bundo and Wesley, or Bundo and a very confused Moore. The disagreement has also inspired the kind of quality political dialogue we have come to expect: fighting in Amazon reviews. Oliver’s fans took en masse to giving the Pences’ book one-star reviews, while Pence’s fans counteracted with five-star reviews, with one pro-Pence Twitter user even calling on their comrades to “channel the Spirit of ’76 by ordering copies” of the book. That is presumably a reference to the 1776 American revolution, and not the 1990 David Cassidy film of the same name, but who knows? Either way, proceeds from Pence’s book go to a children’s cancer charity and a trafficking charity, and the money from Twiss’s to Aids United and the LGBTQ charity the Trevor Project. So perhaps, after all this shrieking into the void from our comfy filter bubbles, the world is a better place now.

That I would be myself – despite the artificial set-up – and enjoy meeting someone new. First impressions? He’s shorter than me.And yay, we’re both late! What did you talk about? Work, the weather, and how poorly educated we are when it comes to refined French foodie words. Any awkward moments? I felt physically awkward for much of the time – I couldn’t get to grips with my chair. Good table manners? His lobster-cracking skills were questionable. Best thing about Neville? His adventurous nature – he’s quite the explorer. Would you introduce him to your friends? Yes, although there might be an eyebrow raised, or two. Describe Neville in three words Nice, English, chappy. What do you think he made of you? Different; unexpected? Did you go on somewhere? It was a bitterly cold snowy evening so we headed straight for our trains home. And... did you kiss? That would have been awkward. If you could change one thing about the evening, what would it be? Less talk about work and more about the meaning of life. Marks out of 10? I’d say a 7. Would you meet again? Possibly, but as a potential chum. Neville on Lisa What were you hoping for? A good amount of chitchat, moderate to intermediate drinking and some flirting. First impressions? Very pretty; very cool hair. What did you talk about? Travelling, jobs, religion. Any awkward moments? On the contrary, there were some nice lulls in conversation while we took in the skyline. Good table manners? Superb. Best thing about Lisa? Engaging; good conversationalist. Would you introduce her to your friends? Drinking is the rock my friends and I orbit around and she doesn’t drink, so no. Describe Lisa in three words Spiritual, open, wholesome. What do you think she made of you? I hope she thought I was a sound dude. Did you go on somewhere? Nope. I had to dash for a train. And... did you kiss? Just a hug goodbye. If you could change one thing about the evening, what would it be? My palate isn’t sophisticated enough for the cognac I ordered with dessert. Marks out of 10? 8.5. Would you meet again? Our interests don’t really converge on the spiritual stuff and drinking, so no. Lisa and Neville ate at The Ivy Tower Bridge, London SE1. Fancy a blind date? Email blind.date@theguardian.com.

Already relentlessly reliable, the drivers believe the car is a step forward and the team are now favourites to equal Ferrari’s record of five consecutive drivers’ and constructors’ titles. Once again the team to beat. Lewis Hamilton (GB, aged 33) No44 Debut Australia 2007 Wins 62 Poles 72 Titles 4 Last season 1st Odds 4-6 At the top of his game and now only improving when presented with a challenge. Hugely comfortable with the team, he is motivated and still hungry for a fifth title to equal Juan Manuel Fangio. It will take a vigorous assault to stop him. Valtteri Bottas (Fin, 28) No77 Debut Australia 2013 Wins 3 Poles 4 Best finish 3rd Last season 3rd Odds 10-1 Still has much to prove. The Finn opened last season strongly but was soundly beaten by Hamilton thereafter. Now must show his pace and ability across the season to keep the seat. Putting Hamilton under pressure would be a major step. Ferrari Car SF71H Engine Ferrari Principal Maurizio Arrivabene Debut Monaco 1950 GPs 948 Titles 16 2017 2nd Have taken last year’s well-balanced car and adopted a new high-rake approach, which has still to prove itself. Have not moved on as far as Mercedes over the winter but retain strong balance through the corners. Potentially have much to come but may open slowly. Sebastian Vettel (Ger, 30) No5 Debut USA 2007 Wins 47 Poles 50 Titles 4 Last season 2nd Odds 4-1 A strong effort last season marred by costly moments of weakness. Still Ferrari’s No 1 driver but to challenge must be able to match Hamilton’s mental strength and flawless execution. Kimi Räikkönen (Fin, 38) No7 Debut Australia 2001 Wins 20 Poles 17 Titles 1 Last season 4th Odds 40-1 Wingman to Vettel. If Ferrari harbour any ambition for the constructors’ title (and Räikkönen’s retention suggests they do not) the Finn must be more consistent and less erratic. Red Bull Car RB14 Engine Renault Principal Christian Horner Debut Australia 2005 GPs 244 Titles 4 2017 3rd Brought a far more competitive car to testing and can expect to hit the ground running this season. Remain hampered by the Renault engine but are potentially closer to Mercedes than Ferrari. Early wins and solid reliability are crucial to back up a strong driver line-up. Daniel Ricciardo (Aus, 28) No3 Debut GB 2011 Wins 5 Poles 1 Titles 0 Best finish 3rd Last season 5th Odds 9-1 Has struggled to get on top of the higher grip and downforce of the new cars and although he outscored Verstappen last season was not as impressive as the youngster. Consistent and aggressive, can be fearsome if he puts it together. Max Verstappen (Neth, 20) No33 Debut Australia 2015 Wins 3 Poles 0 Best qualifying 2nd Titles 0 Best finish 5th Last season 6th Odds 11-2 Showed far greater maturity last season, especially dealing with some woeful unreliability and was mighty quick when he had the car under him. Fearless and unintimidated, a burgeoning and exceptional talent who will push to the limit against all comers. Force India Car VJM10 Engine Mercedes Principal Vijay Mallya, Robert Fernley Debut Australia 2008 GPs 191 Titles 0 Best finish 4th 2017 4th May struggle to punch above their weight as they have for the previous two seasons in a tense midfield. Currently focused on developing a strong mechanical platform for this year’s car. Upgrades arrive in Melbourne and subsequent deployment will dictate their real competitive level. Sergio Pérez (Mex, 28) No11 Debut Australia 2011 Wins 0 Best finish 2nd Poles 0 Best qualifying 4th Titles 0 Best finish 7th Last season 7th Odds 250-1 Has been crucial to his team’s recent success but faces real a battle with Ocon this year as both have a point to prove. Still harbours ambitions of another shot with a top team and putting his highly rated team-mate in the shade is the best way to do it. Esteban Ocon (Fr, 21) No31 Debut Belgium 2016 Wins 0 Best finish 5th Poles 0 Best qualifying 3rd Titles 0 Best finish 8th Last season 8th Odds 250-1 Now settled at Force India, the young Mercedes driver will expect to prove his worth and potential to replace Bottas at the senior team by roundly beating Pérez. If he stays out of trouble he should have the edge over his team-mate. Williams Car FW41 Engine Mercedes Principal Frank Williams Debut Spain 1977 GPs 666 Titles 9 2017 5th Adopted the most revolutionary approach on the grid with Paddy Lowe’s new design a drastic change from last year. Their ambitious plan has potential but it may take time to realise, especially given the inexperienced driver line-up. Lance Stroll (Can, 19) No18 Debut Australia 2017 Best finish 3rd Poles 0 Best qualifying 2nd Titles 0 Best finish 12th Last season 12th Odds 750-1 A solid rookie season was a riposte to some of the opprobrium he received for earning his place with his father’s dollars but now he knows the cars and tracks he has nowhere to hide. Sergey Sirotkin (Rus, 22) No35 Debut season Odds 500-1 Russian rookie also bringing cash to the seat but has impressed and now has a chance to prove himself. Technically adept, he has a degree in race car engineering. Beating Stroll and bringing on the new Williams would make a major impression. Renault Car RS18 Engine Renault Team principals Jerome Stoll, Cyril Abiteboul Debut GB 1977 GPs 341 Titles 2 2017 6th Now fully enjoying the resources a works team requires. Various new concepts on this year’s car will provide a challenge to bring it up to speed. Have focused on reliability first for the engine, with more power expected later. The second half of the season may indicate just how far the team has come and how far they are from the top three. Nico Hülkenberg (Ger, 30) No27 Debut Bahrain 2010 Wins 0 Best finish 4th Poles 1 Titles 0 Best finish 9th Last season 10th Odds 100-1 In his seventh season has perhaps the best chance yet to score his first podium and must perform strongly to reach the expectations of his ambitious team. The German enjoyed the grip of the new cars last year and now has a chance to exploit it and cement a long-term future with Renault. Carlos Sainz Jr (Sp, 23) No55 Debut Australia 2015 Wins 0 Best finish 4th Poles 0 Best qualifying 5th Titles 0 Best finish 9th Last season 9th Odds 125-1 Also eager to make his mark and Renault’s new car may prove to be just what the Spaniard wanted. He has shown flashes of great skill and undoubtedly has more to come. Toro Rosso Car STR13 Engine Honda Principal Franz Tost Debut Bahrain 2006 GPs 226 Titles 0 Best finish 6th 2017 7th New partnership with Honda has got off to a good start. Put in huge number of laps in testing, with Honda beginning to deliver reliability. If they can turn up the performance the team may be in for their best finish yet. Pierre Gasly (Fr, 22) No10 Debut Malyasia 2017 Wins 0 Best finish 12th Poles 0 Best qualifying 14th Titles 0 Best finish 21st Last season 21st Odds 1000-1 Red Bull-backed and highly rated, the Frenchman has won GP2 and stood up well to being parachuted into Toro Rosso at the end of last season. Has great potential. Brendon Hartley (NZ, 28) No28 Debut USA 2017 Wins 0 Best finish 13th Poles 0 Best qualifying 17th Titles 0 Best finish 23rd Last season 23rd Odds 1000-1 Despite being in his first full season in F1, Hartley is hugely experienced at high-level racing. With Porsche he has won the World Endurance Championship twice and the Le Mans 24 last year. Gasly may have the edge in pace but the New Zealander could prove invaluable in developing the car. Haas Car VF-18 Engine Ferrari Principal Guenther Steiner Debut Australia 2016 GPs 41 Titles 0 Best finish 8th 2017 8th Have the potential to threaten the bigger midfield teams, especially early in the season. Consistent and strong on single lap and long runs in testing, the car had pace and good balance. Could be the surprise package of the season. Romain Grosjean (Fr, 31) No8 Debut Europe 2009 Wins 0 Best finish 2nd Poles 0 Best qualifying 2nd Titles 0 Best finish 7th Last season 13th Odds 500-1 May benefit from confidence within the team that brake issues are behind them but as the senior driver he may also need to prove he can manage the anchors better by adjusting his style. Kevin Magnussen (Den, 25) No20 Debut Australia 2014 Wins 0 Best finish 2nd Poles 0 Best qualifying 4th Titles 0 Best finish 11th Last season 14th Odds 500-1 Another McLaren refugee looking to impress enough for a second shot at the top. Has settled well at Haas and could now assert himself over Grosjean and become the team leader. McLaren Car MCL33 Engine Renault Principal Eric Boullier Debut Monaco 1966 GPs 821 Titles 8 Highly optimistic of the new partnership with Renault but the team have much to do. The car looks good but was unreliable in testing with a range of issues. Under massive pressure, especially now the Honda money has gone, they must hope the worst is behind them and the upgrades for Melbourne will pay off. Failure will have major consequences. Fernando Alonso (Sp, 36) No14 Debut Australia 2001 Wins 32 Poles 22 Titles 2 Last season 15th Odds 25-1 Signed for another season on the basis that the team had a competitive engine but will not be pleased if compromised by reliability. Still wrestles more from a car than almost any other driver but wants a shot at podiums at least. Stoffel Vandoorne (Bel, 25) No2 Debut Bahrain 2016 Wins 0 Best finish 7th Poles 0 Best qualifying 7th Titles 0 Best finish 16th Last season 16th Odds 100-1 Escaped major scrutiny last year with the car so far off the pace but now has to impress. If he can match Alonso it would go far in answering critics. With Lando Norris being prepared to step up at McLaren, he needs to deliver. Sauber Car C37 Engine Ferrari Principal Frédéric Vasseur Debut South Africa 1993 GPs 441 Titles 0 Best 2nd as BMW 2017 10th Celebrated receiving this year’s Ferrari engine and the technical Alfa-branded relationship that goes with it with a raft of innovative aero ideas. However, they have yet to show any great effect. The car appears to lack grip and pace but the team, in the process of rebuilding, are optimistic they can unlock its potential. Marcus Ericsson (Swe, 27) No9 Debut Australia 2014 Wins 0 Best finish 8th Poles 0 Best qualifying 9th Titles 0 Best finish 18th Last season 20th Odds 2000-1 Faces his toughest test in the challenge from new team-mate Leclerc and is likely to be overshadowed. Ericsson brings finance but little else. Charles Leclerc (Mon, 20) No16 Debut season Odds 1500-1 Talented Ferrari junior driver comes hot from dominating F2 last season but now faces a testing rookie season in an uncompetitive car. Tipped as a replacement for Räikkönen, he is eager to make his mark and should do so, beginning with beating Ericsson."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/mar/20/yemen-arms-saudi-arabia","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-20T15:48:35Z","webTitle":"Britain and the US must stop fuelling the bloody Saudi war on Yemen | Patrick Wilcken","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/20/yemen-arms-saudi-arabia","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/20/yemen-arms-saudi-arabia","fields":{"headline":"Britain and the US must stop fuelling the bloody Saudi war on Yemen","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The end of this week marks three tragedy-filled years for the people of Yemen, who have suffered from the Saudi-led military coalition’s devastating – and often indiscriminate – bombing of their country. Fleets of fighter jets, the bulk from Saudi Arabia itself, have wreaked havoc on an impoverished country, with thousands of airstrikes on targets including hospitals, markets, homes, factories and funeral halls. Thousands of civilians have been killed, thousands more horribly injured. Collapsed infrastructure, coupled with a partial blockade, have deprived most of the population of clean water and proper healthcare, unleashing the worst cholera outbreak in modern history. Despite all this, western countries, led by the US and the UK, have supplied the Saudi-led coalition with huge amounts of advanced military equipment, facilitating a military campaign characterised by repeated violations of international humanitarian law, including possible war crimes. This conflict has revealed in the starkest possible terms the real cost of the lucrative global arms trade, not to mention the challenge of implementing the UN arms trade treaty. Beyond the US and the UK, many other countries – including France, Spain and Italy – profess their support for human rights and adherence to the treaty while similarly lavishing hi-tech weaponry on the Saudi coalition. However, on this grim anniversary for Yemen there are glimmers of hope. Across the world vocal criticism from campaigners, journalists and, crucially, some politicians has begun to bear fruit. In recent months, under growing public pressure, a host of European countries have suspended arms transfers to the Saudi coalition. In other countries where arms exports have continued, they are coming under intense scrutiny, with court challenges and growing criticism from parliamentarians and the wider public. It’s just possible the tide may be turning. In Greece, there was a storm of protest in December when news emerged of a deal to send 300,000 tank shells to Saudi Arabia. Amid mounting pressure, led by Amnesty Greece, a parliamentary committee broke with precedent and cancelled the deal. In Finland, when images surfaced in January of the United Arab Emirates, a key Saudi coalition member, using a Finnish-made Patria armoured vehicle for combat operations in Yemen, there was public uproar. News that Finland had granted a licence for spare Patria parts prompted most candidates in the recent Finnish elections – including the president – to speak out about arming the UAE. Norway announced in the same month that it was suspending exports of lethal military goods to the UAE (it had already stopped supplying Saudi Arabia), citing the risk of misuse in Yemen. Austria, the Netherlands and Belgium’s Flemish region have repeatedly denied licences for arms sales to Saudi Arabia. The really big news, though, was the decision by Germany’s incoming coalition to suspend future licences for arms transfers to countries directly engaged in the Yemen conflict. After years of concerted pressure from civil society, journalists and some key politicians, one of the world’s major arms manufacturers has finally drawn the line. It remains to be seen how robust this stance will be – in the past arms suspensions have often been short-lived and reversed when the pressure abates – and, crucially, goods under current deals will still be shipped. But it’s another sign that opponents of these reckless arms sales are beginning to gain traction. Meanwhile, pressure is growing elsewhere as well. In the UK, public opinion and all opposition parties support an end to arming Saudi Arabia. Much of the outcry over Mohammed bin Salman’s recent visit to London focused on this. Dismayed at the government’s unwillingness to halt its vast arms sales to Saudi Arabia, campaigners took the UK to court, arguing that the government breached its own – and international – laws. It is disappointing that their case was lost (the government won on the grounds that its licensing decisions were “rational” given the evidence being assessed, notwithstanding that much of it had been provided by the Saudis themselves), but efforts are under way to appeal. In the US, impassioned speeches in the Senate accompanied a vote last June to block the transfer of $510m of precision-guided munitions and related services to Riyadh. The vote was lost by an unprecedentedly narrow margin of 47-53. Meanwhile, a new Senate resolution invoking the 1973 War Powers Act seeks to remove US logistical and intelligence support for the Saudi-led coalition’s Yemen campaign on the basis that it amounts to US involvement in a war never authorised by Congress. And in Canada, France, Italy and Spain we are seeing a flurry of challenges to arms supplies to the coalition – including court cases, activism and intense public debate. A growing legal and moral quandary now faces European supplier countries that still pour weapons into the bloody conflict. Under the UN arms trade treaty, they have an obligation to halt the supply of weapons if these are likely to be used for serious violations of international human rights or humanitarian law. The US, as a signatory, has pledged not to undermine the treaty’s object and purpose, which includes “reducing human suffering” – a commitment mocked by the current desperate situation on the ground in Yemen. As Yemen enters another gruelling year of hunger, disease and war, with more than 20 million of its people now in need of humanitarian aid, the moral and legal bankruptcy of western support for the Saudi-led coalition has never been clearer. A growing number of countries have recognised the risk of ever-greater complicity in the mounting violations and likely war crimes being committed in Yemen. It’s time for the Saudi coalition’s remaining arms suppliers to follow suit and end their Faustian pact over weapons and Yemen. • Patrick Wilcken is Amnesty International arms control and human rights researcher"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"fashion/2018/apr/06/platform-shoes-claes-bang-fashion-trends","type":"article","sectionId":"fashion","sectionName":"Fashion","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-06T11:00:31Z","webTitle":"From platforms to Claes Bang: this week’s fashion trends","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2018/apr/06/platform-shoes-claes-bang-fashion-trends","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/fashion/2018/apr/06/platform-shoes-claes-bang-fashion-trends","fields":{"headline":"From platforms to Claes Bang: this week’s fashion trends","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Going up GHDs Seen backstage at Alexander McQueen to straighten floor-length fringing.

Police have sent an extra 4,000 officers on to the streets and diplomats have called for an end to “tribal rhetoric” after at least five violent incidents involving beatings, stone-throwing and arson, and after politicians had criticised voters for “regionalism” – seen as a euphemism for tribalism – in deciding how to vote. The main opposition, the Sierra Leone People’s party (SLPP), won slightly more votes than the ruling All People’s Congress (APC) in the first round of a historically peaceful election on 7 March and the two parties have been trying to win over voters ahead of the runoff next week, causing growing tension in the west African country. After the presidential spokesman Abdulai Baratay suggested on state radio last week that more SLPP supporters than APC ones had voted along tribal lines – language he later denied using – there was an increase in the number of violent incidents. The APC candidate, Samura Kamara, said that supporters of the SLPP candidate, Julius Maada Bio, had thrown stones at him and that when he stopped at a bar en route to a rally last week they burned it down shortly after he had left. Police confirmed that there had been street brawls between supporters of the APC and the SLPP in the capital, Freetown, and that candidates from both sides had had their houses and cars set on fire by “youths”. Ibrahim Tawa Conteh, who won an SLPP seat in west Freetown, said that he had been attacked twice while campaigning but the police had stood by and done nothing, even after he had taken a suspect to the police station. “The police made no arrests and I was smuggled out of the station in police uniform so no one would recognise me,” he said. “As I’m talking to you now I can’t come out, I’m in hiding. I’m struggling to get my family out because I’ve heard rumours they’re going to make an attempt on my home today. “I’m so scared for myself and my family and I don’t know what is going to happen next. I fear that they’re just going to keep coming until I’m dead.” Pa Alhaji, an APC politician in east Freetown, said that opposition youths had stormed his compound on Sunday and attempted to burn down his house. Black streaks from the fire stretched up the side of the building and his car was a burnt-out shell. “They poured fuel on my front door and lit it on fire, and completely demolished my car,” he said. “I believe they did this because my building has been a centre for party operations during the election. We’ve done trainings, campaign organising, distributed election supplies. “This is a political issue. We’ve definitely been targeted for our party support.” Many of Sierra Leone’s ruling party supporters come from northern districts, while the largest percentage of opposition supporters live in the south. Some members of the two largest ethnic groups, the Temnes and the Mendes, have quietly claimed regional discrimination during their respective turns as the opposition, but serious regional divides have been outwardly dormant since the country’s 11-year civil war ended in 2002. “The battle lines have now been drawn and you’re either red or green, north or south,” said Derrik Gbla, an APC supporter in east Freetown. “You’re either with us or against us. You don’t have a fence to stand on now.” Ethnicity was not a widely discussed issue in the six months leading up to the first round of voting. “Party members feed their fellow supporters with information, and they are bound to take what they hear to heart, but there has been little [tribalistic] talk out in the open,” said MB Kamara, head of Sierra Leone’s criminal investigations department. “When people are desperate to make a point they’re going to use whatever channels are available to them, including intimidation.” But the presidential spokesman accused of triggering the incidents by criticising southerners for how they voted said that he “would never talk about tribe” and that the issue he had raised was very different. “I have studied the Rwandan genocide and know the trouble with that,” said Baratay. “What I was talking about was regionalism, which people often get confused with tribe here.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2018/mar/20/who-do-you-think-you-are-usa-review-monica-courteney-cox-ancestors","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-20T22:00:11Z","webTitle":"Who Do You Think You Are?

USA review – the one where Monica goes in search of her ancestors","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The one where Monica goes to England and finds she’s related to the Queen. Or should be the Queen, maybe. Courteney Cox would take either. At home in California, she jokes: “I hope I’m from Buckingham Palace.” Pronounced the American way: Bucking Ham Palace. She also hopes that her ancestors made a mark, though maybe not by murdering anyone. Let’s see … Going up her mum’s side there’s a bit of light incest but nothing too serious, and she’s related to a lot of people in Virginia. Never mind them, though, who was the first to come to the US? I don’t think Courteney is Native American is she? No, here’s Thomas Ligon (1623-1675), Courteney’s great x nine grandfather, who came to Virginia from War Wickshire, England. She’s one of us. So she’s on a plane to the old country to meet Nick the genial genealogist, the first of several scholarly British chaps who spend their lives deep in dusty old records and are clearly rather excited to have Monica from Friends in the house. He rolls out some extra charm and attentiveness, helps with the Latin and a bit of gentle pronunciation correction: Berkeley (as in Central Park not Central Perk). That’s a name in Courteney’s family that gets Nick excited because it’s an aristocratic name. Courteney’s excited, too. “Wow, I like it,” she says. Then it’s off to the family pile, Berkeley Castle in Gloucestershire – a proper one “with a moat and those little windows where you can kill people”, Courteney confirms. It was built by Thomas de Berkeley, Courteney’s great x 18 grandfather. From there it all goes a bit Danny Dyer, without question the greatest WDYTYA of all time. Thomas de Berkeley held Edward II prisoner here, in 1327. And a great x 19 grandfather of Courteney’s, Roger Mortimer, was effectively ruling the country, as well as shagging the king’s missus, Queen Isabella. Edward was killed, possibly suffocated, although one account has a hollow instrument thrust into his fundament. Youch. “Why not just suffocate him?” asks Courteney. Where’s the fun in that? Whodunnit? Almost certainly one of her rellies, possibly both. Later they would be tried in Westminster. Well “tried”; Roger was bound and gagged, so he couldn’t say anything, his guilt already decided, then drawn and hanged. Thomas de B was acquitted, luckily, or Friends wouldn’t have happened the way we know it and Cougar Town probably wouldn’t have happened at all, not that the latter would matter much. Oh, and this other chap in this picture here, being put to a very unpleasant death, his privates chopped off and tossed into the fire? That’s Hugh Despenser, another great x 18 grandfather, executed on the orders of Roger Mortimer. Cox hoped her ancestors made a mark, although maybe not by murdering anyone, remember? Well, they didn’t just murder anyone, they murdered the king, and each other. Then they married each other and ran the country. I think it’s safe to say they made a mark. “You think they make that stuff up in Game of Thrones but they really don’t,” says Courteney. “We were doing it right there with the old great grandparents.” It might not attain Danny Dyer levels of hilarity, because Courteney Cox doesn’t get so carried away with her meteoric rise through the strata of English society, but she is entertaining and amusing in a more understated way. “Thank you, Parliament,” she says, on realising that Thomas de Berkeley’s acquittal also clears her to exist. As Danny D found out, once you’re in it’s not hard to go higher still. Or once you’ve found a genealogist who can get you into these kinds of levels of society, it’s not hard to find another who can take you back a little further to get you to the top. That’s where Courteney’s headed. At the College of Arms she meets her great x 20 grandfather, Edward I. From there it’s easy: great x 25 grandfather: Henry I. So her great x 26 grandfather is William the Bastard. You could point out that Courteney Cox has many great x 26 grandparents (268,435,456, I think, although of course some of them must be the same person, as that’s roughly the population of the world in 1066). So one of them is bound to be if not William I then at least someone. Or, going the other way, he has a hell of a lot of direct descendants. But that would make you a spoilsport. This is the one where Monica goes to London and finds out she’s William the Conquerer’s great x 26 granddaughter. And the only downside is that it also means ... she’s Danny Dyer’s cousin."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"travel/2018/mar/25/madeira-winter-sun-early-spring-getaway","type":"article","sectionId":"travel","sectionName":"Travel","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-25T06:00:45Z","webTitle":"Younger at heart: Madeira’s makeover","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2018/mar/25/madeira-winter-sun-early-spring-getaway","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/travel/2018/mar/25/madeira-winter-sun-early-spring-getaway","fields":{"headline":"Younger at heart: Madeira’s makeover","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"‘Time to off-road,” says Pedro, our jeep driver and guide for the day. It’s the most enthusiastic he’s been all morning; his 4x4 Land Rover is built for it after all, and he isn’t remotely worried that we’re stuck in mud with our back wheels hanging over the edge of the track. “Are we going to fall down the mountain?” asks my seven-year-old, her knuckles white. “We’ll be fine,” I tell her, as Pedro accelerates over a fallen log and hurtles up a steep hill in search of another panoramic view. We’re about 1,500m above sea level and close to Madeira’s rugged north coast; mist clings to volcanic peaks further above us. The air is humid, heavy with the scent of eucalyptus and many metres below us are terrace after terrace of banana trees, fringed with sugar cane and palm trees. So far it’s more Malaysia than Madeira, subtropical and lush with waterfalls, lagoons and colourful vegetation. A few days before, I’d been told to expect a relaxing but possibly boring experience – a package-holiday crowd, sedate teas and sweet cake. “It’s nice, but full of old people,” a friend told me, who’d visited years ago. “I stayed in a lovely hotel and two pensioners had died by the end of the week. They had to ship them off the island.” But no more, apparently. Madeira is in the midst of a makeover. According to its tourist board, the island is drawing a younger traveller in search of adrenaline-fuelled adventure. Thanks to the mountainous terrain, it’s ideal for trail running, downhill biking, canyoning and abseiling. Then there’s the walking: following the levada trails is the best way to enjoy the views, a network of narrow irrigation canals built as far back as the 16th century to bring water from the mountains to the farmland below. Our attempt at a levada walk is curtailed after 20 minutes when black clouds roll down from the mountains and we’re caught in fog and rain. “It’s four seasons in one day here,” says Pedro. Fifteen minutes later, the rain stops and we’re sitting in Pólo Norte, a rustic restaurant near the village of Porto Moniz with stunning sea views. Pedro insists we try the Madeiran speciality – filete de espada com banana, battered fish crowned with buttery baked banana, a combination that shouldn’t work but is strangely delicious. Afterwards, we visit a volcanic beach nearby, with sand like coal dust; the grey clouds roll away and the Atlantic turns turquoise in the sun. Despite Madeira’s infamous microclimates, it rarely falls below 19C in winter and by the end of our pre-spring stay we are slapping on sunscreen by the pool. But we’re not here to sunbathe; it’s adrenaline action we’re after. The next day, this comes in the form of a whale trip. The deep waters around Madeira are plankton-rich and safe; the perfect environment for whales and dolphins all year round. My seven-year-old is scared of whales and I’m increasingly nervous as dry land disappears and the sky turns as dark as the sea. We head towards the endless horizon, Madeira shrinking behind us and the wind whips up. They stop the engine and my heart sinks; the Atlantic is oily and muscular, its swell pushing against the sides of our catamaran, waves crashing over the sides. But then we spot them in the water and our moods switch. My daughter is no longer afraid of something she can see in its natural habitat, rather than a model on display in the Natural History Museum. Anyway, she’s too distracted by a group of dolphins circling us, followed by four sleek black short-finned whales, including a mother and baby, skimming through the waves. Heading back to Funchal, Madeira’s capital, we speed past the elegant seafront hotels built out over volcanic rocks with fabulous ocean views. I begin to realise that what I thought would be a massive downside – Madeira’s lack of beaches – is actually its crowning glory. Without a shoreline as a buffer, the Atlantic confronts you at every angle, wild and elemental, an arm’s reach away. Nowhere more so than the creamy and curvaceous Vidamar Resort Hotel where, sitting on my sleek glass balcony, I feel like I’m on board a liner that’s drifted out to sea. It isn’t a hotel room but more a spacious two-bed apartment that I could happily move into. But it’s the views that make it: steel blue everywhere you look. Who needs sand when just below you there are two terraced infinity pools tipping into the ocean? Later that evening, we make a pilgrimage to the island’s iconic hotel, Reid’s, a faded pink pile high on the rocks which has been around since 1891 with a roll-call of former guests including Winston Churchill and George Bernard Shaw. I’m too late for its famous afternoon tea on the terrace and opt instead for the island’s favourite tipple, a Poncha: a cloying and heady mix of sugar cane liqueur, honey, orange and lemon juice, served in their art deco cocktail bar. It’s a different world here and, watching the slow but decorous waiters serving Fawlty Towers-style majors in blazers, I wonder if our taste of adventure has run its course. Apparently not, according to our guide the next day. There’s a cable-car ride to the hilltop village of Monte over the rooftops of Funchal with a return trip that’s much more thrilling – a wicker toboggan ride through the narrow streets (waxed by hand to increase our speed), which is how villagers used to transport their goods, with two “drivers” in traditional boaters to guide us. Like a fairground ride, we’re thrown around at speed, screaming with delight all the way down the hill. We end up in Funchal’s old town, which is much more characterful than the hotel developments that spread out from the centre. Most of the bars and restaurants run along Rua Santa Maria, where tables spill out on to narrow cobbles. We stop at Galeria Restaurante for its recommended asparagus risotto and explore the maze of narrow streets beyond, where all the doors are painted with colourful murals as part of an art project to revitalise what used to be a rundown area: difficult to believe now. Back at Vidamar Resort, we recline on our king-size bed, doors open on to the Atlantic, watching 1980s films on cable (Pretty Woman followed by Ghost) and I can’t remember the last time I felt so relaxed. As we fall asleep, music drifts up from a nearby hotel bar: the unmistakable croon of Frank Sinatra’s You Make Me Feel So Young. So much for old-school Madeira – I couldn’t put it better myself.

For a bit of relaxation, try Furnas Boutique Hotel, a wellness retreat up in the hills that has thermal indoor and outdoor pools. • Double rooms start from about £82, furnasboutiquehotel.com El Hierro The smallest of the Canary islands, El Hierro is also possibly the least well known. It is wild and remote, and enjoys a similar temperate climate to the rest of the Canaries. Its capital, Villa de Valverde, has about 1,800 inhabitants (the island’s total population is under 11,000), so there are no hotel developments – only a few quiet bars and simple restaurants. While the coastline is rugged and windswept, the landscape inland is more verdant with gentle rolling hills and juniper forests, making it ideal for walkers.

I’ve been waiting for a fertility clinic to accidentally defrost its embryos ever since I was invited to see one London egg bank’s storage tanks, and said, out loud to the nurse: “Surely not?” On 4 March, two tanks at two fertility clinics in America malfunctioned. At the clinic in Cleveland an alarm sounded to indicate low liquid nitrogen levels, but nobody heard. At the clinic in San Francisco (where patients pay $600 a year for storage alone, with many encouraged to do so by packages offered by their employers in tech, Facebook and Apple), an embryologist noticed low levels during a check, so quickly moved the eggs and embryos, stacked invisibly in fine, long straws, a little like the ones you can buy at the fair with sherbet in, to another tank. The clinics are yet to discover whether any have been damaged. Across the US, hundreds of people are waiting to find out if their plans for a family have melted, too, if their investments, both soul and cash, have been squandered. “It’s really quite sad the samples weren’t split up,” one expert said, discussing the clinics’ common method of filing patients’ embryos together, rather than across different tanks. “They were literally putting all the eggs in one basket.” On the news, the malfunctions were described in the language of earthquakes, or flood – a “fertility disaster”. “Surely not?” I said, looking around at the tanks that were kicking about at our feet, these small metal barrels, hairy with wires. In London, it was a supply cupboard, of the sort traditionally used to store buckets for accidents, or reams of toilet paper, or perhaps pens. And there were some of these things here, too, alongside the eggs, shelves of binders, a system, but it was the casualness of the place, like a backstage afterthought, that shocked me into a fantasy of catastrophe. By that point I’d spoken to many of the women who had saved small fortunes, taken the drugs, dealt with the hormones, sat down and plotted their lives on paper like a “choose your own adventure” story, succumbed to the egg harvesting “procedure” and its series of mild perils, in order to purchase a home to freeze their distant hopes in these metal tanks, on this cupboard floor. And the risks, as they stood, were defined starkly. The biggest risk reported was that it might not work. That this whole thing was so new that only a tiny proportion of women had unfrozen and implanted their eggs, and gone on to have a healthy child. Still, with this knowledge, more and more people (people with the cash, as well as the hunger) were choosing to take that risk. But the other risks, the ones that clinicians are not trained to debate, these conversations being above most doctors’ pay grade, are complex and answerless. There is the risk that, even after planning for a family so meticulously that you willingly inject yourself daily with hormones, and splay your legs monthly for a dildocam broadcasting to a room of strangers, you will end up alone. Some people will surely relish that independence, and feel comfortable buying donor sperm and bringing a kid up alone; most prefer someone to parent with, and this is one of the unsayable risks that also kicks about in these fertility clinics. The risk that hetero dating culture will continue to insist on a degree of dishonesty, so chucking all responsibility for fertility into the hands (and wallet) of the woman, meaning the only plan she is really able to make becomes a painful plan to pay to delay. And then there is this – the risk that even after all those concerns have been considered and annotated, the facilities themselves are flawed. Of course they are. What tank, really, is capable of containing not just one hope, not just one person’s 20-year plan, of birthday cakes and grazed knees and the profundity of being needed, but hundreds of them, in long sherbet straws? Standing in that room I was inside a metaphor. Every tank contained a thousand conversations, about desire and lack, and frozen expectations of what a life should look like. Every tank contained not just the promise of a return on these women’s wobbly investments, the price of a small car in which they could have escaped, but the promise of change – of being rescued from uncertainty, the promise of a life like their parents’, the promise of sleeplessness, debt, fear, love, the promise of adulthood, grief, someone to hold in the night. The promise that the life these women had pictured for themselves would one day open for them like a pop-up book, and into it they’d gratefully fall, because this is what people do, right, and because these women, too, are people. Then, in their clinic, the beep of an alarm echoing impotently, the tanks’ contents started to melt, that unheard alarm a reminder of how new this is, how new we are, how many questions they have left to answer. Including, “What now?” What the hell now?

The one immortalised by BBC meteorologist Michael Fish assuring people that no hurricane was on the way? The one that went on to develop 115mph winds, felling 15 million trees across the UK, including six of the seven iconic oaks of Sevenoaks? Thankfully storms like this are rare, but a new study reveals that we’re likely to see more of them as the planet warms. The Great Storm was both a “weather bomb” and a “sting jet”. Weather bombs are classified as storms where the air pressure drops by more than 24 millibars within 24 hours, whilst sting jets are blasts of air that accelerate as they plummet, generating powerful surface winds and localised gusts. Oscar Martinez-Alvarado from the University of Reading, and colleagues used a climate model to simulate extreme storms both now and by 2100. Their results, published in Environmental Research Letters, show that if greenhouse gases continue to rise then the chances of North Atlantic storms becoming weather bombs with sting jets more than doubles. “We think that larger atmospheric moisture content is the reason behind the increase,” writes Martinez Alvarado in the Department of Meteorology blog. “Increased numbers of storms would wreak havoc on people’s lives and leave Britain facing a spiralling clean-up bill.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"global-development/2018/apr/02/solve-aid-sector-crisis-dont-employ-expats-dfid-amar-international","type":"article","sectionId":"global-development","sectionName":"Global development","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-02T08:00:06Z","webTitle":"How to solve the aid sector crisis?

Don’t employ expats","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"I can guarantee that the charity I have been running in Iraq for the past 26 years will not be embarrassed by the shocking behaviour of our expat staff, as recently highlighted in the press. We don’t have any expat staff. I founded Amar International to help the many thousands of Iraqis maimed by chemical weapons, the Marsh Arabs forced into tented exile in Iran, and the countless other victims of Saddam Hussein’s genocidal regime. Every school, health clinic and training centre has been built and staffed by Iraqis – Arab or Kurd, Muslim, Christian and Yazidi. The 2,000-strong indigenous team has helped victims of the subsequent wars, invasions and inter-community strife. Amar’s work is run in exactly the way the Department for International Development (DfID) believes is best: locally built, managed and sustainable. But we have received only a derisory £15,000 – years ago – from the UK’s aid budget. Which is, frankly, outrageous. Our Iraqi team believes the absence of expats is good for them, their development and our image, yet it leaves us on the outside. Over two decades, the rise of massive global NGOs has mirrored the corporate world. DfID distributes a staggering £13.4bn a year – and these huge charities have become hooked on their bumper annual fix of aid money. The word “charity” comes from the Latin caritas – to love, to serve and care for others in their hour of need. It is very different from the self-perpetuating aid industry, with its well-paid professionals who behave almost as an occupying army. At Amar International we show the effectiveness of a small, worldwide organisation feeding money and support to indigenous professionals. DfID claims it meets government procurement targets to give a third of contracts to small organisations. But the truth is, most British aid is distributed among the biggest suppliers. In the past, we have been advised not to bid for any aid projects of less than £10m, because that was too small to be worth monitoring by DfID and the UN. But Amar’s annual turnover is usually half that, and we work incredibly hard to raise money and ensure that 92% goes directly to the work in the field. It’s not just us – most small charities are excluded from DfID provision. Yet it is these organisations that are most effective, cause least cultural dislocation, recognise corruption better and work at significantly lower cost. Surely it’s healthy for competition and innovation to share opportunities between a wide group of organisations? The aid budget is now so large, there is a case for competition and market authority for the sector. It would be interesting to examine the interchange between top charity executives, government and DfID appointments – to review how many civil servants have worked for NGOs and vice versa – to ensure we are not dealing with an aid cartel. Amar focuses from the start on the training of internally displaced people and refugees to ensure they are able to provide for themselves as soon the opportunity arises. We use aid to train and develop skills and entrepreneurship, and to invest in local firms that can help reconstruct destroyed infrastructure. We call on DfID to refocus its resources away from long-term handouts to displaced people and refugees, which encourages dependency, and towards investment in businesses that will help countries improve prosperity and employment. Poverty and having nothing to do can create conflict in the first place. The solution to many of the world’s problems is to enable development of local people’s own efforts, rather than keeping them hostage to NGOs. Over the past decade, Amar has delivered more than 4m medical consultations, 662,000 vaccinations and more than 2m visits by women trained to be health volunteers. Our facilities include a soon-to-be completed maternity hospital, two schools, six primary healthcare centres – five of which are inside camps for internally displaced people – 10 kindergartens, and football pitches. We have royal approval – Prince Charles is our patron. But with a bit of government help, we could do much more. The US government and the EU supports our work, so why don’t the British? We need more support for smaller charities, more transparency in the bidding process, and a focus on small-scale, but sustainable, economic intervention. I have spent a lifetime helping the dispossessed and the poor, so I’m the last person to knock overseas aid. However, it’s not how much you give, it’s how wisely and how well that money is spent.

That was the good news from official data showing that the government’s preferred measure of the annual increase in the cost of living dropped from 3% in January to 2.7% in February. The bad news for homeowners worried about having to pay more to service their mortgages is that the easing of inflationary pressure may not influence the Bank’s monetary policy committee’s decision all that much. The Bank still wants to raise rates and could do so as soon as May. Threadneedle Street always thought the Brexit-influenced spike in inflation was likely to prove temporary. Sterling fell on the foreign exchanges after the Brexit vote in June 2016 and over the next year dearer imports led to the CPI measure of inflation rising from 0.5% to 2.6%. In the second half of 2017, inflation briefly topped 3%. But the annual inflation rate assesses what has been happening to prices over the latest 12-month period and as a new month comes in an old month drops out. The months that are now dropping out – in early 2017 – were when the effects of a weaker pound were most marked. Of more concern to the Bank is the state of the labour market. It believes an unemployment rate of 4.4% – only marginally above its lowest since the mid-1970s – is starting to put upward pressure on wages. Earnings growth has been creeping up and before too long earnings will be increasing more quickly than prices. The sharper than expected fall in inflation means the return to rising real incomes will occur sooner and that will mean stronger growth and – from the MPC’s perspective – the threat of higher wage inflation. While there has been little in recent economic data to justify a May increase in rates, earnings data will be crucial. If the annual increase edges closer to 3%, a spring rise will be a real possibility."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"fashion/2018/mar/20/totally-mexico-how-fashion-stole-frida-kahlo","type":"article","sectionId":"fashion","sectionName":"Fashion","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-20T17:06:09Z","webTitle":"Totally Mexico: how fashion stole Frida Kahlo","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2018/mar/20/totally-mexico-how-fashion-stole-frida-kahlo","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/fashion/2018/mar/20/totally-mexico-how-fashion-stole-frida-kahlo","fields":{"headline":"Totally Mexico: how fashion stole Frida Kahlo","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Frida Kahlo is wearing a long, tiered cotton skirt, teamed with a high-necked, ruffled blouse. The photographer has crouched at ground level to take the shot so that she looms larger than life in the frame, the defiant uptilt of her chin emphasised. She holds a vintage embroidered scarf, but bears it above her head in a way to suggest holding a banner or a flag rather than seeking shade or modesty. That portrait appeared in American Vogue in 1937, but everything about the look – the silhouette, embellishment, hairstyle, attitude – would work on the magazine’s pages today. Eighty-one years after that first Vogue appearance – and 64 years after her death – Frida Kahlo is this year’s It girl. In June, her wardrobe will be seen outside Mexico for the first time as part of Frida Kahlo: Making Herself Up, a major V&amp;A exhibition about the image of the most iconic female artist in history. She is the muse for several designers this spring, including Roland Mouret and the New York label Cushnie et Ochs. To mark International Women’s Day, Mattel released a Frida Barbie, one of a new collection depicting inspirational women. This, then, is a proud feminist moment in which fashion is – finally! – glorifying a woman of substance as well as style. But, wait – is her depiction as a glossy style icon a disrespectful and distasteful makeover of a woman who challenged societal expectations of women by, among other things, emphasising her striking unibrow with a Revlon eye pencil in “Ebony”? Kahlo is a poster girl for our age because her image represents a drive toward female self-determination. Unless her oeuvre is being reduced to flower crowns in gift shops, symbolic of pop culture repackaging feminism into sugary blandness? Which is it? Kahlo is the only female artist whose own image is instantly recognisable all over the world. Susana Martinez Vidal wrote a book about Kahlo’s style, “attracted by the fact that a half-Indigenous woman, who didn’t belong to a first-world country, who wasn’t in showbusiness (she wasn’t an actress, singer or dancer) managed to become one of the most iconic women of the 20th century, next to Marilyn Monroe, Jackie Kennedy and Maria Callas”. Kahlo’s image is almost cartoonishly bold, yet draws on a complex set of references. Mexican and European elements are mixed, as are male and female. Her disabilities, a legacy of childhood polio and a road accident, are sometimes on show, sometimes hidden away. The iconography of her self image is unique and utterly compelling. Madonna, whose passion for collecting Kahlo’s work raised both her prices and profile, feels a connection. “I’m not at all sure that fashion has glamourised or sanitised [Kahlo],” counters Circe Henestrosa, curator of the V&amp;A exhibition. “I think she was incredibly glamorous and sophisticated already.” In 1939, Kahlo’s visit to Paris inspired Elsa Schiaparelli to design the Madame Rivera dress in her image. Kahlo loved to shop for clothes, revelling in colour and fabric; she was always strikingly made up. Her self-portraits are decorative, but never fussy. Like any great brand, she has an image that is almost childlike in its simplicity. The flowers in her hair become a crown, a motif that runs from politics to fairytales. Diego Rivera, who as a muralist was no slouch when it came to semaphoring visual messages, likened his wife’s famous eyebrows to hummingbird wings; they are as much a part of Kahlo as the swoosh is to Nike. It is a shame she wasn’t around for Instagram. She would have been a dab hand with a selfie and a provocative caption. “You cannot separate Frida from her work. The two are inextricably linked,” says Carly Cushnie, one half of the design duo Cushnie et Ochs, who dedicated this season’s collection to Kahlo. “Her personality and spirit speak through her paintings. She’s inviting you into her mind.” She is so intimately associated with the clothes she wore that staff at the Blue House in Mexico City, where her clothes are now displayed, have come to believe that the brocade skirts and embroidered shawls get heavier after dark, and to infer from this that her spirit comes back to possess them. A rawness which has kept Kahlo vivid in the culture for almost a century makes her now seem more relevant than ever. She is “the very embodiment ... of a society obsessed with tearing down the walls of the private self”, says Henestrosa. “To channel Frida isn’t about copying a print, or putting her face on a T-shirt,” says Roland Mouret, whose spring 2018 collection was inspired by how Kahlo “deviated from the traditional depiction of female beauty in art and instead chose to paint the raw and honest experiences that so many women face.” A collection in tribute to Kahlo, he says, “has to be about who she was as a woman. Her spirit, the way she never accepted defeat. She resonates to me because I enjoy dressing women who love to be women, and Frida would not allow society to stop her enjoying her life as a woman, to stop her from portraying herself as womanly when her body was broken.” His curvy siren dresses might seem at odds with Kahlo’s aesthetic, but the point, he says, is that “when a woman wears my clothes, you don’t look at her ass or her tits. You look in her eyes.” The second coming of Frida began in 1983, when Hayden Herrera’s biography raised her pop cultural profile. Fifteen years later, Jean Paul Gaultier’s spring 1998 collection was an eye-popping visual cocktail of Kahlo and Marilyn Manson. (You know you have truly arrived as a fashion reference when you get juxtaposed against a contrasting look on the first sentence of a sheet of show notes.) Salma Hayek brought Frida to the cinema in her 2002 biopic; in 2004, a room of her personal belongings, which had been sealed since her death, was opened, and its contents put on display at the Blue House – it is a real coup for the V&amp;A to be able to borrow this collection. Riccardo Tisci’s couture collection for Givenchy in autumn 2010 had floor-length red-carpet dresses with the bones of the spine and rib cage picked out in bugle bead embroidery, which the designer said was a tribute to the plastercast corsets Kahlo wore to protect her damaged spine, handpainted with birds and monkeys. Since then, it has felt like Kahlo has seldom been far from the catwalk. To mark the opening of the V&amp;A exhibition, the luxury fashion resale site Vestiaire Collective has curated a special selection of pieces inspired by Kahlo, including a flower crown headdress by Dolce &amp; Gabbana. “There is a fragility and a reflectiveness about Kahlo that connects us as her admirers with all that it means to be a woman,” says Vestiaire Collective’s Charlie Collins. Kahlo’s family have spoken out against the Frida Barbie, a criticism echoed by Salma Hayek and others. To portray Kahlo with light coloured eyes and with neatly arched brows invites accusations of crassness. Many ardent admirers of her work will feel that for her to be referenced on a catwalk, however well-meaning the context, reduces the self image that she created as an art project into something surface and scuppers the entire point. Such things are complicated and contradictory, as Kahlo knew better than anyone. Google “Frida Kahlo Vogue cover” and you will see the artist as she appeared on an edition of French Vogue back in 1939. Except, that magazine was never published. The cover is a modern mock-up, of unknown genesis, but widely reproduced. Is Frida a style icon? This debate is not new. But it is very fashionable."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"music/2018/mar/25/on-my-radar-gwenno-cultural-highlights-audiobooks-john-abell","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-25T09:00:48Z","webTitle":"On my radar: Gwenno’s cultural highlights","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/mar/25/on-my-radar-gwenno-cultural-highlights-audiobooks-john-abell","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/mar/25/on-my-radar-gwenno-cultural-highlights-audiobooks-john-abell","fields":{"headline":"On my radar: Gwenno’s cultural highlights","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Gwenno Saunders, born in 1981 in Cardiff, is a Welsh musician. Raised in an activist household, she performed for a time as an Irish dancer in Las Vegas. After starting off as a solo electropop act, in 2005 she joined the Pipettes, with whom she released two albums. Her Welsh-language album Y Dydd Olaf came out in 2014, and her latest, Le Kov, a Cornish-language album (it means “the place of memory”), is out now on Heavenly Recordings. She plays Tŷ Pawb, Wrexham on 7 April and Hoxton Hall, London on 12 April. 1. Music Audiobooks I saw them live recently, and I haven’t seen a gig that good for a really long time – it was very surreal, almost like art. It’s two people, Evangeline Ling and David Wrench, and she is completely captivating. She was wearing this fluffy Russian hat and reeled off a load of stories in an aria style, which transported you to different places; he played quite disjointed rhythmic music on synths and drum machines. There’s a post-punk element in their sense of freedom. It had a real impact on me. 2. Book Cheese and Culture: A History of Cheese and Its Place in Western Civilization by Paul S Kindstedt My mum bought me this for Christmas. It’s about how old cheesemaking is: it goes back to the neolithic age, thousands of years ago. Food is so integral to everything: economy, politics, community and culture. It reflects our attitude to food and farming, which is obviously integral to civilisation. I’m one for reading more fact-based books rather than fiction, and this is a really nice mix – it gives you lots of information on something that I really like to eat as well. 3. Artist John Abell Abell is a local artist in Cardiff: he does arresting watercolours and woodblock printing that explore the human condition. There’s a medieval mural quality to his work, in Four Horsemen Discover Civilisation, for example. He also does really big, intense works on wood, which are put where you’d see billboards normally. What I really love about them is that people have graffitied around his work – every time I go past, I keep thinking that some kid will have spray painted all over it, but they haven’t… 4. Podcast Desolation Radio We don’t have a media in Wales that scrutinises what the Welsh assembly does, so it’s not always easy for the majority of the public to know what is devolved and what isn’t, unless you’re actively searching for it… we don’t have, for example, a programme like Newsnight. But this is a fantastic podcast: important and informative, with real in-depth analysis – they cover issues like health, education, the Wales bill. 5. Film Bronco’s House (Dir Mark Jenkin, 2015) This is a brilliant kitchen sink drama about the housing crisis in Cornwall, all shot on film and developed using caffenol, which is made with instant coffee. It’s beautifully shot, incredibly stylish. Urban poverty has been well explored on film, but Bronco’s House sets itself apart to some extent by highlighting modern-day rural poverty. The director limits himself to using 16mm film, which is an inspired choice, in my opinion - it allows him to convey the harsh realities of living in Cornwall through a devastating lens. 6. TV Derry Girls, Channel 4 I absolutely loved this: the script, the soundtrack, everything about it. I used to Irish dance, and I shared a room with a girl from Belfast – obviously Belfast isn’t Derry, but this is really true to the spirit of teenage girls who have gone through that situation: the defiance, the poignancy, the self-involvement. A lot of the time when girls are [on TV shows] it’s because something horrible’s happened to them, which creates a really vulnerable image, which is true, but not the whole picture: the strength and power of the girls was captivating. I’m looking forward to the second series."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/mar/30/thomasina-miers-recipe-for-pork-belly-with-chilli-fennel-and-bay","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-30T14:00:02Z","webTitle":"Thomasina Miers’ recipe for pork belly with chilli, fennel and bay","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/mar/30/thomasina-miers-recipe-for-pork-belly-with-chilli-fennel-and-bay","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/mar/30/thomasina-miers-recipe-for-pork-belly-with-chilli-fennel-and-bay","fields":{"headline":"Thomasina Miers’ recipe for pork belly with chilli, fennel and bay","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Although this takes a few hours to braise in the oven, it is by definition a quick dish if you look at how little time it takes to put together: a light browning of the pork belly and a gentle saute of the leeks and fennel. The result is an unusual and delectable Easter feast. Experiment with different green veg as the weather improves: it is delicious with baby broad beans, fresh or frozen, and stalks of young, sweet asparagus. Braised pork belly with ancho chilli, bay and fennel The long, slow cooking makes the belly tender and unctuous – a lovely contrast to the herb-flecked fennel and leeks. If you can’t find ancho chillies (readily available online), substitute with Spanish dried Nora chillies, 2-3 teaspoons of Aleppo chilli flakes, or a half a teaspoon of normal chilli flakes. Prep 30 min Cook 2 hr Serves 4-6 1.4kg boned pork belly, cut into 5cm cubes or squares Olive oil or rapeseed oil 2 ancho chillies 2 tsp fennel seeds 4 garlic cloves, peeled and roughly chopped 200ml manzanilla sherry, or full-bodied dry white wine 3-4 fresh bay leaves Zest and juice of 1 orange For the vegetables 2 tbsp unsalted butter, or olive oil 2 leeks, peeled, washed and finely chopped 2 fennel bulbs, cut into 2-3cm dice 200g frozen peas 2-3 tbsp cider vinegar 1 handful each parsley and mint leaves, roughly chopped Crusty bread, to serve Heat the oven to 140C/275F/gas 1. An hour before you cook, season the pork belly generously with salt and pepper. Heat a large, wide pan over a medium heat and pour in a tablespoon of oil. Put the pork belly into the pan in a single layer and brown it all over for 20-25 minutes, turning occasionally so that some fat renders out and the meat turns golden brown. Pour out any excess fat as the pork is browning. Meanwhile, tear open the ancho chillies, discarding the stem and seeds, and rip the flesh into large, flattish pieces. Heat a dry frying pan on medium and toast the peppers for 20-30 seconds a side, until they smell fragrant (take care not to burn or they’ll taste bitter instead of sweet). Cover with 200ml boiling water and leave to soak for 20 minutes. Gently toast the fennel seeds in a frying pan for a minute, then grind to a powder. Mash to a puree with the garlic and half the wine in a mortar or food processor. Strain then roughly chop the chillies, reserving the liquid, and pour their soaking water and the rest of the wine into the garlic paste. Once the pork has browned, pour over the garlic sauce. Add the bay leaves and zest and juice of the orange, and bring just to a simmer. Transfer to the oven, cover with a lid slightly askew, and braise for 90-120 minutes, until tender. While the pork is cooking, melt the butter in a casserole and add the leeks and fennel. Season well with salt and pepper and cook over a medium-low heat for 20 minutes, until soft. Add the peas, vinegar and herbs, and stir until the peas are cooked – a few minutes. Adjust the seasoning and set aside. Serve the pork belly in deep bowls on the sweet herby vegetables with crusty bread to mop up all the braising juices. And for the rest of the week I am eating a lot of braised vegetables at the moment. Whizz up lots of flat-leaf parsley in olive oil and use this to drizzle over them; a dollop of goat’s curd or some grilled halloumi on the side is also a lovely accompaniment. If you have ordered a lot of ancho chillies online for this week’s recipe, try deseeding and blitzing any remaining with garlic, shallots, olive oil and vinegar. Leave to macerate in the fridge and slather over anything and everything.

With victory comes near-certain qualification but this is a game upon which rests not just their hopes of winning a place in next year’s finals, but the short-term future of Scottish cricket. “We sat down two months ago as a senior group and we spoke about what we wanted to get out of the tournament and how we were going to do it. Our aim was to win the tournament,” Coetzer says. “We’ve got ourselves in a position to get there. It’s all in our hands now. It’s going to be a challenging game but it’s in our hands.” Sunday’s 25-run defeat to Ireland was Scotland’s first of the competition, though there was also a brilliantly dramatic tie against Zimbabwe in the group stages. They will feel that both of those games could, and perhaps should, have been won, and that their position might have been considerably stronger. “That was a pretty special occasion,” says Coetzer of the game against the hosts. “The place was packed, fans everywhere, it had it all. The atmosphere was pretty electric really. It’s been a special tournament. There’s not many places we’ve been to that have been like this.” Any number of complaints could be levelled at the concept of a tournament in which not just World Cup places but ODI status have been up for grabs, and in which because of the teams’ varied statuses some games have been classified as official ODIs, and others as humble List A matches. Yet it has produced several thrilling encounters which have been watched by large, engaged crowds. “The tournament has had everything,” says Coetzer. “There have been some special games, and we’ve met some special people. Everyone’s embraced it and the cricket’s been amazing. Zimbabwe is amazing in itself. They’ve been through some hard times, and that’s evident when you go around, but the country has embraced this competition, the fans have come out in numbers and the atmosphere is as good as any competition I’ve played anywhere in the world. It has been exciting, an amazing tournament to be involved in, something we’ll have memories of for the rest of our lives. But the tournament would still have had everything if more teams could qualify for the World Cup.” Though the 2019 World Cup will only have one less match than the 2015 event, it will involve four fewer teams. This decision may have seemed sensible to the ICC when they took it, and there will certainly have been compelling financial arguments to be made for it, but the monetary gain has come at a cost. Primary among them is the sense that the interests of smaller nations that have contributed a great deal to recent tournaments – and where the sport, given the right conditions, could continue to flourish – have been betrayed. But there is also a more human cost, which will be paid by the players whose opportunity to play in major tournaments, to challenge and develop themselves and to realise dreams and ambitions, have been sacrificed to allow more money to be squeezed from the game’s most established marketplaces. “I think everyone here wants more teams involved [in the World Cup], and for all of us to have a fighting chance,” says Coetzer. “It just seems ludicrous in my eyes and everyone else’s eyes out here. The quality of the cricket has been second to none. The level of competition, the level of the players, the skill, the improvement even since the last qualifiers, not just in our team but all the other associate members. And it just seems ludicrous that they’re going to minimise cricket rather than grow it. “The impact on us will be huge, really. First of all we’ve got, currently, three fixtures for the whole of next summer: a game against England and two Twenty20s against Pakistan. That’s it at the moment. When you’ve got a very quiet schedule, what are you training for? What are you preparing for? As a team we need something to be targeting, and for us that’s the World Cup. Obviously the England and Pakistan games will be special, but they’ll be done in three days. World Cups are where memories are made and what people want to play in. It’s the main event, really. I think it’ll be pretty hard if we don’t qualify. It’ll hit the guys hard, hit the supporters hard, and everyone who’s put so much work into getting us where we are. We’ve shown in this tournament that we are a thriving, capable squad of players who want to go places. And how are we going to do that if there’s no World Cup, no cricket?” West Indies are overwhelming favourites to win their final match and seal qualification. They sailed through their group with a 100% record and across the tournament have been beaten only by Afghanistan – a team Scotland themselves beat by seven wickets. “We’ve got to believe that we can beat the West Indies,” Coetzer says. “They had a cracking game on Monday [against Zimbabwe] which I’m sure will have taken a bit out of them. They have scraped through on a couple of occasions. There’s no reason at all that there can’t be an opposition to take them down. We’ve shown through the tournament what we’re capable of but we haven’t played our best game of cricket yet. The vibe among the squad is brilliant. We have to believe we can win it, otherwise we might as well not turn up.” • This is an extract taken from the Spin, the Guardian’s weekly cricket email.

Very loosely adapted from Beatrix Potter’s children’s tale, this blend of humans (Domhnall Gleeson and Rose Byrne) and digital animals stuns with a £7.27m opening – the second biggest debut of 2018, after Black Panther. This is below the opening of franchise titles Paddington 2 (£8.26m) and Despicable Me 3 (£11.2m), but ahead of Pixar’s Coco (£3.36m, or £5.21m including previews) and The Boss Baby (£2.80m, or £8.03m including extensive previews). With most schools beginning the Easter break at the end of next week, Peter Rabbit looks set for a nice stretch of rich play. The runner-up: Tomb Raider Given the appeal of the rabbity rascals, video game adaptation Tomb Raider had to settle for second place, with an unspectacular debut of £2.55m (£3.08m including Thursday previews). Rather humiliatingly, this is behind the opening numbers of the original adaptation, starring Angelina Jolie, in July 2001, when tickets were considerably cheaper. Lara Croft: Tomb Raider began with £3.85m including previews of £389,000. Two years later, little-loved sequel The Cradle of Life proved significantly less successful, debuting with £1.52m including £259,000 in previews. In both cases, the producers cast a recent Oscar winner as their star: Jolie won in 2000 for supporting actress in Girl, Interrupted; Alicia Vikander won in 2016 for the same category in The Danish Girl. It’s fair to assume that both actors achieved a hefty pay bump for playing Lara Croft. The flop: Mary Magdalene Is Mary Magdalene a prestige drama, targeting audiences attracted by Lion director Garth Davis and a cast including Rooney Mara, Joaquin Phoenix, Chiwetel Ejiofor and Tahar Rahim? Or is it aiming for the faith crowd, who propelled Mel Gibson’s The Passion of the Christ to £11.1m at UK cinemas? The answer, so far, is that it’s succeeding at being neither, based on its debut of £239,000 from 423 cinemas, yielding a weak £565 average. In 2004, The Passion of the Christ grossed £2.02m on its first weekend of national wide release, from 323 cinemas. The arthouse challenger: The Square Delivering the biggest debut for a foreign language arthouse film so far this year, Ruben Östlund’s The Square begins with a robust £155,000 from 56 cinemas, and £221,000 including previews. Recent comparisons are fellow foreign language Oscar nominees Loveless (debut of £74,000 from 39 sites, and £126,000 including previews) and A Fantastic Woman (debut of £64,000 from 38 sites, and £98,000 including previews). Loveless has so far reached £307,000, and A Fantastic Woman, which won the Oscar, is at £239,000. The Square’s debut compares with a UK opening of £87,000 from 33 cinemas for Swedish director Östlund’s previous film, Force Majeure, in April 2015. Strong word of mouth propelled Force Majeure (“the avalanche movie”) to a healthy £593,000. Distributor Curzon Artificial Eye will be hoping to build on that success with The Square, also leveraging the film’s Cannes Palme d’Or win, a substantial use of English language dialogue, and cast names Elisabeth Moss and Dominic West. A potential negative is the 151 minutes running time. The event: My Generation The chart appears to show a fantastic debut for documentary My Generation, in which Michael Caine reflects on the cultural and social upheavals of the 1960s. It took £260,000 from 17 sites, but £251,000 of that was earned from last Wednesday’s premiere event, relayed to hundreds of cinemas nationwide. The weekend number is a more humble £9,400. The market Largely thanks to the arrival of Peter Rabbit, the market is 54% up on the previous session. However, it’s exactly a year since the arrival of Disney’s massively successful Beauty and the Beast, so UK and Ireland box office is down a troubling 42% on that weekend.

As he prepares to start a new life as the Guardian’s central and eastern Europe correspondent, he reflects on his years in the country Why did you first decide to become a journalist? I always wanted to write, but I came to journalism through Russia, rather than vice versa. I’d studied Russian and Soviet history at university and went to Russia to learn the language when I graduated. I planned to stay for a year and ended up staying for 14 – first working for an NGO, then a local magazine, then for the Independent for six years and the Guardian for the past four and a half. What do you enjoy most about being a foreign correspondent? The incredible variety. You aren’t confined to a thematic specialisation and have a whole region to cover, so in the space of a month I could move from covering the war in eastern Ukraine, to high Kremlin politics, to stories about the ballet or Russian cuisine. I met presidents, billionaires, warlords and cosmonauts, as well as many “ordinary” people who turned out to have extraordinary stories. Of course, it can be mentally tough to cover abuses of power, injustice and inequalities. But the core of the job is learning about the world and meeting people who are always interesting and sometimes inspiring. It’s an incredible privilege – I can’t think of anything I’d rather be doing. Can you tell us a bit about what it’s actually like to live in Moscow? Moscow has become immeasurably more liveable during the time I’ve been there. As the political climate got worse, the city got better, with nicer places to eat and drink and an urban makeover that means there are many more pedestrianised zones and fantastic parks. There is also a slow but noticeable change in attitudes: Moscow is becoming a much friendlier place, which is partly a generational thing, I think. Were you ever prevented from going anywhere or covering particular stories? On the whole, except for border zones and the Arctic, you can travel to most places in Russia with no problems (though the immense distances can sometimes pose logistical challenges). The issue is usually more about access. Many people are alarmed by the idea of talking to a foreign journalists and some topics are really difficult. The whole story about Russian electoral interference has been hard to cover from Moscow. While there are still people around the Kremlin who can give insider information on internal politics, the world of intelligence and security is completely closed off. The recent story about the poisoning of Sergei Skripal, for example: there’s not all that much you can do in Moscow except listen to angry denials. Looking back at your time there, which story are you proudest of? Probably the most extraordinary standalone story I wrote during my time in Russia was the tale of the two sons of Russian deep cover spies. The kids thought their parents were Canadians until the FBI came knocking on the door and it turned out they were actually KGB agents from Siberia. The family was deported back to Russia and the two young men had to start life in a country they had never visited, and come to terms with the years of lies from their parents. The first six months of 2014 were the most intense period of my career so far – from the revolution on Maidan in Kiev, through the annexation of Crimea, the war in eastern Ukraine and the downing of MH17. It was an exhausting and depressing story to cover but extraordinary to bear witness to such momentous events. The brazen Russian lying and disinformation around the conflict was frustrating and tiring, but officials in Kiev and western diplomats also often had skewed ideas about what was going on. I realised that there were very few people who were able to speak to all parties in the conflict: officials in Moscow and Kiev, separatist warlords, ordinary people on both sides of the lines. What are the challenges of being a foreign correspondent? One of the hardest things about working in Russia is that so many people believe all journalists are biased and that it’s impossible that a western journalist would even try to be objective. These days, of course, that’s an issue journalists are facing not only in Russia. In fact, many of the challenges foreign correspondents face are the same as those for all journalists. I have been thinking a lot about the responsibilities of journalists recently. My book has just come out, and doing promotion for it has been an instructive experience. Often, when interviews I’ve given about the book are published, I’ve felt my ideas were quoted out of context, or am confused as to why people have picked out particular strands. It can be very disconcerting to have a long conversation appear in print as two or three quotes, which of course is what we do with our interviewees all the time. Being on the other side of the interview is a very good reminder of how much trust people are putting in you when they agree to tell you their stories. You’re heading to Budapest next. What are you most looking forward to in your new beat? Central and eastern Europe is a fascinating region that seems to have been a bit overlooked in recent years. When most of the former Warsaw Pact countries joined the EU, many people assumed it was a kind of End of History moment, of peace and harmony on a united, democratic European continent. Now, leaders in Hungary, Poland and elsewhere are challenging that consensus, the UK has voted to leave the EU, and all the certainties of a decade ago suddenly seem fragile. I’m looking forward to exploring the bigger stories and trends – the rejection of liberalism, the effects of Brexit and the role Russia is playing in the region."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"education/2018/mar/20/what-are-your-experiences-of-racism-at-university","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-20T13:24:51Z","webTitle":"What are your experiences of racism at university?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2018/mar/20/what-are-your-experiences-of-racism-at-university","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/education/2018/mar/20/what-are-your-experiences-of-racism-at-university","fields":{"headline":"What are your experiences of racism at university?","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The University of Exeter is investigating claims of racism among its law society members, after messages shared online show “vile” racist comments made in a private students’ WhatsApp group.

The title track, released last November as part of a three-song EP, garnered some love for the way it filtered vintage Lauryn Hill vibes into an Amy Winehouse earworm. Elton John played Run Deep on his Beats 1 show. Even better was Snakes, a tremendous call-and-response blues stomper whose visually striking animated shadow-play video illustrated the song’s timely message: watch out for snakes, and own your own power. The album’s arc actually finds Mahal wrestling with attraction, love and heartbreak, moving smoothly through various classic tropes – piano balladry, 70s soul – before ending up on the synthetic, 80s-indebted anthem-pop of Wicked. Your ears prick up, too, around the Optimist mark, where a gnarly guitar riff recalls Jimi Hendrix’s Foxy Lady. Mahal was recently part of a musical tribute to Led Zeppelin at New York’s Carnegie Hall, and there are times here when you wish her ample lungs would cut loose in anger or lust rather than sorrow, and that the album’s sepia classicism would find some more room for experimentation."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"science/2018/mar/20/spring-equinox-marks-the-end-of-winter-amid-the-snow","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-21T11:18:29Z","webTitle":"Spring equinox 2018: it's official, winter is over – despite the snow","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/mar/20/spring-equinox-marks-the-end-of-winter-amid-the-snow","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2018/mar/20/spring-equinox-marks-the-end-of-winter-amid-the-snow","fields":{"headline":"Spring equinox 2018: it's official, winter is over – despite the snow","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"With patches of snow still covering the ground in parts of Britain, it may not seem like the first day of spring. But as of 4.15am Tuesday morning, winter was officially over for another year. The spring, or vernal, equinox marks the point in space and time when the sun moves across the celestial equator, an imaginary circle projected into the sky above the real equator. In the northern hemisphere, the sun moves south to north in the spring equinox, and days grow longer and nights shorter. For those in the southern hemisphere, the same equinox marks the arrival of autumn and longer nights. Seasons on Earth are driven by the planet’s orbit and 23.5 degree tilt from the vertical axis. As the Earth circles the sun, it can show more of its northern or southern poles to the sun. But when the Earth passes through an equinox, both poles receive equal sunlight, because the planet is tilted neither towards or away from the sun. While the equinox signals a time when day and night are equal, the moment when both share 12 hours apiece happens days earlier, because of atmospheric effects. “The Earth’s atmosphere delays the sunset and makes the sunrise earlier,” said Robert Massey at the Royal Astronomical Society. “When the sun is on the horizon, light is bent round because we have a thick atmosphere, and that appears to raise the sun in the sky. So when the sun appears on the horizon, it would actually have set if we had no atmosphere.” The date of the spring equinox varies from 19 to 21 March depending on location and corrections due to the mismatch between the Gregorian calendar, which logs 365 days a year, and the duration of Earth’s orbit around the sun, which takes 365.25 days to complete."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"public-leaders-network/2018/mar/23/labour-tory-northamptonshire-local-government","type":"article","sectionId":"public-leaders-network","sectionName":"Public Leaders Network","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-23T07:27:48Z","webTitle":"Tory councillors are tied to the idea that the market knows best | David Walker","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/public-leaders-network/2018/mar/23/labour-tory-northamptonshire-local-government","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/public-leaders-network/2018/mar/23/labour-tory-northamptonshire-local-government","fields":{"headline":"Tory councillors are tied to a despotic idea that the market knows best","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Max Caller, the independent inspector of Northamptonshire county council, has told the communities secretary, Sajid Javid, that the council is a dead parrot. It has, in the immortal lines of the Monty Python sketch, ceased to be. Instead, u in 2020, arise north northants and west northants. Never mind the geographical oddity (why not east and west or north and south?); never mind the lack of socioeconomic logic in the proposal or the lack of community identification with the new designation. Caller, who is a citizen completely above suspicion with a tremendous track record in local government, hasn’t told Javid the whole truth. He has written a report that says Northamptonshire employs “many good, hardworking, dedicated staff who are trying to deliver essential services to residents who need and value what is offered and available. The problems the council faces are not their fault.” Hooray, and so say all of us who care about local government. But this means the fault at the council lies with councillors. Or, to rephrase, the fault lies with the Tory councillors who have been in charge for many years and who were the worst combination of being incompetent and captivated by ideology. But Caller only implies that; he doesn’t say it. Caller says Northamptonshire lost tight budgetary control and “appeared to abandon strong and effective budget-setting scrutiny. Instead of taking steps to regain control, the council was persuaded to adopt a ‘next generation’ model structure as the solution. There was not then and has never been any hard-edged business plan or justification to support these proposals, yet councillors, who might well have dismissed these proposals for lack of content and justification in their professional lives, adopted them and authorised scarce resources in terms of people, time and money to develop them.” But he does not point out that what afflicted Northamptonshire Tories was ideology of a kind that Javid has, at least until recently, enthusiastically espoused. Ideology that has also been in evidence in Buckinghamshire, another tottering Tory county. That ideology embraces “new public management”, a doctrine in vogue since the 1980s, a fundamental principle of which is that markets know best and the state a burden to be shrunk and diminished. Another of its principles is that public services should be devolved, pushed as far away from the centre as possible, which is why for decades we’ve seen the odd marriage of economic liberals and “localists”. All councillors worth their salt are localists, in the sense they believe they are doing a good job and deserve power and resources to carry on. All councillors, including those on the left. The Local Government Association’s Labour group has just produced a wishlist for what should happen were Labour to win power at Westminster. Give us freedom, they cry, so we can build houses, improve social care, better coordinate schooling – and give us the cash as well. The report’s authors have a slight problem in that Labour council leaders are pretty much non-Corbynista. This may explain the almost complete absence of reference to ending outsourcing, to which Jeremy Corbyn and John McDonnell have committed in recent speeches; references to the leadership are tepid. But the bigger problem is more widespread: there is no clear view among either the general public or MPs about how much autonomy councils should enjoy. The political right, despite its love affair with new public management, is no more coherent than Labour on this. Javid’s predecessor Eric Pickles couldn’t resist instructing councils on the number of times they should empty the bins. Javid becomes an avid centraliser and intervenes, at least when the failings of Northamptonshire Tories become politically intolerable. If Andrew Gwynne, his Labour shadow, were in office, he would do the same in Rotherham, Doncaster or wherever if circumstances demanded, as his party predecessors have done. In addition, Labour now has some heavy policy baggage on adult social care, schools, housing, public health and so on – which implies councils would have to do as they were told, especially if austerity were to end and the money taps get turned on again. Northamptonshire has not been able to survive austerity. But it has done nothing to balance the respective powers of centre and locality.

The European commission called for large technology companies to pay a 3% tax if they make money from user data or digital advertising in a country, regardless of their bricks-and-mortar presence. As well as social media companies making money through user data, the move would also catch online market places, such as Airbnb and Uber. Tech giants have been rattled by the proposals, which are a departure from the current system under which companies are taxed on profits where they are headquartered, often in countries offering lower tax rates. European leaders will discuss the plans at an EU summit on Thursday, opening a fractious debate about how to capture revenue from digital firms. France has led the charge for a digital tax, sometimes nicknamed the Gafa tax, after Google, Apple, Facebook and Amazon. Smaller countries, such as Ireland, Luxembourg and Estonia, fear unilateral EU action could hand an advantage to the US, Japan, or even Brexit Britain. The plans have been in the works for months, before regulators called on Facebook to explain a data breach affecting 50m profiles, or a transatlantic dispute about steel tariffs. Theresa May is set to give cautious backing to the plans at the summit on Thursday. A senior Downing Street source said they recognised the international tax system was designed the best part of a century ago and was no longer suitable for a modern economy. “They are constructive proposals, we’re going to look at them seriously,” the source said. Despite the long gestation, the digital tax is likely to raise tensions between Brussels and Donald Trump’s White House. The US Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, told the New York Times that gross taxes on internet companies were “not fair”, on the sidelines of a debate among G20 finance ministers on taxation in Buenos Aires this week. The commission rejected claims that the plan was targeting US companies. “This is not an anti-American tax, this is not an anti-Gafa tax, this is a digital tax,” said Pierre Moscovici, the European commissioner for tax, who said 150 firms would be affected, including European, American and Asian ones. Moscovici said he had stressed this point to ministers at this week’s meeting in the Argentine capital, adding that the commission saw the plans as compatible with EU obligations under the World Trade Organization. The commission believes the tax will generate €5bn for European treasuries each year, but Moscovici suggested this sum would rise over time. The growing dominance of digital companies is seen as a long-term threat to Europe’s tax base, while also sparking questions of fairness. The commission estimates that digital businesses pay an effective average tax rate of only 9.5%, compared with 23.2% for bricks-and-mortar firms. The proposals must be agreed unanimously by EU member states before they become law, so details may change. The commission’s preferred option is reform of EU corporate tax rules that would include new ways to identify companies with a “digital presence”. A company would be deemed to have digital presence in a country if its revenues exceed €7m (£6m), or it has more than 100,000 users, or has signed more than 3,000 business contracts. Pending this bigger reform, the commission is looking at interim measures, such as the 3% tax on revenues from digital activities, which would include selling online advertising space. The measure would only apply to companies with global revenues of €750m and €50m in the EU. The commission hopes member states will agree the 3% tax by the end of the year, meaning it is likely the UK would have to apply it during a Brexit transition period mooted to end in 2021. EU officials have said they want to prevent European companies being undercut by their neighbour across the channel after Brexit."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/mar/21/blockchain-privacy-data-protection-cambridge-analytica","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-21T16:19:11Z","webTitle":"How Blockchain could help us take back control of our privacy | Josh Hall","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/21/blockchain-privacy-data-protection-cambridge-analytica","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/21/blockchain-privacy-data-protection-cambridge-analytica","fields":{"headline":"How Blockchain could help us take back control of our privacy","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The Cambridge Analytica scandal poses some serious questions about the integrity of democracies in the information age. From Trump to Brexit, the dirty tricks apparently offered by CA’s top executives should cause concern everywhere that elections happen. But the episode is also worrying because of its specific focus: data. We create reams of data every day – every time we open a browser window and every time we make a contactless payment. We do this without thinking. The Cambridge Analytica news demonstrates the power that this data can have when we lose control of it. Facebook isn’t the only huge data company to have suffered a major breach in recent years. In September it was revealed that 143 million Americans and 44 million Britons had sensitive information stolen from Equifax, the credit rating firm, including home addresses and social security numbers. The kicker in this case was that many of those affected had no idea the company was holding that information in the first place – such is the staggering growth of data creation and collection, and the lack of controls enjoyed by consumers over who gets to keep it. Clearly, it’s time for a radical rethink about the data we are producing and the processes governing its collection and maintenance. The EU has already gone some way to addressing these questions through the introduction of General Data Protection Regulation, a set of new rules dictating how businesses can handle personal information. But, despite their significant impact on collection practices in even the smallest businesses around Europe, these regulations still fall light years short of the comprehensive change in mindset needed to safeguard our privacy – and, potentially, the integrity of future elections. Proliferation is the major risk for our personal data. Think about the number of times you’ve entered your address, your bank card security number, and your mother’s maiden name into a website. You wouldn’t dream of giving away that sort of information in a brick and mortar store, and yet we do it unthinkingly online. So how do we regain control of this sea of information? Blockchain technology is one of the potential solutions to this vast proliferation. Blockchains are distributed ledger systems – that is, information is stored not in a single, centralised database, but in a potentially infinite number of places. Blockchains store immutable records and they are distributed among every user, each of whom has their own private cryptographic key. This presents an opportunity. Rather than yielding our most sensitive information to every shop or platform we interact with online, we could instead store it in a decentralised ledger, free from a single point of failure. Connect that technology to existing payment systems and platforms, and combine it with biometric security features on our smartphones or tablets and we could then enjoy significantly more control over what information we share with whom – and say goodbye to passwords at the same time. But there’s a major problem with the application of blockchain technology in this way: privacy. If our data is stored everywhere, how can it be private? This is being tackled by researchers at MIT through their Enigma project, which is a protocol that sits on top of existing blockchains. Enigma promises “secret contracts”, as opposed to existing “smart contracts”, with nodes on the blockchain able to compute data without ever “seeing” it. The researchers say this will allow users to maintain control over personal data, particularly through preventing its monetisation or analysis by platforms. They also claim that it could unlock a new system of lending, in which prospective borrowers can establish their trustworthiness without having to give individual lenders access to their specific personal data. Blockchain techniques are already being adopted at local and national levels. Estonia, which has emerged as one of the most forward-thinking, digital-first economies, has gradually moved all of its citizen data onto a distributed ledger system. Illinois is testing a number of blockchain-based systems, including a birth registry. And Singapore is considering moving towards a blockchain system to allow citizens to interact seamlessly with government services. There is significant work being done to shift the focus of blockchain technology away from pure currency speculation towards real world applications – especially around privacy and storage. Cambridge Analytica, Facebook, and Equifax have demonstrated without doubt that our management of data is broken. Blockchain could help us fix it. • Josh Hall is a writer and editor based between London and Berlin."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/apr/06/how-to-handle-headline-anxiety-take-time-reading-news-oliver-burkeman","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-06T14:00:35Z","webTitle":"Headlines making you anxious?

One day, as the commentator Jeet Heer noted, such schemes may go too far, leaving Hagerman and his ilk in the position of those Japanese soldiers who fought the second world until the 1970s. When Trump gets impeached or defeated, or dies of a Doritos overdose, how will they ever find out? Still, as I grapple with this problem myself, I’m increasingly convinced that the real cause of headline anxiety isn’t learning about worrisome new developments. Rather, it’s not knowing which new developments will prove to have been worth worrying about. Of the 45 troubling things you saw on Twitter this morning, two or three may prove to be signs of the rise of fascism/the destruction of the environment/the collapse of Brexit Britain. Yet the rest won’t. Once, it was the media’s job to sift stories of lasting significance from the rest; today, any publication that sat on a story for a week, to see if it had legs, would get screamed at for suppressing the truth. The passage of time is the best filter for determining what matters. But being late is the one thing no social network, or modern news organisation, can afford. You can afford it, though. Which is why one excellent way to stay calm but well-informed, I’ve found, is to consume the news a day or three later than everyone else. Print is one way to do this. But it works online, too: more and more, I find myself promiscuously cruising the web, saving umpteen articles in a “read later” app (in my case Evernote, though you could use your browser’s bookmarks). By the time I read them, the time filter has worked its magic: a small proportion of them stand out as truly compelling. It’s an imperfect system, since of course you have to become aware of a story to clip it in the first place. But it soon gets easier to tell yourself not to dwell on it till later. After I’d done this for a while, it struck me that it’s essentially what I’d been doing for years with especially persistent personal worries: I’d make an entry in my calendar two or three weeks from today, and resolve not to fret about the matter till then. In almost every case, by the time the date rolled around, the issue seemed absurd. Everyone tells you to live in the moment – but there’s much to be said for putting the moment off for a few days.

Royal Ascot is updating its famously strict dress code and warns sockless men they may be turned away. Socks are an afterthought for many, but sporting them, or shedding them altogether, is not as simple as it looks. By following seven simple rules, you can ensure you always have appropriate ankles. Think about colour Socks should match the trouser, not the shoe, or you will look shorter. Unless you are into a contrast look, where the sock should be wildly different from both. Generally, the higher your hem, the more you can get away with. Avoid black Black socks are a bit “pallbearer on a tea break”. Wear with caution. Socks and sandals are OK Pairing socks with pool slides or sandals is perfectly fine now. Ridiculing it carbon-dates you to twice your actual age. Go long Socks should adequately cover your ankle when you sit, unless your calves are particularly spectacular and you want the world to know. Short socks risk making you look like serial ankle-exposer Tony Blair kicking back with a light ale after a G8 summit. Nobody wants that. Think about skin Sock shirkers have a responsibility to present the best ankle possible. Paler folk should consider their position on fake tan and get busy, to avoid passers-by suffering snow blindness from milky-white mankles. All men should moisturise everywhere, but especially areas on show. The ankle is no exception – glossy ones tease; dry and scaly ones repel. Always wear socks If you are going sockless, make sure you … wear socks. Invisible socks – short trainer socks that remain under the shoe-line – look like cheap ballet pumps, yes, but they are essential for comfort while maintaining your look, and may save your insoles from an odorous demise. Heading to a shoes-off household? Take spare “normal” socks in your bag to avoid embarrassment or jokes about how awful your feet are. Wrap up till Easter Just as Americans don’t wear white after Labour Day, ankles, too, have ridiculous rules. Cover until Easter weekend, when you can let the flesh free. Anyone still flashing after September will make everyone feel cold just looking at them."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/blog/2018/mar/21/serena-williams-mother-tennis-hate-criticism-baby","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-21T13:06:26Z","webTitle":"Serena Williams is now a mother, but don’t expect the hate to stop | Paul MacInnes","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2018/mar/21/serena-williams-mother-tennis-hate-criticism-baby","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/blog/2018/mar/21/serena-williams-mother-tennis-hate-criticism-baby","fields":{"headline":"Serena Williams is now a mother, but don’t expect the hate to stop","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Would someone please give Serena Williams a break? Two weeks into her comeback, seven months after giving birth to daughter Olympia (her name chosen from a shortlist of those associated with strength), the winner of 23 grand slam singles crowns was forced to endure another round of the rubbish that has been as consistent a part of her career as the titles. Williams had to enter the Miami Open this week as an unseeded player, a wildcard in fact. This despite the fact that she left for her maternity leave as the women’s world No 1, at 35 years and seven months the oldest person ever to hold that position. Without commenting on the matter herself, Serena’s deseeding has become a talking point in Florida after she was drawn against Naomi Osaka, last week’s Indian Wells champion, in the first round, a game she subsequently lost on Wednesday night. The director of the Miami Open, James Blake, has suggested: “These kind of things shouldn’t happen.” The seeding is in the gift of the WTA. It has a system of what it calls protected ranking, which allows an injured player to retain a rank averaged from the months immediately following their injury. But this ranking does not apply to seeding. Also, technically speaking, Williams – who plays Osaka on Wednesday evening – was never injured in the first place. “She had a kid, which we should all be celebrating,” Blake said. “So when she comes back there should be a grace period where she can still be seeded.” Blake is not the only person to venture an opinion on this subject and, suddenly, maternity in tennis is a hot topic. Are female players being punished for having a child? Is having a child the same as a broken leg? Should the governing body of women’s tennis maybe have thought about these matters before now? Simona Halep, the current WTA No 1, believes Williams should have been granted top seeding. The world No 66, Mandy Minella, believes no adjustment should be made at all. “The rule should stay as it is,” said Minella, who returned to tennis in February, 99 days after giving birth. “There are many players who have been out because of pregnancy and there will be many more. I don’t think we would be talking about this if it wasn’t Serena.” Needless to say it is not the first time that people are talking about something because of Serena. The Miami Open has given equal prize money to both its male and female winners since 1985, but it is an outlier. At other events on the WTA circuit a champion will still earn far less than their equivalent on the ATP tour. Williams has been making the argument for equal pay for years. In return she has not only had to listen to snide questions from male journalists quoting court-time statistics but also enjoy the diatribes of male executives who believe female players should “get down on their knees” and “give thanks for the men who made their career” possible. That opinion belongs to Raymond Moore, the former CEO of Indian Wells who stepped down amid the outrage at his remarks and which just happens to be the other tournament Serena has entered unseeded since her return. Indian Wells is an infamous location in the Williams legend, the place where Serena’s father Richard railed against racist abuse from the crowd when she won the final in 2001. She subsequently boycotted the tournament for 14 years. The struggle of being a prominent female African‑American athlete has hardly gone away during that time. This winter Williams learned that her fellow American player, Tennys Sandgren, had made an apparently derogatory tweet about her using foul language on court. It was part of a torrent of screenshots of deleted social media bilge attributed to Sandgren on Twitter, forcing him to deny he was an alt-right sympathiser. The woman who has claimed 316 grand slam match wins in her career wrote to this man, who sounds like he changed his name to celebrate both his preferred sport and an interest in Viking lore, and asked for an apology on behalf of an “entire group of people”. Sandgren has since apologised, but only for homophobic remarks he made on another occasion. Williams did not have to step into the Sandgren hellhole, some suggest. Neither did she have to call out Novak Djokovic over his remarks on equal pay. And if she did not want to have her body criticised (as it has been throughout her career) she should not have posed for the cover of Sports Illustrated or, later, Vanity Fair while pregnant. That Williams, the only player male or female to win a career golden slam after the age of 30, has any choice in the matter seems laughable, however. For a start the idea that black people with opinions are difficult is a trope that for generations has given white people cover to provoke them with whatever material they like. Make a story about Serena and it stirs up a whole slurry of associated resentment that will provoke engagement in an audience. That Williams could choose to somehow ignore that seems naive. It would be nice if Serena could have some time off from all this, perhaps spend six months without becoming the figurehead for something eminently sensible yet somehow abhorrent to reactionaries. It would be nice if she received the respect she deserves for her tennis career and that owed to her as a human being. But maybe she won’t. And if she doesn’t you can bet that a born competitor will keep up the fight at her end. In turn that might make Williams an icon whose significance carries beyond her sporting career."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"music/2018/mar/21/sam-smith-review-","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-21T11:27:42Z","webTitle":"Sam Smith review – pop's old soul takes it slow and steady","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/mar/21/sam-smith-review-","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/mar/21/sam-smith-review-","fields":{"headline":"Sam Smith review – pop's old soul takes it slow and steady","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Sam Smith rises slowly from a trapdoor in the centre of the stage, sitting on a nondescript chair, doubled over, as if weighed down by woe. It’s the kind of image projected by the songs on his second album, The Thrill of It All, which spends 35 minutes inconsolably picking over a failed relationship. From his slumped position, Smith sings one of them, protesting about having lost his self-respect and having taken up smoking. The chair on the platform proves to be the extent of the show’s stagecraft, a ballsy move in a world of pop arena shows packed with pyrotechnics and special effects, although perhaps Smith thinks his audience are too old for that kind of thing. “I want to see the best mum-dancing all around the room,” he says at one point. The lack of the usual bedazzling production isn’t the only thing that makes Smith’s live show strangely low-key. His sound exists in an area bordered by sombre pop-soul, replete with the odd retro pastiche, Coldplay-ish stadium balladry and, occasionally, the super-slick sound of Luther Vandross and Alexander O’Neal’s more upbeat 1980s hits. At one point, he launches into a brief cover of the former’s duet with Janet Jackson, The Best Things in Life Are Free. The periodic foray into the realm of Magic FM-friendly funk aside, it all proceeds at the same slow-to-middling pace. You’d describe the lack of variety as a mistake – it certainly doesn’t do a great deal for the show’s momentum – were it not clearly deliberate. Even Latch, Smith’s collaboration with Disclosure, is stripped of its beats and bassline and presented as a lounge-y ballad. Then there’s Smith himself, as unassuming a figure as ever sold 12m copies of their debut album. He has a fantastic voice – there’s an impressive ease with which he vaults octaves – but he’s not an artist whose on-stage presence makes it seem as if the venue is struggling to contain his boundless charisma. He’s a nice guy rather than a born superstar. For all his way with a falsetto leap, there’s something ineffably reserved about his singing, more so than in the studio – whatever you thought of the music on The Thrill of It All, Smith’s vocals sounded authentically anguished. It feels as if he’s performing the songs rather than inhabiting them, a problem when they’re mostly concerned with soul-baring expressions of romantic despair. When he sings, “Will you take me to nirvana?” he sounds less like a man pleading to be catapulted to the heights of sexual ecstasy than someone asking for a lift. There’s a moment when he cedes the stage to his quartet of backing vocalists and, rather than acting as a cue for the audience to storm the toilets, it feels like the energy slightly lifts. Perhaps this is all due to first-night nerves. As the show progresses, songs spark more regularly. Scars – relegated to a bonus track on the special edition of The Thrill of It All – packs more of an emotional punch than its better-known siblings; Him’s depiction of religious homophobia is genuinely powerful and moving; the concluding Pray carries the same, frank tang of desolation as it does in its recorded incarnation. At its close, Smith slumps back on to his chair, and it sinks back into the stage. At Newcastle Metro Radio Arena, 21 March. Then touring the UK until 10 April."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/mar/21/paternity-leave-wonderful-all-fathers-given-chance","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-21T12:38:04Z","webTitle":"My paternity leave was wonderful – all fathers should be given the chance | Maxton Walker","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/21/paternity-leave-wonderful-all-fathers-given-chance","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/21/paternity-leave-wonderful-all-fathers-given-chance","fields":{"headline":"My paternity leave was wonderful – all fathers should be given the chance","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"I had a pretty neat comeback when blokes chuckled at me pushing my baby daughter around during the three months of parental leave I took in 2016: just look at one of the Guardian’s most-read articles of all time, the Top five regrets of the dying. In it, a palliative nurse says that every single dying man she cared for admitted he wished he’d spent less time in the office. And yet, as a committee of MPs has reported this week, men with babies at home can’t be dragged away from their desks to spend time with them, despite having been given the right to share parental leave three years ago. I have no doubt those three wonderful months are the rock that my close relationship with my daughter was built on. She is now two and a half. We are more than father and daughter: we are buddies. I regularly take her to visit my parents in Scotland without my partner; indeed, I am writing this at my parents’ house, having just put my daughter to bed. My partner is back in London putting in, she assures me, some serious desk hours. My daughter is totally comfortable with this, and always has been. She asks for her mum when she is upset but my partner says she will also ask for me when they are alone together. “Caring” would probably not be a word many people would use to describe me, but my relationship with my daughter is, I think, something special. I consider myself lucky. My partner thought my taking leave was a good idea; my line manager thought it was a “beautiful” idea, and I reckoned my solid but unspectacular career could probably take the hit. To be fair, our situation was not typical when we were discussing whether I should take a chunk of the parental leave. My partner and I are both in our 40s and financially stable, so it wasn’t about money (anyway, she earns a lot more than me so we were better off with her going back to work after nine months). But, although neither of us have regrets, my partner admits that it hurt to hand over our daughter and schlep back to the daily grind – and that if it had been her first baby (she has a daughter from a previous relationship) she might well have “kept” the leave for herself. And that’s really why the government’s good intentions have all come crashing down. For many reasons – from the fact that mothers are often encouraged to breastfeed for 12 months and beyond (something than can be difficult if they go back to work), to the cultural baggage of the whole concept of “maternity leave” – the leave is de facto the mother’s; essentially in her “gift” to offer to the father or not. I recently heard about a couple who do similar jobs in the same large organisation who have just had a baby together. He would love to take a piece of the action but his partner wants the full 12 months because, well, she’s loving it. And he doesn’t feel there’s much he can say. I have heard plenty of similar stories. Attitudes simply aren’t shifting, which is bad for everybody, as countries that have managed to improve the uptake of parental leave for dads have seen huge benefits, from a narrowing of the gender pay gap to increased overall happiness. So we certainly have to abandon the ridiculous idea of “shared” leave, and adopt something much closer to the Swedish “daddy months” model: 90 days earmarked for men to take or lose – their decision, and nobody else’s. But we need more. Employers should, if a man says he is planning to skip his leave, be forced to meet him, ask him what his reservations are, respond in writing and be held to what they say. Dictating whether or not babies have crucial formative experiences with their fathers is not the business of organisations – and everybody needs to know that. I’ve heard people advocate making it easier to let men take, say, a day a week unpaid off to be with their kids, but that just runs into the same problems as the government’s 2015 initiative. It will still not appeal to men who think it might make them look uncommitted to the company, and will still be difficult for families with tight finances. Plus, I feel, there is no substitute for spending a lot of time really bonding with your child in its early months. If we did go down the Swedish route, it would also be vital to give men active support in both making the initial decision and in managing their leave. Is there, for example, any measurable downside to stopping breastfeeding at nine months? Who can dads talk to if they do feel overwhelmed? Once dads are pushing the pram, they run into the next problem. I went to a privately run “baby sensory” session every week and a council-run “busy babies” one, both of which gave babies and parents the chance to meet up, talk and share their burdens. Of the 20 or 30 adults at baby sensory, I was almost always the only father. At busy babies, I never recall seeing another man. It was lonely. So anybody who runs postnatal support sessions must be encouraged – even forced – to reach out to fathers, ideally with special dad-only introduction sessions. Coffee shops that have maternity meet-ups should encourage father-only sessions. Taking three months off with your child is never going to be wasted time, but it should be so much more than childcare. It should be a chance for both father and child to develop in ways that they hadn’t anticipated. One of my fondest memories from my time off is taking my baby daughter round the British Museum and showing her the Rosetta Stone. If we find a way through the cultural misconceptions and misunderstandings around parental leave, I know other dads will have their own special moments to treasure – and society will be all the richer for it. • Maxton Walker is a Guardian features subeditor."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"books/booksblog/2018/apr/04/top-10-books-about-horses-jane-smiley-riding-lessons","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-04T12:53:58Z","webTitle":"Top 10 books about horses – Jane Smiley picks her favourites","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2018/apr/04/top-10-books-about-horses-jane-smiley-riding-lessons","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/booksblog/2018/apr/04/top-10-books-about-horses-jane-smiley-riding-lessons","fields":{"headline":"Top 10 books about horses – Jane Smiley picks her favourites","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"When I was learning to ride horses, manuals were essentially worked-over cavalry manuals: horses were to obey, and the rider’s job was to know how to give orders. That changed in the 1960s, when trainers who had never been in the cavalry began to pay attention to horse behaviour. For my first middle-grade series, The Horses of Oak Valley Ranch, I wanted to focus on that, so I set it in the mid-60s and introduced trainers with new techniques. My new book, Riding Lessons, is about Ellen, a girl who loves horses but has to beg to be taught how to ride. She is what was once known as “contrary”: she wants to have her way and knows how to get it (sometimes by subterfuge). I wasn’t her as a child, but I would have loved to be her friend. 1. The Manual of Horsemanship by the British Horse Society and Pony Club When I was a gawky and ignorant 11-year-old, a friend got me to join the Pony Club and introduced me to this book – and the words “headstall”, “loose box”, “gymkhana” and “day rug” in the process. I learned that horses teach their riders to pay attention, be aware of their bodies, contain themselves, follow procedure and watch others. Joan Wanklyn’s graceful illustrations gave the horses intentions and personality. 2. Black Beauty by Anna Sewell A not-children’s book that has become a children’s book, this story of an abused horse contemplating other abused horses he has known was written by a woman who received only £40 for her efforts and died shortly after it was published. 3. National Velvet by Enid Bagnold When I first read National Velvet, I read it for the horse; now I read it for the portrayal of Velvet’s eccentric family. Of course, the arc of Velvet’s Grand National win is utterly unbelievable, but her siblings, her parents and Mi are people of their time and place, making do with their muddy and odd circumstances. I love how frank Bagnold is, but also how she folds the unbelievable parts, such as Velvet’s run, into vivid, believable details of weather, chaos and chance events. 4. The Kellys and the O’Kellys by Anthony Trollope Trollope’s second novel is insightful about Ireland, women, money and family friction, but my favourite bits take place on the turf. Dot Blake is one of the great horse-racing characters in fiction, not because he’s so colourful but because he’s so smart. He gives good advice, about racing and marriage, and he makes use of many intemperate men while never being one himself. Trollope knew his horses and his hunting: there’s a neatly choreographed hunting scene in his novel Orley Farm, and in The Duke’s Children, Lord Silverbridge is swindled out of what would now be £7m by a racecourse scoundrel. 5. Carrot for a Chestnut by Dick Francis I’ve read and enjoyed many of Francis’s novels, but this short story, originally published in Sports Illustrated, is his most brilliant work. It’s about two brothers, sons of a trainer. One brother is favoured over the other and gets to ride the better horses; the other decides to poison his brother’s mount. I’ll stop there. The plot twist is great, and the psychological insights are eye-popping. 6. Saratoga Fleshpot by Stephen Dobyns Dobyns is best known for his poetry, but in the 1990s he wrote a series of humorous detective novels set in Saratoga, New York. I love them all, but this one – about the Saratoga summer horse sales, a two-year-old that bites the buttocks of anyone standing near him and the amusingly named Victor Plotz – is hard to beat. Dobyns is a master of language and seems to know horse racing inside and out. 7. The Horse, the Wheel and Language: How Bronze-Age Riders from the Eurasian Steppes Shaped the Modern World by David W Anthony Can one of my favourites be a book I’ve not finished, but one that I dip into often and with pleasure? It combines three of my greatest interests: horses, travel and philology. When Anthony writes about Mycenae, I remember staring at the stone block at the city gate where chariot wheels left grooves in the paving stones. When he talks about dead languages, I’m reminded of reading Bede in my Old English class. When he writes about taming horses, I see a broad, rolling steppe I’ve never visited. I love history books, and this is one of my favourites. 8. Slow Horses, Fast Women by Damon Runyon The collection is out of print and hard to find. The main Runyon collection in print, Guys and Dolls and Other Writings, doesn’t contain one particular story I love: All Horse Players Die Broke. However, Runyon’s style is always distinct, amusing and insightful. A woman is a “Judy”, a gun is a “Betsy” and a head is a “pimple”, as in: “Although it is only the night before that I am standing in the same spot wondering where I can borrow a Betsy with which to shoot myself smack-dab through the pimple.” 9. Talking With Horses by Henry Blake I’ve read books by many “horse whisperers”. Henry Blake was born in the 1920s, grew up with horses and got into the business of making useful animals out of rogues. Blake had a natural touch – one day, he took five unbroken horses fox hunting because the hunts kept crossing his property and he saw it as an opportunity to jump on them one by one, to give them something to do. Of all the advocates of humane training methods, Blake is the funniest. 10. Deborah Butterfield by Robert Gordon I wrote an introduction to this book, but the book is only a gateway to photographs of the amazing artworks by Deborah Butterfield, a sculptor and dressage rider. Many of her cast bronze horses begin as branches and pieces of wood, which she forms into horses (up to seven feet at the withers), then turns into bronze using the lost wax casting method. How can these animals look so energetic and alive? I have no idea, but they do. • Riding Lessons by Jane Smiley is published by Scholastic Children’s Books for £5.99.

Musical megastar turned actor Diljit Dosanjh – in a move we might now call “doing a Styles” – plays the eponymous Singh, a free thinker schooled to fight the cause of independence but forced to do his bit by his father, a grovelling lackey of empire, in the hope of achieving greater career progression. Rachid Bouchareb’s second world war film Days of Glory may have been an inspiration: our heroes must navigate the xenophobia and condescension of those who would have them march at the back of the battalion and thereby prove themselves first among equals. The script floats one intriguing historical supposition – that men such as Singh signed up because they thought the Brits were more likely to grant them freedom if they fought together – but Batra generally prefers working with tried-and-tested war movie tropes: the trench dance number is a novelty, but when one recruit speaks longingly of future plans, we instantly know he’s done for. It’s aiming for undemanding, foursquare matinee viewing rather than anything probing or lasting, and stumbles persistently into one pitfall: several overdubbed Brits display the speech rhythms of people more fluent in Mandarin than the mother tongue. (Oddly, these UK-shot sequences seem to have had no trouble sourcing credible Germans.) Still, Dosanjh does the uniform proud, there’s a nicely lived-in supporting turn from Yograj Singh as the Sikhs’ commander, and Batra hits most of his big emotional beats, rightly sensing there might be something stirring and striking in the sight of beturbaned warriors charging across a field in Belgium."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"film/2018/mar/25/westwood-punk-icon-activist-review-watchable-documentary","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-25T07:00:47Z","webTitle":"Westwood: Punk, Icon, Activist – watchable documentary on a fashion one-off","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/mar/25/westwood-punk-icon-activist-review-watchable-documentary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/mar/25/westwood-punk-icon-activist-review-watchable-documentary","fields":{"headline":"Westwood: Punk, Icon, Activist – watchable documentary on a fashion one-off","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Vivienne Westwood, folded into an armchair, refuses to make eye contact with the camera. “It’s so boring,” she complains of her own punk past.

And if it tiptoes around certain themes – she is not pressed on the contradictions between her eco-activism and the wastefulness of the fashion industry – the film still offers a glimpse into the controlled chaos of her creativity and her opinions on everything from hem lengths to capitalism to her third husband and collaborator Andreas Kronthaler. “I like living with him as much as I like living on my own,” is Westwood’s ringing endorsement."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"sport/2018/mar/21/russia-ignored-four-attempts-wada-doping-ban-craig-reedie","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-21T11:50:32Z","webTitle":"Russia ignored four requests to inspect anti-doping lab, says Wada","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/mar/21/russia-ignored-four-attempts-wada-doping-ban-craig-reedie","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/mar/21/russia-ignored-four-attempts-wada-doping-ban-craig-reedie","fields":{"headline":"Russia ignored four requests to inspect anti-doping lab, says Wada","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The World Anti-Doping Agency president, Craig Reedie, has warned Russia that it will not be allowed back in “from the cold” until it acknowledges its state-sponsored doping programme and allows its Moscow anti-doping laboratory to be inspected. Reedie, speaking at the Wada Symposium in Lausanne, revealed Russia had ignored four letters proposing a joint inspection of the Moscow laboratory – where hundreds of athletes’ samples are still stored – alongside the Russian Sports Investigatory Committee. Reedie told the 900 delegates that without genuine reform, every Russian victory would be doubted. “We made an offer to senior Russian officials in Pyeongchang to visit the Moscow laboratory together but it seems our offer has fallen on deaf ears,” Reedie said. “We have also written to the Russian Investigatory Committee four times to offer our help and we have not had a single response. “The big losers here are Russian athletes. Their participation in future events will continue to be put in doubt and the rest of the world will not be convinced any meaningful change has taken place. Real action is needed. It’s time for this situation to change. If not, it will damage sport – every Russian victory will be doubted.” The Russian Anti-Doping Agency, which was suspended in November 2015, has now met most of the requirements on Wada’s road map for reinstatement but Reedie said there has been no progress on the final two stumbling blocks despite 15 months of talks. Along with access to the Moscow laboratory, Russia is required to accept the findings of the McLaren report, which revealed more than 1,000 Russian athletes across 30 sports were involved in an institutional doping programme, including at the Sochi 2014 Winter Olympics. “We want to welcome an independent and efficient Rusada back in from the cold – it’s just a pity that progress is so slow from the Russian authorities,” Reedie said. “We have been trying to persuade them to recognise and accept as true the systemic doping as revealed by the investigations led by Professor Richard McLaren and Samuel Schmid, which was the basis of the recent International Olympic Committee decision on Russia’s neutral status at the Winter Olympics.” Rusada’s new head, Yuri Ganus, insisted his organisation had made changes. But when asked why it was not acknowledging the McLaren report, he replied: “It’s not a question that depends on us … it’s about negotiation.” Earlier Reedie denied that the global anti-doping system was “broken” but admitted more work was required to ensure Wada’s rules were being followed in every nation, not just Russia. One of its key issues remains funding and Reedie welcomed the recent announcement that its £20m annual budget, which comes on a 50-50 basis from the International Olympic Committee and national governments, will be increased by 8% this year. However, the need for more money was spelled out by Wada’s director general, Olivier Niggli. He said Wada had doubled its investigations and intelligence team from three to six people, with a seventh joining soon. But the team are able to deal with only 12% of the information it receives from whistleblowers."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"film/2018/mar/21/westwood-punk-icon-activist-vivienne-kate-moss-review","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-21T15:00:08Z","webTitle":"​Westwood: Punk, Icon, Activist review – Vivienne is the real deal","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/mar/21/westwood-punk-icon-activist-vivienne-kate-moss-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/mar/21/westwood-punk-icon-activist-vivienne-kate-moss-review","fields":{"headline":"​Westwood: Punk, Icon, Activist review – the life of a fearless fashion heroine","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Towards the end of this documentary, Vivienne Westwood’s son Joe Corré describes her as Britain’s last genuine punk. There is truth in that. Punk may have effectively vanished in music, but it lives on in Westwood’s clothes, style and the poses she strikes publicly. In this film, she is reluctant to talk about punk rock or her personal life, perhaps aware of the controversy generated by her ghosted 2016 autobiography, in which she laid into various figures and made sweeping and rather startling statements – such as claiming that her first husband, airline pilot Derek Westwood, managed the Who in the early 60s. This film takes us through her early life: when she wafts into the orbit of Malcolm McLaren, who made their fashion store Sex a punk headquarters of sorts. Their acrimonious split left Westwood to battle on alone, to raise two children and to survive the worlds of fashion and business – which she did, with no little courage, and mostly without the corporate support which was to be lavished on more mainstream designers such as Stella McCartney. We see the notorious Sue Lawley TV interview from the 80s, when the studio audience roared with mocking laughter as models came on wearing her creations. Westwood was at first scandalised, threatening to stop the proceedings, but then maintains a strange kind of wounded equanimity, which induced a guilty-looking Lawley to ask if she was upset. The best anecdote is saved for the closing credits, for some reason, when Kate Moss reveals that Westwood told her that, if she was gay, Kate would be the one she would fall for."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/mar/21/home-office-overturns-refusal-of-visa-for-nhs-doctors-daughter","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-21T17:04:41Z","webTitle":"Home Office overturns refusal of visa for NHS doctor's daughter","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/mar/21/home-office-overturns-refusal-of-visa-for-nhs-doctors-daughter","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/mar/21/home-office-overturns-refusal-of-visa-for-nhs-doctors-daughter","fields":{"headline":"Home Office overturns refusal of visa for NHS doctor's daughter","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The Home Office has overturned its refusal to issue a visa to the three-year old daughter of an NHS doctor after her fight was highlighted by the Guardian. Amany Abdelmeguid came to the UK from Egypt in 2016 on a tier 2 visa, sponsored by Health Education England as part of a drive to recruit junior doctors in the UK. At the same time, her husband – an anaesthetist – took a job in Saudi Arabia to get the training he needed to also work for the NHS. The couple’s daughter, Layan, known as Lily, was left in Egypt with her paternal grandparents. The grandparents’ health has since deteriorated to the point that they can no longer look after her. Abdelmeguid applied for Lily’s visa in July 2017. The application was rejected on the grounds that Abdelmeguid’s husband wasn’t in the UK at the time it was made. Government guidelines state that both parents of an applicant must be present unless there are “serious or compelling family or other considerations which would make it desirable not to refuse the application and suitable arrangements have been made in the UK for the applicant’s care”. Abdelmeguid said: “I felt shocked when I got the email overturning the decision. I could not believe it. I think I am still in shock. I can’t believe that after all that time of waiting and hoping and fighting, she will actually be here with me.” She expressed anger that her family had been made to suffer by the Home Office. “I believe that this period of separation has affected Lily’s psychology in a bad way,” she said. “She was suddenly left without her dad and her mum. She felt abandoned and unwanted. She kept asking me every time I video-called her whether she could get on the plane and come to me. She would tell me ‘you left me’. It has been very hard on both of us. I was being constantly tortured.” Believing that her appeal would not be successful, Abdelmeguid had already planned to leave the UK and practise medicine in a different country. “The decision to overturn Lily’s refusal has changed my plans drastically,” she said. “I was offered a job in a GP training programme which I had decided to decline if she was not going to be with me. My husband and I had started already planning to travel to another country to practise medicine, perhaps Ireland or Australia, as we did not feel safe in the UK for long-term plans.” Official statistics on tier 2 visas granted to health and social work staff show the NHS is increasingly reliant on people like Abdelmeguid, with numbers increasing from 2,921 in 2010 to 5,287 in 2016. But it appears some of these staff may be facing increasing difficulty in bringing their dependent children to live with them. The number of children, partners and dependents granted the right to live in Britain has dropped by 73% in a decade. Abdelmeguid said she could now commit to the NHS. “I can progress in my career now and join the GP training programme,” she said. Lily will start reception this September. Lily’s father, Dr Ahmed Ibrahim, will join his family in December after he finishes his training in Saudi Arabia. “I can’t wait to get Lily here,” said Abdelmeguid. “Her nursery kindly kept her place that I booked for her in November 2017. That’s how long I have been waiting. That’s how long Lily and I have been suffering.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/mar/21/france-plans-on-the-spot-fines-for-sexual-harassment-in-public","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-21T12:14:23Z","webTitle":"France plans on-the-spot fines for sexual harassment in public","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/21/france-plans-on-the-spot-fines-for-sexual-harassment-in-public","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/mar/21/france-plans-on-the-spot-fines-for-sexual-harassment-in-public","fields":{"headline":"France plans on-the-spot fines for sexual harassment in public","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"France is to introduce on-the-spot fines for sexual harassment in public places and lengthen the time-limit for filing rape complaints as part of new legislation against sexual violence. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, has said the aim is to ensure “women are not afraid to be outside”. The legislation, which will be presented at a cabinet meeting on Wednesday and go to parliament in the coming months, was prepared before the sexual harassment allegations against the Hollywood film producer Harvey Weinstein and the #MeToo movement, but it has gained prominence since. The law will also set a new legal age of consent – 15 – at which a minor is considered able to agree to a sexual relationship with an adult aged over 18. This move follows outrage over a case in which a rape charge was dropped when a court decided an 11-year-old girl had consented to sex with a man more than twice her age. The crackdown on sexual harassment would mean fines for “degrading or humiliating comments” or hostile and offensive “sexual or sexist” behaviour towards a person in a public place. The minister for gender equality, Marlène Schiappa, has explained this could include situations such as men aggressively asking a woman for her phone number dozens of times when she is clear she is not interested, as well as sexual intimidation and harassment on public transport. The legislation, which would be enforced by police officers issuing on-the-spot fines, is backed by 90% of the French public, according to an Ifop poll published on Wednesday. A 2016 study by a national association of transport users in France found that 83% of women using public transport said they had been subjected to catcalling or intimidating comments about their appearance. Schiappa said this week that the fines would range from €90 to €750. They could be far higher for repeat offenders or in the case of aggravating circumstances. “The idea is that it is high enough to be a deterrent but also that we could be sure the harasser can pay it immediately, so that the law can be efficient,” she said. Questioned over whether punishing harassment in public places was difficult to enforce, Schiappa told Le Monde this month: “It’s important that French laws state that it is forbidden to threaten, intimidate or follow women in the street.” She said it was part of a “cultural fight” by the government. At the UN in New York this month, Schiappa said: “We have to say: ‘Young men, you don’t have the right, you’re not allowed to follow women on the streets, to intimidate them.’” The new law will also give people who have been raped as children more time to file a complaint. They will be able to do so until they are 48, an extension of 10 years. This follows recent cases in which former child victims insisted time limits must be extended. In 2016, Flavie Flament, a French radio producer, accused the photographer David Hamilton of raping her when she was 13, but said the time limit had passed for her to press charges. Hamilton, 83, killed himself in 2016 after Flament went public with her allegations and others also surfaced. The bill also aims to increase sanctions against cyberstalking and online sexual harassment, particularly when committed by a group of several people targeting one person."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/mar/21/ryan-giggs-nervous-wales-manager-first-game-china-manchester-united","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-22T08:40:39Z","webTitle":"Ryan Giggs happy for Gareth Bale mania to take limelight before his Wales bow","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/mar/21/ryan-giggs-nervous-wales-manager-first-game-china-manchester-united","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/mar/21/ryan-giggs-nervous-wales-manager-first-game-china-manchester-united","fields":{"headline":"Ryan Giggs happy for Gareth Bale mania to take limelight before his Wales bow","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Ryan Giggs takes charge of his first Wales game on Thursday but believes the spotlight has been taken off him in China by Gareth Bale. The Real Madrid forward made a 7,500‑mile dash to Nanning on Monday to be part of Giggs’s squad to face the hosts in the opening game of the China Cup. Bale is set to be involved, probably as a substitute, with fans from across China expected to travel to Nanning’s 60,000-capacity stadium to see him. “It’s my first game and I want to get my best team out there,” Giggs said. “Gareth obviously gives everyone a massive lift and he is used to the spotlight. It was the same when David Beckham came into the United team – he took the limelight away from me.” Giggs said players such as Bale were “treated like gods” in the Far East but that he would carefully consider how to use the 28‑year‑old. “It’s an important part of the season and I won’t be taking any stupid risks,” the manager said. It is understood Wales will avoid a fine in the region of £100,000 if Bale plays. Giggs, asked if his side were under commercial and financial pressure to use him, said: “Yes, of course.” Giggs has said he will be more nervous than at any time during his playing career. “I never really got nervous as a player but I will be much more nervous tomorrow. As a player you want a little bit of nerves but generally speaking I never really got nervous. Coaching and management is completely different. “As a player you are quite selfish and you are just making sure you are doing your job in the team. As a manager there are so many things to think about that are constantly going through your mind. “It’s a case of: ‘Have you forgotten anything? What could be improved?’ It’s about preparing the team as best you can with your staff also. Afterwards it is just evaluating, seeing what you could have done better, and seeing what we did well.” Ashley Williams, who is set to continue as captain despite a poor season at Everton, has said he contemplated retiring from internationals after Wales failed to qualify for the World Cup. Chris Gunter will become Wales’ most capped outfield player with 86 should he be involved.

The harvest is the collection of ripe crops in the autumn, which has its own church festival: we gratefully collect what the all-powerful has put there for us. This sense of gathering up what is natural persists in the talk of “harvesting” cells in biological experiments (from 1946), but has become irreparably perverted in the euphemistic use of “harvesting” to mean hunting whales. “Data harvesting” itself emerged from scientific information management in the late 90s, and soon became a buzzphrase for online marketers. In other words, data harvesting is about as old as the modern web, and might even be viewed as its entire purpose. If something is “harvested”, it must spring, like wheat, from a renewable source. And so, as long as we continue trustingly to tell the tech giants everything about ourselves, the harvest will be fruitful for the dark farmers of our digital lives.

Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria, along with an earthquake in Mexico, wildfires in California, monsoon flooding in Bangladesh and a mudslide in Colombia, cost the Lloyd’s market £4.5bn in claims, more than double the previous year when it paid out £2.1bn. The hurricanes, which tore through the southern US and Caribbean last summer, hit Lloyd’s particularly hard because the US accounts for 44% of its business. It said it was its second costliest year for major claims behind 2011. Bruce Carnegie-Brown, the Lloyd’s chairman, said: “To date, the market has paid more than 50% by value of the claims notified in relation to Harvey, Irma and Maria, and is in the process of paying the rest.” He expects 2018 to be another challenging year, and added: “The market’s 2017 results are proof, if any were needed, that business as usual is not sustainable. As a result the market is embracing new ways of working.” Last year’s 330 natural disasters are estimated to have caused a global economic loss of $353bn (£251bn), with Harvey, Irma and Maria accounting for 60% of the insured losses. Inga Beale, the Lloyd’s chief executive, said: “The market experienced an exceptionally difficult year in 2017, driven by challenging market conditions and a significant impact from natural catastrophes. These factors mean that for the first time in six years Lloyd’s is reporting a loss.” The world’s oldest insurance market made a pretax loss of £2bn last year, compared with a £2.1bn profit the previous year. The group’s combined ratio – a measure of claims and costs as a proportion of premiums – worsened from 98% to 114%. A figure above 100% indicates a loss. Its annual report showed Beale was paid £1.3m last year, down from £1.5m in 2016. Along with other executives, she did not receive a bonus payout under the Lloyd’s performance plan last year because the LPP only pays out if the company makes an annual profit of more than £100m. Lloyd’s was one of the first UK businesses to publish its gender pay gap, revealing that women earn 32.1% less than men (for bonuses the gap is even bigger at 40.7%). Beale said she was “not proud of that at all” and that Lloyd’s was taking action, having signed up to the government’s women in finance charter and introduced a back to work programme for parents. Its goal is to have women in 40% of its top management jobs in the next five years, up from 33.8% today. Women were not allowed into the Lloyd’s underwriting room until 1973, when Liliana Archibald became the first female broker there. Lloyd’s reiterated that its new office in Brussels would be up and running by July, ready to start writing business in January. However, Beale was concerned about what would happen to existing insurance policies across the EU after Brexit. She urged European regulators to agree a solution soon, as transferring the contracts to new entities would be an “unnecessary expense and definitely doesn’t benefit the consumer”. Transferring insurance contracts would take 12-18 months and involve the courts, according to the Bank of England. It estimates 6 million UK policyholders and 30 million policyholders across the rest of the EU could be affected."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/mar/21/jack-leach-england-new-zealand-somerset-cricket","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-21T11:00:46Z","webTitle":"Jack Leach’s unlikely rise could solve England’s spin conundrum","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/mar/21/jack-leach-england-new-zealand-somerset-cricket","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/mar/21/jack-leach-england-new-zealand-somerset-cricket","fields":{"headline":"Jack Leach’s unlikely rise could solve England’s spin conundrum","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"When I first saw Jack Leach bowl six or seven years ago I may have made a similar mistake to the England selectors. Instinctively we all look for a natural athleticism in our young sportsmen that is identifiable by their effortless, feline movement. When everything happens gracefully with time to spare we nod to one another, earmarking another star. It was not like that for me when watching Leach in 2011, or for the selectors in 2017. Leach does not glide around the field like a gazelle; his muscles seldom ripple. He has lost a lot of hair; unusually he plays cricket in glasses; he does not ooze the eager bravado that can be so reassuring to coaches, who yearn for players that are forever “up for it”. Leach does not quite fit the identikit of the modern super-fit, super-trim sportsman. Yet in the West Country Leach is a bit of a hero. In the past two seasons he has done as much as anyone with his left-arm orthodox spin to keep Somerset in the first division of the County Championship. He may never be the complete Test cricketer but at least there may now be the realisation among the selectors – I’ve been convinced of this for a while – that he is the best available spinner in the country, although he has only been summoned to New Zealand after the discovery of a stress fracture in Mason Crane’s back. Leach learned of his call-up on a Somerset pre-season golf trip to Trevose in Cornwall last week. “I’d just played the worst round of my life. My golf’s shocking. I don’t even enjoy it and I’d just lost to Andy Hurry [Somerset’s new cricket director and a very moderate golfer]. It was a bad day until I got the call. Then it turned into a very good one, with the Somerset boys all so chuffed for me.” Their delight would have been genuine because Leach is universally liked at Taunton and he is increasingly admired after the way he handled his nightmarish winter of 2016-17, when doubts surfaced about his action after a routine test at Loughborough in September 2016 – no one had ever queried it before. To make matters worse the England and Wales Cricket Board made his situation public in the clumsiest of manners at the end of the tour to India when nearly everyone was puzzled that Liam Dawson rather than Leach had been called up. “The biggest thing I didn’t like was being worried that I was effectively cheating because that wasn’t something I was trying to do,” Leach recalled. “I wasn’t trying to gain an advantage from it. I just didn’t understand my bowling well enough. That’s why I look back on it all as a real positive. It made me understand my bowling more and it made me a better bowler. Those lower moments made me stronger. No doubt there will be more. I try not to get too emotional and just learn from every opportunity.” Leach, now 26, has shown his worth as a doughty competitor in tight situations for Somerset over the past two years – with bat as well as ball. There is no great mystery about his bowling. He is accurate; he has added more zip to his stock delivery; he is not intimidated by the prospect of bowling on turning pitches – some spinners are – and he has an impressively calm temperament. He has also trained hard, so he looks physically more robust. Moreover, he is growing in confidence as demonstrated by the way he coped with his first meeting with the national press, which is obviously an awesome experience. He says he learned much from watching Nathan Lyon during the Ashes. Australia’s Lyon was regarded as an unfashionable, one-dimensional spinner when he started, a bit of a journeyman. Not any more. Perhaps the same could happen to Leach, who is sharp enough to recognise that next winter’s tours to Sri Lanka and West Indies provide him with a big opportunity but he is realistic enough to take nothing for granted in the meantime."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/blog/2018/mar/21/talking-horses-ruby-walsh-aims-at-punchestown-return-after-leg-injury","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-21T10:35:45Z","webTitle":"Talking Horses: Ruby Walsh aims at Punchestown return after leg injury","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2018/mar/21/talking-horses-ruby-walsh-aims-at-punchestown-return-after-leg-injury","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/blog/2018/mar/21/talking-horses-ruby-walsh-aims-at-punchestown-return-after-leg-injury","fields":{"headline":"Talking Horses: Ruby Walsh aims at Punchestown return after leg injury","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Wednesday’s best bets, by Chris Cook Ruby Walsh is going to be back in action just five weeks from now, if he gets his own way about his recovery from last week’s reinjury of his broken leg. The 38-year-old has been given a bit more detail on the extent of the damage this morning and appears to be encouraged. “I saw my doctor, Diarmuid Moloney,” he said in quotes first reported by Racing UK. “The diagnosis is that it’s a very similar fracture on the inside of the original one, which has effectively opened up. “It’s good news in that the cast has come off and I am in an air-cushioned boot right now. I don’t know exactly how long it will take to heal but it means I am hopeful of getting back for Punchestown. Aintree is not going to happen for me, though. “The prognosis could have been a lot worse and I just have to treat this as just another setback. I am determined to get back in the saddle for Punchestown and hopefully finish the season on a high.” Walsh broke his right leg in mid-November, took four months out and returned to race-riding on the Thursday before the Cheltenham Festival. Having won two Grade Ones on the Festival’s first day, he suffered his latest injury in a fall in the RSA Chase. It was just his ninth ride since his comeback six days before. If it were me, I’d be worried about having got reinjured so quickly and would be thinking about a leisurely return, maybe in time for Listowel’s harvest festival, sacrificing the summer in favour of preserving my frame for another five years in the job. This kind of thinking is, of course, one of several excellent reasons why I’m not a jump jockey. ‘Leisurely’ does not appear in the vocabulary of those who choose that line of work; they are keenly aware that they can take as much time off as they like, be fighting fit and then break a limb on the first ride back. Good luck to Walsh and here’s hoping he gets a smoother run on his next comeback. Just Georgie (3.15) is an interesting 5-1 shot for a small-field novice handicap chase at Haydock, having dropped out of a Wetherby race yesterday that was worth half as much. This ex-pointer has a low strike-rate over his career but has been faring well with Danny Cook aboard since being stepped up to three miles. They won with some authority at Wetherby last month and Sue Smith’s eight-year-old fully deserves the 8lb rise he got for that. There’s more to come, though there will have to be against three last-time-out winners. There appears to be some interest at 14-1 in Eagle Ridge (3.50), making his handicap debut in the following hurdle race. His third run in novice company was his best and an extra three furlongs ought to help. At Chepstow, I’m thinking Market Road’s winning run might finally come up against the buffers, the grey being now 17lb higher than in October. The Bay Birch (4.00) only started her winning run last month, after 21 defeats and against just one other finisher, but I think there was some substance to that, on her second start after leaving Ireland. She still looks handily treated and is 11-4."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"science/2018/mar/26/can-you-solve-it-the-art-of-the-deal","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-26T06:10:17Z","webTitle":"Can you solve it?

By late February, they realised they had already reached more than 30% of their 2018 total. “It’s been mad,” said Simpson, who worked for Boddingtons’ brewery before landing in this tranquil part of south-west France from the UK 16 years ago. “Just mad. We’ve had people coming in saying, literally: ‘We’re here for a week and by the time we leave we’d like a house.’ They want to sort things out, get in, start qualifying for residency. They feel the clock’s ticking. There’s a deadline.” With its honeyed stones and half-timbered square, its pub, cricket club, tea rooms and Epicerie anglaise – digestive biscuits, Oxford marmalade, lime cordial and salt’n’vinegar crisps – Eymet is the most English corner of a region whose rolling hills and reliable, but not too unbearable, sun have long been popular with Brits. About 400 of this bastide town’s 2,600 inhabitants are UK nationals – and even as older residents grow increasingly worried about their post-Brexit retirement, an unexpected pre-Brexit boom is under way, of often younger Britons keen to make the move before it could be too late. Simpson, who before the referendum was scathing about the “sheer absurdity, the absolute idiocy” of it all, said she stillfelt “mortified ... even bereaved”. But, from a professional standpoint, she added: “We opened a new branch in Bergerac last month. In its first weekend, it sold three homes. We really can’t complain.” Across the square, Jane Fraser-Bryan, of Guyenne Immobilier Properties, told the same story. “Overwhelmed isn’t the word,” she said. “We have people showing up with cash itching to buy. Interest levels are maybe 20 times normal. Winters are usually so quiet here we shut for three weeks at Christmas. This time, we had three days off.” It’s almost as if, said Tom Campbell, “every Brit who’s ever dreamed of living on the continent but done nothing about it has woken up and thought: ‘If I don’t do it now, it’s never going to happen. Or at least, it’ll be a hell of a lot harder.’” House-hunting near Bergerac with his partner, Ella, Campbell – an internet security specialist from Sussex who works remotely – said the aim was “to be out of Brexit Britain, registered in France, as EU citizens with a right to reside, by 29 March next year. That way, we should be OK.” In practice, assuming the status quo transition period agreed this month comes into effect next March, British nationals looking to settle abroad, and EU citizens thinking of coming to Britain, should now have a little longer, until December 2020. But few seem willing to take the chance. “Things haven’t exactly gone the way the government said they would so far; I don’t see why anyone would think they will now,” said Lisa Reynolds, a freelance illustrator from Birmingham, who had made an offer on a converted barn near Monpazier, 40 minutes east of Eymet. She is hoping to move in over the summer, in time for her eldest to start primary school. “It does feel like the pressure’s on,” Reynolds said. “Yes, there’s massive uncertainty. But we’ve been coming here, talking about this, for ages. Brexit makes me so angry, but it’s forced us to take the plunge. In a way, I’m quite grateful.” But while some scramble to make the move, many of those who already have are fretting and quietly furious. Peter Timmins took early retirement from the bank he worked for in Cheshire and moved to a hamlet outside Eymet in 2014. “People really are very, very worried,” he said. “If the UK doesn’t get a deal, if it all goes up in smoke, we will be the losers. We already feel like bargaining chips. And whatever the politicians say, we have no clarity or certainty.” Timmins and his wife sold up in Britain and invested all they had in France, but he said he had no idea what exactly they would have to do to stay. “Will we just have to fill in a form?” he asked. “Apply for a carte de séjour? Will there be some kind of minimum income requirement?” He was angry, too, that the couple’s plans to stay a few years in France and then go somewhere else in the EU, perhaps to Spain or Portugal, appeared stymied. “As things stand, Brits on the continent are going to be effectively landlocked,” he said. “Free to stay, but not to move on.” Older Britons’ most serious concerns, Timmins said, were for the ever-falling value of their pensions (“people in their 70s are already taking pin-money jobs, gardening, cleaning, to top up their income”), and that the UK may one day no longer cover the healthcare costs of its pensioners abroad who paid British social security. “Private healthcare in France would leave some penniless,” he said. Younger residents, many running thriving businesses, see fewer problems. “I’m registered, in the system, paying French tax and social security, an established business with plenty of work,” said Adrian Kewell, a self-employed electrician who came to work on one job in 2007 and never quite left. “I’m really happy here.” At Eymet’s weekly market, a clutch of British stallholders were similarly unfazed. “It’s a bit ‘Brexit, what Brexit?’” said Karen Clinton, whose Secret Curry Club sells from half a dozen local markets. Andrea Lovesy and Carl Pope, who sell British food from porridge oats to pickle, said the fall in the exchange rate had not hurt them: “We’re taking in euros, buying in pounds.” Newcomers said Brexit had not dented their dream of a new life in the sun of south-west France. David and Denise White, from Northamptonshire, who opened Rose’s Vintage Tearooms in Eymet less than a year ago, came close to calling their whole project off the morning after the referendum. “But then someone said: ‘Just do it,’” said David, who had a tiling and plastering business. “And we did: bought in December 2016, moved in January, opened in May. We’ve been pretty much flat out ever since.” Like many, Rupert Bache, who has been in France for nearly 30 years – running Le Pub Gambetta with his French wife, Mathilde, for almost 10 of them – said he had “not quite managed to get round” to applying for French citizenship as he had promised he would do if Britain voted leave. “Me and paperwork don’t really get on,” he said. “But mainly, I keep dreaming something’s going to happen, that it won’t actually happen.” Mathilde was fed up with the whole thing. “Society has far, far bigger problems than Brexit,” she said. “Here at least, it’s basically a problem of the rich. And meanwhile in Bergerac, there are people sleeping in their cars … I really couldn’t care less about Brexit.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2018/mar/21/brexit-tories-urge-pm-to-reject-transition-deal-over-fishing-policy","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-21T10:18:23Z","webTitle":"Tory Brexiters urge PM to reject transition deal over fishing policy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/mar/21/brexit-tories-urge-pm-to-reject-transition-deal-over-fishing-policy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/mar/21/brexit-tories-urge-pm-to-reject-transition-deal-over-fishing-policy","fields":{"headline":"Tory Brexiters urge PM to reject transition deal over fishing policy","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Tory Brexiters have demanded that Theresa May reject the transition deal agreed between David Davis, the Brexit secretary, and his EU opposite number, Michel Barnier, in Brussels on Monday. The 13 Conservative MPs and Sammy Wilson of the DUP – whose 10 MPs give May her working majority in the Commons – have signed a letter condemning the failure of the draft withdrawal agreement to end the common fisheries policy as soon as the UK formally leaves the EU on March 30 2019. Instead, British fisheries will remain in the CFP – one of the most bitterly resented aspects of EU membership – until the end of the transition period in December 2020. In the final year of the transition agreement the UK will have no say in the policy, although the EU has said quotas will not change and there will be “consultations”. The letter says: “The effect of ending discards during this period without compensating measures will be a further disaster for the UK’s already shattered fishing fleet, particularly for the inshore fleet, further eroding prosperity in vulnerable coastal communities. These demands are completely unacceptable and would be rejected by the House of Commons.” The MPs are taking part in a protest on the Thames outside the Palace of Westminster on Wednesday morning. They have been joined by the former Ukip leader Nigel Farage and are throwing fish back into the river to underline their objection to the EU-imposed practice of discarding fish that do not meet quota rules. This is the first open revolt by the Brexiters since the letter from the European Research Group signed by 62 Conservative MPs setting out their red lines a month ago. Earlier this month, Michael Gove, the environment secretary, went to Scotland to make a common declaration with the Tory leader Ruth Davidson calling for a “fast exit” from the fisheries policy. On Tuesday, forced to answer questions from a hostile Commons on the failure to deliver on his pledge, Gove admitted he was also disappointed. But he insisted that MPs should keep their eyes on the final prize of leaving the EU altogether by 2020."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2018/mar/21/neil-hamilton-hits-out-at-childrens-childish-brexit-views-on-bbc","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-21T13:18:49Z","webTitle":"Neil Hamilton hits out at children's 'childish' Brexit views on BBC","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/mar/21/neil-hamilton-hits-out-at-childrens-childish-brexit-views-on-bbc","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/mar/21/neil-hamilton-hits-out-at-childrens-childish-brexit-views-on-bbc","fields":{"headline":"Neil Hamilton hits out at children's 'childish' Brexit views on BBC","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The Ukip Welsh assembly member Neil Hamilton has posted a video in which he claims to have “triggered leftie luvvies” including Gary Lineker, after Hamilton complained to the BBC that children were giving “childish” answers about Brexit in a “biased and absurd” radio broadcast. Hamilton publicised his complaint to the BBC and Ofcom after a section of Monday’s World at One on Radio 4. During the programme the BBC reporter Tomos Morgan was interviewing children at a Welsh primary school about their views on Brexit. One 10-year-old told the BBC: “I don’t want to leave Brexit because even though we have to give money, they give us money too, to improve our schools and community.” And a nine-year-old said: “I think it is a bad idea because one of my friends in year three/four says she wanted to be a music singer, well, teacher, and someone asked her, she said, well, if I want to go around the world to see different music and see how it is, she won’t be able to because we’ve left breakfast [sic].” Hamilton’s complaint included the claim that Morgan “failed to question any of the patently childish answers given to him”. Describing it as a “mawkish puff piece”, Hamilton said: “Every child who featured on the programme was anti-Brexit and the segment lacked any form of political balance.” Hamilton said in his video, published on Tuesday evening, that it was “a real joy” to see “leftie luvvies get really triggered”, naming the Match of the Day presenter Lineker and the LBC presenter James O’Brien, among others. “We’ve heard the childish responses of the children,” Hamilton said, claiming they seemed “positively grown up” compared with the “collective squeals” of the “snowflakes” who had mocked his initial complaint on social media. During the interviews, one 11-year-old said: “I know that there’s a lot of people who have friends who are in Europe, and if we were to leave they might not have been able to get in. I am aware that the people that can come into the country who may not always do good things, and they can do bad things, but on the other hand you do have relatives and friends. It’s better to see them in real life than just Skyping all the time and stuff.” The inspiration for the radio segment was the announcement by the Welsh government of a consultation among children about Brexit. The Young Wales network of organisations is involved in plans to contact children aged 11 and above, while schools will be recording the views of seven- to 11-year-olds. The Welsh children’s minister, Huw Irranca-Davies, said: “Our children are our future, so it’s absolutely vital we ensure their views and concerns are listened to.” In his complaint, Hamilton quoted a 2016 survey by the TES suggesting that 75% of teachers supported remaining in the EU. The true figure was 70%. Hamilton claimed: “The dangers of bias and indoctrination in the classroom are high, even if done unconsciously.” Another Ukip Welsh assembly member, Gareth Bennett, has claimed the Welsh government’s consultation is “part of a sinister plot by the left”. Responding to Hamilton’s complaint, a BBC spokesperson said: “The World at One reported on a recent Welsh government initiative to consult children and young people about the Brexit process. As part of the programme we heard from children who gave their own opinion about Brexit, which we continue to report on impartially and fairly.” Hamilton, who is the leader of Ukip in Wales, was elected to the Welsh assembly in May 2016. He was previously the Conservative MP for Tatton in Cheshire before losing his seat to Martin Bell in 1997 after the “cash for questions” scandal."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/mar/21/bill-to-give-medical-staff-right-to-refuse-role-in-abortions-condemned","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-21T10:02:54Z","webTitle":"Bill to give medical staff right to refuse role in abortions condemned","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/mar/21/bill-to-give-medical-staff-right-to-refuse-role-in-abortions-condemned","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/mar/21/bill-to-give-medical-staff-right-to-refuse-role-in-abortions-condemned","fields":{"headline":"Bill to give medical staff right to refuse role in abortions condemned","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Pro-choice groups have condemned an attempt to create new laws that would allow doctors and nurses to refuse to take part in abortions on moral grounds. A private bill going through the House of Lords that would expand rights of conscientious objection for healthcare professionals has been dismissed as unnecessary by abortion providers and campaigners. Those in favour of the bill, sponsored by the Northern Irish crossbench peer Nuala O’Loan, insisted their aim was not to restrict abortion but to uphold freedom of belief and religion they claim is under threat in hospitals since a contentious supreme court ruling in 2014. The conscientious objection (medical activities) bill passed its second reading earlier this year and is set for a line-by-line examination during its committee stage, which begins on Friday. If it becomes law it would allow doctors, nurses, midwives or even pharmacists to refuse to not only take part in abortions but also from any indirect preparatory work, such as delegating colleagues or post-procedure care. As well as abortion, the bill would also allow healthcare professionals to refuse to take part in withdrawing life support and certain kinds of research into embryos. But the British Pregnancy Advisory Service (BPAS), the UK’s leading abortion provider, said that the proposed law would “enable a tiny number of people” to hinder women seeking abortions in the NHS. Clare Murphy, BPAS’s director of external affairs, suggested that the expanded rights to conscientiously object would allow nurses to “refuse to bring a woman a glass of water because she has had an abortion”. “There is already an extremely tolerant attitude towards those who do not wish to partake in providing certain aspects of healthcare,” she said. “Our feeling is that this bill is a solution in search of a problem, but one which could have profoundly negative consequences for women needing care.” That warning was echoed by Kerry Abel, the chair of pro-choice advocates Abortion Rights. “The law currently already provides healthcare workers with these protections,” she insisted. “Extending this protection to tasks not directly related to the abortion would be to the detriment of women needing to end a pregnancy and the healthcare staff committed to providing that care.” But Lady O’Loan, a former law lecturer and Northern Irish police ombudsman, said her bill was about upholding the right to freedom of belief, not about restricting access to abortion. When introducing the bill in the House of Lords, she said health workers deserved the same rights that pacifist conscientious objectors were given during both world wars. “If you make people do things which they believe are morally unacceptable then the integrity of them as a health service professional would be seriously impacted,” she said. While she was personally opposed to abortion as a Catholic, she said that her bill did not seek special treatment as many in the NHS were against abortion for non-religious reasons. The right to not take part in abortions is already written into the 1967 Abortion Act, but O’Loan said that a 2014 supreme court ruling meant these protections were now too narrowly defined. “The section of the Abortion Act provides only very limited protection for a very limited number of people: those who are physically engaged in abortion. It would mean a midwife would have to delegate somebody to do something which she cannot in all conscience do.” For many decades, hospitals had allowed doctors and nurses to absent themselves from even indirect involvement in abortions, which had worked “reasonably well”, she said. But a test case by two Catholic midwives from Glasgow that reached Britain’s highest court four years ago had ended with a ruling which upended the previous arrangements. Mary Doogan and Concepta Wood, two labour ward sisters at Glasgow’s Southern general hospital, had for decades been allowed to opt out entirely from abortions, including delegating colleagues to the procedure. But after a management reorganisation, they were told that arrangement had to end. A lengthy legal tussle ended in 2014 with the supreme court ruling that the 1967 Act’s conscience clause only covered “hands-on” involvement in abortion and not the indirect delegation that the two midwives also refused to do. Doogan said that while it had always been difficult for those like her who considered abortion to be “abhorrent” to work in obstetrics and gynaecology, the court’s judgment meant some people were choosing not to join the profession because of fears they would be forced to assist with abortions against their objections. The 63-year-old, who has not returned to the NHS since her court case began, said that the health service desperately needed more midwives and doctors in obstetrics, pointing out the Royal College of Midwives estimates the NHS is short of about 3,500 midwives. “If we get our consciences protected there might be the possibility of more people coming back in,” Doogan suggested. The argument that expanding conscience protections would hamper access to abortion and undermine women’s rights was “stupid and hollow”, she said. “That is such a load of rubbish – getting an abortion is easier than going to the dentist.” Although O’Loan said her bill addressed a non-partisan issue, Labour has said it will oppose its passage through the House of Lords. The long-term fate of the legislation is uncertain, she admitted: the government has remained neutral in the Lords but not yet indicated to her if they would support it should it reach the Commons, although at least one Tory backbencher – Fiona Bruce – has said they would sponsor it."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2018/mar/21/carpetright-moss-bros-kingfisher-high-street-retail-mothercare","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-21T16:26:35Z","webTitle":"Carpetright, Moss Bros, Kingfisher and New Look hit by retail woes","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/mar/21/carpetright-moss-bros-kingfisher-high-street-retail-mothercare","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/mar/21/carpetright-moss-bros-kingfisher-high-street-retail-mothercare","fields":{"headline":"Carpetright, Moss Bros, Kingfisher and New Look hit by retail woes","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The gloom on the high street deepened on Wednesday as struggling Carpetright said it was set to close stores, Moss Bros issued a stark profits warning, B&amp;Q reported falling sales, Mothercare said it remained in talks with its bankers and New Look’s creditors voted to slim down the struggling fashion retailer. Carpetright, Britain’s biggest carpet retailer, did not reveal how many outlets might shut, but it is believed to be considering axing up to a quarter of its 409 UK stores. A decision is expected in the next few weeks. It said the closures were needed to address the “legacy property issue” resulting from overexpansion under its previous management. The company is considering a company voluntary arrangement (CVA), a process designed to stave off insolvency by closing stores and negotiating lower rents with landlords. It has arranged an emergency short-term loan of £12.5m from shareholder Meditor in return for an additional 5% stake and also wants to raise between £40m and £60m through an equity issue. Carpetright has issued a series of profits warnings in recent months, sending its shares sharply lower. At their current level of 41p, the business is valued at less than £30m. The potential Carpetright closures come as fashion retailer New Look’s creditors met on Wednesday afternoon, with 98% voting for a CVA that will involve the closure of up to 60 of its 593 stores and rent reductions on dozens more. Landlords leaving the meeting expressed frustration at taking a financial hit and feared more retailers would follow the same route as New Look. Several said they were worried the CVA would not solve New Look’s problems. The retailer has debts of £1.2bn against sales of £1.4bn last year. One said: “This is a chronically badly-run business. It’s a difficult climate out there but to load up a retailer with this sort of debt is just crazy.” Clothing suppliers at the meeting expressed relief that the chain would live on. One said: “It’s a sensible CVA. New Look has continued to pay suppliers on time and that gives it the best chance of survival.” There was grim news from another clothing retailer, Moss Bros, which warned that profits for the coming year were likely to be “materially lower than current market expectations”. The company’s shares crashed 23% to 45p as it said the suit hire business was “challenging” and that the number of shoppers on the high street remained lower than hoped, “reflecting a more cautious consumer environment”. The company also admitted that sales were affected by stock shortages after Moss Bros made changes to the way it sourced clothing in an attempt to offset Brexit-driven inflation in costs. At B&amp;Q, which is owned by Kingfisher, sales dropped by 5.1% as the chief executive, Véronique Laury, described the outlook for the UK as “uncertain”. Kingfisher’s profits for the year to end January were down by 10% to £682m. The slowdown at Kingfisher comes despite troubles at its major competitor Homebase, where sales have slumped since a botched takeover by Australian group Bunnings. The group is considering closing as many as 40 stores putting hundreds of jobs at risk. Meanwhile, Mothercare, the struggling mother and baby retailer that is in talks with its banks, has been given more time to secure extra funding. Its lenders have deferred key tests of its financial covenants – which had been due on Saturday – until May. The retailer said talks on the terms of its existing loans were “progressing constructively” and it hopes to reach agreement by mid-May when its results are due. “Retail Black Wednesday: the sequel,” said Patrick O’Brien, the UK retail research director at market research firm GlobalData. “Just three weeks after the administrations of Toys R Us and Maplin were announced on the same day dubbed ‘Black Wednesday’, it appears the sequel is already upon us, with Moss Bros, Carpetright, Mothercare and New Look all being in the news for the wrong reasons.” Slowing consumer spending, rising costs and the switch to buying online have bitten down hard on retailers in the past six months, with businesses including electronics store Maplin, children’s specialist Toys R Us, furniture retailer MultiYork and bedmaker Warren Evans calling in administrators and putting thousands of staff out of work. Expensive homeware such as sofas, kitchens and carpets have been hit particularly hard as the housing market has slowed. Department stores House of Fraser, Debenhams and Marks &amp; Spencer are either reducing the size of stores or closing them as they try to adapt to changing shopping habits. The recent cold weather also hit trade for many retailers, with sales at John Lewis down 14% that week, while Ocado warned on Tuesday that it took a £1.5m profit hit from the “beast from the east”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/mar/21/iranian-banker-malta-corruption-scandal-money-laundering-charges","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-22T11:11:16Z","webTitle":"Authorities seize control of bank at center of Malta corruption scandal","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/21/iranian-banker-malta-corruption-scandal-money-laundering-charges","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/mar/21/iranian-banker-malta-corruption-scandal-money-laundering-charges","fields":{"headline":"Authorities seize control of bank at center of Malta corruption scandal","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Maltese authorities have seized control of a bank at the centre of a corruption scandal that was exposed by the murdered journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia. Malta’s banking regulator has frozen all transactions for customers, executives and shareholders at Pilatus Bank with immediate effect following the arrest and indictment in the US of its Washington-based Iranian owner, Ali Sadr, who was charged on Tuesday with money laundering and evading sanctions. Pilatus, which reported €308 million of assets in 2016, has been the subject of intense controversy in Malta and was known to have held accounts for a top official in the government of the prime minister, Joseph Muscat, and members of Azerbaijan’s ruling family. The Malta Financial Services Authority announced within hours of the indictment that it that it had removed Sadr as a director of the bank and suspended his voting rights. The MFSA said it was also barring Sadr and any other directors or top executives from withdrawing funds from the bank. Pilatus must also obtain approval before being able to transfer any of its own capital. Amidst confusion over whether all Pilatus accounts had been frozen, the regulator issued a second notice on Wednesday evening stating no customers could move money without its permission. “The Bank has been directed not to transact any business whatsoever irrespective of the client or the counterpart,” it warned. Sadr is charged with a six-count indictment that alleges he participated in a scheme to illegally funnel $115m in payments from Venezuela to Iranian individuals, in violation of US sanctions and anti-money laundering rules. The criminal charges raise significant new questions about Pilatus’s future operations. The US investigation was initiated in 2013, authorities said. Pilatus opened an office in Mayfair, London, in April 2017 after being granted a “passport” to operate in the UK by the Maltese regulator. However, British banking watchdogs have never granted it permission to open accounts for UK resident customers. A spokesperson for Britain’s Financial Conduct Authority said: “The FCA is aware of the issue and has been actively engaging with the firm, the home state regulator the Malta FSA and the PRA [Prudential Regulation Authority]. The firm is passporting in from Malta under the Capital Requirements Directive but has not opened for business in the UK. We will continue to monitor the situation closely.” The development poses questions about how Sadr, who is the son of one of Iran’s richest men, came to win – and keep – a banking licence in the Mediterranean country. The bank was the subject of a detailed investigation by Malta’s anti-money-laundering agency, the FIAU, in 2016. The FIAU alleged in a report that the bank showed a “glaring, possibly deliberate disregard” for money-laundering controls. Pilatus has said in the past that it denies any wrongdoing and fully adheres to all laws and regulations. Pilatus did not respond to a request for comment. The bank was not named in the criminal indictment and has not been accused of wrongdoing by US authorities. But the charges against Sadr have bolstered critics of the bank. David Casa, a Maltese MEP who is a frequent critic of Muscat, said in a letter to the chair of the European Banking Authority, that the indictment called for a further investigation into Pilatus. He also called on the EBA to examine whether Malta’s chief banking regulator, the MFSA, was aware of Sadr’s alleged criminal activity and whether the decision to grant the bank a banking licence was the result of favourable political interference by an official within the Muscat government. He pointed to an allegation by the FIAU that Keith Schembri, Muscat’s controversial chief of staff, had received questionable payments, which originated from Russian nationals, into a Pilatus account that was held in Schembri’s name. Schembri has said the payments were a legitimate repayment of debts from a friend and has denied wrongdoing. Caruana Galizia, who was killed in a car bomb in October, was being sued by Pilatus for defamation and for causing damage to the bank’s reputation at the time of death. The lawsuit was later dropped. Caruana Galizia had made a wide range of enemies, reporting on a political system rife with corruption, businesses seemingly used to launder money or pay bribes, and a criminal justice system that seemed incapable, or unwilling, to take on the controlling minds behind it all. Caruana Galizia’s three sons – Matthew, Paul and Andrew – welcomed the news that criminal charges would be considered by a court. “We wish our mother could have been alive to see it happen,” the brothers said. The US case against Sadr was brought by the US Department of Justice and by local law enforcement officers in the district attorney’s office in Manhattan. In court documents, prosecutors have alleged that Sadr – who is referred to as Ali Sadr Hashemi Nejad – skimmed $115m of a nearly $500m Venezuelan construction contract through the US banking system. He is alleged to have used a vast network of front companies and foreign bank accounts to mask Iran’s business dealings in Venezuela, and then used entities in Switzerland, Turkey, and British Virgin Islands to funnel the funds back to Iran. The court records alleged that a business owned by an Iranian conglomerate called Stratus Group, which was controlled by Sadr’s family, entered into a multimillion-dollar arrangement with the Venezuelan government in 2004 in which they agreed to an infrastructure project to build thousands of homes in Venezuela. According to prosecutors, Sadr took steps to hide the role of Iranian parties in the transaction as he funneled proceeds from the contract through the US banking system. In one case, Sadr and an unnamed co-conspirator used passports they acquired in St Kitts and Nevis and an address in the UAE to incorporate two entities outside Iran to receive the dollar payments. It is alleged that one entity, called Clarity Trade and Finance, was incorporated in Switzerland, while another, Stratus International Contracting, was incorporated in Turkey. The two entities were used to funnel the dollar payments to an offshore entity in the British Virgin Islands. Clarity also wired $2m in proceeds from the Venezuelan project back into the US, where it was used to purchase real estate in California. The justice department said that the case was being handled by the terrorism and international narcotics unit."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/mar/22/syrian-rebel-victory-in-afrin-reveals-strength-of-turkish-backed-force","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-22T05:00:16Z","webTitle":"Syrian rebel victory in Afrin reveals strength of Turkish-backed force","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/22/syrian-rebel-victory-in-afrin-reveals-strength-of-turkish-backed-force","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/mar/22/syrian-rebel-victory-in-afrin-reveals-strength-of-turkish-backed-force","fields":{"headline":"Syrian rebel victory in Afrin reveals strength of Turkish-backed force","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The Syrian rebel commander Abu Ahmed was smiling. His troops had played a key role in Turkey’s assault on the Kurdish enclave of Afrin in northern Syria, a fight they have won. Abu Ahmed is a senior officer in the 10,000-strong rebel force that, with Turkish backing and instigation, took control of Afrin on Sunday after a two-month battle. His name has been changed, along with others, to freely discuss their sensitive relations with their backers in Ankara. Amid the series of defeats at the hands of the Syrian government of Bashar al-Assad and its Russian backers, victory in Afrin is one of the rare successes for rebel fighters in recent years. Their quick victory in a fight against an adversary trained and armed by the US, which had ousted Islamic State from vast tracts of territory, underlined the growing power of a rebel army in Syria’s north, armed and paid by Turkey, that now comprises three legions and controls a growing swathe of territory. Throughout northern Syria, bands of disparate rebel groups have fallen in line behind the Ankara-backed project, which has imposed military discipline on fighters that Washington, while covertly backing, had deemed too fractious and weak to defeat Isis. “I mean, even Bashar al-Assad didn’t succeed in uniting us,” said one rebel official. “We are militarily and politically weaker than the regime, which is using scorched-earth tactics and areas are falling while we are accusing each other of betrayal. “The people now hate all the rebel factions, and this will change when there is a unified army,” he added. Critics, including within the opposition, say they are no more than mercenaries fighting Turkey’s battles, pitting Syrians against Syrians. Their fighters, while acknowledging they have no ultimate say in the broad contours of the war, disagree. They say their new army, now close to 20,000 strong, will be able to take on al-Qaida-linked militants in the northern province of Idlib. They say the force, as it grows, will strengthen their hand in peace negotiations in Syria, even as Assad’s Russia-backed forces claw back territory around the country. And, if a deal is reached one day to oust Assad, they say they can work with the government’s army to impose order in all of Syria. “If Assad stays with his apparatchiks this will not be over, but if there is a transition away from Assad and his top echelons in the leadership, we can work together with the army with the support of the international community to impose security on all the liberated areas,” said Abu Ahmed’s political aide. “And if we are tricked, the weapons are still there, and the fighters are there, and it will be a fight to the death.” Turkey announced the launch of the assault on Afrin in January, after the US said it would raise a border force to patrol Syria’s frontiers from Kurdish militias that had fought with Washington against Isis and liberated the city of Raqqa. Turkey, a Nato member, had long tolerated the American alliance with the People’s Protection Units (YPG), which Ankara considers the Syrian branch of its own Kurdish separatist insurgency, because of American assurances that it was temporary. The battle for Afrin displaced tens of thousands of people and cost nearly 300 civilian lives by the estimates of war monitors, and the rebels’ arrival was accompanied by widespread looting of homes and shops in Afrin city. It also raised accusations that Turkey and its rebel allies intend to change the demography of the area by settling Arab refugees to outnumber indigenous Kurds. It was Ankara’s second major campaign in Syria. In August 2016 it launched Euphrates Shield, an operation that relied on Syrian rebel groups to clear towns controlled by Isis from the border and halt Kurdish expansion west of the Euphrates river. After the campaign, Turkey sought to better organise and train the rebels allied with it, providing them with training, arms, and even a monthly stipend for the fighters in the military factions that join the alliance. The three legions that form the rebel army, which nominally falls under the authority of a barebones transitional government formed with Turkish backing, are led by defected Syrian soldiers who are themselves advised by senior Turkish military officers, according to rebel officials and commanders. Rebels say they conducted the vast majority of the fighting in Afrin, backed by Turkish artillery and fighter planes. They are convinced that the battle was an overall strategic victory, because it will open a ground corridor into nearby Idlib province, a stronghold for al-Qaida-linked militants, and link them up with other rebel factions that want to join the coalition there. While acknowledging their lack of agency in determining the course of the war, they see no problem in aligning themselves with Ankara, given what they see as a convergence of interests in Syria. The prospect of a united rebel army, as the war in Syria enters its eighth year, appears to overpower their dependency on an ally with whom their goals might not always align. “The main goal is to build an army for the opposition, and we built a nucleus,” said one rebel commander. “The regime doesn’t make its own decisions, it’s basically a military faction like all the rebels, and neither does the opposition. When the international powers agree, [the war in] Syria will be over, and when that happens, time will help everyone forget.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2018/mar/21/tomb-raider-alicia-vikander-lara-croft-discuss-with-spoilers","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-21T11:08:22Z","webTitle":"Tomb Raider: new Lara, Daddy Croft, and Indiana Jones ripoffs - discuss with spoilers","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/mar/21/tomb-raider-alicia-vikander-lara-croft-discuss-with-spoilers","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/mar/21/tomb-raider-alicia-vikander-lara-croft-discuss-with-spoilers","fields":{"headline":"Tomb Raider: new Lara, Daddy Croft, and Indiana Jones ripoffs - discuss with spoilers","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Video game adaptations have a long history of being, well … mostly completely terrible, thanks largely to the vapid efforts of one Uwe Boll. And even the most ardent Angelina Jolie fan would presumably admit that the Tomb Raider movies were hardly the Oscar-winner’s finest hour. So why would Alicia Vikander, Hollywood It girl and current art house dahling, sign up to star as Lara Croft in a reboot of the action-adventure series? Were there no Marvel superhero parts available? Critics have reacted with predictable sniffiness to Norwegian director Roar Uthaug’s debut Hollywood outing, with the movie rated just 50% on the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes. And yet a quick glance at the site’s rundown of its best and worst reviewed video game adaptations suggests that might not be such a bad score after all. In fact, hang on a minute! It’s the joint highest ever rating for this type of film, sharing that honour with last year’s animated Resident Evil: Vendetta. What’s your verdict? Should Lara have been allowed to climb out of her tomb and back into multiplexes? Or would you bury her back under some ancient rubble for at least a few more decades? Here’s your chance to give a verdict on the film’s key talking points. Old Lara vs new Lara Who boasts the finest cut-glass English accent? Angelina or Alicia? Did the new movie’s slightly more grounded approach appeal more than the 00s action cheese of the original films? Who made the best Daddy Croft, newcomer Dominic West, or the earlier films’ Jon Voight? And were the new movie’s screenwriters right to dispense with any real romantic interest for Lara this time around, hunky Daniel Craig replaced by a fellow from the local Indian restaurant who never quite summons up the coverage to ask Lara out? East End chicanery and origins story fatigue In 2001’s Lara Croft: Tomb Raider, we first meet Jolie as she is fighting a giant robot to retrieve a priceless diamond. In the new movie, Croft is living among the hoi polloi of Shoreditch, barely scraping a living as a bicycle courier because she refuses to admit her father is dead and lay claim to her spectacular inheritance. It’s a neat way to make Lara more relatable, but does rather fail when we know she only has to sign daddy’s death forms and walk half a mile south down Bishopsgate to be restored to the lap of luxury. Did you appreciate bearing witness to the birth of a legend? Or would you have happily skipped the first 45 minutes of the film? Alicia Vikander: action hero Despite failing to register with the critics, Jolie’s stint as Lara Croft did achieve the feat of setting her up as one of the more bankable female action heroes of the past 20 years, leading to sojourns in Mr and Mrs Smith, Wanted and Salt. Vikander is capable of her own uniquely spiky form of feminine menace, as exemplified by her sinister turn as a flirty robot in Alex Garland’s Ex Machina, and she more than holds her own as the all-action archaeological explorer. Crucially, the Swedish actor always looks genuinely capable of taking down stronger male opponents, though the CGI-tastic finale in which she climbs through a collapsing torrent of boulders surely rather beggared belief. The Indiana Jones rips Given the inspiration for the original video game was a certain whip-cracking archaeologist, it’s probably a little unfair to criticise Tomb Raider for swiping too heavily from Raiders of the Lost Ark. But there was a moment down in the final resting place of long-dead Japanese queen Himiko when nobody in the auditorium would have been too surprised to hear Harrison Ford whisper “close your eyes” as the baddies furtively prised open her ancient tomb. Ditto the ladder over a sharp fall, which recalled the precarious bridge scene in Temple of Doom. Did Tomb Raider do enough to freshen up the genre? I thought the deadly puzzle with the multi-coloured stones was a neat spin. The franchise-building intrigue Forgive me if I haven’t a clue what Trinity is, or why the sinister organisation is so desperate to dig up 2,000-year-old zombie queens. The end of Tomb Raider left us wondering if Croft’s one-time guardian Ana Miller (Kristin Scott Thomas) is somehow connected to the evil grouping. Regular players of the video game can perhaps enlighten us as to why exactly we should give a damn. But at least this means we might see Scott Thomas get her evil on in a sequel – Uthaug’s movie has so far done quite reasonably at the international box office, so that’s a prospect we shouldn’t write off just yet.

Perhaps this is because Britain is an island. Perhaps it is because deep sea fishing was always prodigiously dangerous and heroic. Perhaps it is because fishing communities are particularly tightly knit. Or perhaps it is because, unlike mining and merchant shipbuilding, UK fishing continues to survive. Fishing is a relatively small industry, but it still sustains about 24,000 jobs, a third of them in fishing itself, double that in processing, and half of the total in Scotland, particularly in the north-east. Whatever the reason, the fact of that resonance is beyond dispute, as the government has again discovered this week. Under pressure from north-east Scottish and south-west English fishing constituencies that voted Conservative, the UK has pressed to be unhooked from the EU’s common fisheries policy as soon as Brexit officially occurs in March 2019. The EU, in contrast, argued that the CFP should continue through the transition period. At the start of March, the chancellor, Philip Hammond, said the government was open to continued inclusion. A week later, the environment secretary, Michael Gove, and the Scottish Conservative leader, Ruth Davidson – a leaver and a remainer – teamed up to press the case for leaving the CFP during the transition. This week in Brussels, that aspiration was dashed when the transition terms kept Britain firmly within the CFP until December 2020. That outcome was predictable, as were the political consequences. Although Theresa May made climbdowns on other important issues – including free movement, migrant rights, Northern Ireland and the duration of the transition – only fishing has roused the Brexiters to protest. Much of that is explained by Scottish Tory embarrassment. The Tories have failed to do what their fishing industry voters wanted. The SNP, which backs remaining in the EU and the CFP, has been quick to claim that Scotland is being betrayed. The truth is that both parties have been opportunist – the Tories by pretending that CFP withdrawal was easily attainable, the nationalists by pretending they would give fishing communities what they want. Mr Gove tried to make the best of a political bad job in the Commons on Tuesday. Wait one more year and all would be well, he argued. But that’s not true. The political disappointments will continue after Brexit because the UK fishing industry is not going to get the total control over fishing in UK waters and access to UK markets that it has pressed for. Nor should it. Inside the EU or out, fishing requires internationally agreed management of fleets, vessels, catches and sustainability. The CFP has been tough for the UK fishing industry, for a variety of reasons, especially in eastern England, where it has been destroyed. But something strikingly similar to the CFP is likely to be the only practical alternative, whether fishing policy is controlled in Brussels, London or Edinburgh."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"society/2018/mar/21/damning-report-finds-serious-failings-in-nhs-mental-health-services","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-21T00:01:05Z","webTitle":"Damning report finds ‘serious failings’ in NHS mental health services","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/mar/21/damning-report-finds-serious-failings-in-nhs-mental-health-services","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/mar/21/damning-report-finds-serious-failings-in-nhs-mental-health-services","fields":{"headline":"Damning report finds ‘serious failings’ in NHS mental health services","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Vulnerable mental health patients are suffering serious harm, and in some cases dying, because of “serious failings” in their treatment, the NHS ombudsman has warned. Mistakes such as failing to diagnose or treat patients properly and discharging them from hospital too soon can have “catastrophic consequences”, said Rob Behrens. In a report analysing more than 200 complaints about NHS mental health care Behrens highlighted “failings that have occurred, and continue to occur, in specialist mental health services in England, and the devastating toll this takes on patients and their families”. His findings come two weeks after the Guardian revealed that coroners had issued NHS providers of care with legal warning notices over 271 deaths of mental health patients that occurred in England and Wales between 2012 and 2017 following failings in the treatment they had provided. The report identifies five “common failings” by mental health trusts that can lead to patients suffering distress or harm or dying avoidably. They include inadequate assessment of the patient’s risk of suffering harm or committing suicide and poor communication between health professionals and the patient or their family. The report is a dossier of detailed but anonymous cases which, in some cases, led the ombudsman to conclude that patients were subjected to care so poor that it was “injustice [that was] shocking and tragic”. The failings illustrate how far the NHS has to go if it is to improve care in the dramatic way that ministers and health service bosses have promised in recent years. For example, a Ms J died after she had a life-threatening reaction, called neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS), to being prescribed an antipsychotic drug for a psychotic episode she was having. Doctors dismissed the physical symptoms of her condition. “Had doctors identified NMS, it is likely that Ms J would have received the appropriate treatment and survived. As such, we concluded that Ms J’s death was avoidable,” the report said. Her death illustrated “the human cost of service failures”, Behrens said. In another case, a mental health professional decided that a Mr O was suffering from an episode of psychosis for the first time. However, the worker breached National Institute of Health and Care Excellence guidelines by not assessing the patient for signs of post-traumatic stress disorder. The NHS trust’s risk assessment “was too brief and inadequate”, the report said. “It is shocking but unsurprising to hear of so many times where services failed to provide even the basics in terms of offering the right treatment, operating safely or treating people with dignity and respect,” said Sophie Corlett, director of external relations at Mind, the mental health charity. “This report exposes some alarming care failings,” said Prof Wendy Burn, the president of the Royal College of Psychiatrists. She urged ministers to ensure that NHS mental health services had enough money to do their jobs properly. “Unfortunately, our latest research shows mental health trusts’ income is lower than it was in 2012.” Although the cases relate to “systemic failings” that occured before 2016, when the NHS agreed to overhaul mental health care through the Five Year Forward View for Mental Health, the same sorts of failings are still happening, said Behrens. Understaffing of NHS mental health services is a key reason, he added. For example, the number of mental health nurses fell 13% between 2009 and 2017, and England’s 53 mental health trusts are short of about 10% of staff. NHS mental health trusts upheld 65% of 14,106 written complaints they received in 2016-17, higher than the 61% upheld by acute (physical) health trusts. For that reporting year, the ombudsman investigated 352 complaints about mental health trusts, upholding 37%, compared to 40% for acute trusts. • This article was amended on 21 March 2018. An earlier version referred to complaints against NHS mental health trusts in 2016-17 that were upheld by the ombudsman. Those figures related to complaints received by NHS mental health trusts themselves."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"cities/2018/apr/04/jakartas-urban-poor-have-found-a-new-way-to-fight-city-hall-and-win","type":"article","sectionId":"cities","sectionName":"Cities","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-04T11:30:09Z","webTitle":"Jakarta’s urban poor have found a new way to fight City Hall – and win","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2018/apr/04/jakartas-urban-poor-have-found-a-new-way-to-fight-city-hall-and-win","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/cities/2018/apr/04/jakartas-urban-poor-have-found-a-new-way-to-fight-city-hall-and-win","fields":{"headline":"Jakarta’s urban poor have found a new way to fight City Hall – and win","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"On the official spatial planning map of Jakarta, Arti Astati’s neighbourhood on the coast is painted blue. As far as City Hall is concerned, there are no people there. Just the sea. Astati begs to differ. This informal urban neighbourhood, or kampung, is home to about 1,000 people, many of whom work in the green mussel fishery. But the city did not recognise their existence – and after decades of neglect, it threatened the kampung with forced eviction. “They say we don’t have any right to live here, that we are usurpers of state lands. But we don’t have anywhere else to go,” said Astati, one of a group of locals who fought the eviction plan. It’s a familiar story in Jakarta – in 2015-2016, about 13,800 families had their homes bulldozed – but the way this one ended was new: the kampung won their case, and City Hall recognised the neighbourhood as Green Mussel Kampung. It set the precedent for a new model: Jakarta’s urban poor are organising, and they’re getting help. The last two years have been especially difficult for poor people in Jakarta. The former governor, Basuki Tjahaja Purnama – better known as Ahok – backed the demolitions in the name of development and flood control, and compounded it with insults. Kampung residents have been called thieves, thugs, dirty, diseased and illegal squatters. Many middle-class Jakartans broadly share that view: that kampungs are dirty and chaotic, an obstacle to the city’s modernisation. There have been heated debates about forced evictions, and the mainstream media in Jakarta has tended to echo Ahok’s opinions. In a 2016 survey, 66% of Jakartans said forced evictions are necessary for the city’s development. Banding together Urban poor leaders realised it was the middle class they needed on their side. Organised under the banners of the JRMK (Urban Poor Linkage) and the UPC (Urban Poor Consortium), they reached out to Jakarta’s architects, artists, scholars, lawyers, students and journalists of diverse backgrounds – creating a network of volunteers and organisations. Together they set out to “eviction-proof” the kampung. The architects map the neighbourhood and suggest improvements; lawyers help draft objections and other matters; academics help articulate the bigger ideas of why the community matters. The journalists – of which I am one – in collaboration with aspiring reporters from the kampung, write the history and stories of the communities, in an initiative called Archiving Urban Kampung (KKM). “There have been maybe 500 [volunteers] in the past two years,” says the UPC’s Gugun Muhammad. “This is massive.” He notes that so many had come forward that the communities now have the luxury of picking and choosing those who will have the most sustainable impact. One of them was Herlily, a lecturer in architecture at Universitas Indonesia. When Herlily first arrived at Muhammad’s neighbourhood in 2015, residents were hoping to defend their kampung by arguing its importance to the tourism industry, for its proximity to the old city wall. But Herlily saw the potential in the communities themselves. She proposed that the residents prove to the city that they could keep the rivers clean. Instead of building an “inspection road” along the river for municipal workers, why not make the kampung the guardian of the river? The residents embraced the idea. “Now, if you go there, you will hear they are proud not only of the old city wall but of their own kampungs,” she says. The UPC and JRMK have become political, too. During last year’s local election campaigns, the two organisations made a deal with the candidate for governor, Anies Baswedan. In exchange for respecting their land rights, they would endeavour to give him the 60,000 votes they represented between them. They had tried the same thing five years earlier with Joko Widodo, but when Widodo left to become president and Ahok took over, he showed no intention of honouring his predecessor’s promise and evicted thousands. Having learned their lesson, the communities made the contract with Baswedan legally binding – and he was voted in. So far, Baswedan seems to be keeping his promise. But the work still has to be done locally, introducing many kampung residents to unfamiliar concepts such as participatory planning and lobbying City Hall. This is where the volunteers are proving their worth. Kamil Muhammad, an architect, spends his weekends volunteering for several kampungs. “My weekday clients would want sophisticated 3D rendering, very visual. But here in Kampung Kunir, they need tactile design,” he says. Muhammad explains that his kampung work taught him lessons his education at the University of Melbourne did not: in one case, after talking to residents about their need for a shelter, he helped them build a model made of cardboard boxes. There are legal consultants, too, such as Handika Febrian, who like Kamil Muhammad has a weekday practice but on weekends runs a clinic in the kampung, helping to draft legal documents. ‘They’re making something different’ This sort of collaboration is unprecedented. There have been volunteers before – UPC has worked in Jakarta since 1997 and JRMK since 2008 – but never this many, never this diverse, and never this joined up. “JRMK and UPC were once stuck. Their stories were ones of disappointments,” says Amalinda Savirani, a political scientist at Gadjah Mada University. “But they’re making something different because these new people are more diverse.” The sheer variety of professions is attracting residents who might previously have been uninterested in getting involved. Archiving Urban Kampung gives aspiring journalists a place to write; several visual artists have held short programmes in the kampungs, another hit with younger people. “The volunteers are not old-fashioned activists whose strategy is limited to protesting on the streets,” explains Savirani. Many of the volunteers say the collaboration helps them challenge how the city is seen – to break the walls dividing the classes and pioneer new ways of development that do not require forced evictions. But part of the reason they spend their weekends here also tends to be more personal. Nur Lintang Muhammad finds more his work with the kampung more meaningful than his job as a news journalist. “When I do the volunteer work, my spirits are lifted. I like the real interactions and I’m happy to become the mentor of the young kampung journalists,” he said. “I feel like I have done something.” The kampung communities feel that connection, too. “They have boosted our spirit,” said Marsha Chairudin of Kampung Kunir. “We say to ourselves, ‘Look, those people from outside our kampung show high spirit. We should do the same.’” Follow Guardian Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, and explore our archive here"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/mar/21/jacob-rees-mogg-fishing-communities-hard-brexit","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-21T10:54:35Z","webTitle":"Rees-Mogg’s hard Brexit won’t do anything for fishing communities | Griffin Carpenter","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/21/jacob-rees-mogg-fishing-communities-hard-brexit","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/21/jacob-rees-mogg-fishing-communities-hard-brexit","fields":{"headline":"Rees-Mogg’s hard Brexit won’t do anything for fishing communities","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Jacob Rees-Mogg has been hinting at his profound connection with fishing communities over the last couple of days. And while he spoke at a protest at which MPs were due to fling fish off a boat on the Thames on Wednesday morning as a mark of solidarity, he didn’t end up getting on board. That was left to Nigel Farage. But if Rees-Mogg’s position on the Brexit negotiations is anything to go by, he and many other hard Brexiteers cannot really have fishermen’s interests at heart. Despite pressure from senior government figures, including a joint effort from Michael Gove and Ruth Davidson, the details of the transition agreement are that current fishing policy, like all other policy areas, will remain in place. This was one of the cherries that EU negotiators were clear was going to remain unpicked. Rees Mogg is one of 13 Tories who have now written to Theresa May threatening to vote down the EU withdrawal bill because of this. The announcement has not gone down well in the fishing industry, either. Since the early days of the referendum, fishermen were promised “hundreds of thousands of tonnes” of additional fishing quota by government leaders. That was a tempting offer, although the terms and conditions have proven less appealing. In the months since the Brexit vote, it has become clear that the twin issues of catching and selling fish are bound up in the minds of EU negotiators just as they are bound up in the financial prospects for the UK fishing industry. Most UK-produced seafood is exported, and most of that ends up in supermarkets and restaurants in the EU. This is why, at the same time as fishermen would like more quota, they have also been clear that a “no deal” Brexit disrupting trade to the EU would be a disaster. This prospect is particularly alarming for small fishing communities that specialise in shellfish rather than quota species (these rights are mostly owned by large trawlers) but do sell their catches to the EU market. This was one of the key findings from my economic impact assessment of Brexit scenarios for UK fisheries. To deliver the largest quota gains possible while keeping tariffs as low as possible will not be straightforward. Walking away from negotiations will deliver neither. On tariffs, the UK would default to higher World Trade Organisation rates as well as face the worrying prospect of non-tariff barriers at EU ports. On quota, the UK going it alone and setting a higher level only works in the longer term if the EU agrees to a lower share. The reality is that over 100 fish stocks will be shared, post-Brexit, and both sides deciding their own quota limit will inevitably harm fish stocks and the communities that rely on them. A good deal for the fishing industry requires co-operation. Of course, two more years of uncertainty is nobody’s first choice of outcome. There are real problems in the management of fisheries and the viability of fishing businesses, although not as Rees-Mogg or Nigel Farage have described. Fishing quotas, by limiting the amount of catch, have worked as intended and have brought many fish populations in EU waters back to sustainable levels. The recent certification of North Sea cod as sustainable was a particularly hard-fought journey from a near collapse of the stocks. The value of fish landings is now increasing year-on-year, and profits in the fishing industry are at the highest level recorded. And yet it is difficult to find signs of these positive trends in many fishing communities. This is partly due to changes in technology and labour markets, resulting in fewer fishing vessels each year (as in other EU and non-EU countries). But it’s also related to how the UK distributes its quota, and not just its total size. The decision on how quota should be distributed (big vessel or small, trawler or handline) has always been up to the UK government. The reality is that most Brexiteers have never engaged with the nuts and bolts of this issue, and we’re looking at two more years without real engagement. All this has of course been lost in the political theatre around fisheries. The totemic nature of fisheries in the UK consciousness has made the industry ripe for photo-ops, but not for serious reform. This is extremely frustrating for struggling fishing communities, but it’s also very dangerous. Just weeks ago, Rees-Mogg was making the case for tariff-free imports of food products, post-Brexit, without a hint of concern that cheap imports would undercut British fishermen. An industry that has been overlooked and politicians trying to make a name for themselves can make for interesting bedfellows, but not particularly good ones. Fishing communities deserve better. • Griffin Carpenter is senior researcher at the New Economics Foundation"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"sport/blog/2018/mar/20/six-nations-2018-five-unsung-heroes","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-20T17:59:28Z","webTitle":"Six Nations 2018: the unsung heroes of this year’s championship","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2018/mar/20/six-nations-2018-five-unsung-heroes","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/blog/2018/mar/20/six-nations-2018-five-unsung-heroes","fields":{"headline":"Six Nations 2018: the unsung heroes of this year’s championship","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"1) Rory Best The Ireland captain was asked after the grand slam victory whether Eddie Jones’s derogatory remarks about the country revealed a few days before had been motivation for the champions. Best showed class in his reply that was to the effect: who had not found themselves in a position like that? The most-capped player in the team is not among the most celebrated, but every side needs a Best to hold it together, selfless to the point where the team comes first, second and third. He has been on two Lions tours and did not make a Test appearance, but there was never any moaning or boat-rocking. He will be 36 in August and the head coach, Joe Schmidt, will have to decide whether a key part of his set-up will make it to the World Cup. 2) Chris Robshaw Hero is not a word associated with England after an underwhelming defence of their title but Robshaw was their one player who lived up to his reputation. He was chosen out of position on the open-side for the most part and England struggled at the breakdown throughout, but that was down to a system failure, certainly when in possession, rather than who was wearing the 7 jersey. He captained England for four years, but he carries no ego, never hiding and always doing the unglamorous, often unseen work, someone who would uncomplainingly take out the bins on a cold, wet night week after week. 3) Cory Hill Wales’ second-rows have their partner and captain, Alun Wyn Jones, to live up to. Hill was not much heard of outside Wales when he was chosen to start his first Six Nations match against Scotland in the opening round one week before his 26th birthday, having made his Test debut off the bench against Australia the previous season. He epitomised the tight-five forward Wales have been asking their regions to hone in recent years, athletic, mobile and able to receive and give a pass while also weighing in at the set-pieces. Hill was given his opportunity because of Jake Ball’s injury, but he still had to hurdle Bradley Davies and Luke Charteris. One of three Wales players to start every match this Six Nations, he had entrenched himself by its end. 4) Greig Laidlaw The Scotland scrum-half’s international career looked to have been reduced to a walk-on role when he was left out of the side to face Wales having missed the galvanising autumn campaign through injury. Ali Price was better suited to the fluid, all-action style patented by Glasgow, but after 48 minutes at the Principality Stadium, with the game all but lost, on came the 32-year-old Laidlaw. It was too late to alter the result, but he was back in the saddle the following week against France, kicking six penalties in the second half and adding a pinch of pragmatism after moving to outside-half, as he did in the final match against Italy that he won with a late penalty. Sometimes it is not about who has the swiftest pass or the fastest legs, but who thinks the quickest and keeps their head when others have given up trying to find theirs. 5) Sergio Parisse Not so much an unsung hero as a song sung blue after the Italy captain suffered his 100th Test match defeat against Scotland having been within a couple of minutes of what would have been a victory only the most flint-hearted would have begrudged them. After 17 seasons as a professional – he won the first of his 134 caps in 2002 – his most productive years are behind him, but he has snubbed time and the physical toll the game takes on players to continue to strive to make Italy a credible part of the Six Nations. He delayed retirement to help his head coach, Conor O’Shea, and two of the game in Rome’s most prominent players last Saturday – the flankers Sebastian Negri and Jake Polledri – are profiting from his experience: his mind, their legs and bodies. Italy have taken some beatings this year, but Parisse has remained on the field throughout, defiant and leading by example to the very end."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"culture/ng-interactive/2018/mar/25/simone-lia-on-how-man-discovered-fire","type":"interactive","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-25T07:00:47Z","webTitle":"Simone Lia on how man discovered fire","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/ng-interactive/2018/mar/25/simone-lia-on-how-man-discovered-fire","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/ng-interactive/2018/mar/25/simone-lia-on-how-man-discovered-fire","fields":{"headline":"Simone Lia on how man discovered fire","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2018/mar/27/how-we-made-cabin-pressure-benedict-cumberbatch","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-27T05:00:06Z","webTitle":"'Suddenly it was like Beatlemania' – how we made Cabin Pressure","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/mar/27/how-we-made-cabin-pressure-benedict-cumberbatch","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2018/mar/27/how-we-made-cabin-pressure-benedict-cumberbatch","fields":{"headline":"'Suddenly it was like Beatlemania' – how we made Cabin Pressure","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"John Finnemore, writer In the early noughties, I was writing for the radio sketch shows Dead Ringers and That Mitchell and Webb Sound and I wanted to try something narrative. My father was a pilot, and I came up with a two-hander about life in the flight deck: two people who haven’t chosen to be together, stuck in a small space for hours. Sitcoms need that element of being trapped, whether it’s a prison cell, a hotel or a rag-and-bone yard. I originally structured the cast along the lines of Father Ted: two leads, two sidekicks. I started off with a louche, naturally authoritative captain and a try-hard first officer, but quickly reversed the roles. I don’t remember taking it from Dad’s Army but that’s the obvious example.I pitched it to the BBC and, after a good deal of wrangling, they said yes. Benedict Cumberbatch was clearly going places at that point, though he hadn’t gone there yet. The 2004 movie Hawking had been his breakthrough, and he’d played an uptight control freak in Starter for Ten, who was basically a more unpleasant version of Martin, my captain, which convinced me he was perfect for the part. I had only written two episodes when we cast it, so I was able to write the rest with specific voices in mind: Roger Allam as first officer Douglas, Stephanie Cole as the airline’s owner, Carolyn. Almost immediately, I realised it was a terrible waste to keep Carolyn in the background, so she and Arthur the idiot steward – the bit part I’d written for myself – became bigger voices and it developed into a four-hander. The first series went out in 2008. It was the early days of the iPlayer and social media, and there wasn’t much feedback. We had two nice reviews, but that was it. Then a second series got commissioned and it won a best radio comedy award, which helped spread the word. We recorded live and there was a pretty good take-up for tickets. But the third series was post-Sherlock. Suddenly the audience was 90% female, mostly under 25 and they were queuing round the block. It was like Beatlemania. I was worried they just wanted to be in the same room as Benedict and that this would throw things off, but I was completely wrong. They listened and laughed at the other characters as much as they did at Martin. I suppose the sort of teenager who decides Sherlock Holmes is their idol is the sort of teenager who’s going to enjoy Cabin Pressure. I’ve had messages from fans in Hong Kong, Honolulu, Moscow and Perth. Some say it’s helped with their fear of flying, which seems odd given that Martin was not a very good pilot and Douglas was not a very reliable one, but I suppose just imagining the two of them in the flight deck rather than faceless droids is reassuring. You have to be a cruel god when you’re a sitcom writer: you can’t let your characters be happy for too long. You have to either leave them in trouble, or when they get themselves out of it, find them new trouble or it’s not funny. That’s one of the reasons I wanted to finish the show – so I could give them a satisfying ending. Stephanie Cole I didn’t know John Finnemore’s work when the first two scripts arrived, but it sprang at me like a glorious ray of sunshine. The writing was so witty and distinctive. I loved the clear idea of each episode being a flight destination and it running A to Z sequentially with 26 episodes, and how simple it was revolving around just the four main characters working for MJN Air. I played the airline’s CEO, Carolyn Knapp-Shappey. Try saying that quickly several times. I can’t tell you the number of times we had to retake. One of the joys of my character was how strong and feisty she is: she had the upper hand over the men, for the most part. Carolyn told it like it was and took no shit. We’ve all met women like her. She was very easy to put on, and I confess perhaps there’s a little of her bossiness in me. When you play a character in a series she doesn’t always progress so it was wonderful that when Carolyn’s love interest came (in the shape of Anthony Head’s Hercules), she was thrown for a loop, which gave a whole new side to her. We would have a read-through before recording, but there were many times when we had to stop the recording because we all had the giggles. Very little was ad-libbed or changed. John’s scripts were always well-nigh perfect. Radio drama takes a bit of getting used to. It doesn’t matter what you do bodily, but you have to be meticulous about the thought behind your lines. You can’t fudge when it’s just your voice being heard. Getting together to record was relatively simple until Benedict got so well known. By the second series, we were getting the odd person hanging around outside waiting for autographs. By the time we recorded the final episode, it was like a rugby scrum outside. People were coming from America and Lithuania to be in the audience. Benedict didn’t change a jot as his fame grew. We were always just four fellow actors. • John Finnemore’s Flying Visit tours the UK, 17 May-15 June."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"artanddesign/2018/mar/20/waterhouses-small-breasted-nymphs-are-not-girls","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-20T18:33:40Z","webTitle":"Waterhouse’s small-breasted Nymphs are not girls | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/mar/20/waterhouses-small-breasted-nymphs-are-not-girls","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2018/mar/20/waterhouses-small-breasted-nymphs-are-not-girls","fields":{"headline":"Waterhouse’s small-breasted Nymphs are not girls","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The lessons of the Hylas affair (The Nymphs and me, G2, 20 March) are threefold.

The falling cost of wind and solar projects combined with advances in battery storage technology will unlock about £20bn of investment in the UK between now and 2030, Aurora Energy Research said. Onshore wind and solar will both be viable without subsidies by 2025 in the UK, it added. The prediction comes as the Swedish energy firm Vattenfall announced that it had won a Dutch government tender to develop a windfarm which will become the world’s first without subsidies when built off the Netherlands coast in 2022. “The [subsidy-free] future is within reach,” Magnus Hall, Vattenfall’s chief executive, told an industry audience in Oxford. But the switch to a post-subsidy world would still require some financial aid during the transition period, Hall said, to ensure that risk was fairly shared between energy firms and governments. Hall urged ministers to consider reversing the UK’s ban on subsidies for onshore windfarms, saying developers of these projects should be allowed to compete in auctions for subsidies. His call was echoed by two of the UK’s big six energy firms, SSE and ScottishPower. Alistair Phillips-Davies, chief executive of SSE, said onshore windfarms should be given a chance where communities support them. “I’d like to see onshore wind coming back in the UK,” he said. Keith Anderson, chief corporate office at Scottish Power, told the Guardian: “Let’s use it, let’s deploy it. There are still areas absolutely where we could build onshore windfarms, areas where the local community are acceptive of windfarms.” Wind power is expected to account for half of the 18GW of subsidy-free renewables to be built in the UK between now and 2030, according to a new Aurora Energy Research report. The other half will be from solar power, which had largely stalled after subsidy cuts in 2015 but received a boost when the UK’s first subsidy-free solar farm opened last year. Having so much green energy generation will squeeze out the opportunity for the likes of Germany’s RWE to build large gas power stations in the UK. The government has already downgraded the amount of new gas power capacity it expects to be added by 2030 from 22GW to 7GW, but Aurora said that would shrink to just 1GW if subsidy-free renewables took off as anticipated. Mateusz Wronski, an analyst at Aurora, said: “The subsidy-free revolution is here and it’s big.” Prices in the capacity market, the government’s scheme for guaranteeing power supplies during winter, have repeatedly been too low to encourage new large gas power plants to be built. The energy minister, Claire Perry, announced on Tuesday that the government would be launching a formal review of the capacity market later this year. One consideration will be whether to open up the scheme to renewable energy projects, a step that would further hammer gas. Perry said the cold snap at the start of March, which saw gas demand jump 40% above normal levels, had shown the UK energy system was robust but there are “lessons to be learned”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"fashion/2018/mar/20/jean-queen-how-to-pull-off-denim-on-denim","type":"article","sectionId":"fashion","sectionName":"Fashion","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-20T17:44:45Z","webTitle":"Jean queen: how to pull off denim-on-denim","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2018/mar/20/jean-queen-how-to-pull-off-denim-on-denim","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/fashion/2018/mar/20/jean-queen-how-to-pull-off-denim-on-denim","fields":{"headline":"Jean queen: how to pull off denim-on-denim","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The so-called Canadian tuxedo has come a long way since Britney and Justin wore eye-popping matching all-denim outfits to the American Music Awards more than 15 years ago.

There are more pressing reasons than science for psychiatry to be ashamed of its engagement in this programme. Patient confidentiality has been a fundamental principle of medical care since Hippocrates. Nowhere is it more important than in psychiatry, where troubled people need to know that their concerns will be treated sympathetically and confidentially. The reporting of people to authorities for what they think rather than what they do is surely contrary to all we value in our legal and civic tradition, while the naive hypocrisy of labelling a surveillance role as a safeguarding one fools nobody. It compromises psychiatry’s need to try to be as honest and transparent with patients as possible. We have long had to balance our primary duty to patients with our undoubted obligations to the society in which we operate. This has always been a highly complex and sensitive area with no easy answers. If not addressed openly and honestly, it risks a serious breakdown of trust. There are well-established principles for breaking medical confidentiality if there is clear evidence of dangerous criminal activity or direct risk to a third party. Prevent falls well outside these principles. Given some of the darker episodes in our history when we have colluded with repressive regimes, it is remarkable that psychiatry’s challenge to Prevent has not been more vociferous. Tom Burns Professor emeritus of social psychiatry, University of Oxford • The Guardian contributes to anti-Prevent mythology by reporting a pilot research study, Counter-terrorism in the NHS: Evaluating Prevent Duty Safeguarding in the NHS (by Drs Heath-Kelly and Erzsébet Strausz), which rests on shockingly shaky foundations. Among other things, the study suggests that the mentally ill are being unfairly stigmatised as terrorism risks by NHS mental health trusts which are themselves being turned by the counter-terrorist Prevent strategy into instruments of surveillance rather than safeguarding. Yet these sweeping allegations are based on interviews with only 17 NHS “experts”, two police officers, and safeguarding teams in six NHS trusts and clinical commissioning groups out of over 300, plus completed online questionnaires from an unrepresentative sample of 329 out of a total of 1.5 million NHS employees.

The country’s biggest carmaker, Jaguar Land Rover, has been experimenting with autonomous cars on roads in the Midlands and is set to demonstrate more of the cars’ features, including an emergency braking warning system, on urban streets this week. Government-backed trials using small autonomous vehicles in south London are due to end on Friday, with organisers reporting widespread public unease about the implications for road safety and cybersecurity. A self-driving Uber car killed a woman in Tempe, Arizona on Sunday night – the first time a self-driving vehicle has killed someone that was not its occupant. Elaine Herzberg, 49, was wheeling her bicycle when she was struck by the Volvo, and later died of her injuries in hospital. US government safety investigators were sent to examine the crash site and Uber has suspended its test fleets of self-driving cars across the US and Canada. Police in Arizona said initial video footage suggested Herzberg walked out suddenly. One previous death involving autonomous cars, a Tesla Model S owner killed in Florida in 2016 when his car crashed on autopilot, was blamed on the driver’s inattention, but investigators highlighted design flaws in the vehicle. Many in the motor and insurance industries expect safety benefits from autonomous cars since more than 90% of accidents involve human error. In 2016, the latest full year for which data is available, 448 pedestrians were killed by vehicles on UK roads, and more than 6,000 in the US. But fears remain over how driverless cars will interact with humans on the roads. Christian Wolmar, the author of Driverless Cars: a Road to Nowhere, said the Arizona accident would have a big impact: “We don’t know precisely what happened, but it is clear Uber are worried by withdrawing all their cars. Driverless cars will not be accepted if there is a perception that they are not 100% safe. Of course new technology has blips, but this one, that no one has particularly asked for, is being sold on the basis that it’s so much safer.” Noel Sharkey, emeritus professor of artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield, said: “Autonomous vehicles present us with a great future opportunity to make our roads safer. But the technology is just not ready yet and needs to mature before it goes on the road. Too many mistakes and the public may turn its back on the technology.” In London, members of the public have been using low-speed autonomous pods on cycle paths and walkways around the Greenwich peninsula as the culmination of a three-year Gateway study into people’s responses to driverless technology. Gateway said that under half of 1,300 public responses were positive about the new technology, with those uncertain or opposed citing cybersecurity and road safety fears. A spokesman said: “The lesson is you absolutely have to build in security and road safety from the get-go.” The pods have had one reported collision, hitting a barrier with the roads minister, Jesse Norman, onboard. He has nonetheless pledged to keep the UK in the vanguard of developing autonomous technology, recently confirming an overhaul of road laws to include self-driving cars. Greenwich is expected to to allow Ford and Jaguar Land Rover autonomous cars on its streets in the next phase of testing. Gatwick announced it would be testing autonomous vehicles to shuttle staff across the airfield, which it said could lead to “an Uber-like service” for ground staff to hail."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/mar/21/muslims-british-national-identity-uk-report","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-21T00:01:06Z","webTitle":"Muslims place greater importance on national identity, finds UK study","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/21/muslims-british-national-identity-uk-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/mar/21/muslims-british-national-identity-uk-report","fields":{"headline":"Muslims place greater importance on national identity, finds UK study","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Muslims in the UK attach more importance to being British than the general population, according to a report. They also place greater emphasis on education, and identify more strongly with their religious identity than their non-Muslim peers. The 75-page report from Ipsos Mori analysed research and opinion polls conducted since 2010 to paint a comprehensive picture of British Muslims. The UK’s Muslim population was 3 million at the 2011 census, but was estimated last year to be 4.1 million, or 6.3% of the population. Almost half are under the age of 24 and one-third are under 15, making them the fastest-growing group among young Britons. Eighty-five percent said they felt they belonged to Britain. More than half (55%) said their national identity was important, compared with 44% of the general population. Religious identity is extremely or very important to 94%, and more than half pray at least five times a day or engage in worship of some kind. Asif Aziz, the chairman of the Aziz Foundation, which commissioned the report with the Joseph Rowntree Charitable Trust, Barrow Cadbury Trust and Unbound Philanthropy, said: “While British Muslims identify strongly with their religious identity, they are also staunchly British.” Muslim children have high aspirations for their educational achievement, with 56% saying it was very likely they would go to university, compared with 38% of non-Muslim children. More Muslim girls than boys expected a university education. More than 7% of Muslims are unemployed, compared with 4% of the UK population as a whole. Almost two-thirds of Muslims said they think different religious and ethnic groups should mix more. A majority of Muslims of all ages wear a poppy on Remembrance Day and almost three-quarters said they always or sometimes send Christmas cards. Forty-five percent of Muslims under 24 said at least half their friends are from outside their ethnic group. Those in London are more likely to have a diverse group of friends than Muslims in the rest of the country. Muslims tend to have more conservative social attitudes than the general population, the report said. Half of Muslim men and one-third of women believe wives should obey their husbands, and 38% of men said it is acceptable for a British Muslim to have more than one wife. A majority said homosexuality should not be legal. One in four Muslims are worried about being physically attacked because of their skin colour, ethnic origin or religion. Kully Kaur-Ballagan, a research director at Ipsos Mori, said the report showed the vast majority of British Muslims “believe that being Muslim and being British is entirely compatible”. Younger Muslims were “more open in their views and have more diverse social networks”, she added."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"news/2018/mar/20/corrections-and-clarifications","type":"article","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-20T21:00:10Z","webTitle":"Corrections and clarifications","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/mar/20/corrections-and-clarifications","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/2018/mar/20/corrections-and-clarifications","fields":{"headline":"Corrections and clarifications","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"• A panel said that in 2016 the value of the EU’s trade deficit with the US was $92bn.

It is not yet time for fat heads of lettuce, but the tender beginnings of so many other things that are appearing in the garden. No one wrote better about spring salads than the 16th- and 17th-century humanist Giacomo Castelvetro, who was exiled to our shores and so horrified by our diet that he wrote a treatise on how to eat more salads. It’s a short masterclass on good food writing. He suggests one takes “the young leaves of mint, nasturtium, basil, salad burnet, tarragon, the flowers of herba stella [buck’s horn plantain] and tenderest leaves of borage... the newborn shoots of fennel, the leaves of rocket, of sorrel, of lemon balm, rosemary flowers, some sweet violets and the tenderest leaves of the hearts of lettuce.” Rosemary flowers and nasturtiums won’t be here for a while, but it’s possible to dig up some mint roots from the garden or take a few from a congested pot and bring inside to force its tender tips. Basil will germinate in a matter of days on any warm windowsill. Fennel shoots, sorrel, rocket, lemon balm and young borage leaves can all be brought on with a cloche or fleece if necessary, and sweet violets should be springing up around the garden. If you don’t have any of these in your garden, then now is the time to get them established. Don’t buy lemon balm ; someone somewhere will have more than enough to give you a division. Don’t let it self-seed too much, as it has a habit of coming up everywhere. Herb fennel is a lovely tall addition to any garden, and there’s a bronze form, too. Once established it’s there for life: the seed can be collected later in the year and used in cooking; toasted, it’s a lovely, nutty addition. French sorrel has a tendency to start flowering after a few years, and thus you get fewer leaves. Either resow every three years or try to get hold of ‘Profusion’, a non-flowering form. Salad burnet tastes of cucumber but it needs to be picked very young and tender, or else it’s a little hairy. It grows well in partial shade and likes damp soil. Borage and rocket can be sown undercover now, or direct in April or May. Both will happily self-seed where they please. The easiest way to get sweet violets (Viola odorata) in the garden is to buy a pot now (try plantsforshade.co.uk), and, again, let it spread to create a ground cover. It likes winter sun and summer shade, which tend to be best found under a deciduous tree."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2018/mar/20/ant-and-dec-itv-drink-driving-arrest","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-20T17:35:00Z","webTitle":"Primetime problems: what next for Ant and Dec?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/mar/20/ant-and-dec-itv-drink-driving-arrest","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2018/mar/20/ant-and-dec-itv-drink-driving-arrest","fields":{"headline":"Primetime problems: what next for Ant and Dec?","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"They work together, holiday together, even live on the same street – a duo, a twosome, that have outlasted all the defining partnerships of our age: Charles and Diana, Liam and Noel, even LMFAO. Now for the first time in their near three-decade-long careers, they are stranded from one another. On Sunday, Anthony McPartlin was involved in a car collision and arrested on suspicion of drink driving leaving Declan Donnelly reportedly “devastated” at his best friend’s condition. Even before the road incident, Ant McPartlin had had a desperately trying 12 months. In June, he checked himself into rehab for addiction to drink and painkillers. He said he started self-medicating after dealing with depression and chronic knee pain, telling the Sun on Sunday he was bingeing morphine and Tramadol “to the point of psychosis”. After a two-month stint in rehab he returned to host I’m a Celebrity … Get Me Out of Here! and seemed to have made a rehabilitation. Then in January, he announced he was splitting from Lisa, his wife of 11 years and childhood sweetheart. Many wondered whether he would be able to return to TV so soon after the divorce and in the midst of recovery. I’m a Celebrity … mostly involves presenting links from behind a table, but with a series of ITV’s Saturday Night Takeaway lined up for February, McPartlin would be expected to prance around in dresses, perform dangerous live stunts and land gag after gag. Is it possible to be a light entertainer when life has become dark? On the first show of the series he was unflappable: racing monster trucks with Donnelly and dressing up in the slinky white dress from Can’t Get You Out of My Head to dance with Kylie Minogue. There was no sign that anything was up. Still, McPartlin’s strong performance did not stop tabloids running stories suggesting that the show was a disaster. The Mirror and Mail Online ran full stories about viewers’ concern for McPartlin’s wellbeing, both based on a single tweet by a random viewer who said he “doesn’t look right”. The Mirror ran a long headline “What a difference a year makes! ... The collapse of his marriage – coupled with his former addiction issues – have clearly taken their toll.” The story then positioned a professional studio photo of McPartlin in 2017 next to a low-res screengrab of him in 2018 to illustrate his supposed fall from grace. The death of Amy Winehouse was meant to have prompted media soul-searching as to how the press should treat recovering addicts – but it seems as if very little had changed. From the viewers’ perspective, at least, things seemed to be back on track. McPartlin managed a further three episodes with no noticeable issues. Then, on Sunday afternoon, McPartlin was involved in a collision as he was driving home in his Mini Cooper in Richmond. After the incident, he failed a police breathalyser test and was arrested, before being released under investigation on Monday. ITV quickly announced that this week’s episode of Saturday Night Takeaway would be cancelled. The rest of the series is under review, but McPartlin will definitely not be in any episodes as he returns to rehab. ITV bosses would be the first to say that McPartlin’s health is their priority, but they must be seriously concerned about the jeopardy this puts them in. Ant &amp; Dec have been the most prominent faces on the network for over a decade – graduating from the critically acclaimed Saturday-morning show SMTV Live to host Pop Idol in 2001. Since then they have been the faces of almost every entertainment format the channel has tried: when the Saturday Night Takeaway series is over, Britain’s Got Talent, also hosted by the duo and normally the channel’s biggest show of the year, begins. They will have already recorded links for the early rounds of the show, but will it be in poor taste to broadcast them if McPartlin is unable to host the latter stages? The pair have always said they would never want to work without the other, so it seems likely that they will both disappear from our screens for a while, taking their first hiatus ever. You might think it won’t be that difficult to find replacement hosts. But compare them with their nearest competitors – the 1,000-mile stare of Tess Daly as she tries to remember what excitement felt like, the rambling dissociative patter of Alexander Armstrong as he says “Thank you very much indeed” for the 562nd time in a 45-minute episode of Pointless – and Ant &amp; Dec are in a different league, the De Niro and Pacino of Saturday nights. To see their magic, just look at the one who is not talking, always working twice as hard as the one who is; they have a reactive, emotional rhythm that has not been bettered. Perhaps a fair comparison would be the likes of David Letterman and Jimmy Fallon, but they host their shows for a relatively small late-night audience of cool kids; Ant &amp; Dec manage the same shtick while taking Mum and Grandad along for the ride Saturday Night Takeaway, in particular, is a greatly misunderstood show. Thought of as mainstream fodder, it’s actually an innovative, formatless show that pushes the boundaries of shiny-floor live TV. In the one episode of this series, for example, they did a bit called Games of Phones in which they took the phones from everyone in the studio audience and then told viewers that if they knew someone in the studio they should ring them. Suddenly hundreds of phones started to ring as Scarlett Moffatt tried to plug them in and identify which audience member they knew so the caller and receiver could split a grand. In this series, they had organised a chartered plane to take hundreds of competition winners for a week-long stay at the Universal theme park in Orlando. They would dish out tickets through various means (they surprised three people who lived equidistant from the studio and made them race there while the show was live – the first person to arrive won) with a plan to film the final episode of the series from there. Yet for all their patter and warmth, the pair have never found a register to talk about something as complex and unhappy as addiction or depression. They only know pure joy, or a sob story that quickly becomes pure joy. They have not done too many tell-all interviews; one of the most memorable was a 2013 episode of Desert Island Discs in which they said that the hardest moment of their careers was when they were wrapped up in the TV competitions scandal – people who were not entered into prize draws but still charged for their calls. A blip in their nice-guy act, perhaps, but realistically nothing compared with the current challenge. During that same interview, they said the problem with making live entertainment TV is that you’re only as good as your last show. Once you are off the box, you are forgotten; a Michael Barrymore or a Matthew Kelly. They said they wanted to make a scripted comedy at some point, so they would leave behind something for the comedy canon. But now they have been presented with a different opportunity to be remembered, and to do something they have never done before: drop the act. Who could be more important ambassadors for mental health than two people whose public personas are relentlessly chirpy. It won’t be easy. However bad your mental health, drink-driving – if McPartlin is found guilty – is not something that can be easily forgiven. But if they can find a way to work depression and recovery into Saturday nights, they could leave a legacy far more profound than a dodgy ITV sitcom."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/mar/21/russia-propaganda-skripal-britain-churchill","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-21T06:00:04Z","webTitle":"If you talk about Russian propaganda, remember: Britain has myths too | Afua Hirsch","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/21/russia-propaganda-skripal-britain-churchill","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/21/russia-propaganda-skripal-britain-churchill","fields":{"headline":"If you talk about Russian propaganda, remember: Britain has myths too","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"When Edward Bernays, the father of modern propaganda, set out in 1928 to explain what it was, he cited not Pravda, or puff from the Weimar Republic, but the New York Times. His point – analysing the front-page stories on relief for China, Zionism in the Middle East, and a report by President Hoover on US living standards – was not that American newspapers were propaganda, but that everything was. Bernays, inspired in part by the work of his uncle Sigmund Freud, was hardly a glowing example of best practice. He used his command of propaganda – described as “the conscious and intelligent manipulation of the organised habits and opinions of the masses” – for causes as diverse as civil rights, and persuading American women to spend more money on cigarettes. “Propaganda carries to many minds an unpleasant connotation,” Bernays wrote, “yet whether [it] is good or bad depends upon the merit of the cause urged, and the correctness of the information published.” Almost a century later, we still misunderstand propaganda as something that only other, more evil people, organisations and states do – and none more so than Vladimir Putin’s Russia. The poisoning of Sergei and Yulia Skripal has brought renewed focus on what seems to us the remarkable perspective of the state-funded broadcaster Russia Today (RT), which paints the whole incident as either a deliberate attempt by Theresa May to frame Putin, or as British Russophobia gone mad. But Russia is not the only state to practise propaganda – they are just doing it less well, I would argue. For a Russian MP to appear on Radio 4’s Today programme likening Theresa May to Hitler, and Poland’s former foreign minister to a “prostitute”, as the Duma member Vitaly Milonov did last week, or to suggest, as the Russian ambassador to Britain did on RT, that the Skripals’ poisoning is really a British effort to divert attention from Brexit hardly seems very convincing. And if the ostensible point of RT is to bring more English-speaking people round to Russia’s way of seeing things, it’s bad propaganda, failing on its own terms. But the outrage surrounding the very fact that RT tries to push its narrative surprised me. Surely the desire to have the world see things from a host nation’s perspective is the job of state-sponsored global media. It’s the reason Britain developed its BBC World Service – initially, let’s not forget, called the Empire Service – and while the BBC and journalists like me who appear on the modern BBC certainly believe in its impartiality, that’s not necessarily how it’s seen abroad. The power of the model explains why so many more states are doing it, not least the rapidly expanding Turkish state international broadcaster TRT, and Qatar-funded al-Jazeera, all of which seek to bring a particular perspective rooted in the nations from which they are run. You could argue that the media are failing on their own terms everywhere. Perceived propagandisation is one of the factors diminishing trust in them across Europe. Indeed, one study that found fewer than half of people in many European democracies now agree that they can trust most of the news, most of the time. But that doesn’t mean we are averse to a little propaganda of our own, especially when it comes to our history. More of us than we knew may have been influenced in our voting choices by Cambridge Analytica and their ilk, and when it comes to the movies, Hollywood propaganda is on a roll. The former Telegraph editor Charles Moore is no leftie, but he describes the movie Darkest Hour – the Oscar-winning take on Winston Churchill’s achievement in overcoming the greatest wartime odds in 1940 – as a work of “superb Brexit propaganda”. I would call the film propaganda, more generally – and a great example of the kind of myth we like to promote in modern Britain. Churchill has been rebranded as a tube-travelling, minority-adoring genius, in line with a general understanding of him as “the greatest Briton of all time”. There’s a strange cognitive dissonance you experience working on the inconvenient parts of Churchill’s legacy – as I have been recently for a documentary I’m making. Two serious historians have told me in recent weeks that when they began researching less popular episodes in Churchill’s life, they were warned that doing so would either finish their careers, preclude them from promotion, or make them outcasts in academia. And for a historian to state a set of facts about Churchill’s legacy in Bengal, Mesopotamia or Sudan, as David Olusoga did at a literary festival this week, is still regarded as a news story at best, at worst as a kind of unpatriotic travesty. Churchill himself, of course, was a grandmaster of propaganda. The quote so often attributed to him – “history shall be kind to me, for I shall write it” – comes, says one theory, from a boozy birthday dinner he had in 1943 with Roosevelt and Stalin. Like most British people, I was raised in a country steeped in a sense of occupying the moral high ground, far too sophisticated and open-minded to conflate news and storytelling with propaganda. But that perception is hard to square with our tendency to attack anyone who offers a different narrative – albeit based on fact. I will probably suffer such a fate just for writing this column. One of the major differences between us and Russia is that you couldn’t have this debate about history and values there. What a shame it would be for us to waste the fact that we can. • Afua Hirsch is a Guardian columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"travel/2018/mar/20/send-us-a-tip-on-places-to-see-wildflowers-in-europe-and-win-a-200-hotel-voucher","type":"article","sectionId":"travel","sectionName":"Travel","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-20T16:09:26Z","webTitle":"Send us a tip on places to see wild flowers in Europe – and win a £200 hotel voucher","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2018/mar/20/send-us-a-tip-on-places-to-see-wildflowers-in-europe-and-win-a-200-hotel-voucher","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/travel/2018/mar/20/send-us-a-tip-on-places-to-see-wildflowers-in-europe-and-win-a-200-hotel-voucher","fields":{"headline":"Send us a tip on places to see wild flowers in Europe – and win a £200 hotel voucher","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Whether it was on a walking holiday in the mountains, a road trip or cycling through beautiful countryside, we want to hear about great places you’ve enjoyed wild spring flowers.

You buy an open ticket that allows you to travel indefinitely by train throughout Europe. But prior to my own Eurorailing adventure, I’d lent my Lonely Planet: Europe on a Shoestring to five friends who had already been on such a trip, asking them to add notes, suggestions, annotations. All five, without colluding, said Slovenia’s Lake Bled was the single most beautiful place they had seen in Europe. Fast-forward to 2006, when I was a postgraduate student, and I wound up embarking on a longer, “slow food” version of my rail smorgasbord. I lived in eight European cities, each for at least a month, to get a feel for what it would be like to move there indefinitely. After forays into Venice, Florence, Rome, Madrid and Leiden, I ended up in Ljubljana, Slovenia’s capital. And that is where I fell in love – with the country and the future Mrs Charney. This is what I fell in love with. In order to marry her, on our wedding day, I was obliged to survive the dreaded shranga, a gauntlet of pre-nuptial feats of manliness required of aspiring grooms from beyond the Slovenian mountain village confines. Once I’d got through the nerve-racking bouts of scythe-sharpening, bark-shaving, axe-wielding and, yes, even wife-buying traditions, and was permitted by the grumpy-looking villagers to enter the church and carry on with my wedding, I knew that this was the place for me, and have since come to feel truly a part of it. Slovenia has been, for me, a land of opportunity. This has meant that I’ve become something of Slovenia’s foreign cheerleader, and recently I even released a book, Slovenology: Living and Travelling in the World’s Best Country, that is part memoir, part travelogue, and part essay collection singing its praises. There are only so many times that Slovenia can be called a “hidden gem” and still claim to remain hidden. But those who come to this tiny country nestled between the Alps and the Adriatic seem to feel they’ve discovered a little-known paradise. While cheap flights from London have made it an easy weekend destination, and the capital, Ljubljana, is popular on the stag and hen circuit, the entire country boasts wonderland landscapes. Beyond the confines of charming, Zürich-like Ljubljana, Slovenia offers travellers a destination that is easy to navigate (with English spoken just about everywhere). It is one of the safest countries in the world, not to mention the cleanest (it won National Geographic’s 2017 World Legacy Award, as the most sustainable tourist destination, and Ljubljana was Green Capital of Europe in 2016). Having chosen this country as my new homeland, settling in the charming three-castled alpine town of Kamnik, just north of the capital, I wanted to get to know it in a more intimate way. I wanted a local’s-eye-view of the secret facets of this “hidden gem”. And so I hatched a plan. I set about contacting people I found interesting – for instance, the great folk-rock musician, Vlado Kreslin, the world-famous chef Janez Bratovž, and the expat Bosnian actor and director, Branko Đurić – and requested interviews. To my delight, everyone acquiesced. In Slovenia, everyone writes their own email, and even the prime minister is just a message away. I struck up friendships and collaborations with many of the people I met in this way, working my way through a who’s-who of interesting Slovenians. Vlado Kreslin, a Bruce Springsteen-like musical icon in Slovenia, introduced me to the wonders of Prekmurje, the furthest-flung region of the country, on the Hungarian border. This is a flatland of storks and slow-churning wooden mills on the river, with a lively and culturally influential population of Gypsies. Kreslin grew up here, in his father’s gostilna, or country inn, listening to bands mixed of Slovenians and Gypsies, and speaking a dialect that is unintelligible to most Slovenes. My wife and I attended a party at the Kreslins’ weekend home there, with dozens of other guests, from DJs to government ministers, all gathered around a bubbling cauldron of bograč, a rich goulash spiked with paprika from the nearby Pannonian plain, and ripping apart deep-fried catfish from the nearby Mura river. After dinner, Kreslin and his friends, members of his band but guests, too, grabbed instruments and played an impromptu concert, just for the pleasure of it, as the moon rose high above the roll and roil of accordion, violin, guitar and hammered dulcimer. As a tourist I’d found Lake Bled a bit twee. It was only when I went with actor/director Branko Đurić, as a co-organiser of the short-lived Bled Film Festival, that I saw the magic it can conjure. We’d gathered at a villa on a cliff above the lake, which had once been a favourite residence of Tito. Celebratory homemade schnapps was consumed, and as night fell we were rowed out to the single, church-topped island in pletne, gondolas manned by capped oarsmen. A trail of floating candles guided us to the cascade of stone steps that led up from the island’s mooring to the medieval church. The festival guests used the steps as seating, and the mooring became a stage upon which we gave out the awards. And then the partying began, with the church’s schnapps-fueled priest particularly keen to take a selfie with American actor Armand Assante. It was Lake Bled at its best, without the trappings of tourism, in a light as magical as anything I could imagine. But of all my encounters, the one that taught me most about my adopted country was this summer’s road trip with Janez Bratovž, tasting indigenous Slovenian ingredients for his next cookbook. Bratovž is the godfather of nouvelle cuisine in the former Yugoslavia – the first to introduce carpaccio and rare steak to a land of delicious but well-done cutlets doused in cream sauces. He picked 20 key ingredients that he uses in his cooking and, together with photographer Matjaž Tančič, we spent the summer crisscrossing the country, visiting the finest producers. Steps from the border with Italy, in Goriška Brda, we tasted what many think is the world’s best prosciutto, or pršut. Just 80 legs a year from indigenous, wonderfully fatty blackstrap pigs are prepared by Uroš Klinec and pre-sold to select restaurants around the globe. From the Caravaggesque darkness of his cellar, a vegetarian’s nightmare (but this carnivore’s delight) of hanging hocks of ham, we emerged on to his sun-soaked patio, overlooking the wine-rich hills, and enjoyed prosciutto so delicate and light that it melted on the tongue. Across the country, in Kreslin’s Prekmurje flatlands, we tasted the finest Styrian pumpkin seed oil, hand-pressed in century-old presses by the Kocbek family, and of such flavour and delicacy that it is used not only to dress salads, but as a sauce for ice-cream and to lace bars of dark chocolate. We wound through the hills of Tolmin, above the emerald Soča river, a real-life Narnia (one of the movies was filmed here), to meet a farmer bringing back the colossal, leopard-skinned Soča river trout, with flesh so delicious that today it is only served as a carpaccio. This was the site of Ernest Hemingway’s A Farewell to Arms, where this king of trout nearly became extinct in the first world war, as hungry soldiers flung grenades into the river to catch a meal. At the salt flats near Piran, on Slovenia’s 46km of karstic coast, we met Dario, whose family has been harvesting salt for generations, in flats that date back to the Roman empire, when salt was used as pay (the term salary comes from salaria, meaning salt). We drove up a mountain in Dolenjska, in the south east, with a mountain-sized sheep farmer eager to show us his dominion, arriving at the top only to find the still-warm remains of a gutted sheep, which showed that a bear was lurking somewhere nearby in the darkness barely held back by the ebbing twilight (I opted to stay in the car for that one, while Tančič took photographs of the farmer and Bratovž kept an eye out for bears and wolves). We dipped down to the Istrian peninsula to meet former property lawyer Aleš Winkler. He sold his fancy Ljubljana flat, bought 30 goats as lawnmowers for his rural holiday house, taught himself online to make cheese and this year gave the keynote speech for Slow Food International, teaching Italians and French how to make a proper chèvre. Back in the Kamnik region, in the vast meadow atop mesa-like alpine mountain Velika Planina, there are odd, low-slung shepherds’ huts that recall The Shire and are full of traditional artefacts (including a rain-repelling shepherd’s gown made of strips of shaven wood and anti-witch knives carved with runes). Here, we sampled breast-shaped Trnič cheeses (which always come in pairs). This summer’s travels with Bratovž opened up locations and delicacies that I’d never have found on my own, and for which I am most grateful, for they allowed a constellation of indigenous ingredients to show me an intimate, insider’s portrait of my adopted country. I remain just as in love with Slovenia (and, of course, with my Slovenian wife, for whom I endured such unusual “feats of manliness”) as ever. For it is the Slovenia of passionate, in-the-know Slovenians that offers the most magic. And if you happen to read this and decide to move here, the first beer is on me. • Noah Charney is the author of Slovenology: Living and Traveling in the World’s Best Country.

Once you gain a kingdom, however, the game veers into less familiar territory. You collect taxes, use the proceeds to build shops and facilities and, most compellingly, head out into the world to find prospective citizens to bring back. Having identified someone who has a talent and is prepared to emigrate, you must typically carry out some decisive errand, or help them resolve a personal quest in order to seal the deal. Their fealty pledged, you now assign them a role in the kingdom, and watch as they skitter about, harvesting wood, selling fish, building ships, or researching new technologies that help even the odds on the battlefield. In this way, grand empire-building becomes minutely personalised: you care deeply for each of your citizens because you are invested in their individual stories. Building a city to rule is not enough for Tildrum, who, in the hubristic tradition of so many rulersthroughout history, feels compelled to take his vision for society out into the world. In his fairytale naivety, the young king draws up a “declaration of interdependence” and, after reading up on his neighbouring nations, undertakes a series of royal visits in which he urges various heads of state to sign up to the document. The places you visit could have been plucked from the pages of Italo Calvino’s Invisible Cities. There’s Hydropolis, an island capital, where love has been outlawed by a beleaguered queen who ensures obedience by way of a Sauron-like magical eye that can see through walls. There’s Goldenpaw, a Vegas-like monument to coin and chance, where even the annual taxes are decided on a dice roll. Persuading the heads of state to join your peace mission takes time. They are adults and, unlike children, subject to facts and forces that complicate innocent notions of world peace. Eventually, however, you come to share Tildrum’s benevolent, quasi-evangelical mission. The game’s cat’s cradle of interlocking systems is not for the unfocused. The young king’s duties are myriad, and range from scavenging to combat to town planning to sea captaincy to international diplomacy. Your to-do list grows by the minute, and soon Tildrum’s unceasing toil makes our royal family look inexcusably lethargic. At a time when nationalism is on the rise, when presidents advocate isolationism, splendid or otherwise, and when countries are more eager to detach themselves from their supportive neighbours, rather than cleave to them, the idealistic simplicity of Ni no Kuni IIs style and message is rendered curiously potent. Also out this month Far Cry 5 (Xbox One) Blockbuster video games, like most mass media entertainment, shy away from grand politicising: too firm an ideological stance risks alienating a portion of the audience, reducing profitability. Far Cry 5, by contrast, appears to lean into America’s ongoing political divisions. You play as a deputy sheriff pitted against a far-right militia, similar to the kind that rose during the Obama presidency and whose support Trump has obviously courted. In this heated setting, casting the game as a traditional battle between good and evil could turn potentially instructive fiction into toothless flimflam. Either way, Far Cry 5 will be, at the very least, interesting. TT Isle of Man: Ride on the Edge (PS4, Xbox One, PC) The annual, and frequently deadly, Tourist Trophy race, in which men and women scream around the Isle of Man on powerful motorbikes, became freshly notorious following the excellent 2011 film documentary, TT3D: Closer to the Edge. Now you have a chance to feel first-hand something of the thrill and terror of competitors in a race that has claimed 146 lives since it started in 1907. From the dry stone walls to the puffing cottage chimneys and inclement weather, the Isle of Man has been meticulously recreated in a game that demands players take time to master the art of slick gear changes and weight balancing if they’re to finish."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/mar/21/cambridge-analytica-facebook-exploited-trust","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-21T16:26:30Z","webTitle":"The evil genius of Cambridge Analytica was to exploit those we trust most | Richard Wolffe","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/mar/21/cambridge-analytica-facebook-exploited-trust","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/mar/21/cambridge-analytica-facebook-exploited-trust","fields":{"headline":"The evil genius of Cambridge Analytica was to exploit those we trust most","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"How on earth did Donald Trump win the presidency when he lost the popular vote by such historic margins? To put this in perspective: John Kerry lost the popular vote in 2004 by almost the same number of votes as Donald Trump 12 years later. This is not a small question, to be noodled over by disgruntled Democrats and political scientists. It lies at the heart of the likely impeachment of Trump himself, and it will dominate at least the next two US elections. The answer is fundamental to our democratic culture of fair elections, the rule of law, the role of technology and the free media. Now there are any numbers of factors that could have swung 40,000 votes in three states – Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania – which created the catastrophic fluke of the Trump presidency in the electoral college. But there are no factors as large and persistent as a weaponized Facebook – the trusted and entirely unregulated delivery vehicle for an astonishing amount of highly targeted disinformation. Without Facebook, there would have been no Pizzagate, and the hacked DNC emails would have struggled to reach their intended audience. The strangely Russia-loving Green party would never have tallied enough votes to skew those three battleground states towards Trump. All roads lead to Facebook and the small company that plundered its vast user data: Cambridge Analytica. Together the social network looks less like a group of friends and more like the Silk Road black market of arms and drugs dealers. Thanks to the reporting of the Observer, the Guardian and Channel 4, we now know that Cambridge Analytica could happily arrange for a candidate to fall into a compromising scandal with a Ukraine prostitute or a bribery sting. As the now-suspended CEO, Alexander Nix, put it so well: “It sounds a dreadful thing to say, but these are things that don’t necessarily need to be true as long as they’re believed.” In his snooty British accent, Nix is only saying – and converting into highly effective digital marketing – what Trump has long believed: lies don’t matter as long as they’re believed. So while it might seem grandiose for Nix to boast that he played a central role in getting Trump elected, he also identifies several key truths that Trump supporters may refuse to believe. First, the use of posts from fake activist groups that blur the lines between a campaign and outside groups. “This stuff infiltrates the online community, but with no branding, so it’s unattributable, untrackable,” Nix helpfully explained to undercover reporters. Election laws will surely change as a result of Nix’s bragging and Facebook’s arrogant and inept response to this snowballing scandal. Nobody could get away with such brazenly political manipulation in TV ads. Why should they do so on Facebook or any other part of the web? Cambridge Analytica also says their data “informed all the strategy” of the Trump campaign, including use of the “Crooked Hillary” slur that Trump still deploys to this day. At this point, lots of Trump supporters – and many political pundits – like to say that nobody could be this powerful. No single firm could have exerted this much influence. But that ignores the simple premise that has taken Facebook to such epic heights until now: that we trust our friends as a source of information far more than we have trusted traditional media and other institutions. The Trump campaign – aided and abetted by Russian hackers and trolls, conservative billionaires, and the brainiacs of firms like Cambridge Analytica – drove its disinformation through the people we like to trust: our friends. The evil geniuses of Cambridge Analytica were, as Channel 4 has shown, not nearly the geniuses they thought they were. Seriously, guys: when your company is registered in Delaware, you should probably realize that you come under US jurisdiction. Besides, we now know that many firms hoovered up Facebook’s data and the social media giant didn’t care. The end is surely nigh for Cambridge Analytica, and its key executives and investors can expect subpoenas in the near future. If the Democrats win back the House this year, we can expect new laws to prevent unattributable, untrackable political ads on digital platforms in time for the election that will decide Trump’s fate. But before we reach that point, Facebook’s future is already in serious doubt. It is now a polluted space, where you have no idea if your friends are real, if their posts are disinformation, if the ads are legal, and if your user data is safe. You may still trust your friends, but you won’t trust what they post on Facebook. Advertising dollars will bleed away, removing the only thing Facebook really cares about. Developers will drift away because they won’t want to work for a polluted brand. And the regulators will start interfering with new product launches and new takeover targets. If that sounds ridiculous, cast your mind back to the almighty position of Microsoft almost two decades ago, when it ruled most of the computer screens, documents and emails we stared at all day. When the justice department challenged its monopoly power, Bill Gates, his executives and his lawyers dug in with every denial and shred of outrage they could muster. They lost their case but avoided the government’s attempts to break them up, after George W Bush “won” the disputed 2000 election. It didn’t much matter. Stripped of goodwill, with an eye on government regulation, Microsoft turned into the company it despised: IBM. Ubiquitous, boring and left behind. Only recently has Microsoft turned its reputation around, but it’s a far cry from its heyday in the late 1990s. It was a remarkable coincidence that Gates himself turned to philanthropy at the same time, rebuilding his reputation on a global scale among people who needed his extraordinary wealth far more than he did. All that has yet to play out for Mark Zuckerberg: the outraged denials, the public shaming, the polluted brand, the turn to philanthropy. Facebook is unlikely to collapse, but its decline has already begun. He is only just discovering what everyone else learns when they come into Trump’s vortex, willingly or not. There is no escape when your reputation is circling the drain alongside him."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/mar/22/gin-juice-and-jingoism-are-us-golf-fans-the-worst-in-sport","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-22T08:00:21Z","webTitle":"Gin, juice and jingoism: are US golf fans the worst in sport?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/mar/22/gin-juice-and-jingoism-are-us-golf-fans-the-worst-in-sport","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/mar/22/gin-juice-and-jingoism-are-us-golf-fans-the-worst-in-sport","fields":{"headline":"Gin, juice and jingoism: are US golf fans the worst in sport?","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The idea that American golf spectators are the worst fans in sports is hardly new, but Rory McIlroy’s headline-grabbing suggestion to limit alcohol sales at PGA Tour events after the latest episode of bad behavior has placed them back in the spotlight. Which one assumes is how the “Get in the hole!” mouth-breathers like it anyway. Let’s be clear: US golf fans exist in a separate category altogether from the hooligans or ultras who attend sporting events with the express purpose of committing acts of violence. And the well-lubricated attention-seekers blurting “mashed potatoes” and “Baba Booey” during players’ backswings represent a tiny fraction of the spectators who adhere to, if not the heightened standard of golf etiquette, then a baseline of human decency. But there’s something unnervingly rotten about the bad apples whose, let’s be honest, predominately white male entitlement takes advantage of and corrodes what makes the sport unique, spoiling the experience for the majority. There are some who might dismiss out of hand the notion of gentlemanly conduct in the modern age. These are occupational hazards for millionaire athletes, they say. Does splitting the fairway with a tee shot require more silence and concentration than hitting a curveball or taking a penalty? Of course not. And the idiocy of overserved loudmouths is hardly limited to golf. But golf is different than other sports due to the proximity between the fans and the players. What other sport gives the rank-and-file spectator a chance to high-five their hero during competition? It’s a privilege that has far too often been abused by the knuckle-dragger who turns up to the course, inhales a dozen marked-up Stella Artois before spewing non sequiturs (at best) from the safety of the crowd. It’s clear to any semi-regular observer of the tour that something must be done. But it might already be too late. Nowhere has the problem been isolated as a uniquely American epidemic than international events like the Ryder Cup and Presidents Cup, where profanities and insults have flown with alarming frequency over the last two years on US soil. Danny Willett’s school-teacher brother didn’t do the then-reigning Masters champion any favors when he launched a scorched-earth broadside on American fans ahead of the United States’ victory at Hazeltine in 2016, calling them “cretins ... squeezed into their cargo shorts and boating shoes,” and “fat, stupid, greedy, classless, bastards ... pausing between mouthfuls of hot dog so they can scream ‘Baba booey’ until their jelly faces turn red”. Harsh, to be sure. But the invective absorbed by Willett over the week that followed did nothing to dispel the characterization and rather underscored it. The vulgar conduct continued at last year’s Presidents Cup, but the trend is hardly limited to the flag-waving jingoism rampant at team competitions where the bar of etiquette have traditionally been relaxed. The well-documented accounts of players, caddies and family members from both sides of the pond confirm the abuse is worse on the American end. Yet alcohol-fueled boorishness is just as prevalent at routine tour stops. There was the moron who yelled during Tiger Woods’ backswing on the green at Torrey Pines in January and countless other instances just like it in recent years. The problem is clear as day, but the solution is anything but. Organizers have leveraged free-flowing booze and flag-waving tribalism to broaden the appeal of their events and dispute the notion of golf as a stodgy enterprise, but at the cost of its own standards of decorum. We’re seeing now they can’t have it both ways. There’s no putting the genie back in the bottle, not when tournaments like the Waste Management Phoenix Open have leaned into their self-coined reputation as the “biggest party in golf” to the tune of record-breaking crowds that represent desperately needed antidotes to narratives of the sport’s demise. The social compromise, which is reflected across society everywhere from political discourse to the way we treat one another online, might be acceptable if the trend appeared to be holding steady. But it’s by all metrics getting worse. The PGA Tour’s executive vice president, Ty Votaw, has said a fan can be punished if they yell when a player is taking a shot – but anything after impact is within the rights of a ticketholder. Never more has the chasm between what’s legal and what’s right been wider. Nearly all other spectator sports in America attempt to discourage public drunkenness with formal alcohol policies. Major League Baseball discontinues beer sales after the seventh inning, while the NFL and NBA don’t permit the sale of alcohol after the third quarter. Similar measures at PGA Tour events couldn’t eliminate boorishness completely and might feel like a penalty on the vast majority of well-behaved, well-adjusted spectators, but they’d do nothing to exacerbate a trend that’s headed in one direction. Ultimately, it falls on the spectators themselves to self-police: like the crowd who zeroed in on Woods’ tormentor at Torrey Pines. That’s a frightening last resort for those with a grasp of human nature, but in times like these it’s all we’ve got."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2018/mar/20/yemen-war-us-saudi-senate-support","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-20T22:08:37Z","webTitle":"Yemen war: Senate rejects ending US support of Saudi-led campaign","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/20/yemen-war-us-saudi-senate-support","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/mar/20/yemen-war-us-saudi-senate-support","fields":{"headline":"Yemen war: Senate rejects ending US support of Saudi-led campaign","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The US Senate has rejected an effort to end support for the Saudi-led bombing campaign in Yemen that has resulted in the deaths of thousands of civilians and driven the country to the brink of famine, after a rare attempt by Congress to claw back its war powers from the executive branch. The Senate voted 55-44 on Tuesday against taking up the war powers resolution, which had been opposed by the Trump administration. The vote coincided with a White House meeting between Donald Trump and Saudi Arabia’s crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, at which the president lauded US defense sales to Saudi Arabia. “The relationship is probably the strongest it’s ever been,” Trump said. “Saudi Arabia is a very wealthy nation and they’re going to give the United States some of that wealth, hopefully, in the form of jobs, in the form of the purchase of the finest military equipment anywhere in the world.” The resolution to end US support for the Yemen conflict had been championed by senators from across the ideological spectrum, including independent Bernie Sanders, Republican Mike Lee, and Democrat Chris Murphy, and would have required Trump to extract any troops in “or affecting” Yemen within 30 days. “For far too long, Congress under Democratic and Republican administrations has abdicated its constitutional role in authorizing war,” Sanders said in a speech on the Senate floor before the vote. The Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, had urged lawmakers to abandon the effort, calling it “bad policy” and “procedurally mistaken”. He echoed the Pentagon’s argument that the resolution should not invoke the War Powers Act because the support the US is providing to the Saudi-led coalition “does not involve any introduction of US forces for purposes of the War Powers Resolution”. McConnell added that US intelligence provides the Saudis “greater precision in their air campaign”, resulting in fewer civilian casualties. “Withdrawing US support would increase not decrease the risk of civilian casualties and it would signal that we’re not serious about containing Iran or it’s proxies,” he said. The third anniversary of the Saudi intervention in Yemen falls this weekend, with no sign of peace. The conflict began in 2014, when the Houthis, Shia rebels from the country’s north, seized the nation’s capital and ousted the Saudi-backed ruler, Abd Rabbu Mansour Hadi, who lives in exile in Riyadh. In response, a Saudi-led Arab coalition began a bombing campaign in 2015, to restore the exiled government to power. The US has not formally backed the Saudi coalition, but it has provided targeted intelligence to the bombing campaign and has assisted with refueling coalition bombers. The United Nations has said the conflict has created one of the world’s worst manmade humanitarian disasters, as millions of Yemenis have been displaced and the population faces famine, with aid agencies struggling to supply assistance. Ahead of the vote, Yemen aid campaigners challenged Saudi claims that it had lifted its aid blockade on Yemen, and said restrictions meant the flow of commercial food and fuel was still below required levels. The continued disruption was pushing up the price of oil and depriving hospitals of power, they said. Speaking from the Yemen capital of Sanaa, Radyha al-Mutawakel, chair of the Mwatana organization for human rights, said: “It is much cheaper to stop the war rather than the continuously buying and selling arms. There are no heroes in Yemen, just criminals and victims. Anyone that comes to Yemen says ‘you are not living you are dying’. People no longer have the resources for life.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/apr/02/universities-brushing-racism-under-the-carpet-students-say","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-02T12:50:27Z","webTitle":"Universities brushing racism under the carpet, students say","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/02/universities-brushing-racism-under-the-carpet-students-say","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/apr/02/universities-brushing-racism-under-the-carpet-students-say","fields":{"headline":"Universities brushing racism under the carpet, students say","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Universities must tackle racism and not wait until incidents blow up on social media to act, according to student union officers and lecturers who say that a recent spate in racist incidents reported online is just the tip of the iceberg. Student representatives from leading Russell Group universities have told the Guardian that racism is being brushed under the carpet by most institutions. At one university a student support group said it had received 31 complaints since November. It comes as the Guardian heard from three students at Exeter University, who are calling on chancellors to make urgent changes after a spate of racist incidents, which they say are happening on campus and within student societies. Chris Omanyondo, Arsalan Motavali and Roman Ibra, all 21, told the Guardian about incidents of racism, including one in which they allege Ibra was called a “nigger” by a group of fellow students. In a separate incident, five students were suspended from the university after complaints that derogatory messages, including “if you ain’t English, go home”, were posted on a student WhatsApp group. Last month two 18-year-olds were arrested after Nottingham student Rufaro Chisango posted a video in which a group of men are alleged to be chanting “we hate the blacks” and “sign the Brexit papers”. Nottingham Trent University said: “Those suspected perpetrators have been suspended immediately pending a full investigation. We have contacted the student who made the complaint and are providing support to her and others affected. And we are liaising with the police about this incident. The National Union of Students (NUS) black students officer, Ilyas Nagdee, said that the cases were just “the tip of the iceberg”. Nagdee said: “Racism is embedded in every fibre of our institutions. Whether it’s the culture on campus or the content of the curriculum, the experiences of students of colour on campus point to them being treated as secondary recipients to the education system on campus.” His words were echoed by Ayo Olatunji, black and minority ethnic Students’ officer for UCL, who said : “We would hear about a case a day in the media if everything that happened went online,” he said. “Universities are not excluded from society, and society is rife with racism,” said Paul Miller, professor of educational leadership and management at the University of Huddersfield. Exeter university seems to have a particularly bad record, according to Annabel Murphy, the Tab’s assistant editor, who oversees news stories for 12 universities including Exeter. “The kind of people that go there are often very privileged,” she said. “They’ve had a lack of exposure to other races and have grown up surrounded by vaguely racist jokes that have been seen as just ‘banter’”. A University of Exeter spokesman said the university had an “unwavering commitment to tolerance, respect and inclusivity”. They added that in each of the last five academic years, the number of student reports of racism had been fewer than five. Even as the problem has become more visible, there are concerns that university authorities have failed to respond. Zamzam Ibrahim, the president of the University of Salford student union, said racism was a huge problem in all institutions but universities tended to shy away from it. “It’s unfortunate that it’s only when things go viral on social media and affect the image of the university that it’s taken seriously,” she added. One student who approached the Guardian, but asked to remain anonymous, said that he was on a leave of absence from Loughborough university after dealing with racism at university that damaged his mental health and self-confidence. “I’ve read messages in hall group chats where the words ‘coon’ ‘black’ and ‘ape’ were thrown around as insults. I’ve also heard stories about hall rugby team boys making ape noises in reference to an opposing black player ‘trying to communicate’,” he said. Loughborough University’s vice-chancellor, Prof Robert Allison, said that since being made aware of this incident the university had spoken to the student and were working with him to take appropriate action. Ryan Perinchief, president of the Durham People of Colour Association (DPOCA), created last year in response to racial incidents, said he had received 31 reports since November. “These are complaints of overt racism occurring, which would otherwise be ignored at Durham as it is such an elite institution.” Perinchief shared some of the complaints he had received, including one that read: “A bunch of white teenagers shouted ‘ni hao’ and ‘konichiwa’ at me. Would not stop. I was standing at the bus stop, and no one intervened.” Another one read: “You’re pretty for a black girl. I would get with you if you were white.” Durham University’s deputy vice chancellor and provost, Prof Antony Long, said that the university did not accept prejudice or discrimination and condemned racism. Concern has also been raised that students do not feel that they can go to their universities with a complaint. The Guardian sent a freedom of information request to universities about formal and informal complaints of racism over the last four years, but most responded to report just one, two or a handful of cases a year. The University of Birmingham said it had received five or fewer informal complaints, and five or fewer formal complaints, of racism a year since 2013-14. But Nagdee said that he had spoken to at least five students already this year about incidents at Birmingham. “Universities need to hold themselves to account as to why students may not want to report these incidents,” he said. A spokesperson for the University of Birmingham said it took a zero-tolerance approach to any examples of discrimination and incidents of reported racism on campus had been low for some time. “Universities are a place for open and constructive debate, the pursuit of knowledge and challenging established thinking in a civil way. Discrimination has no place here,” they said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2018/mar/22/unions-undocumented-workers-immigration-deportation-painters","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-22T10:00:23Z","webTitle":"Undocumented workers find new ally as unions act to halt deportations","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/mar/22/unions-undocumented-workers-immigration-deportation-painters","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/mar/22/unions-undocumented-workers-immigration-deportation-painters","fields":{"headline":"Undocumented workers find new ally as unions act to halt deportations","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"As the Trump administration takes its fight against undocumented workers to the workplace, some US unions are stepping in to protect their members and creating a new battlefront between the Republican party and organized labor. Last May Hugo Mejía Murguía, an undocumented worker from northern California, got a call to report to work. It was a shift that would change his life and launch a national campaign. When he arrived at the Travis air force base in Fairfield, California, military police called Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) after seeing his California driver’s license indicated his undocumented status. Ice also detained a second worker, Rodrigo Núñez. “My life just changed in only five or 10 minutes. I felt like I lost everything,” the father of three told the Guardian. Two weeks later when his wife came to visit him in an immigration detention center, much to his amazement, he learned that his union, the Painters Union Local 82, was hiring a lawyer to represent him. “I just thought that I was a member of the union for work and so I could get insurance for my kids. I never thought that my union would help me in a case like this. It was amazing,” said Mejía Murguía. Under the banner #FreeHugo, his union went all out on his behalf, holding rallies around the country to stop his deportation. The pressure was intense. “A couple times I tried to quit. It was just so hard to stay far from my family. It was hard when they came to visit me because of the glass when I saw them crying and I couldn’t touch them,” he said. “When they gave me letters and this support, that got me excited and I didn’t feel so alone about my case.” Finally, on 22 November, after 204 days in detention, he was released as a result of his union’s activism in public and in court, winning a stay on political asylum grounds. Rodrigo Núñez was less fortunate and was deported back to Mexico. Their different fates highlight a split in the union movement and its attitude to undocumented workers who are increasingly running into difficulties under the Trump administration. Núñez’s union, the United Brotherhood of Carpenters, did not defend him. While the Painters Union has chosen to embrace their increasingly immigrant workforce over the last few decades, the UBC has a much more strained relationship with immigrants. In March 2017, Bill Bing, a representative for the Northeast Regional Carpenters Council representative, even admitted in the Buffalo News that the union routinely called Ice to report undocumented workers on construction sites in upstate New York. “There are very good local union and nonunion contractors who suffer the fallout from dirty business,” Bing told the Buffalo News. The leadership of North America’s Building Trades Unions has traditionally been one of the whitest sectors of the labor movement. Civil rights groups have repeatedly sued construction unions to admit African Americans, and for decades, unions like the Carpenters would call immigration authorities to deport undocumented workers. However, over the last two decades as construction unions sought to organize larger numbers of undocumented workers, the attitude of labor has changed. Now, in the era of Trump, many labor leaders see an opportunity to accelerate those changes. “Has the Trump era accelerated our efforts? Absolutely,” said the Painters Union president, Ken Rigmaiden. “There are too many reasons to mention but one, in particular, is forcing 11 million immigrants back into the dark side of the construction economy, where wage theft and intimidation thrive.” Since being elected in 2013 as the union’s first African American president, Rigmaiden has led efforts to get construction unions to embrace immigrant labor. In July 2017, Rigmaiden hired 30-year-old Neidi Dominguez, who immigrated to the US from Mexico when she was nine and lived here undocumented until she was 25, as the Painters Union’s national strategic campaign coordinator. As the first Latina woman to head a major department at the Painters Union, Dominguez has led efforts not only to make her union more vocal and active on immigration, but to push other unions to be more proactive. Labor leaders like Dominguez say that since the majority of new members in the construction workforce are Latinos, building trades unions must do more to embrace immigrant workers if they are going to survive. “In the building trades for too long, it’s been almost nothing but a bunch of white guys. It’s changing but not quick enough,” said Dominguez. Under Dominguez’s leadership, the union helped to launch the Working Families United coalition, that has helped lead labor’s effort to protect workers facing threats of deportation while pushing unions to be more inclusive of immigrants. Because of Trump administration policy shifts regarding undocumented workers, the Painters Union is one of many that has become a sanctuary union and developed programs to defend their membership against the threat of deportation. Not only have the unions become more engaged in assisting their immigrant members facing deportation within their union, but externally their politics have also begun to shift. During the 2013 immigration debates, the AFL-CIO officially embraced the use of E-Verify system to check documentation of workers on construction. Some unions still embrace E-Verify, but many labor leaders have noticed a shift. One factor that has helped promote the leftward shift of the building trades has been the emergence of Latino labor leaders within their unions. One of the most prominent of those is Randy Bryce, a half Mexican, half Polish ironworker from Racine, Wisconsin, known as the “Iron Stache” for his distinctive facial hair, who has become a social media hit with his grassroots campaign against the House speaker, Paul Ryan. Despite living in a district in south-eastern Wisconsin that is only 5% Latino, Bryce has made immigration reform a central issue of his campaign; getting arrested recently during a protest against Ryan’s refusal to pass the Dream Act to protect undocumented children raised in the US. “People are getting the message,” said Bryce. “I tell people everybody is trying to gain access to the American dream. It’s getting harder and harder to find, but it’s not other people risking their lives trying to come over here to find it. It’s not their fault, it’s the boss trying to keep their foot on all of our necks.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/mar/21/josh-charnley-returns-rugby-league-warrington-wolves-sale-sharks","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-21T08:00:05Z","webTitle":"Josh Charnley says he returns to rugby league a more confident player","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/mar/21/josh-charnley-returns-rugby-league-warrington-wolves-sale-sharks","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/mar/21/josh-charnley-returns-rugby-league-warrington-wolves-sale-sharks","fields":{"headline":"Josh Charnley says he returns to rugby league a more confident player","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Josh Charnley has insisted he can leave rugby union with his head held high despite cutting short his time with Sale to return to rugby league with Warrington.

Wigan were not among those who approached him over a return but he rejected numerous approaches, preferring to remain with Sale until he felt he had fully adjusted to the rigours of rugby union: something he believes he ultimately achieved in the subsequent months. “In November, my agent rung me and told me Warrington were interested in me, but I turned it down because I’d not proved myself yet in rugby union,” Charnley said. “I still had another year on my contract and wasn’t interested in coming back so soon and being one of those guys who’d simply failed and come back. “I had a few other clubs knocking at the door too but it came too early in my union career, so I turned them down as well. Then, five or six weeks ago, we played against London Irish and it was my best game, I won the man of the match and I genuinely thought I’d cracked it. “It was tough, I’ve got to admit that. The first six months in particular were really hard. I was doing loads of homework and studying what we were doing just to learn the game and it was difficult. But I think I cracked it by the end, and I’ve genuinely no regrets at all.” Charnley acknowledged that with three internationals in Denny Solomona, Marland Yarde and Byron McGuigan as his direct competition at Sale, he was fearful that the longer he spent on the sidelines, the more his value for any prospective employer would suffer. “I’d not played since that Irish game [in February]. It’s tough to play every week and I didn’t want to sit around, wait and devalue as a player. The opportunity came up again to come here last week, we agreed terms and it’s happened very quickly.” Charnley is unlikely to feature for Warrington in their Super League fixture against Wakefield on Friday, but when he does make his debut for the Wolves he believes he can buck the trend and return to league a better player than the one who left. “I’ve been scrolling through Twitter and there’s been a lot of criticism from people saying you’re never the same player when you come back to league having played union,” he said. “But I’ve worked on things I wasn’t confident with before while I’ve been in union. I’m a lot more confident in certain aspects of my game now and I come back better to deal with that kind of pressure.” The winger also believes he rejoins rugby league at an exciting time for the sport but said he was surprised to notice the lack of profile it has in some quarters during his time in union. “Being in union during the [Rugby League] World Cup, none of the lads knew it was happening,” he said. “The advertising for the sport just isn’t there, but at least it’s growing. “With places like Toronto and New York wanting to take the game on, hopefully we can give it a bit of a push. A lot of the union lads do like league so if we can get out there and spread the message, hopefully it’ll grow.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/2018/mar/20/exeter-chiefs-jack-nowell-billy-vunipola-saracens-injured","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-20T19:51:34Z","webTitle":"Injured Jack Nowell and Billy Vunipola to spend longer on the sidelines","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/mar/20/exeter-chiefs-jack-nowell-billy-vunipola-saracens-injured","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/mar/20/exeter-chiefs-jack-nowell-billy-vunipola-saracens-injured","fields":{"headline":"Injured Jack Nowell and Billy Vunipola to spend longer on the sidelines","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The physical strain on England’s leading players shows little sign of easing with the Premiership champions Exeter resigned to losing Jack Nowell and Harry Williams for several more weeks and the Champions’ Cup holders Saracens unsure if Billy Vunipola will be fit to feature in next month’s European quarter-final against Leinster in Dublin. Nowell, who suffered a fractured eye socket last autumn, and Williams were both injured on international duty and missed England’s final two games against France and Ireland, with ankle and tricep injuries respectively. Neither will feature for the Chiefs in the short term although Exeter’s director of rugby, Rob Baxter, remains hopeful they will return for the closing stages of the season. “We’re looking at weeks rather than months at this stage,” said Baxter. “Harry has a nerve-related weakness in his tricep but we don’t think it’s too severe. We’re also hoping Jack will still have a significant impact before the end of the season.” Vunipola suffered a broken arm in January, having previously endured lengthy lay-offs after knee and shoulder surgery, but his hopes of a prompt return hang in the balance. “It’s a little bit uncertain,” said Mark McCall, Saracens’ director of rugby. “Billy is in a race against time to be ready for the quarter-final. If the arm isn’t right to play then we won’t risk him. He’s been injured enough, we don’t want to re-injure him.” Despite England’s disappointing Six Nations campaign, calls for central contracts to ease the burden on the country’s top players have been flatly dismissed by Premiership Rugby, with Baxter among those firmly against the idea. “How long have Ireland been centrally contracted and how many times have they had a season like this one?” said Baxter. “It’s very much a knee-jerk reaction to one year. If England go on to be dominant in next year’s Six Nations and do well in the World Cup, no one’s even going to be thinking central contracts. To come out with comments such as: ‘It’s up to the Premiership clubs to manage players better’ is just naive. We spend 12 months managing our players the best we can. I seriously don’t think where the players are now physically is down to the clubs at all. It’s down to the extra burden that gets put on to international players, it’s not because Premiership rugby players are lacking management.” Baxter, whose table-topping side resume their league campaign at Bath on Friday night, also points out that injuries are an occupational hazard. “You can’t expect guys to be playing high-level rugby and not pick up injuries. If there were five injured players coming away from every England camp you’d be starting to talk about it. At the minute there’s been an unfortunate set of circumstances.” Exeter, meanwhile, will hear on Wednesday that their postponed Anglo-Welsh Cup final against Bath has been rescheduled for the Easter bank holiday weekend. Baxter has also paid tribute to his departing scrum-half Will Chudley, whose summer move to Bath has been confirmed. “It wasn’t an easy decision to let Will go,” said Baxter. “He’s been a very important part of what we’ve achieved here and he’s one of the players I’ve enjoyed coaching the most.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2018/mar/20/facebook-cambridge-analytica-mark-zuckerberg-shareholder-questions","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-21T07:44:25Z","webTitle":"Facebook investors may want to quiz Mark Zuckerberg | Nils Pratley","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2018/mar/20/facebook-cambridge-analytica-mark-zuckerberg-shareholder-questions","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2018/mar/20/facebook-cambridge-analytica-mark-zuckerberg-shareholder-questions","fields":{"headline":"Facebook investors may want to quiz Mark Zuckerberg","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Politicians and regulators won’t be the only people who want a word with Mark Zuckerberg. With Facebook’s shares sliding more than 10% since the data breach involving Cambridge Analytica, shareholders would probably also like to quiz their chief executive about how he has been running the firm. But what are outside investors’ chances of exerting real influence? What if, after a few more chapters in this saga, the majority owners of Facebook conclude the “catastrophic failure of process”, as one MP put it, is so damaging that a new boss is required to restore credibility in the eyes of users, advertisers and the outside world? The short answer is that those investors would struggle to change the boardroom line-up. Zuckerberg owns only about 16% of Facebook but he has 60% of the votes, having achieved control by creating a class of stock with 10 times the voting rights of normal shares. To British eyes, the arrangement looks outrageous. Dual-voting structures at public companies were largely dismantled in the 1990s when they were deemed an affront to the idea that equal economic risk should imply equal voting power. In US technology sector, however, they prosper. Technology companies born in the 21st century prefer governance structures that belong in the 19th century. Google, Facebook, Groupon, LinkedIn and TripAdvisor all have unequal voting rights. Snap, owner of Snapchat, even managed to issue a class of share with zero votes. The thin justification is usually that the founders are geniuses who require complete freedom to pursue their visions. Being truly accountable to shareholders, with their grubby short-term concerns, is a distraction from the pursuit of greater long-term glory – or so the argument goes. It is astonishing that US investors, even in their greed to get on the next tech hit, tolerated such guff. But they did, and still do. Dropbox, an internet storage firm, and Spotify want to take the same route. One cannot, of course, say Facebook has been asleep to data risks because Zuckerberg is insulated via his super-charged shares. Nor can one say that harder accountability to owners would have made the company do anything differently, such as recognising the risk in allowing political messages to run like commercial adverts on the platform. But a proper voice for shareholders might have helped to puncture the instinctive defensiveness that Facebook displays whenever its “social mission” is questioned. In the circumstances, the severe reaction in the share price is not a surprise. This is a $490bn company with a boss whose voting power means he cannot be removed against his wishes. That arrangement looks fine in good times – not so when crisis strikes. GKN v Melrose: the battle continues Another day, another tit-for-tat round of exchanges between GKN and Melrose over pensions, each side claiming its plan is superior. Who’s right? Actually, that’s the wrong question. It is the view of the trustees of GKN’s pension funds that matters. The trustees have declared that GKN’s version provides “appropriate mitigation” but what of Melrose’s offer of “up to” £1bn? It looks OK to the unpractised eye, but what do the experts think? They should hurry up and give a view. Voting on this takeover bid closes on Thursday next week and, at the margin, pensions could influence some shareholders. It seems unfair that one side has a thumbs-up and the other hasn’t got an opinion. Melrose should have done itself a favour by approaching the Pensions Regulator for clearance, as it was asked to do. But the GKN trustees should still speak up soon. • This article was amended on 22 March 2018 to correct the valuation of Facebook from $66bn to $490bn."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2018/mar/20/russia-election-meddling-senators-release-security-recommendations","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-20T19:40:04Z","webTitle":"Senators release election security recommendations to deter meddling","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/mar/20/russia-election-meddling-senators-release-security-recommendations","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/mar/20/russia-election-meddling-senators-release-security-recommendations","fields":{"headline":"Senators release election security recommendations to deter meddling","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"A bipartisan group of senators leading an inquiry into Russian meddling in the 2016 US election called on Tuesday for urgent action by Congress to help states protect their voting systems from future threats of foreign interference. With the 2018 congressional primaries already under way, members of the senate intelligence committee outlined a series of recommendations – the first public release from the panel’s yearlong investigation – that they say will help improve the cybersecurity of the nation’s election infrastructure. “We’re now at a point where we’ve wrapped up one piece of our investigation, which deals with election security,” said Republican senator Richard Burr, the chairman of the committee, who spoke alongside the Democratic vice-chair, Senator Mark Warner, and members of the committee. By and large, he said, “we need to be more effective at deterring our adversaries.” “The Russians were relentless in attempting to meddle in the 2016 elections and they will continue their efforts to undermine public confidence in western democracies and in the legitimacy of our elections,” Senator Susan Collins, another Republican member of the committee, added during the press conference. The election security recommendations were released a day ahead of full committee hearing to discuss the attempted hacks of several state voting systems in 2016 and federal and local response. Jeh Johnson, the former homeland security secretary and Kirstjen Nielsen, the current homeland security secretary, are scheduled to testify. The suggestions include more federal funding for states to replace outdated voting systems and improved information sharing between local and state agencies. At a minimum, the committee said, machines should have “a voter-verified paper trail and no wifi capability” that would make them more vulnerable to being hacked. There are currently 14 states that lack a paper trail of votes cast. “Look at where we are now in this year of our Lord 2018, we’re talking about paper ballots,” said Kamala Harris, a Democratic committee member. She added: “Russians cannot hack a piece of paper the way they can a computer system connected to the Internet.” The panel was careful to stress that states should remain firmly in control of their election systems, adding that the role of the federal government should be to “ensure they receive the necessary resources and information”. They also called on the US government to “clearly communicate to adversaries that an attack on our election infrastructure is a hostile act, and we will respond accordingly”. The committee’s suggestions will be outlined in more detail in a report expected to be made public in the coming weeks. While Burr emphasized that his committee has not committed to any deadline, the panel said it prioritized their election security recommendations because of the urgency of the situation. Top intelligence officials have warned that the US election infrastructure remains vulnerable to foreign intrusion. “The last time it was the Russians, it may not be the Russians next time,” Senator James Lankford, a Republican of Oklahoma, said. “They have set a pattern that others can follow. It could be the the North Koreans, it could be the Iranians, it could be a domestic hacktivist group that uses that same playbook to try to seek chaos.” The findings do not address the committee’s investigation into whether Trump colluded with Moscow on its disinformation campaign. The bipartisan nature of the Senate committee sharply contrasts with a parallel investigation in the House, which the Republicans recently ended after concluding that there was no evidence of collusion between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin. The Republicans’ report also contradicted a conclusion by the US intelligence community that Russia meddled in the election to help sway support for Trump. Separately, special counsel Robert Mueller, is leading an investigation into whether Trump campaign associates coordinated with the Kremlin during the 2016 election. Last month, in indictments handed down by a grand jury, Mueller alleged that 13 Russian citizens and three Russian organizations had sought to disrupt the 2016 election. Mueller’s inquiry has also resulted in criminal indictments and guilty pleas of former Trump campaign aides. The president has repeatedly disparaged the inquiry as a “witch hunt” and denied that there was any collusion between his campaign and Russia. White House press secretary Sarah Sanders called the inquiry “absurd” at her press briefing on Tuesday, saying: “To pretend like going through this absurd process over a year would not bring frustration seems a little ridiculous.” On Tuesday, Trump said he called to congratulate Vladimir Putin on the leader’s controversial re-election on Sunday. Trump said the leaders planned to meet in the “not too distant future” to discuss “the arms race”. Asked during the White House briefing if Trump raised the issue of Russian meddling on the call, Sanders said she did not believe he had."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/mar/20/the-guardian-view-on-the-gender-pay-gap-enough-excuses-time-for-action","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-20T18:47:53Z","webTitle":"The Guardian view on the gender pay gap: enough excuses; time for action | Editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/20/the-guardian-view-on-the-gender-pay-gap-enough-excuses-time-for-action","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/20/the-guardian-view-on-the-gender-pay-gap-enough-excuses-time-for-action","fields":{"headline":"The Guardian view on the gender pay gap: enough excuses; time for action","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"With only a fortnight left before the deadline, not even a third of companies, charities and public bodies have met their legal requirement to publish figures on their gender pay gaps. There was plenty of notice that all with more than 250 employees would need to do so. The slow pace indicates the low priority afforded to such concerns and, perhaps, a hope that embarrassing figures will be buried in a late rush of filings. It seems probable that many organisations will not comply, and it is unclear whether and how they will be punished. They should be. The figures are not perfect. The refusal of law firms to include the earnings of (mostly male) partners, for example, produces technically accurate but misleading results. Nonetheless, the data published so far is powerful. Few if any women will be surprised that male colleagues outearn them per hour. But cold statistics have real force when they show disparities as stark as these: men at the UK wing of Goldman Sachs International earn more than twice the mean hourly pay of women. The impact is potentially reminiscent of #MeToo, if so far more muted. Such figures demonstrate to each woman that the problem is not an isolated case, but structural. They are not alone. Now they can prove it. The journey from the 1970 Equal Pay Act to the 2010 Equalities Act represented a shift from the idea that individuals had a right to not be discriminated against, to the idea that the country should and would tackle discrimination. So while the figures may be helpful to women in lobbying for change – allowing them to show that comparable businesses have very different outcomes – it is up to their employers and their representatives to take action. But will they? So far, many firms have boasted that they are committed to diversity (not committed enough, evidently) and that they pay the same for the same kind of work. This is not deserving of a gold star; equal pay is a legal requirement, in place for almost half a century. The shame is that it is not, in fact, being met in full. Worse, many companies – particularly those with striking pay gaps, such as fashion retailer Phase Eight (65%) and travel group Tui (56.9%) – seem to have missed the point. They say, in essence, that the gap exists because the senior jobs are dominated by men. This is not an explanation of the problem. It is the problem itself. The pattern of more women in low-paid jobs and fewer in high-paid jobs is seen in most organisations, across very different sectors; and it is why the figures showing employment rates per quartile are every bit as important as the hourly comparison. (The Guardian has an 11.3% mean hourly pay gap. This is lower than the current Office for National Statistics average, but it is not good enough and the aim is to reduce it further and to achieve 50-50 gender balance in the top half of the organisation within five years.) Some women may simply leave organisations that do not reward them. Good for them; bad for the companies losing talent unnecessarily – but will their bosses realise this? The time for excuses and explanations is over. Real progress requires a broader response, with management, unions and politicians putting forward concrete plans to change the culture through measures such as blind CVs and unconscious-bias training; and setting specific, numerical, stretch targets. The equalities watchdog should call out those who do not report, and those whose figures are woeful, as well as offering breakdowns by region and sector. Much of the gap reflects an enduring tendency to discriminate on the basis of hours worked, and assume that top jobs can only performed in one way, by one person working full time – rarely possible if they have significant care commitments. MPs on the women and equalities select committee argue that increasing male involvement in family life, including through an extension of paid, ringfenced paternity leave, will be key. The duty to report these figures is an annual one. There is a risk that their effect may dwindle in the years to come. But close analysis and publicity could make them more powerful, not less: it will become evident that some companies are closing the gap while others are making little or no progress. “The truth will set you free,” said Gloria Steinem. “But first, it will piss you off.” Prepare to get angry."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/mar/21/mod-cambridge-analytica-parent-company-scl-group-list-x","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-21T17:05:33Z","webTitle":"MoD granted  'List X' status to Cambridge Analytica parent company","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/mar/21/mod-cambridge-analytica-parent-company-scl-group-list-x","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/mar/21/mod-cambridge-analytica-parent-company-scl-group-list-x","fields":{"headline":"MoD granted  'List X' status to Cambridge Analytica parent company","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The chair of the Commons home affairs committee has called for a full investigation into the activities of Cambridge Analytica after it emerged that its parent company was granted provisional “List X” status by the Ministry of Defence until 2013, granting it access to secret documents. The Labour MP Yvette Cooper said there were serious concerns around SCL Group and its subsidiary Cambridge Analytica, which is being investigated by the information commissioner over a huge leak of Facebook data. SCL Group had a close working relationship with the MoD and was paid almost £200,000 for carrying out two separate projects. List X contractors are bound by strict rules over document security, and the MoD insists there was no recorded data breach. Cooper said: “Given the mounting concerns about Cambridge Analytica’s disregard for proper standards, particularly on information and data protection, we ought to know what the government contracts were with Cambridge Analytica or SCL and what access to information they had.” In 2014, MoD officials worked with SCL Group on “Project Duco” to analyse how people would interact with certain government messaging. The work on Project Duco is likely to raise concerns that government officials were aware of Cambridge Analytica and SCL’s operations, and intended to use them to promote government messages. “There are now growing concerns about whether there should be a wider investigation into their activities,” Cooper said. “There are concerns about the implications for democracy, about information being used in an illegitimate way and no one has the chance to counteract it, and that raises real problems.” The SCL project was carried out by the MoD’s Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (DSTL), which is focused on maximising “the impact of science and technology for the defence and security of the UK”. According to a heavily redacted document released under freedom of information rules, Project Duco was part of the government’s “human and social influence” work, and SCL was paid £150,000. The company was also paid £40,000 for work carried out in 2010-11. The government team, which included psychologists and analysts, worked with SCL in 2014 to assess how “target audience analysis” could be used by the British government. Over the course of the project in 2014, MoD officials flagged concerns over SCL’s data management, saying there were “rudimentary security mechanisms” in place. As part of Project Duco, UK officials assessed SCL’s methods, which included analysing “psychological and anthropological principles” and assessing how these could contribute to the government’s strategic communications. Over the course of the project, SCL assessed behaviour patterns in young unmarried males and key factors affecting instability among this group. Shortly after the work with DSTL, SCL delivered training for Nato, which was subsequently passed on to Georgian, Ukrainian and Moldovan government officials. According to an audit, SCL was paid C$999,657 (£548,000) for work on target audience analysis, including an eight-week training course for Nato staff. Target audience analysis allows governments or companies to assess how to target individuals with a message to change behaviour. As part of Project Duco, the MoD was given “source background detail” by SCL, which included “analysis processes, data collection plans and sampling strategies”. Cambridge Analytica and SCL are under pressure over the use of Facebook data. A whistleblower has said Cambridge Analytica was provided with the disputed Facebook data in 2014. Target audience analysis (TAA) is a controversial approach to government communications that evolved during the battle for hearts and minds in Afghanistan. According to an assessment of the method by the Cdr Steve Tatham of the Royal Navy in 2015, it allows governments to “diagnose the exact groupings that exist within target populations”, leading to a ranking that “depends upon the degree of influence they may have in either promoting or mitigating constructive behaviour”. It then uses “psycho-social research parameters” in order to “determine how best to change that group’s behaviour”. According to Statham, the data “builds up a detailed understanding of current behaviour, values, attitudes, beliefs and norms, and examines everything from whether a group feels in control of its life to who they respect and what radio stations they listen to.” He added: “TAA can be undertaken covertly.” During the work with SCL, the MoD noted that “it was ascertained that some SCL staff are vetted and they have rudimentary security mechanisms in place (eg a locked cabinet).” The report stated: “It is not thought that they have the capability to handle any electronic material above unclassified not considered the secure dissemination of documents.” An MoD spokesman said: “We have no current relationship or contracts with SCL Group, which includes Cambridge Analytica. As such, the company has no access to any classified information.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/mar/21/morning-mail-charge-over-justine-damond-shooting","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-20T20:14:32Z","webTitle":"Morning mail: murder charge over Justine Damond shooting","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/mar/21/morning-mail-charge-over-justine-damond-shooting","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/mar/21/morning-mail-charge-over-justine-damond-shooting","fields":{"headline":"Morning mail: murder charge over Justine Damond shooting","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Good morning, this is Eleanor Ainge Roy bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Wednesday 21 March. Top stories The Minneapolis police officer who shot and killed an Australian woman, Justine Damond, in July last year has been charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. Officer Mohamed Noor turned himself in on Tuesday after a warrant was issued for his arrest. Damond was shot on 15 July, minutes after she called 911 to report a possible sexual assault in the alley behind her home. Damond’s family said the charges were “one step toward justice” and they were pleased the Hennepin county attorney, Mike Freeman, had decided to bring charges. They said they hoped a strong case would be presented and Noor would be convicted. Noor has not talked publicly about the case and declined to be interviewed by state investigators. An officer who was with Noor at the time of the shooting, Matthew Harrity, told investigators he had been startled by a loud noise right before Damond approached the driver’s side window of their police SUV. Harrity, who was driving, said Noor had then fired his weapon from the passenger seat. Damond died of a gunshot wound to the abdomen. Jail records showed Noor was being held on $500,000 bail. If convicted of third-degree murder, he could face a maximum of 25 years in prison, though the presumptive sentence is 12 years. A judge could issue a sentence ranging from about 10 to 15 years. Documents released under freedom of information laws show state and federal ministers plan to renew 20-year-old logging agreements without conducting any new scientific or environmental reviews. The ministers have also discussed legal concerns that the extensions to regional forestry agreements might be invalid if they were based on the old scientific assessments. The concerns about the “legal and political risks” to the extensions that are about to be agreed are highlighted in a collection of 10 documents – including briefing notes and “contentious issues briefs” – prepared for the NSW primary industries minister, Niall Blair, and the state’s lands and forestry minister, Paul Toole, and obtained by Guardian Australia. Hundreds of millions of Facebook users are likely to have had their private information harvested by companies that exploited the same terms as the firm that collected data and passed it on to Cambridge Analytica, according to a new whistleblower. Sandy Parakilas, the platform operations manager at Facebook , told the Guardian: “My concerns were that all of the data that left Facebook servers to developers could not be monitored by Facebook, so we had no idea what developers were doing with the data.” He adding that the lax approach to the privacy of users was “utterly shocking”. In related news British MPs have summoned Mark Zuckerberg to appear before a select committee investigating fake news, and accused his company of misleading them at a previous hearing. But where is the Facebook chief executive, and when will he publicly address the mounting accusations? Sally McManus, leader of the ACTU, will today call for gig economy and labour hire workers to be offered the same minimum conditions as other employees, including access to unfair dismissal and collective bargaining. In a speech to the National Press Club, McManus will call on casual employment to be “properly defined” and for casual employees to be given the right to convert to permanent positions after six months. McManus’s call is backed by a big union advertising campaign. Google says it welcomes an inquiry by the Australian competition regulator into the impact of digital platforms on Australian media companies. In a briefing from New York, Google’s vice-president for news, Richard Gingras, says he would much rather collaborate than “exchange criticisms in the press”. The search engine giant has come under sustained criticism about its dominance over advertising which media companies say is threatening journalism.

Michael Cheika has always emphasised ball in hand but serious tactical changes may be needed to keep up with the Six Nations champions Ireland. Indeed, the Waratahs showed that tactical kicking still has a place in Australian rugby, with a 51-27 win over the Melbourne Rebels thanks to the devastating execution of Bernard Foley and Kurtley Beale. Thinking time The federal court of Australia ruled on Friday that the letters between the Queen and the former governor general of Australia John Kerr leading up to Gough Whitlam’s 1975 dismissal should remain secret. Here is what Paul Chadwick, the Guardian’s global readers’ editor, would say if he wrote to the Queen this week. “How should Australians feel when their legal system implicitly tells them that they must again look far abroad for an authoritative ruling on a matter of such consequence? These are testing times for the democracies. By this act of disclosure, you can nourish Australia’s.” Tracey Emin says a lot of public art projects are “ego-based” and “take over everything”. Her new project in Sydney, four years in the making at a cost of $912,000, has some of the trappings of a large-scale installation but, she says, it is not like that. The Distance of Your Heart features lifesized birds made out of bronze under park benches, awnings and lamposts. “I’m being gentle, I’m not being domineering, I’m not being macho,” she tells the Guardian Australia before its opening today. Carrie Hou, a single Asian female, offers her take on Michelle Law’s acclaimed play, Single Asian Female. It’s the first mainstage production in Australia to feature three Chinese-Australian leads. While the plot, featuring an overprotective mother from Hong Kong, might read “to white audiences … like a pretty stereotypical family drama”, Hou says it had a profound effect on her. It was “the first time we had seen our experiences so accurately encapsulated in theatre.” Media roundup The Canberra Times reports that a surge in demand for acute mental health services in the city means people in urgent need of help are being turned away from over-crowded wards and told they are not sick enough to be admitted. The Daily Telegraph splashes with plans to transform Sydney into a 24/7 city, following the lead of London, Berlin and Adelaide – where a significant proportion of consumer spending occurs after dark. A report into the transformation recommends that shops, museums, galleries and libraries all stay open much later at night. And the ABC reports that in the seven years since ice use began to surge in Australia, there has been a 33.5% rise in children placed in out-of-home care.

But I was puzzled by his statement: “A hierarchy of manly and unmanly human beings had long existed in many societies without being central in them. During the 19th century, it came to be universally imposed, with men and women straitjacketed into specific roles.” With such a statement he seems to be unaware of how this hierarchy was imposed way before the 19th century. Feminist historians have mapped how the patriarchy has been codified in law from at least the 18th century BCE in Mesopotamia and is evident in every recorded culture, even if the existence of a few goddesses, queens or prophetesses may distract us. As Mary Beard reminds us in Women and Power, we find as early as Homer that “speech will be the business of men”. And while patriarchal values were so clearly imposed in the 19th century, this was also the time when resistance became more visible and organised – the resistance that feminists celebrate and continue. It is essential that male writers who want to unpack the burdens of masculinity recognise how heavy and how complex these burdens are and how they have weighed on women and men not for 200 years but for millennia. Otherwise they run the risk of underplaying not only the scale of the problem, but also the work already carried out by feminists to map the patriarchy and resist it.

When the time came to teach those skills to her grandchildren, however, more than a century of gender discrimination stood in her way. For nearly 150 years, legislation stipulating who the Canadian government officially recognises as First Nations has discriminated against women, making it more difficult for them to hold status and pass it to their descendants. “We’re the only group in Canada that has got legislated discrimination still active, alive and well,” said McIvor. Early versions of the Indian Act – the 1876 colonial-era legislation that attempts to wrangle Canada’s more than 600 First Nations bands into a bureaucratic category – defined First Nations as “a male Indian, the wife of a male Indian or the child of a male Indian”. Campaigners have long challenged this definition, managing to chip away at some of the inequality. But today – in a country with a prime minister who proclaims himself a feminist and whose government has sought to usher in feminist foreign policy around the world – the law still continues to discriminate. Campaigners say the repercussions of that discrimination range from the denial of services and rights to a crisis in which as many as 4,000 indigenous women in Canada have gone missing or been murdered. McIvor was not entitled to indigenous status because she had married a non-indigenous man. A 1985 change to the act eventually allowed her and her children to gain status – but prevented her from passing it to her grandchildren. Without status, McIvor wasn’t able to live on reserve land and was excluded from hunting, gathering and fishing as well as traditional marriage, funeral and healing ceremonies. In contrast, her brother – twice married to non-indigenous women – was able to pass his status to his children and grandchildren. “What I lost was my community, and what I lost was my ability to feel like I belonged,” said McIvor. She and her descendants also had no claims to the tax breaks, healthcare and education benefits accessed by some First Nations. She began what a decades-long fight for equality, using her training as a lawyer to pursue the issue in court. Her case joined a string of others that in recent years have sought to tackle the sex discrimination in the legislation. Last year, it finally seemed that equality was imminent, after Canada’s senate unanimously passed a legislative amendment. After initially balking at the idea, the federal government – led by the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau – eventually approved the provisions. But no timeline has been set for thee changes, and the government now says that it must first consult with First Nations and other indigenous groups. “There’s no way that anybody in the world should be consulting with somebody on whether or not they should continue to discriminate,” said McIvor. Campaigners acknowledge that there are legitimate concerns over issues such as access to resources for the country’s 1.6 million indigenous peoples, but they express concerns that the consultations are being used to further delay equality. “What we’re getting is words – nice words – but no action,” said Shelagh Day of the Canadian Feminist Alliance for International Action. “How could this still be happening with a government that is committed to women’s equality and that has said it’s interested in a new nation-to-nation relationship?” Previous comments from the government hint at concerns over the costs involved. A recent report from the country’s parliamentary budget officer estimated that around 260,000 people would actually register if equality was granted – which could cost the government more than C$400m a year in health and education benefits. Several United Nations bodies have drawn a direct line between sexual discrimination in the Indian Act and Canada’s crisis of missing and murdered indigenous women. In a 2015 report, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights cited the Indian Act as “an important factor in understanding the persistence of unequal treatment and stereotyping of indigenous women, which in turn continue to place indigenous women at an increased risk for multiple forms of violence”. The push for change comes amid a wider conversation on replacing the Indian Act with the indigenous self-government and self-determination. But as long as the act endures, it must treat men and women equally, said Day. “When the federal government is talking about forging a new nation-to-nation relationship with indigenous peoples, it seems critical that the pool of people with whom the new relationship is being forged not be distorted by colonial-era sex discrimination.” In an email to the Guardian, the federal ministry responsible for the Indian Act said officials are working with First Nations communities and other partners to design consultations on eliminating the remaining sex-based discrimination in the act. The ministry declined to detail their timeline. After more than two decades of litigation, McIvor’s grandchildren are now entitled to status but – unlike her brother’s grandchildren – will not be able to pass this to successive generations. So her battle for equality continues. “What I lost was a big piece of me, of who I am and how I was recognised. My people saw me as not one of them,” she said. “People say it’s about getting your medical and your dental and your education. It has very little to do with that,” she said. “It’s the recognition that I belong to this group of people. That they recognise me as belonging – and I recognise them. That was lost.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/may/02/radio-dodo-syrian-refugee-children-bedtime","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-02T07:00:06Z","webTitle":"Radio Sleepytime brings bedtime stories for Syria's bereft children","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/02/radio-dodo-syrian-refugee-children-bedtime","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/may/02/radio-dodo-syrian-refugee-children-bedtime","fields":{"headline":"Radio Sleepytime brings bedtime stories for Syria's bereft children","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"“Attention ladies and gentlemen, come closer! The circus – and your favourite radio show – is about to start,” says a French-Canadian veteran journalist in French. He turns to his co-host, a Syrian storyteller, who repeats the words into her microphone, this time in Arabic. In the tiny downtown studio of a student radio station in Montreal, Bernard Derome and Marya Zarif are recording a radio show for Syrian refugee children. Launched in 2017 with the support of the Canadian Commission for Unesco, Radio-Dodo, or Sleepytime-Radio, has already broadcast 37 episodes online and through Radio-Rozana, a Syrian radio station based in Paris. The weekly bilingual show mixes stories, songs and segments about everything from tying your shoelaces to why your milk teeth fall out. The aim is to help Syrian refugee children around the world forget about their worries and fall asleep at night. The woman behind the show is Brigitte Alepin, a French-Canadian tax expert whose Syrian grandfather immigrated to Canada in the early 20th century. When the Syrian war erupted in 2011, Alepin said she felt shocked and helpless; only a few years earlier, she had visited her grandfather’s hometown of Aleppo with her young son. Throughout the trip he had played with local children; now, she couldn’t help wondering about them. “I asked myself, how is it that life makes it possible for my boy – who had been in Aleppo – now to be safe at home in Quebec?” she said. “I told myself I would never be able to feel good about myself again if I didn’t find a way to help.” For a while, Alepin wondered how she could help Syrian refugees half a world away, but as she discussed the problem with a friend, an idea formed: radio waves could cross borders and reach an audience anywhere around the world. “We were talking and a little while later, I had an intuition: I would try to make a radio show for children,” said Alepin. She gathered a small team of Syrian, Algerian and Canadian volunteers to help her organize the show, find content and sign up storytellers. Prominent Canadian writers including Kim Thuy and Wajdi Mouawad, and former Canadian Olympic athlete Marie-Ève Marleau have appeared on the show to read stories or discuss their jobs. Most of the audience is in Turkey and Quebec. One regular listener is Rahaf, a 10-year-old Syrian refugee from Damascus who came to Montreal in 2016 with her two brothers and their parents. Rahaf uses her brother’s laptop to listen to the show as she falls asleep; her favourite story so far was about a dog taking the bus by himself. “I just listen on my bed and I sing along,” she said in French, her new language. Rahaf’s mother, Basma – who asked for the family’s surname to be withheld – said that her husband and sons escaped to Jordan first. But when Basma and Rahaf attempted to follow, they were arrested and jailed for 18 months. After being released, she and her siblings lived in a refugee camp in Jordan for three years; conditions were harsh, and there was no chance for the children to go to school. Now Rahaf is getting used to her new life, going to school during the day and playing at home. “I like telling myself stories and when I have a new book, I read it to myself,” she said. Alepin says she wants to continue spreading love and joy to refugee children and plans to further expand her project. She has recently found a partner radio station in Mali to broadcast her show to children in the French-speaking country, and hopes that eventually Radio-Dodo can become a global radio show for child refugees around the world.

The minister for emergency services, Troy Grant, said the former Australian federal police commissioner, Mick Keelty would undertake the review. Grant said the residents of Tathra and surrounding areas had understandably been left devastated by the bushfire and the damage it left behind. About 70 houses were lost or damaged in the blaze, which ripped through the town on Sunday afternoon. While no one died, some residents did not receive text message alerts to evacuate. There have also been allegations that the Rural Fire service turned down an offer of assistance from the Fire and Rescue NSW. The professional fire fighting service offered to send a pumper to the fires after receiving numerous emergency calls. The RFS, a volunteer organisation, said the pumper was unsuitable for the conditions they faced on Sunday. Grant said after residents returned to their homes there would be a full investigation. “Mr Keelty has the credentials and the experience to properly review the operational response to the Bega Valley fire, having led an independent inquiry into the 2011 Perth Hills bushfire and the 2012 Margaret River bushfire,” he said. “His expertise will ensure an independent assessment of the events surrounding this natural disaster.” Grant said this would particularly focus on the call taking and dispatch arrangements of both Fire and Rescue NSW and Rural Fire Service across the state. “Any recommendations that are put forward will be considered to ensure regional and rural communities in NSW receive the best emergency service response possible,” he said. The minister said local firefighters and personnel had worked tirelessly to contain the Bega Valley fire and save as many properties as they could. “Thank you to all firefighters who risked their lives to fight the Bega Valley fire,” Grant said. “While properties have been lost, together our firies saved 398 homes and no lives were lost, which is thanks to the hard work from both NSW RFS and Fire and Rescue NSW firefighters. Our firefighters have gone above and beyond for their community, as they always do.” The review was “by no means a criticism of our dedicated and hardworking firies, rather the appropriate course of action to ensure community confidence in our emergency service agencies”. An official coronial inquest will also be conducted into the emergency response to the fire."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2018/mar/21/british-architecture-projects-under-threat-from-brexit-riba-survey","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-21T06:00:03Z","webTitle":"British architecture projects under threat from Brexit – survey","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/mar/21/british-architecture-projects-under-threat-from-brexit-riba-survey","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/mar/21/british-architecture-projects-under-threat-from-brexit-riba-survey","fields":{"headline":"British architecture projects under threat from Brexit – survey","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Architecture has been hit badly by Brexit with more than two-thirds of UK architects reporting building projects put on hold since the referendum, according to a new survey. More than a third said they had projects cancelled in 2017 because of the uncertainty surrounding the UK’s departure from the EU. The Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA) said the findings from “the most comprehensive survey of architects on Brexit” reveal significant concerns about the continued lack of clarity over the long-term future relationship with the EU. The professional body – whose members range from solo practitioners to “starchitect” firms led by the likes of Richard Rogers and David Chipperfield – said that Brexit would isolate Britain further, with 74% saying that access to the single market was necessary for British architecture to continue to expand internationally. They also expressed concern that if there were no mutual recognition of professional qualifications across borders they would lose valued EU staff. The survey found that 60% of EU architects working in the UK have considered leaving, a rise on a similar survey in 2016 when 40% said they had considered leaving because of Brexit. More than 20% of the 40,000 architects working in the UK are from the EU. “Many EU architects continue to face uncertainty about their future in the UK. This is unsustainable,” said the RIBA chief executive, Alan Vallance. “It is having a real-time impact on recruitment and is unquestionably a threat to the success of our economy and society. The UK government must make urgent decisions that allow the sector to thrive today,” he added. RIBA argues that architects have a valuable contribution to make to post-Brexit Britain by helping to create cohesive communities through good design and building work. It said that, with just one year to go, its survey showed that the threat of a hard Brexit was impacting confidence in the industry. The UK’s architecture sector contributes £4.8bn to the British economy every year, but RIBA is concerned that Brexit combined with new immigration policies for EU citizens will thwart the industry’s growth potential. Architecture is renowned for international collaboration and exports – innovative creations such as the Pompidou Centre in Paris was designed by British architect Lord Rogers and Renzo Piano, the Italian architect behind the Shard. RIBA has called on the government to recognise that architecture, like science and research, relies on the creative potential of international collaboration. “Global reach can only continue if the UK government prioritises access to international talent,” the RIBA report said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2018/mar/20/reay-atkinson-obituary","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-20T18:23:28Z","webTitle":"Reay Atkinson obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/mar/20/reay-atkinson-obituary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/mar/20/reay-atkinson-obituary","fields":{"headline":"Reay Atkinson obituary","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"My friend and former colleague Reay Atkinson, who has died aged 91, stood out as an adventurous senior civil servant committed to improving the economy and the well-being of his native north-east England. He played a key role in luring the car manufacturer Nissan to Sunderland in 1984. Reay had seemed destined to become a permanent secretary in Whitehall. In 1973 he was chosen to head a new Central Computer Agency charged with delivering IT to Whitehall and then in 1978 became head of information technology at the DTI (the Department of Trade and Industry). But when Margaret Thatcher scribbled “poppycock” at the top of a report he had written, Reay’s days in Whitehall seemed numbered. He was told promotion was unlikely. Rather than take a job on offer at the Royal Mint, in 1981 he headed north to become regional director of the DTI in the then northern region (which included the north-east and Cumbria). Although he was based in his home city of Newcastle upon Tyne, he and his third wife, Rita, decided to live in the north Pennines, at Garrigill. Fell walking became a passion in the nearby Lake District. Reay had an immediate impact on the region. Although he was at times quick-tempered, his determination and diplomacy meant that he was one of the few people capable of holding together warring parties in a (still) politically tribal north-east. In a citation to honour Reay’s fellowship at Newcastle University, it was noted that “his northern roots, and a willingness to use a liberal interpretation of civil service rules, led some in the capital to worry that he had gone native”. When Nissan was weighing up options for a UK assembly plant in the early 1980s – Sunderland, or Shotton, in north Wales? – there is little doubt that Reay played a pivotal role in successfully pitching for Wearside. In 1986 the Nissan plant, directly employing 7,000, was officially opened by Thatcher. The son of a railwayman, William Atkinson, and a schoolteacher, Lena (nee Haselhurst), Reay saw wartime service in the Royal Navy, serving in arctic convoys and, subsequently, as a marine sub-lieutenant during the D-day landings in the course of which he was wounded. He was educated at Gosforth High school and graduated in history at the former King’s College, then an arm of Durham University in Newcastle, which subsequently became Newcastle University. He joined the civil service in 1950. He is survived by Rita (nee Bunn), whom he married in 1983, a daughter, Susan, from his first marriage, to Joy, who died in 1955; and a son, Simon, and daughter, Sarah, from his second marriage, to Leigh, which ended in divorce."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2018/mar/26/the-terror-review-menacing-arctic-horror-series-gives-a-lasting-chill","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-26T14:16:55Z","webTitle":"The Terror review – menacing Arctic horror series gives a lasting chill","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/mar/26/the-terror-review-menacing-arctic-horror-series-gives-a-lasting-chill","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2018/mar/26/the-terror-review-menacing-arctic-horror-series-gives-a-lasting-chill","fields":{"headline":"The Terror review – menacing Arctic horror series gives a lasting chill","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Despite its unstoppable increase, there remains something undeniably exasperating about small-screen horror, the extended format bloating any potential scares. The campy American Horror Story franchise has grown tired, The Walking Dead should have died a long time ago and news of a Blair Witch series is terrifying for all of the wrong reasons. But horror fans remain resilient, having endured more big-screen disappointments than most, and in The Terror they might finally have something worth staying in for. Executive-produced by Ridley Scott (whose small-screen output has ranged all the way from Taboo to The Good Wife), this menacing 10-parter is loosely based on true events. The truth is that in the mid-1800s, two British ships underwent an ambitious voyage to the Arctic in order to force the Northwest Passage. It was doomed and the crews didn’t return. But exactly what happened to them remains a mystery and in his 2007 novel, Dan Simmons created a fictionalized account of what befell the men of HMS Erebus and HMS Terror. In this handsome adaptation we’re thrown in at the, ahem, deep end, joining the men far into their trip with flashbacks filling in some of the smaller details on land. The two crews are headed up by Sir John Franklin (Ciarán Hinds) and Captain Francis Crozier (Jared Harris) whose dueling outlooks cause friction, with the inexperienced yet bolshy Captain James Fitzjames (Tobias Menzies) stirring the pot. As they find themselves further from home, their problems start mounting with the unforgiving climate threatening to put their ambitions permanently on ice and a mysterious force suggests an even darker fate might be in store. One of the major issues with small-screen horror is pacing. Most scary movies tend to run for around 90 minutes for a solid reason: putting an audience on edge for any longer requires considerable, rare skill and keeping them in the dark proves frustrating once the running time is extended beyond breaking point. After some sleek credits, in the first 15 minutes of The Terror, there’s enough menacing grisliness to suggest that a 10-part story won’t feel like a snooze, showrunner David Kajganich confidently timing reveals (the second episode is set eight months after the first). It’s already been announced that The Terror will work as an anthology show and if a second season were to be produced, it would follow a different story and this awareness leads to tighter storytelling. While the knowledge of what will occur does give the show a foreboding sense of dread, the cinematographers struggle to lend it the claustrophobic tension it needs to fully burrow under the skin. The vast icy landscape surrounds the crew in brightness, a challenge within the horror genre, yet unlike John Carpenter’s The Thing, the initial episodes struggle to make it seem like a truly terrifying place to be. The TV budget gives it a staginess that also prevents us from truly feeling transported. But the unknowable nature of what sinister force is tormenting the men means that the show remains steeped in intrigue and it bristles with the constantly shifting powerplay within the crews. Hinds is a compellingly tragic figure with the haunted expression of a man whose optimism in what might be achieved and faith in the protection of God are both being slowly chipped away. His performance lends a tragic edge to the increasingly dire situation and while he’s the show’s undoubted MVP there’s strong support from a spiky Harris as his opposing captain. The unrelenting misery of The Terror might prove a tad joyless for those who prefer their horror without a side of bleak semi-realism and it remains to be seen just how effective it will be once the 10th hour has aired. But, for now, there’s hope for small-screen horror, albeit wrapped in a hopeless package.

In the autumn, the two sides will probably finalise the text of the withdrawal agreement, enabling the UK to leave the EU at the end of March 2019. However, the issue of the Irish border remains unresolved, and could still wreck the Brexit talks. Despite warm words in the run-up to the summit, the British and Irish positions appear fundamentally incompatible. The UK government plans to leave the single market and the customs union. It says it wants to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland. But some in Ireland doubt its sincerity: the British know the EU will need to police its single market and customs union by checking for compliance with its standards for industrial and agricultural goods, as well as tariffs and rules of origin. So how could a hard border be avoided? The joint report signed by the EU and the UK in December sketched out three possible answers. Option A would sort out the border as part of the overall EU-UK agreement on future relations. Option B would be Ireland-specific solutions based on advanced technology. And if neither A nor B proved viable, option C would apply: in the north there would be “full alignment” with those EU rules required to support the Good Friday agreement and north-south cooperation. The joint report also ruled out – to placate the Democratic Unionist party – new barriers between Northern Ireland and Britain. The British reckoned that C meant aligning just some rules, while the Irish and the EU thought it meant much more. To remove the ambiguity, the commission spelled out the precise meaning of alignment in the Irish protocol of the draft withdrawal agreement, published last month. This would keep Northern Ireland in the customs union and the single market for goods and electricity, and abiding by EU rules on plant and animal health, VAT and state aid. Northern Ireland would be subject to the European court of justice. The protocol said nothing about excluding a border in the Irish Sea. The British government was flabbergasted, believing the spirit of the Good Friday agreement – that both communities in Northern Ireland should agree to constitutional arrangements – had been flouted. Even some of the most pro-EU cabinet ministers were perturbed, worrying about the impact on public opinion of an apparent attempt by the EU to impose its rules on Northern Ireland. Theresa May said that no British prime minister could accept the wording of the protocol. But there was not much sympathy for the UK among EU governments. They thought the protocol’s firm line was required to prevent the UK backsliding on its commitments. The EU has not made agreement on the transition conditional on the UK signing the protocol. But it has insisted that the UK state that it accepts that the withdrawal agreement should include a “legally operative version of the ‘backstop’ [option C] … in the joint report”, and that this will apply unless another solution is found. The UK has also agreed to tackle the border through a new trilateral negotiating process with the commission and Ireland. But all this merely postpones rather than resolves the border problem, which may blow up at June’s EU summit. The Dublin government is adamant that it will not accept any infrastructure on the border lest it become a target for terrorists. It does not believe that option B, clever technology, is viable. Asked how option A could work, it says the UK would have to stay in the single market and the customs union – which May rejects. Hence the importance of option C for the Irish. But the draft protocol’s version of that option remains unacceptable to May and the DUP. The 26 other EU governments say they are right behind Ireland, but are they? In private, if not in public, some of them hope for a compromise. Their diplomats, like some senior EU officials, believe that if the UK leaves the customs union and the single market, controls of some sort will be necessary. “We need local solutions that ensure checks can be carried out, in a way that avoids the need for a hard border,” said one official. “The checks would be near the border but not on it,” said another. Some French officials think option B is the best way forward. However, the UK cannot count on the member states cajoling Ireland to climb down. Even those governments that hope for compromise say that if Dublin calls on their support, they will stand by it. Some UK officials want to mix options A, B and C. They talk of a “customs partnership”, whereby the UK would police the EU’s customs union on its behalf and vice versa, obviating the need for border checks. But the EU says this is “magical thinking”, and unrealistic. British officials think option B could help solve the border problem, with methods such as number-plate recognition, electronic pre-clearance and trusted-trader schemes. They also think the less sensitive parts of option C, such as aligning with EU rules on plant and animal health, would help. In addition, they would let small traders cross the border unhindered. All that could reduce, but probably not eliminate, the need for some checks near the border. Could the Irish live with that? They say not. But if they really tried to make May swallow the protocol as it stands, there would be no deal. And that would damage the Irish economy almost as much as that of Britain. Several of Ireland’s EU partners will gently encourage the Irish to accept a less than perfect outcome on the border. • Charles Grant is director of the Centre for European Reform"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"books/2018/mar/26/further-reading-penelope-lively-renewal","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-26T05:00:18Z","webTitle":"Penelope Lively picks five books about renewal","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/mar/26/further-reading-penelope-lively-renewal","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/mar/26/further-reading-penelope-lively-renewal","fields":{"headline":"Penelope Lively picks five books about renewal","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The definitive account of the remarkable botanical entrepreneurs of the 19th century is Alice Coats’s The Plant Hunters. We owe to Robert Fortune, George Forrest, David Douglas and others the plants that are ubiquitous in our gardens today, but which were acquired by way of perilous expeditions and the arduous collection of specimens. Buddleias, azaleas, rhododendrons, hydrangeas and many more are staples today, but they were brought back to the UK by men who risked life and limb, climbed mountains, braved bandits and pirates, or scoured remote areas of China, like Ernest Wilson in his pursuit of Davidia involucrata, the handkerchief tree, the ultimate horticultural trophy of the early 20th century. Willa Cather’s My Ántonia is the great novel of pioneer life in the American west. Ántonia Shimerda is the daughter of Bohemian immigrants, and the feisty central figure of a narrative that darts about in time and space, conjuring up the Nebraska landscape that is “nothing but land, not a country at all, but the material out of which countries are made”. This is prairie life at its very beginning – sod houses, the struggle to grow things. It is full of marvellous imagery, my favourite is that of the plough with the sun sinking behind it: “exactly contained within the circle of the disk, the handles, the tongue, the shade – black against the molten red”. Midnight’s Chidren has to be the fictional blueprint of a beginning, of new growth. Salman Rushdie’s epic novel charts the challenges that faced India in the early years of independence, through the eyes of Saleem, one of those born on the stroke of midnight on the day of independence – the cultural, religious and political differences, the migrations and wars, the suffering and expectations. The book was also the most prominent expression of magical realism, which Rushdie argued allowed political ideas to be expressed in ways more pungent than those available in conventional literary style. The Beginning of Spring is Penelope Fitzgerald’s Russian novel, set in Moscow in 1913. It is an amazing re-creation of the city, the Russia of that time, extraordinary in its detail of furnishings, practices, attitudes, behaviour. Fitzgerald had only been to Russia once, briefly, and obviously not in 1913, making it an exemplary instance of fiction where careful research is the hidden seven eighths of the iceberg. It is also elliptical, elusive. We, the readers, know that the revolution is not far off; this is never hinted or implied, but there is this curious sense of something new and unidentifiable that lurks, epitomised in a mysterious woodland scene with figures that may or may not be conspirators. Margaret Mead’s Growing Up in New Guinea was a huge success when it was published in 1930. I remember reading it in the 50s, with fascination – the first work of anthropology I had come across. She was studying the childhood lives of the Manu people of the Admiralty Islands, north of New Guinea, comparing the relatively relaxed attitude towards childcare there with western practices. I found that less interesting, back then, than her intimate observation of the lives of the Manu, and how children behave while growing up in such a contrasting society. Her writing was the kind of accessible anthropology that I have found absorbing ever since; she was in many ways a pioneer, bringing anthropology to a wider audience. • Penelope Lively’s Life in the Garden is published by Fig Tree.

Waving the black and white flag used by the Islamic State and wearing balaclavas, military fatigues and ammunition belts, members of the group released most of the girls they had abducted in Dapchi early on Wednesday morning. On 19 February armed militants pretending to be soldiers herded the girls into trucks and escaped. The Nigerian government was initially slow to act but then said it would negotiate with the group for the girls. It has denied any ransoms were paid. Witnesses said the militants pulled up near Dapchi police station on Wednesday and shouted that parents should pick up their daughters. Initially, villagers ran away fearing another attack. But when they realised what was happening, they began to cheer and wave at the militants, chasing after their pickup trucks, some recording videos on their phones. “Dapchi is full of joy,” said Mohammed Mdada, who saw the girls being whipped as they were driven away a month previously. He said the militants apologised to some of the girls’ parents in their language, Kanuri, and shook their hands before driving off. “They said that if they knew they were Muslim girls they wouldn’t have abducted them,” Mdada said. “They warned the girls that they should stay away from school and swore that if they came back and found any girl in school, they’d abduct them again and never give them back.” One of the goals of Boko Haram – which has kidnapped thousands of girls, boys and women, forcing some of them to blow themselves up, killed thousands of others and displaced millions – is to stop children receiving what it perceives as western-style education. Usman Mataba, whose niece was among those returned, said she had talked to the militants. “I approached them and they told me that they had brought all the girls except six – that five had died on the day they were taken,” he said. “They said they discovered they were dead when they arrived at their destination, so they buried them.” Mdada said he had been told the five girls were trampled to death. The sixth had “refused to cooperate” with them, Mataba said. Amnesty International later said four girls were still missing. Locals said Boko Haram also dropped off a boy who had apparently been kidnapped by accident. Hafsat Abdullahi phoned the Guardian to say her 16-year-old sister Fatima, who had been taken, had been dropped off in Dapchi. She put her sister on the phone. “It took us three days to get back to Dapchi,” said Fatima. “We were divided into three groups and flown in planes, and taken over rivers in boats.” Soon after arriving back in Dapchi, the army told Fatima and her schoolmates to assemble at the village hospital. “They took all of them to the hospital, Fatima is in the hospital now,” Hafsat said later, waiting at home to see her sister. “I heard that the chief of staff of the army is here and wants to take the girls with him to Damaturu. I don’t like that – I want her to stay.” Their parents were not allowed in to see them, and the girls were soon put into vehicles and driven away. Their destination was Abuja, Nigeria’s capital, where they were to meet the president, Muhammadu Buhari. In the aftermath of the Dapchi attack, Buhari said his government would negotiate with the militants, but in a statement released on Twitter on Wednesday he claimed there had been “backchannel” negotiations and that no ransoms had been paid. This raises the question of what was offered to secure the girls’ release. The Nigerian government held several Boko Haram commanders who could have been handed over as barter. Other aspects of the abduction and release remain murky. According to an Amnesty International report, the army and police had been warned that Boko Haram would abduct the girls and made no attempt to stop them. They also had been warned that they would be brought back on Wednesday morning, according to Dapchi residents, and positioned themselves at the school they had been taken from, thinking that they would be dropped off there. However, their kidnappers drove them into the centre of the village, close to the police station. Neither the military nor the police attempted to apprehend the militants, who even stopped to change a tyre before leaving Dapchi, according to Mataba. Parents of the Chibok girls, kidnapped four years earlier in a neighbouring state to worldwide condemnation, happened to be in Dapchi to commiserate with their counterparts and urge them to be patient. The Chibok girls were taken before Boko Haram split into several factions, when it was led by Abubakar Shekau, a notorious militant who vowed to “sell them in the market” and who is still believed to have some 100 of the girls in his custody, having traded others for vast sums of money, according to an investigation by the Wall Street Journal."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/ng-interactive/2018/mar/21/david-squires-on-sydney-fcs-impending-a-league-implosion","type":"interactive","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-21T17:00:02Z","webTitle":"David Squires on ...

With Senate debate under way this week, the government has launched a major duchessing effort, backed by business groups, to convince crossbenchers to support a reduction in the company tax rate from 30% to 25% by 2026-27. Courtesy of Martin’s decision to support the package, it now has four crossbench votes. Cory Bernardi, David Leyonhjelm and the former One Nation representative Fraser Anning are already in the yes column. On Tuesday, Pauline Hanson and Derryn Hinch confirmed they were also at the negotiating table. Both Hanson and Hinch want assurances that there will be a quid pro quo for workers if the big business tax cut passes. With Hanson and Hinch clearly in mind, the Business Council of Australia issued a public statement signed by Australia’s biggest companies on Wednesday afternoon indicating business would invest in Australia “as the tax cut takes effect” – which is over a period of 10 years. Less than a month ago, Hanson said she was opposed to a big business tax cut, but the One Nation leader has signalled she is now positively disposed to the change in the event companies give something back to workers. Hinch, in response to the BCA’s public commitment about investment, said he was not yet persuaded. The Victorian crossbencher has expressed concern that it is politically unpopular. Ahead of this parliamentary fortnight, business groups have been targeting their lobbying efforts and advertising campaigns on the ground in Queensland – Hanson’s home state – and the One Nation leader has also visited the Pilbara mining region, meeting with Fortescue. Martin, who replaced fellow Tasmanian Jacqui Lambie as a consequence of the dual citizenship fiasco, said on Wednesday he would support the big business tax cut to ensure businesses in his state remained competitive. “After extensive consideration and stakeholder engagement, it is apparent that priority needs to be given to ensuring Tasmanian businesses big and small are competitive in global markets,” Martin said. “My position is about achieving the best deal for Tasmania, and strengthening Tasmania’s global export markets, bolstering jobs creation, wages growth and building sustainable communities,” he said. Assuming that the One Nation bloc and Hinch can be persuaded, putting another four yes votes in its column, the government will also need the vote of the newly arrived South Australian senator, Tim Storer. Storer was associated previously with the Nick Xenophon Team but split from them, and sits in the chamber as an independent. He was sworn in only on Monday, and is yet to assemble a full complement of staff. The remaining NXT bloc of two senators has confirmed it will oppose the change. Debate on the package kicked off on Wednesday but was adjourned until the evening. The finance minister, Mathias Cormann, has signalled he wants a vote on the package in this parliamentary fortnight, before the May budget. Senators are being lobbied by business groups and big companies to support the tax cut on the basis it will keep Australian companies competitive when other countries are reducing their company tax rates. But they are also being lobbied by the progressive think tank the Australia Institute, which argues a tax cut for Australia’s biggest companies would be a multibillion-dollar threat to Australia’s revenue base. With the vote breaking in the government’s direction, the progressive activist group GetUp also joined the fray on Wednesday, circulating a report arguing that $1.96bn of the $5.271bn annual value of the corporate tax cut would flow offshore each year, and the banks would get 45% of the total value of the corporate tax. The GetUp national director, Paul Oosting, urged Senate crossbenchers to resist the lobbying effort from business. “We’re calling on senators to stand up for the interests of everyday Australians in the face of this corporate misinformation campaign”. Speaking in Port Macquarie, the prime minister cautiously welcomed the developments in Canberra. “We are seeking the support of the crossbench,” Malcolm Turnbull said. “It is vitally important that we provide the incentive for businesses – small, medium and large – to invest and employ.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/mar/23/aflw-grand-final-2018-lions-out-to-capitalise-on-brennan-absence","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-22T17:00:36Z","webTitle":"AFLW grand final 2018: Lions out to capitalise on Brennan absence","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/mar/23/aflw-grand-final-2018-lions-out-to-capitalise-on-brennan-absence","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/mar/23/aflw-grand-final-2018-lions-out-to-capitalise-on-brennan-absence","fields":{"headline":"AFLW grand final 2018: Lions out to capitalise on Brennan absence","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"After seven rounds of heavily contested, do-or-die football, just two teams remain in the hunt for the 2018 AFLW premiership: minor premiers the Western Bulldogs and their unlikely opponents, the Brisbane Lions. The Bulldogs go into this contest as favourites, having topped the ladder for the majority of the season, but the suspension of captain Katie Brennan throws a significant spanner in the works. Yes, Brennan is effectively playing on one leg, but as anyone who has watched Erin Phillips this season would attest, a spiritual leader can carry an entire team, injury notwithstanding. Brennan’s suspension – given the circumstances – would have cut the players deeply, especially as she has fought so hard to return from yet another season cruelled by injury. There is a case to argue that her team-mates will take extra motivation and fire into the game on account of her absence, but the drawn out saga also threatens to psychologically derail their preparation. Brennan is a proven goalkicker, the VFL women’s leading scorer in the most recent season past. Hers is as solid a technique as one will find in either the AFLW or AFL – look no further than her early-season goal into the wind against Fremantle for proof. Fit or not, she worries opponents into free kicks, and has the calm under pressure to slot them through. Still, the Bulldogs have managed well in Brennan’s absence this season, forced positional changes arguably unearthing this season’s revelation in Brooke Lochland (who, at season’s end leads the goalkicking with 12, including an incredible seven against Carlton in the inaugural pride game). In combination with Bonnie Toogood and at times youngster Monique Conti, the unlikely trio have formed one of the competition’s most potent forward lines. Of course, no forward line is effective without exceptional delivery from its midfielders, and the Bulldogs are blessed with two of the best in the competition: last season’s dual best-and-fairest winners Emma Kearney and Ellie Blackburn. Last year, Blackburn finished second in the overall best and fairest count for the competition, and this season her leadership has been taken to another level in the absence of Brennan. However, it is arguably her counterpart Kearney who has had the better season. Kearney has averaged 19.6 disposals this season (including five clearances) and is second in the league for both centre clearances and stoppages. She has also won an average of 2.6 free kicks a game, indicative of her willingness to put head over the ball with little regard to her own safety. The detractors will argue she has perfected the Joel Selwood shrug, which she has jokingly referenced on social media, but Kearney is consistently first to the ball, and the most desperate. She finished the season the coaches’ champion player of the year (tied with Adelaide’s Chelsea Randall), and may yet finish atop the league’s best and fairest, as well as best on ground on grand final day. Brisbane, however, are not without star power of their own, and deserve to go into the decider a good chance of toppling the daughters of the West. Kate Lutkins deserves to be favourite for the Lions’ best and fairest, and averages 17.3 disposals in the backline, including 3.6 rebound 50s a game. It is her work off half-back that has been the most potent and penetrating, regularly setting up the more highly-touted Sabrina Frederick-Traub. Make no mistake, to say Lutkins is underrated is not to argue that Frederick-Traub is not deserving of all the accolades she receives: she is. In perhaps the most arresting photo of the season, Frederick-Traub is depicted with no less than six Melbourne players hanging off her in an attempted tackle. She still manages to release the ball. Her core strength is unparalleled in the competition, while she also averages a competition-high 2.6 contested marks. These she takes both inside 50 and across the wing, pushing up to receive and set up play. Then there are the things that are harder to measure: her capacity to command respect, and unquenchable thirst to win. When Frederick-Traub isn’t in the contest, she is raring her team-mates on, fist-pumping and chest-thumping, not a moment on-field wasted. To say the marquee forward has been critical in getting the Lions this far is a serious underestimation of her talent. As a team, the Lions are also fired up to prove a point, after not a single AFLW captain tipped them to make it this far despite being runners-up in 2017. That perception wasn’t helped by ‘doing a ‘Bradbury’ to make the grand final from fifth going into the final round of the season, but Brittany Gibson said external perception would be a weapon rather than a deterrent for the team. “We’ve been [continually] rated as underdogs, and lacking that little bit of respect,” she said earlier in the week. “We’re working as a team to build that respect among the competition. All we can do is keep winning... [but] we thrive on being the underdog.” Considering Brisbane have lost only one game and drawn once in Melbourne since the beginning of the AFLW, there is plenty of reason to believe the underdogs can prove the ultimate point. The game will be played at Carlton’s historic home ground, Ikon (or Princes) Park, with a capacity of approximately 22,000. While this size is rightly of concern to fans, the AFL has reassured respective AFLW club members that they will have priority access to the final, allowed to enter half an hour before gates open to the general public. The game remains free of charge, and will not be ticketed. Originally slated for 1:05pm, the game will also now be played at 12:35pm. This is presumably to accommodate for Brisbane Lions fans who want to head to the men’s clash at Etihad Stadium after, which kicks off at 3:35pm. For those not in attendance, the grand final will be televised nationally on Seven."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/the-running-blog/2018/mar/22/chinese-burn-how-the-peoples-republic-has-become-an-endurance-running-superpower","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-22T06:00:27Z","webTitle":"Chinese burn: how the People's Republic has become an endurance-running superpower","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/the-running-blog/2018/mar/22/chinese-burn-how-the-peoples-republic-has-become-an-endurance-running-superpower","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/the-running-blog/2018/mar/22/chinese-burn-how-the-peoples-republic-has-become-an-endurance-running-superpower","fields":{"headline":"Chinese burn: how the People's Republic has become an endurance-running superpower","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"With chiselled features, sinewy physiques and oversized water bottles, my fellow runners are easily identifiable on the flight to Tengchong. We might have no common language, but we exchange perfunctory nods of mutual recognition as we descend en masse on the Gaolingong mountains. The rising popularity of ultra-running is a global phenomenon, but nowhere is it more pronounced than in China. “Each time I visit China to run I see massive increase in both participation and performance; the growth is amazing,” observes Michael Wardian, former 100km World Silver Medallist, World Marathon Challenge record holder and a competitor at the recent Mt Gaoligong by UTMB. The explosion in road running in China has been well documented. According to China Daily, nearly one million people run in Beijing’s Olympic Forest Park each day. From just a handful of marathons a few years ago, the country hosted more than 500 last year. In 2015, Japan and the US recorded the highest number of marathon finishers at just over half a million each. If China hasn’t already overtaken this number, then it seems certain to do so soon. Such is the level of demand that counterfeit race numbers are a real problem for many Chinese marathons. As elsewhere in the world, the normalising of 26.2 miles seems to have driven a desire for some runners to push their limits further. Concrete data is hard to come by, but the races, the distances and the enthusiasm certainly continue to multiply. At the Ultra Gobi, volunteers conclude the race by taking part in a 50km fun run. In January, nearly 2,000 runners took part in an ice marathon in Northern China at -15C. And with three races – 160km, 125km and 55km – Mt Gaoligong itself was nothing short of a four-day trail-running festival, attracting big sponsors, lots of media and several thousand participants. It wasn’t long ago that Chinese races were chaotic affairs. A race organiser from Hong Kong, which has a much longer tradition of trail running, tells me: “A few years ago cheating was rife; I remember seeing runners on the backs of motorbikes.” Now it is the mainland Chinese races and runners that are dominating. In a pattern that echoes other consumer trends, Chinese ultrarunning has been heavily influenced by, and is eager to learn from, more established races in Europe and the US. Xingzhi Exploring Group, the organisers of the Mt Gaoligong races, have recently partnered with UTMB International. The Ultra Trail of Mont Blanc (UTMB), a Chamonix-based race that has grown from nine friends to nearly 10,000 participants annually over the past 16 years, is arguably the spiritual home of the sport in Europe. Now, in a joint venture with OC Sport, they plan to expand into a global series of mountain races. China was the obvious place to start. The growth in ultra-running in China can in part be attributed to simple economics. “Once people have taken care of their needs, they look for ways to escape and long-distance running offers that,” explains Jin Rao, the CEO of Ultra Tour of Mt Siguniang - a 100km high-altitude race (average 4,200m) that now attracts more than 1,500 applicants each year. Jin has an interesting perspective on China’s changing tastes, having grown up as a “village boy” in Sichuan province where running up mountains was a necessity of daily life. His races now attract a primarily urban and wealthy demographic. “I’m just happy that more people want to visit my mountains,” he tells me through a translator. Businesses have been quick to recognise the opportunity. While running might be an intrinsically inexpensive hobby, it is also a big market. Zhao Fan, Chinese distributor for Altra shoes, reports sales tripling every year and expects the trajectory to continue. Most international outdoor equipment brands have invested heavily, and several local rivals have emerged. Running abroad is an ambition for many participants in Gaoligong. Remi Duchemin, CEO of OC Sport, estimates that approximately 300 million Chinese now have the economic resources to travel for races, and that number is growing every year. In August, 385 Chinese runners will take part in the UTMB, second only in number to the French. But it would be short-sighted to see Chinese races as mere replicas. While they have imported many of the best aspects – excellent route-marking, efficient organisation and a zero-tolerance approach to littering – they have also added a uniquely Chinese atmosphere. At each of the 17 checkpoints along my 162km slog across the Gaoligong mountains, we are greeted by armies of enthusiastic volunteers offering ginger tea and beer. For a few runners, the CPs even provided a convenient opportunity for a cigarette break. As you approached the finish line, supporters lined the streets. Dan Lawson, the 24-hour European champion, spoke for many when he declared that “China is my favourite country in the world in which to race; the support is unbeatable”. This adulation also helps to explain the popularity of the sport. “In ultra-running, everyone can have their champion moment,” says Remi Duchemin. “This is true in all countries, but particularly so in China.” After scraping in just under 24 hours and unexpectedly finding myself on the eight-man podium, I can certainly attest to being made to feel undeservedly special, the endless requests for selfies helping to prolong the delusion. Runners the world over are often aware of this egocentricity. “I don’t date other runners,” one female athlete jokes after the race. “There isn’t room for two self-absorbed people in a relationship”. But while the sport might be inherently individualistic, the sense of camaraderie at Chinese races is palpable. A late and improbable burst of energy sees me overtaking a few runners towards the end and each greets me with a smile and a breathless “Jia you” – which appropriately translates as “add oil”. The finish line the following day is littered with gaunt, hobbling figures returning to cheer on fellow runners who have battled through a second night on the course. Whether the drivers behind China’s running boom are economic, cultural or both, the trajectory seems clear. “For international runners, China is likely to be a key destination over the coming years,” explains Michael Wardian. “I can’t wait to come back,” Last year’s announcement by Abbott, who run the World Marathon Majors, of three new races in the series will only reinforce this. Abbot have partnered with Chinese conglomerate Wanda, so a Chinese race is surely a dead cert to be added to the majors list. Having run my first ultramarathon in 2010, I have watched with excitement as the sport has grown and developed. The choice of races, the standard of competition and the general interest have all increased dramatically. China’s emergence as an endurance sport superpower will add further momentum to this bizarre but compelling cross-cultural trend. And after slogging up and down 160km of Gaoligong mountains, I know that there are few places I would rather run. Alfie is on instagram at @jogonalfie.

Guardian Australia has seen a copy of the private briefing materials prepared for crossbenchers by the finance minister, Mathias Cormann, which have been circulated as part of efforts to stitch together the numbers to legislate a reduction in the company tax rate from 30% to 25% by 2026-27. The briefing materials provide a “non-exhaustive” list of specific companies that stand to benefit under the government’s proposal, identifying their revenue and the state in which their head office is located, with particular states highlighted for individual senators. Cormann also sets out a number of propositions in support of the policy change, including an argument that parliament has already passed a tax cut for businesses with turnovers of up to $50m a year, and it would be “economically damaging to effectively entrench a tax incentive for businesses to be smaller by limiting lower taxes to them rather than to encourage businesses to keep growing”. The briefing materials underscore a sense of urgency, warning crossbenchers that achieving a tax cut for big business “is even more important now than it was at the last election” because if the parliament doesn’t “act now, our business tax rate will remain nine percentage points higher than the US”. “To not pass this legislation now would pose an immediate threat to investment, jobs and future wages growth with a consequent real impact on the living standards of everyday Australians who would inevitably suffer as a result.” The government has brought on the company tax cut debate this week – the final sitting fortnight before the May budget – and wants a vote before parliament rises for the Easter break. While the case looked hopeless only a month ago, a full court press by Cormann, backed by business groups, has nudged things in a positive direction from the Coalition’s perspective. The government is now is inching towards the required level of crossbench support for the big business tax cuts, with the Senate’s newest arrival, the independent South Australian Tim Storer, a key potential kingmaker. On Wednesday, the government secured support from Jacqui Lambie’s upper house replacement, the Tasmanian senator Steve Martin. Courtesy of Martin’s backing for the package, the government has four confirmed crossbench votes. Cory Bernardi, David Leyonhjelm and the former One Nation representative Fraser Anning are already in the yes column. It needs nine votes to pass the package. With Pauline Hanson and Derryn Hinch signalling publicly they wanted a commitment from business groups that the tax cut would be passed through to workers, the Business Council of Australia on Wednesday produced a statement signed by the chiefs of 10 major companies providing a general commitment that business would invest locally “as the tax cut takes effect” – which is over a period of 10 years. Key Senate players believe the BCA statement, even though it lacks any specific commitments, will get Hanson’s One Nation bloc on board, which would bring the government to seven votes. If that assessment is correct, it leaves two votes in play. Hinch has not been swayed by the BCA statement, but remains at the table. At a doorstop on Thursday Hinch dismissed the BCA statement as “very kumbaya”, noting that it “didn’t guarantee anything”. He said he was after “hard words – if you give us this tax cut, we will give wage increases” and also something that “perhaps helps pensioners”. “I don’t totally trust big business … I’m not going to suddenly vote for something and then in three months time someone comes up to me and says ‘they didn’t do it - why did you vote for it when they didn’t do it?’” Storer told Guardian Australia: “I am continuing to meet with stakeholders on this important matter.” He declined to nominate a timeframe for when he would resolve his position. A business lobbyist who met with Storer this week, Peter Strong, who heads the small business group, the Council of Small Business Australia, told Guardian Australia the new senator seemed to have an open mind on the big business tax cut. “He’s in the information-gathering phase. I think he could go either way,” Strong said. Influential progressive thinktanks, like the Australia Institute and activist groups such as GetUp, are lobbying senators against the change on the basis it will cost the budget billions in revenue, and firms aren’t paying their fair share under the existing regime. The government’s briefing materials address those points directly. It rejects arguments that businesses don’t pay their fair share of tax under the existing regime, and it rebuffs the idea that with all the pre-tax deductions available in this country, Australia’s corporate tax rate is comparable to tax rates overseas. The material draws on data from the Oxford University Centre for Business Taxation to argue that Australia’s effective corporate tax rate “is now highest out of 33 OECD economies”. With the government inching towards securing the required Senate support, Labor reiterated its opposition to the policy. “Malcolm Turnbull’s $65bn company tax glide path only hits big businesses with turnover of over $1bn by 2022-23,” said the shadow treasurer, Chris Bowen. “It’s an unfunded wrecking ball to the budget at exactly the same time the government has baked in optimistic wages growth projections into the budget,” Bowen said. “We know that by the end of the next 10 years, these big business tax cuts will end up costing the budget over $15bn each and every year.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/mar/21/myanmar-president-aung-san-suu-kyi-confidante-resigns-htin-kyaw","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-21T06:08:07Z","webTitle":"Htin Kyaw, Myanmar president and Aung San Suu Kyi confidante, resigns","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/21/myanmar-president-aung-san-suu-kyi-confidante-resigns-htin-kyaw","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/mar/21/myanmar-president-aung-san-suu-kyi-confidante-resigns-htin-kyaw","fields":{"headline":"Htin Kyaw, Myanmar president and Aung San Suu Kyi confidante, resigns","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The president of Myanmar, Htin Kyaw, has stepped down, saying he is “taking a rest” following health issues. Htin Kyaw was an important ally in the government for state counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi, who is constitutionally barred from the presidency, and the pair were childhood friends. Htin Kyaw was nominated as president by Aung San Suu Kyi’s party, the National League for Democracy, in 2016 and she exerted much of her influence through him. His resignation comes at a precarious time for Myanmar and Aung San Suu Kyi, who is under pressure from the international community to address the campaign of violence carried out by the military in Rakhine state – described by the UN as having the “hallmarks of genocide” – which has led to an exodus of 700,000 Rohingya Muslims over the border to Bangladesh. The Myanmar government has denied claims of ethnic cleansing and pledged to begin repatriating the Rohingya, though so far it has approved the return of only 374 people. Reports that Htin Kyaw had been experiencing ill health in the past few months had been vigorously denied by the government. However, on Wednesday the state counsellor’s office said he was stepping down to recuperate after undergoing multiple treatments and surgery. Government spokesperson Zaw Htay told the Guardian: “Yes, he has resigned. He just had an operation but it was successful. We will now start the process for electing the next president within seven working days according to the constitution.” Htin Kyaw was the first Myanmar president since the 1962 coup to have no connections to the military. In the interim, his position will be held by the military-nominated vice-president Myint Swe, an ex-military officer who, while leading the Yangon Command in 2007, oversaw the brutal crackdown of the Saffron revolution. Myanmar’s electoral system requires that the president be voted in from a selection of names put forward by lawmakers, including at least one nominee chosen by the military, which retains a quarter of seats in parliament. “We’ve been hearing that he [Htin Kyaw] might make such a step for some months, so this is no surprise,” said Dr Khin Zaw Win, a former political prisoner and director of the Tampidipa institute in Yangon. “I think the new person will have to take some more responsibility from the state counsellor. It was a mistake for her to centralise so much authority, leaving U Htin Kyaw as a puppet.” He said Zaw Myint Maung, a popular MP who is also close to Aung San Suu Kyi, was being tipped – but he has a son living abroad who, if a foreign citizen, would constitutionally bar him from the role. Another frontrunner is Win Myint, speaker of the house of representatives, a member of the NLD executive committee and another close confidante of Aung San Suu Kyi. He too resigned from his post on Wednesday, a sign he intends to put his name forward. Myanmar political analyst Richard Horsey said the choice had to be from Aung San Suu Kyi’s “inner circle of trusted loyalists”. “The president has full executive authority under the constitution so it requires a personal pact in order for Aung San Suu Kyi to maintain the situation where she is the actual seat of power.” Cape Diamond contributed to this report"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/australia-books-blog/2018/mar/22/the-darkest-web-exploring-the-ugly-world-of-illegal-online-marketplaces","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-21T17:00:05Z","webTitle":"The Darkest Web: exploring the ugly world of illegal online marketplaces","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/australia-books-blog/2018/mar/22/the-darkest-web-exploring-the-ugly-world-of-illegal-online-marketplaces","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/australia-books-blog/2018/mar/22/the-darkest-web-exploring-the-ugly-world-of-illegal-online-marketplaces","fields":{"headline":"The Darkest Web: exploring the ugly world of illegal online marketplaces","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"It’s an arresting concept: the idea that rippling beneath the internet there is a dark twin breathing and growing. A place where drugs are sold; where hitmen advertise their services; where material to match any sexual urge can be found. The Darkest Web is an exploration of this underworld known as the dark web, and Australian author Eileen Ormsby is your tour guide. This is the second book from Ormsby, whose first, Silk Road, was an in-depth exploration of the dark web marketplace, based both on research and Ormsby’s personal experiences as part of the community. This new book takes a wider view of what else, aside from the sale of drugs, goes on down there. What pulls you through The Darkest Web isn’t its often-nefarious, sometimes-gory details, but Ormsby’s handling of three progressively intense narrative arcs. Split into sections, the reader is introduced to a few key characters in the dark web world at each level: Dark is about the marketplaces that popped up after the owner of Silk Road was arrested in late 2013 (he was later jailed for life); Darker follows one man who is determined to have his wife killed but who doesn’t realise the hitman site he’s found is a scam; and Darkest takes the reader through the nightmarish world of “child porn” (which many people believe is the wrong terminology for child exploitation material) communities. There are real deaths chronicled in this book, and Ormsby herself was at the receiving end of threats of violence for her reporting on the dark web on her blog, All Things Vice. So what makes a London lawyer leave her job and make friends in such a place? “I was working in London in a Magic Circle firm for the one-percenters when the global financial crisis hit,” she tells Guardian Australia. “So that disillusioned me quite heavily and also got me interested in Bitcoin.” Bitcoin is the most well-known cryptocurrency, the development of which was necessary for the proliferation of dark web marketplaces. Cryptocurrencies were “created to ensure that people had … their own currency” even if the big banks went down, she explains; Bitcoin also allows two people to transfer payments without knowing each other’s identities, making sales of drugs and other illegal items possible. Most famous for selling drugs, the Silk Road marketplace was guided by an almost utopian philosophy. “Their idea was that people had a right to decide what they put into their own bodies and to buy those things if they wanted to, so long as they weren’t harming another person,” Ormbsy says. “But once Silk Road got taken down the markets that came after it were run by less scrupulous people, the people that were more likely to sell anything that could make them money.” Stolen identities and weapons, for starters. The book might investigate a fake killers-for-hire site, Besa Mafia, but it does end with a real death, and Ormsby says it changed the stakes. Stephen Allwine, from Minnesota in the US, spent thousands of dollars and several months engaging the services of a hitman to kill his wife, Alice – and when no hitman came, he did it himself and tried to make it look like a suicide. Ormsby had been researching the site for a while, and had started trying to warn the authorities about people all over the world who were paying huge amounts of money to get people killed. “[Law enforcement agencies] were pretty much not interested. It was like, ‘Oh it’s a scam site, who cares’ and they wouldn’t tell us if they were following up on any of these things or not.” Did the authorities simply underestimate the customer’s commitment to killing? Or was it simply that they didn’t know how to deal with it? “A bit of both,” Ormsby replies. When Ormsby reported on Besa Mafia being a scam, she received threats, and at one stage was getting 20 or more emails a day. The owner of the site, known as Yura, was making hundreds of thousands of dollars and she was jeopardising his operation. “He really did think of himself as a Robin Hood of the dark web, going around scamming people out of the money they might have otherwise given to ‘real’ hitmen.” Ormsby handles the third section – about child exploitation – with clarity and respect. Ultimately, too, it is hopeful. “It’s horrendous and depressing, but unlike the international taskforces taking down the drug networks – who are all disparate and who all want their own little piece – the international taskforces that are working on child pornography work together really, really well. And they’re working hard all the time. They are getting better and better at finding these people.” Despite all the ugliness, Ormsby has found some not-so-dark places on the dark web to still take part in, including a community where “people gather and discuss things about the different dark web markets” and “a small psychedelics community” which is “like a little slice of sunshine and rainbows on the dark web,” she laughs. “It’s a really lovely little place with lots of happy people.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2018/mar/21/tonga-bans-school-girls-rugby-boxing-preserve-dignity","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-21T03:58:47Z","webTitle":"Tonga bans schoolgirls from rugby and boxing 'to preserve dignity'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/21/tonga-bans-school-girls-rugby-boxing-preserve-dignity","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/mar/21/tonga-bans-school-girls-rugby-boxing-preserve-dignity","fields":{"headline":"Tonga bans schoolgirls from rugby and boxing 'to preserve dignity'","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The Tongan government has banned schoolgirls from playing rugby or boxing because the sports are deemed undignified and not in keeping with the island’s traditional culture. The letter from the ministry of education has caused outrage among many Tongans, who say the directive is outdated and sexist. Dame Valerie Adams, New Zealand’s two-time Olympic shot put champion, whose mother is Tongan, criticised the ban. “According to this way of thinking, a proud Tongan like myself could not attain the standing I have in this world. Tongan women must be free to choose their destiny, and not be held back by misguided and stubborn misinterpretation,” Adams said on Facebook. “Honouring tradition and following passion need not come into conflict. Rugby, like any sport, ought to be embraced by our Tongan women – we’re good at it – don’t take it away!” Tongan women’s rights advocate Ofa Guttenbeil-Likiliki said the ban represented an obsolete view. “It takes us right back to the thinking that education is only academic and for girls to remain in that kind of academic lane, sports is just the alternative for boys,” Guttenbeil-Likiliki told Dateline Pacific. “It is really just taking us back from all the work we have done so far in trying to achieve and bring forward gender equality in Tonga.” The New Zealand prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, said her country’s aid program to Tonga was not threatened by the ban, but she disagreed with it. “As a school student I played touch rugby and I would encourage all the young women to engage in whatever sporting code they are interested in. “We do provide funding … to Tonga to encourage children’s participation in sports. And so a young woman will still be able to do that, I understand, through their villages, even if this dictate is made by these schools.” On social media, many expressed anger at the ban, which the ministry of education said was necessary to “preserve the dignity of Tongan women and hold on to Tongan cultural values”. The chief education officer, Manu ‘Akau’ola, told Dateline Pacific the directive was ordered by the education minister, Penisimani Fifita, due to concerns that children had missed too much class time due to Cyclone Gita, a category five storm that hit the island in February. “So his direction is not because we’re not supportive of the sporting events, it’s just [to] make up the lost time we’ve lost because of the cyclone,” ‘Akau’ola said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"artanddesign/2018/mar/21/turning-cities-into-sponges-how-chinese-ancient-wisdom-is-taking-on-climate-change","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-21T04:41:37Z","webTitle":"Turning cities into sponges: how Chinese ancient wisdom is taking on climate change","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/mar/21/turning-cities-into-sponges-how-chinese-ancient-wisdom-is-taking-on-climate-change","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2018/mar/21/turning-cities-into-sponges-how-chinese-ancient-wisdom-is-taking-on-climate-change","fields":{"headline":"Turning cities into sponges: how Chinese ancient wisdom is taking on climate change","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"How does a city cope with extreme weather? These days, urban planning that doesn’t factor in some sort of catastrophic weather event is like trying to build something in a fictional utopia. For Kongjian Yu, one of the world’s leading landscape architects, the answer to coping with extreme weather events actually lies in the past. Yu is the founder and dean of the school of landscape architecture at Peking University, founding director of architectural firm Turenscape, and famous for being the man who reintroduced ancient Chinese water systems to modern design. In the process he has transformed some of China’s most industrialised cities into standard bearers of green architecture. Yu’s designs aim to build resilience in cities faced with rising sea levels, droughts, floods and so-called “once in a lifetime” storms. At 53, he is best known for his “sponge cities”, which use soft material and terraces to capture water which can then be extracted for use, rather than the usual concrete and steel materials which do not absorb water. European methods of designing cities involve drainage pipelines which cannot cope with monsoonal rain. But the Chinese government has now adopted sponge cities as an urban planning and eco-city template. Yu spoke in Melbourne on Tuesday at a symposium on water-conscious design held as part of Melbourne Design Week at the National Gallery of Victoria. Speaking to Guardian Australia ahead of his appearance, Yu, who is based in Beijing, explained the key benefit of sponge cities is the ability to reuse water. “The water captured by the sponge can be used for irrigation, for recharging the aquifer, for cleansing the soil and for productive use,” Yu said. “In China, we retain storm water and reuse it. Even as individual families and houses, we collect storm water on [the] rooftop and use the balcony to irrigate the vegetable garden.” When it comes to water, the mottos of the sponge city are: “Retain, adapt, slow down and reuse.” His firm now has 600 employees and works across 200 cities in China. The firm has completed more than 600 projects and won a swag of major architecture and design awards. The strategies Yu uses are “based on peasant farming techniques, adapting peasant irrigation systems to urban environments and experience in adapting buildings to a monsoon climate”. The first strategy – “based on thousands of years of Chinese wisdom” – is to “contain water at the origin, when the rain falls from the sky on the ground. We have to keep the water”. “In China, there is a shortage of fresh water,” Yu says. “China has only 8% of fresh water of the world and feeds 20% of the population – so any fresh water from the sky will need to be kept in an aquifer.” Yu, who grew up on a farm and later studied architecture at Harvard, understands the need to be water conscious. “The ability to regulate water year-round in dry season is a very critical strategy for the people to survive. “One thing I learned is to slow down the process of drainage. All the modern industrial techniques and engineering solution is to drain water away after the flood as fast of possible. So, modern tech is to speed up the drainage but ancient wisdom, which has adapted in the monsoonal season, was to slow down the drainage so the water will not be destructive anymore. By slowing the water it can nurture the habitat and biodiversity.” For Australia, and places where water is scarce: “When it’s dry, keep the water on the ground in an aquifer, so it will not evaporate too much.” Adaptation to drought conditions is also important: using as little water as possible, and recycling what there is. As Yu says, it’s important to “make friends with water”. “We don’t use concrete or hard engineering, we use terraces, learned from ancient peasantry wisdom. We irrigate. Then the city will be floodable and will survive during the flood. We can remove concrete and make a water protection system a living system.” • Melbourne Design Week is happening at the NGV until 25 March"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2018/mar/21/sando-review-an-outrageously-good-performance-in-a-hit-and-miss-new-abc-comedy","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-21T10:30:08Z","webTitle":"Sando review – an outrageously good performance in a hit and miss new ABC comedy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/mar/21/sando-review-an-outrageously-good-performance-in-a-hit-and-miss-new-abc-comedy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2018/mar/21/sando-review-an-outrageously-good-performance-in-a-hit-and-miss-new-abc-comedy","fields":{"headline":"Sando review – an outrageously good performance in a hit and miss new ABC comedy","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Is Franco Cozzo an internet sensation yet? Melburnians of a certain age will recognise that name, its mention triggering recollections of low-rent, late-night furniture ads starring the boisterous silver-haired local celebrity. Cozzo’s catchphrase is two words repeated again and again, with the subtlety of those frenzied late-night ads that implore viewers to buy doors: “GRAND SALE! GRAND SALE! GRAND SALE!” ABC TV’s new comedy Sando, co-created by Phil Lloyd and Charlie Garber and directed by brothers Christiaan and Connor Van Vuuren, follows a protagonist who is more than a little Cozzonian – with added boorishness, and a shit-stirring demeanour. Where Cozzo is known as “the furniture king”, Victoria “Sando” Sandringham (Sacha Horler) is “the package deal queen”: an utter trainwreck of a woman, with a gravitational pull that sucks the people around her into maelstroms of chaos and confusion. It is no easy task to stage an uproariously entertaining wedding sequence; we’ve witnessed vows and matrimonial shenanigans so many times before. And yet the Van Vuurens (the creative team behind Bondi Hipsters) direct a doozie in the opening of Sando, depicting the church marriage ceremony of the protagonist’s daughter Susie (Krew Boylan) and her fiancé Kevin (Firass Dirani). In these early establishing moments, a hint of the Sandringham family dynamic is revealed when Sando suggests to her ageing mother how proud she must be to have three generations of Sando women. Mum curtly responds: “You’ve turned my beautiful boutique store into a bargain basement furniture whore house for bogans.” When Sando receives an SMS informing her she is pregnant, her husband Don (Phil Lloyd), after a moment’s reflection, notes that “my birthday was nearly a year ago”. This triggers a chain of rapidly escalating events, combining the show’s key assets: spiky dialogue, squirrely characters, familial contretemps, splashes of sight comedy and an at times cracking pace. The story jumps 10 years into the future, to an end-of-year party held in the showroom of the best-performing Sando outlet. Sando and her team get plastered, with a rapid, Wolf of Wall Street-esque montage depicting their mischief, including employees hurling plates at each other, jousting with outdoor umbrellas and smoking a bong constructed from a hand iron. The scene is fast, playful and visually compact. When morning arrives, company CFO Tony (Rob Carlton) stages a coup on the hungover furniture mogul and ousts her with backing from the board. It’s a new world out there, Tony says, with online discount stores and the like. An “adapt to the times” and “over the hill” theme emerges, with a note of wistfulness: about reconciling the past, and failing to progress from it. A core tangent involves Sando attempting to reconnect with her family, a task that requires some delicacy – but instead she approaches it like a bulldozer running over a flower garden. The second and third episodes (the first three form the extent of this review) don’t have the punch and pluck of the first; they are slower and feel more complacent. Relationships between the characters paint a “tangled web we weave” series of scenarios, retreading rote situations – an attempt to conceal an affair, for example, between Don and Susie’s best friend Nicky (Adele Vuko), and the surprise arrival of a hitherto unknown family member. There are some deceptively clever flourishes, fusing core elements around character and theme. Sando’s professional skills are hinted at when she agrees to keep a personal secret, but at a price (“we could do a deal, because I’m the package deal queen”). When it is revealed her ideal night in constitutes a glass of wine on the couch while watching her old commercials, it is an almost melancholic moment, the protagonist rendered as a kind of cut-rate Norma Desmond – fantasising about past glories that were far from great in the first place. Genevieve Morris, who recently played a crusty police dispatch officer in No Activity, was originally set to star in the title role but stood down due to health reasons, replaced by Sacha Horler at the eleventh hour. Perhaps the circumstances around Horler’s last-minute casting helped her nail the part; she genuinely feels like a person thrust into a series of unanticipated encounters. Her performance is outrageously good, somehow drawing empathy for a character who has all the poise of a fish drowning in oxygen.

Two days after an Uber SUV fatally struck the 49-year-old Elaine Herzberg in Tempe, Arizona, while traveling in autonomous mode, friends of the victim have argued that the ride-share company should face consequences and criticized government officials for encouraging car companies to test the vehicles on the state’s public roads. “This shouldn’t have ever happened,” said Carole Kimmerle, a Mesa resident who said she had been friends with Herzberg for more than 10 years and had previously lived with her. “I think this should be a negligent homicide … and the government should also be held accountable.” Herzberg’s loved ones said they were still in shock on Tuesday after police announced that the Uber car, an SUV Volvo, was driving roughly 40 miles per hour on its own and did not appear to slow down when it collided with the victim, who was walking her bicycle in front of the car at 10pm on Sunday. There was a human operator in the front seat, but police said the car was in autonomous mode, which meant the radar technology may not have detected the pedestrian or the vehicle did not stop for another reason. Tempe police said Herzberg was not in a crosswalk when she was hit, though some have argued that the car still should have stopped. Uber said it was temporarily pausing its self-driving operations in Phoenix and other cities, but the company has not commented on the cause of the crash. As federal investigators have begun their inquiry, local police officials have appeared to cast blame on the victim, saying Uber may not have been at fault, sparking further backlash from the woman’s friends. “Uber should be shut down for it,” one friend, Deniel Klapthor, told the Guardian. “There has to be a bigger punishment than not allowing them to drive it on the street.” Kimmerle added, “She was not in anyway unsafe. She rode a bike everywhere. She was very cautious of the laws.” Herzberg had struggled with homelessness, according to her friends, who said she had recently turned her life around and was in the process of starting a new job. If her family were to pursue a civil case, attorneys could potentially make a range of negligence claims, said Bryant Walker Smith, an assistant professor at the University of South Carolina and a legal expert on autonomous cars. Depending on what might have gone wrong, the victim’s family could argue that a number of players were liable, including the car maker, the operator behind the wheel, the manufacturers of various specific technologies, and Uber itself, he said. “The attorney would want to say to a hypothetical jury, ‘These are really scary systems. They demand the utmost care and responsibility.’ And the lawyer would suggest that’s not the case here,” said Smith. Ryan Calo, a University of Washington law professor and self-driving expert, predicted the company would try to resolve any case quickly and privately: “Uber will settle this immediately for an undisclosed amount of money.” The first reported fatal self-driving car crash happened in 2016 when a Tesla on “autopilot” did not detect a white truck in its path. There have since been a series of high-profile incidents involving Teslas, Ubers and other companies, and some have raised concerns that even if self-driving technology is a safer mode of travel, the industry is entering a particularly dangerous phase of development when the vehicles aren’t yet fully autonomous and require humans to intervene. Arizona has lured self-driving car operators to the state by arguing it has fewer regulations than other jurisdictions – a fact that upset Herzberg’s friends, who said the government should have done more to prevent these kinds of crashes. “In Tempe, they’re everywhere,” said Jerry Higgins, another friend of Herzberg, who said he keeps his eye on the self-driving cars and said he was struggling to understand how the collision occurred: “Don’t they have a driver in the car that’s supposed to keep stuff like this from happening? … I don’t see how they didn’t work something like this into the programs.” Herzberg loved to read and write and was always generous and offering to help others even when she was dealing with her own struggles, said Kimmerle. “She was very loving,” she said. “The world lost a good person.” Contact the author: sam.levin@theguardian.com"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/mar/26/south-america-women-rise-again-copa-america-femenina","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-26T11:00:00Z","webTitle":"From the ashes: South American women rise again for the Copa América Femenina","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/mar/26/south-america-women-rise-again-copa-america-femenina","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/mar/26/south-america-women-rise-again-copa-america-femenina","fields":{"headline":"From the ashes: South American women rise again for the Copa América Femenina","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Two years ago, most of South America’s women’s national teams disappeared from the Fifa rankings because their federations cared only about their men’s team. It got so bad that some federations stopped scheduling matches and staffing women’s sides. This could have been the death knell for women’s football in several countries but instead it was the starting point of something magnificent. Since then, players have organised themselves, protested and played their way back on to the pitch. Their collective actions should be seen in the context of global women’s football campaigns, such as the Danish women’s fight for equal pay and the turf wars of the 2015 World Cup. For these players, the Copa América Femenina’s importance can hardly be overstated. Next month they will square off in Chile to qualify for the World Cup and Pan-American Games 2019, as well as the 2020 Olympics. Players are looking at the Copa as a chance to convince the crowds, their federations, their families and maybe even themselves that they are rescuing women’s football in South America from oblivion. So how have the women from three of the most passionate football cultures protested against being treated so shamefully? The short answer is collectively. Collective action is politics of necessity for the players who fear retaliation from their coaches and federations. Because the teams are so far under the radar those decisions happen without public outcry. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the national teams most vocally protesting against the conditions – Argentina, Brazil and Chile– are those with the highest ranking men’s teams. The Brazilian federation has unapologetically mistreated players and shut women out of leadership positions for decades. Even during the World Cup in Canada the president of women’s football complimented the squad on their feminine appearance rather than their play. When Emily Lima was appointed as the first female head coach in 2017 the Brazilian players celebrated, only for her to be abruptly dismissed months later. In a poignant protest, five players, including the prolific striker Cristiane, retired. Former players, current players, and experts followed up with a powerful letter. The federation president, Marco Polo Del Nero, has been described as a “playboy” and is reluctant to leave the country for fear of being arrested for corruption, organised a committee to address concerns. It worked for months but was unexpectedly disbanded in February. One more protest co-opted, dismissed and such hard work wasted. Chilean players, meanwhile, made a surprise move when they formed a players’ union in 2016, which eventually integrated into the men’s union and gained enough momentum to reorganise their team after years of neglect. It was the union that convinced the Chilean federation to host the Copa América, another step toward the revitalisation of women’s football on the continent. The forward Fernanda Pinilla, a driving force on and off the field, says the current feminist movements “have inspired totally different visions to those that we have been accustomed to. I feel that there has been a complete empowerment of Latin American women.” These movements are intersectional, including the Argentinian campaign against gender violence #NiUnaMenos. Calling general strikes, such as the ones that took place on International Women’s Day, point toward the growing recognition that the devaluation of women’s labour and disrespect for their integrity must be addressed simultaneously. The Argentinian team went on strike last September after their stipends, less than $10, went unpaid. Even when paid, they trained without proper changing rooms on a dirt field. I attended the team’s first training session last week and spoke with the coach, Carlos Borrello, who has three weeks to assemble a competitive squad for the Copa. It is a hard road when the federation allots three training sessions per week. Borrello has to miss training because he is also in charge of the three other women’s youth teams. The sacrifice demanded of these players is remarkable. Goalkeeper Gaby Gartón explained to me that any article of sport clothing is 50% more expensive than in the US or Europe and the salaries of the players a fraction. Despite that, she says “being able to wear the Argentinian national team jersey is more than enough to keep women playing in those conditions”. The difficulty fielding national teams is compounded by the anaemic landscape of women’s clubs. Many of the women cannot afford the trips to training, given that the stipend does not cover equipment or the loss of wages. I spoke with a top player from Boca Juniors whose monthly salary is $150. When I asked how she managed, she said, frowning: “I have to get a gym membership to stay competitive, eat a decent breakfast, pay for boots and if my whole family didn’t contribute to helping me live my dream, I would have had to quit years ago.” Unpaid and mistreated, the female footballers of South America have rejected neo-liberal arguments that they only matter if they can market themselves. Despite promised development money from Fifa, Conmebol, the governing body in South America, has yet to account for how federations use those funds. Fifa, for its part, does not have an accounting system for Conmebol, which is far from ideal. The recent Fifa rankings tell a story of extreme inequity. In all of Conmebol, not one women’s team ranks equal to their male counterparts. When I asked players about the tournament, their eyes lit up. Most hope for second and third place, behind Brazil. Respect for Brazil is the only constant in men and women’s football. Brazil have won six of the seven Copa América tournaments, with Argentina stealing one in 2006. Regardless of the winners, this Copa América will be a testament to how solidarity among female players has challenged the structural and cultural sexism of some of the world’s largest sporting organisations."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/mar/22/police-taking-days-to-respond-to-999-calls-as-budget-cuts-bite","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-22T00:01:19Z","webTitle":"Police taking days to respond to 999 calls as budget cuts bite","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/mar/22/police-taking-days-to-respond-to-999-calls-as-budget-cuts-bite","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/mar/22/police-taking-days-to-respond-to-999-calls-as-budget-cuts-bite","fields":{"headline":"Police taking days to respond to 999 calls as budget cuts bite","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Under-pressure police forces are taking days to respond to 999 calls that should be dealt with in an hour, the policing watchdog has said, as they come under “significant stress” from slashed budgets and increased demand. Almost a quarter of forces in England and Wales are struggling to deal with emergency calls in a timely way, Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire &amp; Rescue Services (HMICFRS) has said in a report on police effectiveness. West Midlands, Greater Manchester and South Yorkshire were singled out as having the worst record on delays in dealing with 999 calls. In some cases, crimes that require a “prompt” response – that is, police attending within an hour of the call – are not dealt with for days. In Cambridgeshire, for example, the average “prompt” response time was 15 hours. This could include cases of serious assault, including sexual violence, inspectors said. The inspectorate put the delays down to a lack of police officers available to attend the emergencies, ruling out a problem with the call handlers. Labour said the findings showed that cuts to police budgets had left the service at breaking point, while the minister for policing pointed out inspectors found most forces to be effective at keeping people safe. Zoë Billingham, Her Majesty’s Inspector of Constabulary, who led the inspection, said she had “major concerns that policing is under significant stress”. She said: “On occasions, that stress stretches some forces to such an extent that they risk being unable to keep people safe in some very important areas of policing.” “About a quarter of forces are all too often overwhelmed by the demand they face, resulting in worrying backlogs of emergency jobs, with officers not attending incidents promptly, including those involving vulnerable people.” Police budgets have fallen by around a fifth since 2010 and HMICFRS recently said forces will have £700m less a year to fight crime in the coming years, as well as fewer officers. Earlier this week, Theresa May was officially rebuked by the UK Statistics Authority for misleading MPs and the public over false claims that the government was providing an extra £450m in funding to local police forces in 2018/19. Louise Haigh, the shadow policing and crime minister, said: “We’ve had all the Tory spin on police funding, but this week we are finally getting to the truth. “First the stats watchdog raps the prime minister for misleading claims and now the independent inspector is sounding the alarm – warning that some forces are so stretched that the lives of vulnerable people are being put at risk. “It’s time the Tories owned up to the public because their cuts have left our police at breaking point and our communities at risk.” As well as struggling to respond to emergency calls, HMICFRS found police officers were not seizing opportunities to look for evidence in the initial stages of the investigation. In too many cases, so-called “golden hour” responsibilities were not being carried out, the watchdog said. House-to-house enquires, identifying witnesses and use of body-worn cameras were being overlooked. In addition, a review of 2,700 crime case files revealed more than 50% of opportunities to identify an offender were missed and on a quarter of occasions house-to-house enquiries in search of witnesses were not made. The watchdog also found police forces with high workloads and “poor supervision” are yet to risk assess 3,300 registered sex offenders, an 18% increase on last year. As of July last year, there were 60,061 “wanted records” on the police national computer – including 374 relating to homicide and 1,135 to rape, the report said. And it highlighted the ongoing “national crisis” in the shortage of detectives. There is currently a shortfall of 5,000 investigators across England and Wales, meaning one in five detective desks are empty, the report said. The report added: “HMICFRS is concerned by this finding, because it shows that the system is under severe strain and in some forces the cracks are showing.” Overall one force was rated “outstanding”, 30 were “good” and 12 judged to “require improvement”. Nick Hurd, the minister for policing and the fire service, said: “The government recognises that crime is changing and demand increasing, which is why we have provided a strong and comprehensive settlement that will increase funding by up to £450m across the police system for 2018/19, including £270m drawn from increased precept contributions. “The government has given police new powers to protect vulnerable people, including domestic violence protection orders and new offences under the Modern Slavery Act, and progress has been made in this area. But it is clear the police response can be inconsistent and requires improvement. “Forces and police and crime commissioners must go further and act on HMICFRS’s recommendations, because they play a crucial role in responding to crimes, such as domestic abuse, as more people grow in confidence and report them.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2018/mar/22/both-directions-why-harry-styles-new-song-is-a-breakthrough-for-bisexual-music-fans","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-22T16:00:08Z","webTitle":"Two directions: why Harry Styles' new song is a breakthrough for bisexual music fans","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/mar/22/both-directions-why-harry-styles-new-song-is-a-breakthrough-for-bisexual-music-fans","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/mar/22/both-directions-why-harry-styles-new-song-is-a-breakthrough-for-bisexual-music-fans","fields":{"headline":"Two directions: why Harry Styles' new song is a breakthrough for bisexual music fans","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"In the last few years of his career, Harry Styles has shown that he is an ally of the LGBTQ community in subtle and not-so-subtle ways. When the homophobic Westboro Baptist Church in Kansas picketed his former boyband One Direction’s concert, he responded with a tweet supporting “equal rights for everyone”. Since launching his solo career last year in a flurry of Jacobean ruffled shirts and studied Jagger-esque moves, he has danced with rainbow flags and invited queer trio Muna to support him on tour. In a new song debuted this month, Styles seemed to align himself more directly with the LGBTQ community than he had to date. Performing Medicine in Paris, he confidently roared, “The boys and the girls are here / I mess around with him / And I’m OK with it.” Fans hailed it as a bisexual anthem. Styles hasn’t explained the Medicine lyrics, and has never openly identified as queer. When asked about his sexuality in interviews, he has been consistently ambiguous. “I don’t feel like it’s something I’ve ever felt like I have to explain about myself,” he told the Sun last year. Even so, Medicine was an important moment for some bisexual music lovers, unaccustomed to seeing their own experiences mirrored in arena-filling pop songs. “It made me feel good about myself as a bisexual,” says Joanie, a Styles fan from Montreal. “Hearing your idol sing about your people means more than you can imagine.” Fifteen-year-old Even, who identifies as bisexual, agreed. “I think it’s really cool and brave,” he says. “There are not many male bisexual celebrities, so people think bi boys don’t exist, but they do.” Mainstream pop has a fairly robust history of queer themes, but the “B” in LGBTQ has often been overlooked. Representation is crucial: bisexual people can be stigmatised by both straight and LGTQ communities, according to the lead author of a 2017 study, leading to “double discrimination” and putting them at higher risk of struggling with mental health issues than other LGBTQ folks. As pop culture slowly becomes more inclusive of specific marginalised identities, there’s a hunger for songs that directly speak to bisexual experiences. Now, there’s an increasing feeling that these themes need not be hidden between the lines: last March, Frank Ocean’s one-off single Chanel seemed to directly allude to bisexuality, and in the neon-soaked video for her comeback single Make Me Feel, Janelle Monáe giddily spins between male and female love interests. According to a 2017 study, less than half of American teenagers identified as straight, and speaking directly to this audience can create loyal, lifelong fans – as long as it is sincere. Grammy-nominated R&amp;B artist Kehlani speaks openly about her pansexual identity, and depicted sepia-filtered same-sex romance in her 2017 video for Honey; her gigs are packed with LGBTQ teens. Last year, Halsey teamed up with Fifth Harmony’s Lauren Jauregui for Strangers, an earworm that used female pronouns. “That song is so important,” says Quinn, a genderqueer bisexual fan from Tennessee. “In the past, a lot of bisexual representation has been negative or nonexistent – but I love how both Halsey and Lauren are bisexual women singing about queer romances.” This fanbase is rightly sceptical about being exploited. Bisexual themes in post-millennium pop have often come across as queer-baiting – making a play for the lucrative support of LGBTQ audiences while avoiding the risk of alienating other (homophobic) fans. Katy Perry’s I Kissed a Girl toyed with girl-on-girl imagery with all the nuance of Nuts magazine (this year she expressed some regret over the lyrics); in Not Myself Tonight, Christina Aguilera donned Torture Garden PVC and sang of a bi-curious moment of madness (“Someone call the doctor,” she urged, “’cause I’ve lost my mind”). Nicki Minaj claimed to be bisexual at the beginning of her career, rapping about a carnivorous appetite for “kitty kat”, but later said that she did it to get attention. Jessie J said that her own bisexuality was a “phase”. It’s been historically rare for male artists to acknowledge bisexuality at all. David Bowie famously told Melody Maker in 1972 that he was attracted to men; a decade later, he called the admission “the biggest mistake I ever made.” When artists toy with bi-curiousness to cause a stir, or reduce it to a kind of nymphomaniac pathology, they minimise the lived experiences of a community that might face specific marginalisation. Bisexual pop fans won’t stand for the crumbs they have been offered in the past, and mainstream music is beginning to evolve in line with this. “Being part of the LGBTQ community is not a joke,” says Joanie. “It’s who we are.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"football/2018/mar/21/gwyn-williams-accused-racist-bullying-chelsea","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-21T20:37:00Z","webTitle":"Gwyn Williams accused of racist bullying by fourth former Chelsea player\r\n","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/mar/21/gwyn-williams-accused-racist-bullying-chelsea","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/mar/21/gwyn-williams-accused-racist-bullying-chelsea","fields":{"headline":"Gwyn Williams accused of racist bullying by fourth former Chelsea player\r\n","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Chelsea are facing new allegations about a culture of “continued racist bullying and abuse” that is said to have left one of the club’s former youth-team players so traumatised he has deliberately avoided going anywhere near Stamford Bridge in more than 30 years and finds it difficult even to watch them on television because of the psychological scars. Legal papers delivered to Chelsea claim the player still suffers from flashbacks and has been damaged for life because of the racism he allegedly encountered from Gwyn Williams, a prominent figure at Stamford Bridge for 25 years. In a statement submitted as part of his legal claim, the player alleges the abuse started soon after he joined the club’s youth system, at the age of 13, and says it continued for six years until he abandoned his career, despite signing as a professional, because his self-confidence had been shattered and the prospect of seeing Williams made him “feel physically sick”. Lawyers representing the man, now 51, have lodged a claim against Chelsea alleging the club failed to protect the player, did not do enough to prevent racism during the relevant six-year period and did not make available an individual or separate body for reporting inappropriate and offensive behaviour. Chelsea have replied to say the club have informed the Football Association and the Premier League, as well as supplying the contact details for the Sporting Chance clinic in case their former player needs counselling. In a statement released to the Guardian, the club said: “We take allegations of this nature extremely seriously. We are absolutely determined to do the right thing, to fully support those affected, assist the authorities and support their investigations.” As revealed by this newspaper in January, Chelsea are already facing legal claims from three former youth-team players over separate allegations that black players were subjected to explicit racism from Williams and the youth-team coach Graham Rix during the 1990s. Both men, neither of whom has any current involvement with Chelsea, denied the allegations. The latest case relates to alleged incidents from 1979 to 1985, which was before Rix’s appointment. Williams has declined to comment but his solicitor, Eddie Johns, who also represents Rix, released a statement in January in response to the previous allegations to say his clients wanted to “deny all and any allegations of racial or other abuse”. He said Williams and Rix had cooperated with a police investigation, which had decided not to take action, and were cooperating with the FA. Johns added that the allegations had not been made directly to his clients. In the latest case the player recalls it being “a dream come true for a young boy” when he joined Chelsea’s youth set-up in 1979, the same year Williams was appointed at Stamford Bridge, and recalls working his way through the different levels to be in the same first-team squad as some of the players, including Kerry Dixon, Nigel Spackman, David Speedie and Pat Nevin, whose boots he polished as an apprentice. Behind the scenes, however, he says he was subjected to repeated abuse from Williams calling him a “nig-nog”, “nigger”, “darkie”, “rubber lips”, “shoeshine”, “sambo” and a “lazy black bastard” and, in one incident, telling him to “stop being a little coon snitch” when he tried to report a serious assault from another player. “To this day I feel I was denied my dream to play professional football,” he says. “I am certain there will have been many more like me – young boys who were targeted and had their self-confidence and self-worth destroyed. By the time I left I couldn’t even bring myself to kick a ball and I’d been a talented kid who had been told I would have gone far in the game. “I’ve never been back to Stamford Bridge since the day I left. I avoid the area. It’s even hard watching them on TV as, although the stadium has changed, it is still a place which holds many hurtful memories for me, and I still get flashbacks. “People will say why didn’t you challenge him or why didn’t you tell people but there was nobody to tell in those days and nobody to support you. I never said anything back – I didn’t feel I could. I never challenged him. He was in a position of power and he knew it. I was a just kid and I felt isolated and I didn’t want to alienate myself any further. “There was also a feeling of shame and guilt as a young man, as if I had been somehow to blame. Football wasn’t like it is now, with lots of people in roles such as player liaison and player welfare. We didn’t even have agents and I didn’t feel I could go to John Neal [the Chelsea manager]. The only people I could possibly have gone to were my parents and I knew my dad would go berserk and march to Stamford Bridge and confront him. “I was worried that would end any chances of me having a career elsewhere in football. Williams was a senior figure at the club; he knew everyone in football. He was effectively untouchable and he ruled all the players by fear. “I worried it would make things worse and finish my career. Looking back now, though, he’d killed my career before it even begun. My confidence had been destroyed. I was technically and physically capable but psychologically I’d been destroyed. I became very depressed.” His decision to come forward, he said, was taken after seeing the publicity created by the Guardian’s previous reports. “It gave me the confidence finally to speak out about what he did to me, something I have kept to myself for more than 30 years. There was a racist culture at the club – and in football, I guess. I hope others come forward now, too, and not just from Chelsea but any other clubs where it happened. I am 100% certain it happened to many young black kids in the 1980s. We were easy targets with no support or help.” His solicitor, Renu Daly, of Hudgell Solicitors, confirmed that a claim had been lodged against the club and said there was “no question that Chelsea should be held vicariously liable”. “Our client is urging anyone who feels they went through similar experiences to come forward and speak out,” Daly said. “Don’t accept it as something which happened back in the day. It is unacceptable now and the reality is people knew it was unacceptable then.” She added: “Football clubs are responsible today – and always were in the past – for the actions of their staff, who in youth-team circumstances were looking after children.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"education/2018/mar/21/teaching-union-calls-for-5-pay-rise-with-possible-strike-backing","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-21T12:58:54Z","webTitle":"Teaching union calls for 5% pay rise with possible strike backing","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2018/mar/21/teaching-union-calls-for-5-pay-rise-with-possible-strike-backing","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/education/2018/mar/21/teaching-union-calls-for-5-pay-rise-with-possible-strike-backing","fields":{"headline":"Teaching union calls for 5% pay rise with possible strike backing","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Britain’s largest teaching union is calling for a 5% pay increase for school staff – buoyed by the announcement of a 6.5% settlement for nurses and NHS staff – backed by a campaign to include possible strike action. The annual conference of the National Union of Teachers, shortly to merge and become the National Education Union, will consider a motion for a pay claim of 5% alongside other school unions, and ask that the increase be funded by the government rather than from existing school budgets. Kevin Courtney, the union’s general secretary, applauded the government’s ending of some austerity-era pay policies. But he warned that teaching in England was moving from crisis to catastrophe, as school staff looked at their long hours and compared working conditions with those of other professions with more generous pay. “There is some optimism in that the government is starting to move. But we think when teachers around the country, and students considering coming into teaching, look at the salaries, they see it is not competitive with other graduate salaries,” Courtney said. Teachers previously had annual pay increases as they gained experience. But those policies have largely been replaced with performance-related pay, increasing uncertainty. Courtney said: “Crucially, teachers are looking at their working hours and they are making a calculation about the hourly rate they actually get. When young teachers are reporting that they work 60-hour weeks, and they calculate their hourly rate, they are thinking their pay is nowhere near enough. “We have already a crisis in teacher recruitment and retention – and if we don’t act soon it will be a catastrophe.” The NEU and other teaching unions recently met with the government’s pay advisors, the School Teachers Review Body (STRB), which later this year will recommend a pay settlement. Courtney noted that last year the STRB was prepared to sound the alarm over looming staff shortages, calling it “a substantial risk to the functioning of an effective education system”. “Those words were quite astonishing for such a body,” Courtney said. “I think the STRB would really want to say that we should have 5% [pay rise] but they are worried whether the government would fund it or not.” The proposal to be considered at the conference later this month will call on the government to fully fund any pay rise and lays the groundwork for industrial action through canvassing members. The NUT conference in Brighton over Easter will be its last separate annual conference following its merger with the Association of Teachers and Lecturers (ATL) to form the National Education Union. ATL will hold its last separate annual conference the following weekend. The conference will hear criticism of poorly performing multi-academy trusts and the high pay handed to their chief executives. The union will also hear evidence of the crisis in mental health among pupils, thanks at least in part to the stress of high-stakes exams. The union will also consider a boycott of primary school tests in England."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"science/2018/mar/21/helmet-shaped-brain-scanner-allows-wearers-to-move-around","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-21T18:00:12Z","webTitle":"Helmet-shaped brain scanner allows wearers to move around","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/mar/21/helmet-shaped-brain-scanner-allows-wearers-to-move-around","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2018/mar/21/helmet-shaped-brain-scanner-allows-wearers-to-move-around","fields":{"headline":"Helmet-shaped brain scanner allows wearers to move around","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The world’s first brain scanner that can be worn as people move around has been invented, by a team who hope the contraption can help children with neurological and mental disorders and reveal how the brain handles social situations. The new scalp caps – made on 3D printers – fit closely to the head, so can record the electromagnetic field produced by electrical currents between brain cells in much finer detail than previously. This design means the scanner can work in ways never possible before: subjects can move about, for example, and even play games with the equipment on, while medics can use it on groups such as babies, children and those with illnesses which cause them to move involuntarily. “This has the potential to revolutionise the brain imaging field, and transform the scientific and clinical questions that can be addressed with human brain imaging,” said Prof Gareth Barnes at University College London, one of three partners in the project. The other two are the University of Nottingham and the Wellcome Trust. The brain imaging technique known as magnetoencephalography, or MEG, has been helping scientists for decades, but in many cases has involved using huge contraptions that look like vintage hair salon driers. The scanners operated further from the head than the new devices, reducing the detail they recorded, and users had to remain incredibly still. The new fitted “helmets” – which look rather like an accessory from a horror or sci-fi film – record data millisecond by millisecond, and can be used while nodding, drinking tea or even playing with a ping pong bat and ball. This allows researchers to measure brain activity doing normal tasks, creating a baseline to detect and monitor diseases. Details of the the scanner are reported online in the journal Nature, though it has so far only been tested on one person, a woman. The next tests are likely to be on children with epilepsy, the hope being that surgeons will be able to diagnose the problem sooner and better target which areas of the brain to operate on. Others it should help include people with psychoses and neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases. The next step, say researchers, is to make the cap look less menacing: the design they have in mind is similar to a bicycle helmet."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2018/mar/22/lord-of-the-rings-amazon-expensive-tv-shows","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-22T06:00:27Z","webTitle":"Mo' money, mo' problems: why expensive TV shows don't always add up","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/mar/22/lord-of-the-rings-amazon-expensive-tv-shows","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2018/mar/22/lord-of-the-rings-amazon-expensive-tv-shows","fields":{"headline":"Mo' money, mo' problems: why expensive TV shows don't always add up","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"After turning its back on mopey comedies about listless people grappling with ennui in big houses, Amazon is banking everything on its upcoming Lord of the Rings TV show. According to Reuters, buying the rights to the property alone set Amazon back $250 million. Once production and marketing has been factored in, it’s likely that the first two series will cost half a billion dollars, and it could reach the $1bn mark if it completes the full six seasons. By some degree, that makes it the most expensive television programme in history. But just because a TV programme is expensive, does that make it any good? Let’s look at some of the costliest series ever made and find out. Lost ($4m/£2.8m per episode) An ensemble series about a plane crashing onto a mysterious tropical island was always going to be expensive. The pilot alone – which involved wrecking an aeroplane, laying it out across a beach, setting it on fire and then fastidiously removing all trace of it – apparently cost so much money that Disney fired ABC’s chairman for having the temerity to even greenlight it. However, it’s Lost for god’s sake. It’s one of the best programmes ever made. This was money well spent and I swear to god I will fistfight anyone who disagrees. House of Cards ($4.5m/£3.2m per episode) Some shows – like Breaking Bad or Fleabag – earn their prestige. Others simply buy it in. House of Cards is the perfect example of the latter. Netflix needed a hit, so it hired one of the world’s best directors and an Oscar-winning actor to achieve it. The result was House of Cards. At first the formula worked – it won seven Emmys, two Golden Globes and quickly established itself as a reason to subscribe – but now it’s all come crashing down. People will still watch the upcoming final series, but only because they want to see how the show will Poochie Kevin Spacey away. Camelot ($7m/£4.9m per episode) Hopes are high for Chris Chibnall’s turn at running Doctor Who, but you’ll notice that everyone is determinedly ignoring his 2011 show Camelot. That’s because Camelot was both eye-wateringly expensive and unforgivably terrible. Billed as no less than “an idea of hope that has resonated at different times throughout history”, Camelot managed to miss every target it set out to hit. The funny bits weren’t funny. The spectacular bits weren’t spectacular. There was too much talking. It was studded with ridiculous sex scenes that felt like they were shipped in from Skinemax. The fact that you can’t even remember it speaks to how bad it was. Sense8 ($9m/£6.4m per episode) Traditionally, you give a television programme a huge budget because you’re confident that it’ll have mass appeal. That wasn’t the case with Sense8; partly because it was a baffling sci-fi about a psychic connection that linked an entire global community, but mainly because the only thing anyone remembers from the pilot is the close-up of a damp strap-on squishing to the ground like a sack of fish. Sense8’s ambition and dedication to telling stories about non-binary characters earned it an audience, just not one big enough to justify all that money. Friends ($10m/£7.1m per episode) Sometimes a show’s budget gets out of control because of all the cool car chases and explosions it contains. Then there’s Friends, which became blisteringly expensive to make because the actors knew their worth. In 2002, the cast had become famous and bored. During contract negotiations, they pushed for a million dollars an episode each; and if they didn’t get it, they’d all leave. They got their million dollars, and Friends became the worst-looking expensive show ever made. The Get Down ($11m/£7.8m per episode) You didn’t watch all of Netflix’s The Get Down, because The Get Down looked and sounded like what it feels like to have a migraine in a branch of Topshop on a Saturday afternoon. It was like 15 television programmes happening simultaneously. It was like a burning farmyard. It was like dying and having an X Factor audition take place on your grave. It was terrible, and made worse by Baz Luhrmann’s refusal to understand the mechanics of a regular television budget. Genuinely the worse use of money since the Maginot Line. The Crown ($13m/£9.2m per episode) Apparently, the most expensive programme ever made so far, largely thanks to all the opulent palaces and costumes on show. It’s undoubtedly paying off – this is television of a scale and ambition we simply haven’t seen before – but you can’t help wish they’d pay their female stars properly. Game of Thrones ($15m/£10.6m per episode) The upcoming final series of Game of Thrones is hurling money at the screen.

I can’t believe I published eight books in 10 years’","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"David Mitchell: To begin, I’d like to float the observation that every author has a limited bundle of archetypal themes – sometimes as few as one. Writers don’t choose these themes as much as inherit them from the patterns of our lives, and even if we try to expel them from a work in progress, they tend to burrow their way back in. Does this sound familiar? One such theme your new book Patient X: The Case Book of Ryūnosuke Akutagawa has in common with everything in that “by the same author” list is mental breakdown, extrapolated to the short-story writer Ryūnosuke Akutagawa’s Technicolor insanity. Would you agree that this is one of your archetypal themes and, if so, can you speculate as to why? David Peace: I agree that writers have recurring archetypal themes or preoccupations. Roger Pulvers, the writer and translator, recently raised a similar point with me about what he saw as my interest in “derangement”, but I was genuinely taken aback; I would have said I was drawn to writing about individuals and societies in moments that are often extreme, and often at times of defeat, be they personal or broader, or both. I believe that in such moments, during such times, in how we react and how we live, we learn who we truly are, for better or worse. But even then, I wouldn’t have said it was a conscious choice; I’ve just wanted to try to understand the places I have lived and now live in, and the people I have lived and now live among, and to do that through writing the histories and biographies of those places and people. And so I was drawn to Akutagawa first as a reader, then as a writer, as a way to better understand the country I’ve chosen to live in, particularly its Taishō period from 1912 to 1926, as well as how a writer could or could not then navigate the dark waters of his times, rather than being drawn to him because of his mental deterioration and eventual suicide. But to swiftly turn that interrogation lamp back your way: I would say you have a preoccupation with the labyrinth and the thread; it’s as though all your novels (and short stories) are part of one gigantic book of maps you are constantly exploring, trying to find the path from this place to the next, from one time to another, and by ever increasingly fantastical ways. All that said, isn’t it always the reader who brings their own preoccupations to the text? In which case, it would be you who has the interest in mental breakdowns, no? So let’s score that round to me, then, and move on … DM: Nice try, but I’m still backing Roger P’s derangement theory, even though what you say about extreme circumstances being a definer of ordinary parameters is persuasive. (Quite what happens if extremism becomes a whole new normality is, in 2018, a moot point.) The “perception gap” between how you see your own work and how other people see it can indeed be as jolting as the gap between how you and others see you as a person. Especially true for writers, perhaps, whose art and selves are maybe two expressions of one thing. Labyrinths and threads? They’re undeniably present in my books, though I think of these as motifs or structures more than themes. Although, sometimes structure is a theme. Like you, I want to understand the world. Why are things the way they are, and not as they could be? Besides causality, my recurring archetypal themes seem to include predation and predacity; language and linguistic impairment; belonging and unbelonging – in addition to the themes hardwired into all novels: identity, memory and time. Perhaps a narrative is an investigation of these questions. What answers turn up can be morphing and murky, but the holy grail is, of course, the quest for the holy grail, and not the disappointing dust-trap that sends your contents insurance premiums through the roof. DP: I think it’s a couple of years now since we last met and I remember you talking in quite some detail about the books to come. According to your Five Book Plan, by now you should be somewhere in the rock world of the late 1960s. Am I right? Or have there been interventions? Diversions? DM: Yes, I’m now on my late 60s thing. I intend to finish it this year. A couple of side projects have eaten time since I last published – co-translating another of Naoki [Higashida]’s autism books and the Future Library project – but I’m on the next novel wagon now and won’t be getting off until delivery. My editor knows where I live. What are you working on, post-Patient X? DP: I’m working on the third book of the Tokyo trilogy, which is called Redux. I’ve been working on it for nigh on 10 years and the various abandoned drafts must run to well over half a million words. Redux has been a big part of these last 15 years, since we first met, and been neglected at times because of some of the changes during those years. The routine has fundamentally remained the same: I work from eight to four, seven days a week. But I’m much less confident in my writing than I used to be, and often feel paralysed by doubt. I’ve slowed down: I can’t believe I managed to publish eight books between 1999 and 2009, but I’m very aware there have only been two books since then. But I’m also aware this is not unique to me and I have a quote from Jean Genet above my desk, which keeps me going: “... after a brilliant period every artist traverses a desperate country and risks losing his reason and mastery. But if he comes out of it victorious ...” I work in hope. Thinking back over the last 15 years, what have been the changes in your “writing life”? By which I mean in both your writing practice and routine, and in your ambitions and hopes for the work itself? DM: Changes in my writing life since 2003, when we were both freshly en-Granta’ed young turks? On the one hand, not a lot. It’s still the cycle of doing what needs to be done that day, finding delaying tactics, letting the guilt build up until I start writing, writing, it getting dangerously late, going to bed, and starting again the next day. On the other, I’ve slowed down – I remember getting whole big chunks of novels done in weeks, not months – but I like to think what I do produce is closer to a finished manuscript than it used to be. Having kids is one obvious change-agent. Not just the way children oblige you to see society through parental eyes, but also that slow-motion process of watching human beings form over a decade and a half has been – to use a parasitic word – useful for my understanding of personality and character. I’ve done some screen work, too, which encourages textual frugality. Screenwriters have to get so much done with so few words. Moving on: I’ve got an eight-year chapter in Japan in my life, but you’re now up to 24 years in Japan. Soon you’ll be at the tipping point. As a long-term resident, do you feel like a stakeholder in Japan, or are you still a free-floating gaijin-san, albeit one with a family and social security? Is it Tokyo for good now? DP: Home or away, Britain or Japan, stakeholder or eternal gaijin? These are difficult questions, more of the heart than the mind, and made even more complicated by ageing parents, growing children, time and distance. At the risk of talking in quotes, there is a beautiful passage in the last interview with Roberto Bolaño where he says: “My two children are my only homeland. And in second place, maybe a few instants, a few streets, a few faces or scenes or books that live inside me.” As I found out when I tried to live back in Yorkshire, selfishly, I need my room in Tokyo, the National Diet Library and the secondhand bookshops of Jimbōchō in order to write, in order to live. I try not to see this as a rejection of Britain, rather as just an acceptance of my own situation. But you must have crossed the tipping point, and have now lived abroad longer than in Britain? You have managed to write successfully in many different places – Italy and Holland, Japan twice and Ireland for a while now – do you feel able to write anywhere? Or is Ireland now the place you need to be to write? DM: Like you, I’m British in terms of formation, background, family, culture and media, but apart from a short stint when our daughter was born, I haven’t lived there since the mid-90s. When England play Ireland at sport these days I even find myself quietly hoping Ireland get the upper hand just for the pleasure of basking in the pure ecstasy my Irish friends will radiate at the final whistle. Navigating old age in a culture and language not one’s own, however, is an issue that gets less abstract by the year. And of course for as long as Brexit remains a checklist of platitudes rather than a programme of policy, we have no idea how withdrawal from the EU will impact on our kids’ life chances and their freedom of movement in the future. DP: Going back to your times in Japan, and to ask about the influence of Japanese literature on your writing, is The Makioka Sisters by Jun’ichirō Tanizaki still your favourite Japanese novel? I remember arguing with you in a hotel dining-room in Nottingham in 2004 that Mishima’s Runaway Horses was the better novel, and you accusing me of being humourless. Not that I bear a grudge. And now I’d say Kokoro by Natsume Sōseki, anyway. I teach part-time a course on writing in the 21st century at the University of Tokyo and at the end of the year, I always ask the students to choose their favourite story and novel of the course. “Variations on a Theme by Mister Donut”, the story you wrote for Granta Japan, has twice topped the poll; Kazuo Ishiguro’s Never Let Me Go always wins favourite novel. DM: Oh dear, I’m sorry you thought that I was accusing you of humourlessness for your admiration of Mishima! My memory is a little hazy of course, but I’m guessing I was making the point in my clumsy way that Mishima’s work is devoid of humour; however much I might admire it in other respects. I mean humour in its widest, wisest sense, not just gag-count. Tanizaki’s not always a barrel of laughs, but there’s a leavening spirit in his writing that, for me, makes him better company. It’s over two decades since I read Makioka Sisters and I might have changed as a reader, so I’m not sure which novel to give my “favourite Japanese novel” title to now. I like Sōseki too – he has a generosity of spirit that reminds me of Forster and which, in turn, the more patrician Tanizaki lacks. As we are here, two middle-aged expat novelists discussing 20th-century Japanese lit like a pair of pigeon fanciers, I’ve got to say, I loved your Sōseki chapter in Patient X, and him running into a possible Jack the Ripper during the former’s miserable year in London was one of those “Back of the net!” moments – and maybe the most perfect synthesis of David Peace crime writer with David Peace the Japanist. DP: Apologies: I was attempting humour about the “Mishima incident” – not my forte – just to be clear, I wasn’t offended in the slightest. But the conversation came back to me when I was recently rereading Runaway Horses and I smiled when it did. Thank you, though, for being so kind about the “Jack the Ripper’s Bedroom” chapter. The intention had been to juxtapose the miserable year Sōseki spent in London with Angela Carter’s time in Tokyo, inspired by the coincidence that the Sōseki Museum in London (now no more, sadly) was a few doors down from the last house in which Carter lived, in Clapham – but it turned into something else, as these things do • Patient X by David Peace is published by Faber on 5 April. Slade House by David Mitchell is published by Sceptre."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"football/2018/mar/21/reading-sack-manager-jaap-stam-championship-relegation-battle","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-21T11:24:26Z","webTitle":"Reading sack manager Jaap Stam after one win in last 18 league games","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/mar/21/reading-sack-manager-jaap-stam-championship-relegation-battle","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/mar/21/reading-sack-manager-jaap-stam-championship-relegation-battle","fields":{"headline":"Reading sack manager Jaap Stam after one win in last 18 league games","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Jaap Stam has left his position as Reading manager after a run of one win in 18 league games, the Championship club have announced. The 45-year-old took Reading to the 2017 Championship play-off final in his first season in charge, but leaves with the club just three points above the relegation zone. A statement on the club’s official website read: “Reading Football Club announce that Jaap Stam has left his position as manager of the club with immediate effect. “Majority shareholders, Mr Yongge Dai and Ms Xiu Li Dai, had wanted to give Jaap every opportunity to turn around what has been a difficult and challenging Championship campaign. “Jaap has not wavered in the time, effort and sheer determination he has put in to try to steer the team away from the position we find ourselves in. However, after careful consideration, the decision has been made that a change is now necessary.” The former Manchester United and Lazio centre-back, who earned 67 caps for the Netherlands, was appointed in the summer of 2016 after working as an assistant coach at Ajax. In his first season as a manager, Stam led Reading to a third-place finish, but saw his side lose to Huddersfield Town on penalties in the play-off final. This season, Stam has overseen just eight wins in 38 games. “We would like to thank Jaap for his hard work and commitment, in particular noting what he achieved in a memorable first season in club management, and we wish him the very best of luck in his future endeavours,” the statement added. “We will now focus on identifying and recruiting the right person to take Reading forward.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"environment/2018/mar/23/coalition-accuses-green-groups-of-misleading-public-on-forestry-agreements","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-22T17:00:35Z","webTitle":"Coalition accuses green groups of misleading public on forestry agreements","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/mar/23/coalition-accuses-green-groups-of-misleading-public-on-forestry-agreements","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/mar/23/coalition-accuses-green-groups-of-misleading-public-on-forestry-agreements","fields":{"headline":"Coalition accuses green groups of misleading public on forestry agreements","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The government has accused green groups of deliberately misleading the Australian people by raising concerns about the roll over of long term logging agreements. The accusations from federal assistant agriculture minister senator Anne Ruston were revealed after Guardian Australia reported the government itself had discussed concerns that the agreements were invalid as they are based on old scientific assessments. In February 2018 Ruston sent letters attacking the groups for “deliberately and dishonestly” making misleading claims in emails about the regional forest agreements (RFAs). The environment groups had responded to calls for public submissions on the extension of the NSW RFAs, claiming they were a failed model for forest management, that populations of forest animals – including koalas - had “plummeted”, and that forest jobs had steadily declined while subsidies were needed to keep logging financially viable. Ruston replied personally in a letter to NPA chief executive, Alix Goodwin in February. The minister – with responsibility at the federal level for forestry - said she was disappointed that the association was “engaged in a campaign to mislead the Australian people”. Guardian Australia revealed on Wednesday commonwealth concerns about the validity of the RFAs and possible legal challenges to their roll-over because the science that underpins the existing agreements is “now quite old”. The “legal and political risks” were outlined in ministerial briefs prepared by NSW bureaucrats for three meetings of commonwealth forestry ministers from late 2016, as they negotiated plans for the RFA extensions. Yesterday the Senate passed an order for the production of documents from Greens senator Janet Rice. Rice is seeking the release of all documents relating to the RFAs produced for the three meetings, and any subsequent meetings. The government has a week to respond. After receiving Ruston’s letter, the board of the NPA NSW sought legal advice before responding on 23 February with a detailed nine page letter refuting the Minister’s claims. “We are also aggrieved by and refute the four allegations in your letter asserting that our ‘petition deliberately and dishonestly’ makes certain claims, or fails to include certain information,” the letter said. In a statement to the Guardian, Goodwin said: “It’s hard to see the senator’s letter as anything but an attempt to intimidate us, because we successfully challenged the government’s efforts to rush the RFAs through with minimum scrutiny.” She said the “direct attack” by Ruston was extraordinary, given that the association’s members wrote the emails while public consultation on the NSW RFAs was still open. Ruston’s letter has also been used as a template for other members of the government to respond to groups making submissions on the RFAs. For example, David Gillespie, the federal member for Lyne, wrote to Mr I Hodson from the mid-north coast branch of the NPA in Wingham on 23 February, saying he was making deliberately dishonest claims about wildlife and native forest logging. Oisin Sweeney, a senior ecologist with NPA, said: “Senator Ruston’s attack was over a submission letter we put together on the failings of the RFAs. We based our claims on a comprehensive review of the RFAs’ social, economic and environmental performance. “We presented this review to Ruston’s office in April 2016.... There were no claims of dishonesty or inaccuracy then – or in the 22 months since.” The Guardian asked senator Ruston a series of questions about the letters. The minister declined to answer the specific questions. She said in a written response: “The Coalition government strongly supports Australia’s native forest industries and the jobs and economic prosperity they bring to our regional communities. “The Coalition government is fully committed to fulfilling its election commitment to establish a 20-year rolling life to all Regional Forest Agreements, which are the best mechanism for balancing the environmental, economic and social demands on our native forests.” Ruston’s letter to NPA NSW is similar to a letter dated 20 February 2018 to Ed Hill, campaign co-ordinator with the Goongerah Environment Centre Office (GECO) in Victoria. Like the NPA, the GECO was encouraging its members and supporters to send emails to state and federal politicians opposing the rollover of the RFAs. Ruston, who wasn’t on the list, replied in a letter to Ed Hill dated 20 February. Appearing to confuse the Goongerah Environment Centre with the Wilderness Society, the minister claimed that the group was trying to “mislead” the Australian people. “What’s curious is that our emails weren’t sent to senator Ruston, they were sent to Victorian premier Daniel Andrews and copied to federal environment minister Josh Frydenberg. We didn’t get a reply from Mr. Frydenberg, but we did get one from senator Ruston.” Hill said: “Normally the responses from government are more measured but this made some outrageous assertions, accusing us of lying just because we didn’t agree with them.” In her statement Goodwin said: “This is an extraordinary attack on the NPA, an organisation well respected for it’s evidence based advocacy, and we reject completely senator Ruston’s accusations of dishonesty and misleading behaviour. “You have to question the state of our democratic processes when we’re invited to make submissions about the management of two million hectares of public property, and then have our integrity questioned by a senator when our view opposes that of the government.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2018/mar/22/justine-damond-shooting-why-did-police-refuse-to-talk-to-investigators","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-22T02:09:53Z","webTitle":"Justine Damond shooting: why did  police refuse to talk to investigators?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/mar/22/justine-damond-shooting-why-did-police-refuse-to-talk-to-investigators","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/mar/22/justine-damond-shooting-why-did-police-refuse-to-talk-to-investigators","fields":{"headline":"Justine Damond shooting: why did  police refuse to talk to investigators?","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The county attorney who announced charges against former police officer Mohamed Noor, accused of killing Australian woman Justine Damond, had harsh words for one group prosecutors rarely take on so publicly: police and the union representing them. “I’ve been privileged to have this job nearly 18 years. I’ve never had police officers, who weren’t suspects, refuse to do their duty and come forward to talk to us,” Mike Freeman said on Tuesday. “We therefore had no alternative than to subpoena them to a grand jury and take their testimony under oath.” As Freeman noted, those officers had been acting under the advice of their union, the Police Officers Federation of Minneapolis. When the city’s local paper, the Star Tribune, broke the story of tensions between Freeman and the union in the investigation earlier this month, the union president, Bob Kroll, responded in the combative and bombastic style that has become his calling card. “They need to figure out whose side they’re on,” Kroll said, referring to the prosecutor’s office. “Law enforcement should work collectively with city and county attorneys to prosecute criminals.” Among Kroll’s many critics is Rachel Paulose, a former federal prosecutor in Minnesota who is also a well-known conservative. “This isn’t about sides, it’s about justice, it’s getting to the truth,” she said. “I think it’s very unfortunate that anyone would make this about sides. This is about truth, transparency and giving citizens confidence that their government is working.” The exchange highlights the way in which the Damond case has underlined systemic issues in the US criminal justice system. Police are known for closing ranks, but the recalcitrance of the police union in the Damond case has stood out, in part because of the international attention the case has received, and because of the stark details of the case itself: ultimately, an officer killed an unarmed woman in her pyjamas who had called police to ask for help. But the stance of the union, whose representatives declined to speak to the Guardian, has also been nuanced. Kroll has opted not to publicly defend Noor in the way he did officers involved in the last controversial police shooting in Minneapolis, that of Jamar Clark, an unarmed black man killed by police in 2015. But in Noor’s case, he did tell officers not to talk to investigators. For activists working on policing in Minneapolis, Kroll’s stance was unsurprising. As union president, Kroll represents rank-and-file officers and they’ve supported him. Last year he was re-elected to his post, thumping a challenger who called him “abrasive” by a margin of 423 to 184 votes. “Bob Kroll’s job, ultimately, and what he sees his job as, is to prevent officers, as much as possible, getting in trouble, ever, for anything,” said Tony Williams, a member of the activist collective MPD 150, which wants the city’s police department dissolved. “If it helps to think of him as a defence lawyer, that’s what he is. It’s his job to get officers off, pretty much no matter what happened. That’s one of the reasons he’s getting re-elected to the union spot.” Williams sees Kroll’s intervention in the Damond investigation as being less about the case itself and more about preventing the establishment of a precedent. “He doesn’t want people getting subpoenaed for talking about police brutality. He doesn’t want there to be this sort of ‘activism’ on behalf of prosecutors, who are actually doing their jobs and trying to hold police accountable when they do things that are dangerous or criminal,” Williams said. The kind of resistance to outside pressure shown by the police union in the Damond case is not unique to Minneapolis. It’s a topic Norm Stamper, who was a cop for 34 years and police chief of Seattle for six years, has written extensively about since he retired in 2000. He sees the mindset as having to do with the insular nature of police culture. Officers, he argues, have an intense shared experience that is starkly different from regular citizens and they often end up spending most of their spare time with other officers. “That produces an attitude, because you’re constantly being fed and fueled by like minds,” Stamper said. “It creates a mentality that comes across like this: ‘We’re the cops and you’re not’. That kind of an attitude is perceived within the ranks as normal and reasonable and necessary. From outside the ranks, citizens in general, other members of the justice system, civic leaders, community activists are all saying, ‘My God, the arrogance of these people’.” The fact that the police union also opted not to defend Noor, a Somali American, has been a sore point in Minneapolis’s large and influential Somali community. Many see it as just one of many contrasts between the Damond case and cases of unarmed black men – Clark and Philando Castile – being shot. “The police union, the leadership of the department and the city, they have all definitely left [Noor] behind,” said Jaylani Hussein, the executive director of the Minnesota chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations. “We know that this is definitely not just because of this officer. We know that his race, his religion, all of that has an impact.” Hussein supports Freeman’s decision to press charges and hopes the case might set a precedent for police accountability that will extend to all communities. “We believe we need justice for Justine and this justice cannot just be for Justine, it has to be for every person who is involved in similar circumstance, so we hope this is not just a one-off case,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2018/mar/22/austin-bomb-suspect-left-video-confession-before-he-died","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-22T03:43:57Z","webTitle":"Austin bomb suspect left video 'confession' before he died","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/mar/22/austin-bomb-suspect-left-video-confession-before-he-died","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/mar/22/austin-bomb-suspect-left-video-confession-before-he-died","fields":{"headline":"Austin bomb suspect left video 'confession' before he died","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The Austin bombing suspect recorded a lengthy video confession, police said on Wednesday evening. Brian Manley, the interim Austin police chief, said in a news conference that before Mark Conditt died after setting off an explosion in his car as officers closed in on him, he made a 25-minute video, found on his phone this morning, in which he describes the differences between the explosive devices in detail. “I would classify this as a confession,” Manley said. As to a motive, he added, “We are never going to able to put a [rationale] behind these acts.” However, Manley said, “He does not at all mention anything about terrorism nor does he mention anything about hate. But instead it is the outcry of a very challenged young man talking about challenges in his personal life that led him to this point.” Manley said police had no plans to release the video, which they believe was made between 9pm and 11pm on Tuesday, a couple of hours before the suspect’s death. He indicated the video suggested Conditt planned to commit more crimes, but Manley declined to elaborate. During a 19-day spell, police believe Conditt was responsible for five explosions that killed two people and injured five more. Another device, a package bomb found in a mail facility near the Texan capital’s international airport, did not detonate. The sixth explosion was fatal, too, but this time it was the suspect who paid the price. Police said that as a Swat team closed in on 23-year-old Conditt in the dark in the suburb of Round Rock, he drove his SUV into a ditch and detonated a device inside his vehicle. That the man is suspected of waging a serial bombing campaign using devices left on doorsteps, shipped via FedEx or placed in a quiet residential street with a tripwire appeared to come as a complete shock to those who knew him best. His family issued a statement on Wednesday saying they had “no idea of the darkness that Mark must have been in”. A police officer guarded his parents’ well-kept home in the Austin suburb of Pflugerville, where the annual German festival Deutsche Pfest is the main source of excitement. Without giving his name, the officer said other family members were not suspects and a search of the property had not turned up anything suspicious. As the string of package bombs exploded so destructively throughout March, the suspect drew comparisons to Ted Kaczynski, the domestic terrorist known as the Unabomber, who is serving life without parole at the supermax prison in Florence, Colorado, for a string of bombings between 1978 to 1995 that spanned the US. Kaczynski was a Harvard-educated mathematics prodigy who spread his attacks so sparsely, killing three and injuring many others, and laid so low that it took years for him to be captured. Conditt was a home-schooled college drop-out whose attacks were so frequent that in a matter of days law enforcement tracked him down and he appeared to choose death before capture. Taking a walk through Pflugerville, another Austin suburb, on Wednesday morning, in the neighbourhood where the suspect’s parents live, resident Beverly Canales was struck by the dramatic sight of law enforcement and media vehicles crammed along the narrow, quiet street. The 56-year-old, whose husband works for the county sheriff’s department, said the suburb still had a charming, small-town feel, despite a population surge in the past two decades. Now it has a less appealing claim to fame than its annual festival. “Our little town of Pflugerville has our own Unabomber,” she said. ‘I am not that politically inclined’ Conditt lived with a couple of housemates at a modest place about half a mile from his parents. Six years ago he claimed not to possess intense political opinions. “I enjoy cycling, parkour, tennis, reading, and listening to music. I am not that politically inclined. I view myself as a conservative, but I don’t think I have enough information to defend my stance as well as it should be defended,” he wrote on a blog. “The reasons I am taking [a politics class at Austin community college] is because I want to understand the US government, and I hope that it will help me clarify my stance, and then defend it.” He did, though, express strong anti-abortion and anti-homosexuality views: “Homosexuality is not natural. Just look at the male and female bodies. They are obviously designed to couple,” he wrote. “In addition, political protection of a sexual practice is ludicrous. I do not believe it is proper to pass laws stating that homosexuals have ‘rights.’” He expressed firm views on law and order in a blog post in 2012, saying he supported the death penalty because “living criminals harm and murder, again – executed ones do not”. Despite stark language, such right-wing stances on hot-topic issues are far from unusual in suburban Texas, even in a place like Austin known as a liberal and cultural anomaly in the Republican state. A recruiting website listed his profession as “purchasing agent/buyer/shipping and receiving”, while his parents, Pat and Danene, appear to run a business consultancy from their home. Said to have been unemployed at the time of his crimes, Conditt had also worked as a computer repair technician and at a semiconductor manufacturing company. Those roles hint at the sort of technical proficiency necessary to construct and safely transport explosive devices, which the authorities described as sophisticated. “When I met Mark, he was really rough around the edges,” a friend who knew him well several years ago, Jeremiah Jensen, told the Austin American-Statesman. “He was a very assertive person and would … end up being kind of dominant and intimidating in conversation. A lot of people didn’t understand him and where he was coming from.” Jensen told the newspaper Conditt – like other family members – was religious. “I know faith was a serious thing for him,” he said. “I don’t know if he held onto his faith or not.

The fire broke out about 7.30pm on Wednesday at the 15-storey Metro hotel in Ballymun in the north of the Irish capital. The hotel had been used as emergency accommodation for some of Dublin’s homeless, though a spokesperson for the Dublin Region Homeless Executive confirmed there were no homeless families at the hotel at the time. The Irish police – the Garda Síochána – sealed off the area around the hotel in Ballymun and said traffic diversions were in place. The hotel is a short drive from Dublin airport. The effort involved more than 60 firefighters, several ambulances and advanced paramedics, three aerial appliances, two command units and four special units. The operation was also assisted by the Dublin airport fire service. Sinn Féin MEP Lynn Boylan tweeted: “Hearing reports of bad fire at Metro Hotel Ballymun, really hope everyone is out of the building and safe.” Erica Fleming, whose apartment overlooks the hotel, said she could see and hear windows exploding as a result of the heat. “One of the apartments is completely engulfed. There is smoke billowing up through the floors,” she said. “The windows exploded about 20 minutes ago, obviously from the heat. The windows of other apartments are just completely blackened out. You cannot see the corridor or landings. “I can see the fire crews dragging the hoses through the building. They are still two floors below but they are making their way up slowly.” Fleming, a mother of one and a student, said she believed she could see people being evacuated from a few floors below the seat of the fire. “There is also a lot of debris falling out the windows.” The Dublin fire brigade said there were no initial reports of injuries or missing people: “It is important for us to give out correct and factual information. As of yet we have no reports of any casualties or people unaccounted for.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/mar/22/cambridge-analytica-says-it-holds-no-data-on-australians-despite-local-entity","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-22T00:33:27Z","webTitle":"Cambridge Analytica says it holds no data on Australians, despite local outpost","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/mar/22/cambridge-analytica-says-it-holds-no-data-on-australians-despite-local-entity","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/mar/22/cambridge-analytica-says-it-holds-no-data-on-australians-despite-local-entity","fields":{"headline":"Cambridge Analytica says it holds no data on Australians, despite local outpost","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Cambridge Analytica has said it holds no data on Australian individuals and has no local business contracts, despite setting up an Australian entity in 2015 and meeting with prospective clients including members of the Liberal party. The company’s tactics attracted worldwide attention after news broke that it had unauthorised access to tens of millions of Facebook profiles, harvested through users of an app and the friends of those users. On Tuesday Guardian Australia revealed the business name Cambridge Analytica had been deregistered in Australia the previous night. “Cambridge Analytica and affiliated companies do not hold any data on Australian residents, nor do they have contractual relationships with any Australian clients,” a company spokesman told Guardian Australia on Wednesday night. The spokesman said Cambridge Analytica had “not executed any client work in Australia nor entered into any contracts of any type” in Australia. Asked if this included employment contracts for its Australian executive, the spokesman clarified the company had no “commercial contracts”. The spokesperson did not answer further questions. An Australian website was set up under the business name of Cambridge Analytica’s parent company, SCL Group. The holder of the Cambridge Analytica business name in Australia, Allan Lorraine, was listed as a director on that website, but said he “never was” its director. Lorraine could not explain the existence of the website except to suggest the company had wanted to appear bigger in Australia than they were. He confirmed the Cambridge Analytica business name – which he registered without the global company’s permission – and the SCL Group Australia website were connected. The website, which sat on SCL Group’s global domain but carried no phone number or street address for the Australian office, has since been taken down. In the Australian corporate registry, the Australian Cambridge Analytica business name was held by the trustee for the Lorraine Family Trust, and its address was that of Lorraine’s home in the Sydney surburb of Maroubra. The SCL Group Australia website carries only a post office address, also in Maroubra. The global page lists offices in a number of countries with several addresses matching those of Cambridge Analytica’s international offices. Inquiries by Guardian Australia to SCL Group about its Australian operation were directed to Cambridge Analytica. On Thursday Lorraine said there was “no such thing as employment contracts as I was only ever going to be a referral partner”. He said had no knowledge of any other work the company might have conducted. Lorraine had earlier told Guardian Australia he registered the Cambridge Analytica business name “in anticipation of doing business with them” after discussing the potential with company representatives. He said both parties got busy with other things – Lorraine with his car-sales consulting business and Cambridge Analytica with the Trump election campaign – and nothing ever came of it. Lorraine said he had “forgotten about it until now” and deregistered the company name on Monday following inquiries from media. He had contacted Cambridge Analytica and the company’s global business development manager, Peter Jones, but had not heard back. In a secretly filmed video by Channel 4 News, Cambridge Analytica’s chief data officer, Dr Alex Tayler, and the managing director of the firm’s global political arm, Mark Turnbull, told a journalist who was posing as a prospective client that the company had set up in Australia."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/mar/21/risky-business-for-panama-but-gomes-feels-the-love","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-21T20:39:55Z","webTitle":"Risky business for Panama but Hernán Darío Gómez feels the love","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/mar/21/risky-business-for-panama-but-gomes-feels-the-love","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/mar/21/risky-business-for-panama-but-gomes-feels-the-love","fields":{"headline":"Risky business for Panama but Hernán Darío Gómez feels the love","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Hernán Darío Gómez said there was a moment of “fright” followed swiftly by “pride” when the draw for Russia pitched his Panama team against England. The manager insisted that, if his side were able to win a game at their first World Cup this summer, the celebrations would be as big as when they qualified with an 88th-minute winner against Costa Rica and the country’s president, Juan Carlos Varela, declared a national holiday. “We’re a very young football country, in terms of our history, the league, and I think we got there quicker than we expected: I thought it would take longer,” Gómez said. “People are very happy to be at the World Cup but, if we have a good tournament, we would celebrate it the same. To win a game would be lovely.” Panama arrived in Europe for their penultimate get-together before their first appearance at the World Cup with their manager likening opponents Denmark and Switzerland to England and Belgium but admitting their preparation for these two friendlies has not been ideal. Some players made it to the team’s hotel only on Wednesday afternoon and judgment may have to be reserved until the summer. “We have not been together since we qualified, apart from when we played Wales in November,” Gómez said on the eve of facing Denmark at the Brondy Stadion. “It’s a game that’s very risky because, we have not been together for a long time now and if you don’t repeat ideas, players don’t remember them. “We have not had time to prepare, the opponent is strong and we’re ‘unarmed’, so we hope that this does not hurt [us]. They could score a lot of goals. We’ve had a [long] journey, few days, not much time, and anything can happen. [Defeat] won’t affect us as a group because we look at it from the point of view of the play but the way the country lives football, it could affect the [people]. Physically, the players look good but we can’t do any special work, we haven’t had time. That will come in May.” Asked if he had been paying close attention to Premier League games and had sent scouts to watch England, Gómez replied: “There’s no need. We’re all very modern now, we have all sorts of programmes, so we can see everything we need to see from Belgium, England and Tunisia.” Since the groups came out, they know everything about us and we know everything about them. Information is easier [nowadays], nothing can be hidden. It’s when the game comes that you see the reality.” Gómez likened Denmark to England, describing them as useful practice for the game in Nizhny Novgorod. “Denmark are a very good team and we want to play good teams for the World Cup,” he said. “This is why we’re coming to play these games. “European football is different to what we play in the Concacaf Cup, the Gold Cup and in qualifying. European teams almost all have the same style. They’re strong, quick, dynamic and they have something that’s very difficult for us: precision at speed, in one or two touches. Then they have individuals who make the difference. South American teams have individuals and technique too but in Europe it’s faster and very practical.” Gómez is heading into his fifth World Cup, with a third national team. He has not been at the tournament since 2002, when he led Ecuador. “I’m happy in Panama, the people show us affection: they love and respect the national team and what we have done. They wanted to see our shirt at the World Cup, hear our national anthem. “There’s lots of love at the moment. I feel as if it was the first time. I feel happy and proud. I would say to the people: enjoy it, it’s high tide, we have a lot to learn, have a good time and be happy.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/mar/21/knife-deaths-among-black-people-should-cause-more-outrage","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-21T21:58:08Z","webTitle":"Knife deaths among black people 'should cause more outrage'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/mar/21/knife-deaths-among-black-people-should-cause-more-outrage","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/mar/21/knife-deaths-among-black-people-should-cause-more-outrage","fields":{"headline":"Knife deaths among black people 'should cause more outrage'","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Knife deaths are not causing the “collective outrage” they should because the majority of victims are from black communities, a top police officer has said. Martin Hewitt, an assistant commissioner at the Met police, said that, although the police are putting “enormous effort” into tackling knife crimes, not enough preventative work was being done. His comments come as charity campaigners have warned that London has reached a crisis point in violent crime after eight people were killed in seven days in the capital. In total 26 people have been murdered by knives this year alone. Six of them were teenagers, and most of them were black. Hewitt told BBC News that he fears this is having an impact on how people react and how the issue is tackled. He said: “I do fear sometimes that because the majority of those that are injured or killed are coming from certain communities and very often the black communities in London, it doesn’t get the sense of collective outrage that it ought to do and really get everyone to a place where we are all doing everything we can to prevent this from happening. “It’s an enormous effort on our part. We are putting enormous resources in to try and stem the flow of the violence and having some success at doing that. But collectively we all ought to be looking at this and seeing how we can prevent it.” Meanwhile, Patrick Green, the chief executive of knife-crime awareness charity the Ben Kinsella Trust, said authorities had not done enough to educate young people on the dangers of carrying knives, despite a rise in violent attacks. He said: “We are at crisis point. We are seeing a steady increase in violent crime, and I think things may well get worse before they get better. “I think what we are seeing now is that we haven’t done enough to help educate young people not to carry knives in the first place or to turn away from violence and I think until we do we are not really going to solve this problem.” Green added that long-term solutions would take time before they became effective and said it would not be possible to “arrest our way out” of the problem. He said: “It’s not like flicking a switch. We can’t just turn this around really quickly. We have an overstretched police force doing the best that it can in terms of enforcement, but we haven’t invested enough in helping young people understand carrying a knife won’t protect them, it won’t solve conflicts, and we need to do far more around that approach to tackle this issue.” The charity was set up after the murder of 16-year-old Ben Kinsella, who was stabbed to death in Islington in 2008 after a night out celebrating the end of his GCSEs. Green, who joined the charity in 2012, said a raft of measures including education, mental health support and social service efforts are needed to curb “the underlying issues that drive young people to violence and to carry knives”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2018/mar/21/mark-zuckerberg-response-facebook-cambridge-analytica","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-22T06:53:26Z","webTitle":"Mark Zuckerberg apologises for Facebook's 'mistakes' over Cambridge Analytica","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/mar/21/mark-zuckerberg-response-facebook-cambridge-analytica","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2018/mar/21/mark-zuckerberg-response-facebook-cambridge-analytica","fields":{"headline":"Mark Zuckerberg apologises for Facebook's 'mistakes' over Cambridge Analytica","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Facebook is changing the way it shares data with third-party applications, Mark Zuckerberg announced on Wednesday in his first public statement since the Observer reported that the personal data of about 50 million Americans had been harvested and improperly shared with a political consultancy. The Facebook CEO broke his five-day silence on the scandal that has enveloped his company this week in a Facebook post acknowledging that the policies that allowed the misuse of data were “a breach of trust between Facebook and the people who share their data with us and expect us to protect it”. “We have a responsibility to protect your data, and if we can’t then we don’t deserve to serve you,” Zuckerberg wrote. He noted that the company has already changed some of the rules that enabled the breach, but added: “We also made mistakes, there’s more to do, and we need to step up and do it.” Facebook’s chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, shared Zuckerberg’s post and added her own comment: “We know that this was a major violation of people’s trust, and I deeply regret that we didn’t do enough to deal with it.” Zuckerberg also spoke to a handful of media outlets on Wednesday, including a televised interview with CNN in which he apologized for the “breach of trust”, saying: “I’m really sorry that this happened.” In similar conversations with the New York Times, Wired and the tech website Recode, Zuckerberg expressed qualified openness to testifying before Congress and said that he was not entirely opposed to Facebook being subject to more regulations. The crisis stems from Facebook policies that allowed third-party app developers to extract personal data about users and their friends from 2007 to 2014. Facebook greatly reduced the amount of data that was available to third parties in 2014, but not before a Cambridge University researcher named Aleksandr Kogan had used an app to extract the information of more than 50 million people, and then transferred it to Cambridge Analytica for commercial and political use. On Saturday, Facebook’s deputy general counsel, Paul Grewal, appeared to defend the lax policies that allowed data harvesting from unwitting friends, writing in a statement: “Aleksandr Kogan requested and gained access to information from users who chose to sign up to his app, and everyone involved gave their consent.” But after five days of outrage from the public, and calls for investigations and regulation from lawmakers in the US and UK, the company appears to be acknowledging that blaming users for not understanding its byzantine terms of service will not suffice. The company will investigate apps that had access to “large amounts of information” before the 2014 changes, Zuckerberg said, and audit any apps that show “suspicious activity”. A Facebook representative declined to share how Facebook was defining “large amounts of information” or how many apps would be scrutinized. Zuckerberg said in his interviews that the number of apps was in the “thousands”. The company will also inform those whose data was “misused”, including people who were directly affected by the Kogan data operation. An online petition calling for just such disclosure for people included in Kogan’s data set had garnered more than 15,000 signatures since the weekend. Facebook also promised to further restrict the amount of data third-party developers can access when users log in to their sites with their Facebook profile, turn off data sharing for apps that have not been used for three months, and move the tool that allows users to restrict the data they share from the Settings menu to the News Feed. David Carroll, a US design professor who is challenging Cambridge Analytica through the UK courts to access his data profile harvested from Facebook, called the reforms “inadequate”. “Users should be notified, and not have to know to go and find out,” he told the Guardian by email. Zuckerberg’s statement notably did not offer any explanation for why Facebook did not make any effort to inform affected users when Guardian reporters first told the company of the data misuse in December 2015. He did address the question in his press interviews, acknowledging to CNN that it was “a mistake” to rely on Kogan and Cambridge Analytica’s certifications that they had destroyed the data. “I don’t know about you, but I’m used to when people legally certify that they’re going to do something, that they do it,” he said. “We need to make sure that we don’t make that mistake ever again.” “With Mark Zuckerberg’s response, they are trying to convey that they are taking this seriously, but they are reacting to furore rather than facts,” said Jeff Hauser of the Center for Economic and Policy Research. “The facts are not new to them.” Jonathan Albright, a research director at the Tow Center for Digital Journalism, said that while he welcomed Zuckerberg’s explanation of how Cambridge Analytica gained access to the data in question, he was disappointed that the CEO did not address why Facebook enabled so much third-party access to its users’ personal information for so many years. “This problem is part of Facebook and cannot be split off as an unfortunate instance of misuse,” Albright said. “It was standard practice and encouraged. Facebook was literally racing towards building tools that opened their users’ data to marketing partners and new business verticals. So this is something that’s inherent to the culture and design of the company.” Olivia Solon and Edward Helmore contributed reporting."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/mar/21/peru-president-pedro-pablo-kuczynski-resigns-amid-corruption-scandal","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-22T01:30:04Z","webTitle":"Peru president Pedro Pablo Kuczynski resigns amid corruption scandal","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/21/peru-president-pedro-pablo-kuczynski-resigns-amid-corruption-scandal","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/mar/21/peru-president-pedro-pablo-kuczynski-resigns-amid-corruption-scandal","fields":{"headline":"Peru president Pedro Pablo Kuczynski resigns amid corruption scandal","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Peru’s president Pedro Pablo Kuczynski has offered his resignation after secret video recordings entangled him in a new corruption scandal on the eve of an impeachment vote, plunging one of Latin America’s steadiest economies into a political crisis. It was unclear if the opposition-controlled Congress would accept his resignation or proceed with a vote on Thursday to force him from office. In a televised message to the nation, Kuczynski said he would offer his resignation to avoid being an “obstacle” to the country but continued to deny any wrongdoing. Just 19 months into his five-year mandate, Kuczynski is the first sitting president in Latin America to be forced out due to links to the Brazilian construction giant Odebrecht, which has been at the centre of continent’s biggest corruption scandal. Kuczynski resigned as lawmakers prepared to vote for the second time in three months whether to oust the 79-year-old leader from office for “permanent moral unfitness” in a plenary session of Congress. He is accused of repeatedly lying about decade-old business ties to the Brazilian firm. But the release on Tuesday night of secretly recorded videos allegedly showing the president’s supporters attempting to buy political support ended any possibility that Kuczysnki could survive the attempt to force him out. The videos released by Peru’s biggest opposition party Fuerza Popular allegedly show key allies of the president offering lawmakers a share of public work projects in return for help in defeating a second impeachment vote against Kuczynski. He narrowly survived a previous impeachment motion in December 2017. The video clips shown in a news conference feature a government official explaining to a lawmaker how to make easy money from government projects for his region, while congressman Kenji Fujimori, assures him of government protection. In his address on Wednesday, Kuczynski blamed “selectively tendentious” edited recording for giving the impression of vote buying and said “political confrontation had created a climate of ungovernability” which did enormous damage to the country. Government ministers have denied contracts were awarded in exchange for political support and announced they would fire the official. Kenji Fujimori also denied wrongdoing, saying the recordings were a reflection of typical negotiations to get infrastructure projects off the ground. Although Kuczynski, known as PPK, was not directly implicated in the alleged vote buying, his increasingly battered credibility could not survive a further scandal. The Oxford- and Princeton-educated former banker who promised to modernise Peru is the first victim of a unfolding corruption scandal which has implicated most of the country’s main political players. “The parliamentary majority worked against PPK from day one,” said Eduardo Dargent, a political scientist at Lima’s Catholic University. “But he too must take responsibility for his downfall. His business interests, his lack of transparency, his lack of political maneuvering to distance himself from the Odebrecht scandal. “In many ways, he dug his own grave.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2018/mar/21/uk-should-get-behind-eu-tax-plan-tech-firms","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-22T07:02:02Z","webTitle":"The UK should get behind the EU's radical tax plan for tech firms | Nils Pratley","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2018/mar/21/uk-should-get-behind-eu-tax-plan-tech-firms","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2018/mar/21/uk-should-get-behind-eu-tax-plan-tech-firms","fields":{"headline":"The UK should get behind the EU's radical tax plan for tech firms","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Radical stuff from the European commission: it is proposing a tax on the revenues of large digital companies operating in the EU, to be levied at 3%. The idea breaches the basic principle that corporate taxes should be charged on profits, not turnover, and thus will cause conflict with the US and probably a few EU countries too. But Brussels deserves support. No measure to date has halted the massive under-taxation of global technology firms. A crude local revenue tax, intended to operate until an international solution can be agreed, is better than the current state of affairs. Digital businesses pay an effective average tax rate of only 9.5%, compared with 23.2% for bricks-and-mortar firms, according to the commission. We know why. The global tax system was designed for a different age and it is too easy for large technology firms to shift intellectual property and profits to low-tax territories. The contortions are legal (mostly) but the result is a skewed system that is a tech subsidy by another name. Other taxpayers are obliged to fill the inevitable tax shortfall. The commission calculates that a 3% tax on local revenues from tightly defined digital activities would raise €5bn (£4.36bn) annually. Spread across 150 qualifying large companies – including Apple, Facebook and Google – the sum cannot be described as punitive. Nor can the tech titans really have believed their free lunch would last forever. When challenged over elaborate tax arrangements, executives have tended to argue that they play by the rules as they find them, and that if politicians want a different system they should change the law. Now the commission is inviting EU governments to do exactly that. The UK Treasury, perhaps surprisingly, has itself flirted with the attractions of a revenue tax. Here is a proposal it can support – before and after we leave the EU. Aviva: picking the wrong battle? Aviva’s hard-charging chief executive, Mark Wilson, gets plaudits for restoring financial discipline to the FTSE 100 insurer, but sometimes he needs to slow down. Since declaring last week that Aviva was generating excess cash and that the moment had arrived to have some “fun”, he has walked into a unfunny City row. At one level, the quarrel is merely technical. The dispute is over Aviva’s claim that it is entitled to cancel £450m worth of “irredeemable” preference shares at their par value of 100p. Since the coupon, or annual interest rate, on these shares is 9%-10% (they were issued a couple of decades ago), the market price was much higher – about 170p. Shareholders are understandably furious that their investment has plunged in value by a quarter. They thought they owned something more like a fixed-income bond. Aviva says it is pursuing financial efficiency. Regulators have decreed that preference shares will no longer count as core capital from 2026. Plus, the company would save £38m annually by paying to cancel at par, which would be a good trade for ordinary shareholders. Even if Aviva’s lawyers have triple-checked the legal basis (the Financial Conduct Authority wants the details), the manoeuvre smells completely off. Try explaining to Joe Punter why it is fair to call something irredeemable and then declare that cancellation doesn’t count as redemption under section 641 of the Companies Act. Every private investor group in the land, and the big battalions of M&amp;G, Legal &amp; General and Prudential, is opposed. Aviva hasn’t yet put a formal proposal on the table, so its bald “may we remind you of our legal rights” approach may be the opening position in a negotiation. But it is aggressive, will cause maximum aggravation and cannot be good for the company’s reputation. The insurer’s other news last week was only slightly less awkward. Wilson has accepted a non-executive post at BlackRock, the world’s largest fund manager and thus surely a direct competitor to Aviva Investors. Does Wilson – and Sir Adrian Montague, chairman of Aviva, for that matter – stop to think about how these things look? Spotlight on audit watchdog The surprise in the latest Carillion hearings wasn’t that a partner at PricewaterhouseCoopers can charge £865 an hour for his time: there is no real competition at the top end of the consultancy market, especially in cases when half the rivals are tainted by past association with the fallen firm. Rather, the revelation was that the business secretary, Greg Clark, is about to order a review of the Financial Reporting Council, the audit watchdog. It is unclear whether he suspects the FRC lacks powers or is simply feeble at using the ones it has. Either way, an investigation is overdue. Even before Carillion, faith in the auditing of UK companies was low and falling."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"guardian-masterclasses/2018/mar/20/live-music-photography-at-field-day-festival-david-levene-photography-course","type":"article","sectionId":"guardian-masterclasses","sectionName":"Guardian Masterclasses","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-20T10:11:49Z","webTitle":"Live music photography at Field Day Festival | David Levene","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/guardian-masterclasses/2018/mar/20/live-music-photography-at-field-day-festival-david-levene-photography-course","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/guardian-masterclasses/2018/mar/20/live-music-photography-at-field-day-festival-david-levene-photography-course","fields":{"headline":"Live music photography at Field Day Festival with Guardian photographer David Levene","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"This course has now passed, but you can be the first to know about the next one - and other workshops like this - by signing up to our newsletter here.

It earned his side a priceless victory – one that keeps Aston Villa primed for a late tilt towards the automatic promotion places in the Championship – and brought the watching Villa supporter Prince William, who went into the home dressing room before kick-off, to his feet. As for Cardiff City, they need to quickly swallow successive defeats that have seen them surrender second place to a swaggering Fulham in the process. This may yet prove a knockout blow, but their destiny is still in their own hands with five games to play, including a game in hand over their rivals. If Villa can beat Leeds United here on Friday night, they will move to within a point of Cardiff, and two of Fulham. This was another match where Neil Warnock was left scratching his head, staggered at a string of superb saves by Sam Johnstone, the Manchester United loanee, five days after Rúben Neves’s sublime free-kick earned Wolverhampton Wanderers victory in south Wales. “We’re value for money but we have been done by two worldies,” Warnock said. “I don’t know how we’ve not won the game. Their goalkeeper tonight was unbelievable – we had so many chances.” As for his team dropping down to third in the table, he added: “It’s nice to be the hunter rather than the hunted. I still think things will happen between now and the end of the season, and it is always different when you are out in front.” That glorious Grealish goal – a strike reminiscent of Paul Scholes’s effort on this ground in 2006 – settled a game that looked as though it was heading for an unwanted stalemate. A former season-ticket holder in the Witton Lane Stand who joined Villa aged six, Grealish watched the ball all the way as it plummeted down from Sean Morrison’s looped left-footed clearance. Grealish powered home emphatically with his right, the ball smacking the post of Neil Etheridge’s goal before nestling in the opposite corner. Johnstone had kept Villa in for long periods, twice denying Nathaniel Mendez-Laing, a menace on his return to the Cardiff starting lineup, as well as keeping out Callum Paterson and preventing a Glenn Whelan own goal. Villa had struggled to seize control of a game that was going from bad to worse when Axel Tuanzebe hobbled off 26 minutes in, given that Birkir Bjarnason had pulled out of the warm-up with a back injury. The captain, John Terry, was another absentee after twisting his ankle during the defeat at Carrow Road on Saturday, and he is unlikely to be fit for Friday’s meeting with Leeds, although the Ivory Coast international Jonathan Kodjia could start after only his 13th appearance of the season here. As for Grealish, Bruce is hopeful this is another sign that the 22-year-old, whose previous off-field misdemeanours have been extensively documented, is maturing. “We’ve all known he’s a talent and to be without him for six months [because of a kidney injury] shows you what we have missed,” Bruce said. “He has tried to play with a maturity, and I think getting a freak injury like that put him on the back-burner a bit. “I’d rather he gets the plaudits for the right reasons, and that he’s on the back pages as opposed to the front or middle. He does some brilliant stuff in training, but training’s training and this is the big stage. It was always going to take a little bit of magic and I thought to a man we responded.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/2018/apr/10/aaron-rodgers-meets-dalai-lama-green-bay-packers-fan","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-10T19:15:06Z","webTitle":"Aaron Rodgers converts Dalai Lama to Green Bay Packers fan, which is nice","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/apr/10/aaron-rodgers-meets-dalai-lama-green-bay-packers-fan","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/apr/10/aaron-rodgers-meets-dalai-lama-green-bay-packers-fan","fields":{"headline":"Aaron Rodgers converts Dalai Lama to Green Bay Packers fan, which is nice","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers managed to recruit a new fan during a humanitarian mission to India this week – while perhaps taking a stride toward achieving total consciousness.

The 82-year-old is shown wearing the hat and gripping the ball alongside Rodgers in a photo posted to the Tibetan spiritual leader’s verified Instagram account. The six-time Pro Bowler is on a charity trip to India with his girlfriend, race car driver Danica Patrick, distributing hearing aids to those in need on behalf of the Starkey Hearing Foundation. Rodgers, who was raised by devout Christian parents, spoke at length about his inner conflicts with church dogma and passion for exploring broader matters of religion and spirituality in an ESPN The Magazine profile last year. The veteran signal-caller missed nine games last season due to a fractured collarbone but is expected to be fully fit when the team’s offseason program starts on Monday.

Now they encourage being bilingual.” Contreras’s daughter attends a Tulsa public school, where she is taught in English and Spanish. It is one of three dual-language immersion elementary schools in Tulsa, where half the students, many undocumented, are native Spanish speakers. The other half are non-native Spanish speakers. Many education professionals say bilingual schools are critical to integrating immigrants. Young children can grow and learn in the language they speak at home without being ashamed to do so at school, as Contreras was. At the same time, their classmates can learn Spanish with help from Latino peers. Contreras is one of more than 100 teachers marching from Tulsa to Oklahoma City, in search of better funding for education in the state. Many leaders of the march have said funding bilingual education is vital, not just for integrating Latinos but for improving education overall. “I think this is something that people are missing when they speak of the expense of when English language learners come to America and we have to teach them to speak English,” said Danielle Terrio, an elementary school teacher who grew up in a bilingual household – speaking sign language and English. “I was raised to think of the idea of ‘the deaf benefit’, that it’s not a disability. I’m multilingual and it’s a real benefit. Same thing for my bilingual kids.” Terrio said teaching in elementary school had shown her that bilingual students could learn faster than those who stuck to their mother tongue. “The bilingual second-grader can take a paragraph of information and summarize it well with skill,” she said. “The bilingual second-grader can pick the main topic out of a paragraph better; the bilingual second-grader can take multiple perspectives better. “They can understand that from this character’s view the story looks like this, and from this character’s point of view it looks like this, because they are translating and transitioning between different cultures all the time.” At a time when migrants are being demonized, some teachers on the road to Oklahoma City said they were marching to get more support for Spanish speakers and to better fund bilingual education. Cindy Gaete, the daughter of Chilean immigrants, is one of the lead march organizers. She works at Marshall elementary school in Tulsa – a school that is one-third Latino. In a school with more 100 native Spanish-speaking pupils, she said, she is the only teacher who is a native Spanish speaker. “The first thing I told my principal when I got hired,” she said, “is that if we are a third Latino, there should not be just one Hispanic teacher in your school.” Without any support, Gaeta said, she has become a de facto pupil liaison for many teachers. She said she would like to see more Spanish speakers in teaching, but said many potential immigrant teachers were steered away from the profession because of low pay, and because they could not access higher education to get necessary teaching certifications. “I would love for our applicant pool to become more diverse,” she said, “but again, it’s a lot harder when there are so many factors against the teaching profession.” The media narrative of the Oklahoma and West Virginia teachers’ strikes has painted them as largely white-led “red state rebellions”. Strike leaders like Gaeta say the role of Latinos and their migrant allies has been largely obscured. While the media has also compared the teachers’ strikes to recent student walkouts over gun violence, Gaeta said, it has largely ignored the inspiration some teachers have drawn from Latino students who walked out in protest when Donald Trump repealed protections for undocumented young people. “Same thing for all the marches lead by black youth in low-income communities,” she said. “They don’t get media attention.” Migrant organizations like Muslims for Mercy have taken the lead in coordinating food logistics for the Oklahoma teachers’ march. An immigrant-owned Tulsa-area restaurant, Desi Wok, made special pro-strike T-shirts which it gave to customers. Gaeta said some of the inspiration for the seven-day, 110-mile march came from the historic 1966 United Farm Workers March from Delano to Sacramento, a 340-mile journey. “Marches in the US have a huge historical legacy,” she said. “Dr Martin Luther King is well known for leading his marches for sanitation workers’ rights, but there was also Cesar Chavez and Dolores Huerta and they believed in the power of marches. We need to keep those historical Hispanic leaders in mind.” On the road to Oklahoma City, the teachers said they were marching for a new future for Latinos. “This is just another way to show solidarity,” said Gaeta as she shared a granola bar, by a gas station on the road outside Warwick."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/apr/10/worcester-ben-teo-see-out-contract","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-10T17:55:45Z","webTitle":"Worcester lifted by Ben Te’o’s pledge to see out contract next season","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/apr/10/worcester-ben-teo-see-out-contract","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/apr/10/worcester-ben-teo-see-out-contract","fields":{"headline":"Worcester lifted by Ben Te’o’s pledge to see out contract next season","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Ben Te’o has moved to end speculation over his future at Worcester by insisting he will “100%” be at the club next season. The England centre has one more year to run on his three-year deal and has confirmed he plans to see out his contract. Te’o’s renewed commitment comes as a boost to Worcester, who can seal Premiership survival this weekend. Last week the Warriors reported a pre-tax loss of £8.1m for the 2016-17 season and Te’o is among the best-paid players in the Premiership but the 31-year-old will be a key part of their attempts to avoid relegation next season when a resurgent Bristol join the top flight. Francois Hougaard, the South Africa scrum-half, signed a new contract last month and, while Te’o has been linked with moves to Bath and Saracens, he said: “I’ve shown my commitment when I play and I will 100% be at Warriors next year. I’m in year two of a three-year contract and I’m going to do year three. Throughout my career I’ve seen out every contract that I’ve signed. That’s the way I like to do it.” Te’o has made only nine appearances for Worcester this season after an ankle injury suffered in October ruled him out until the eve of the Six Nations. He funded a six-week period of rehabilitation in Australia and played a part in all five of England’s matches before returning to Worcester, catching the eye in last weekend’s triumph over Newcastle. Sale have criticised Denny Solomona’s four-week ban after the full judgment of last week’s disciplinary hearing emerged on Monday. Solomona was found guilty of calling Worcester’s Jamie Shillcock a “fucking faggot”, despite the lack of video evidence. Solomona denies the allegation but will not play again this season unless Sale, who have decided not to appeal against the sanction, reach the play-offs. “The club believes Denny, he is a decent and honest person and maintains that no homophobic words were exchanged,” a club statement said. “The RFU disciplinary panel decided, on the balance of probability but with absolutely no other evidence, that Denny had said those words based on Jamie Shillcock’s reaction only.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/2018/apr/10/commonwealth-games-england-not-doing-so-good-largest-team-5m","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-10T17:06:00Z","webTitle":"Commonwealth Games: ‘Tiny island nation of England is not doing so good’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/apr/10/commonwealth-games-england-not-doing-so-good-largest-team-5m","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/apr/10/commonwealth-games-england-not-doing-so-good-largest-team-5m","fields":{"headline":"Commonwealth Games: ‘Tiny island nation of England is not doing so good’","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Team England ticked very few boxes at the Commonwealth Games on Tuesday, from the support officials who incomprehensibly botched the entry form for the cyclist Melissa Lowther to the athletes who became the latest high-profile names to fail to win medals. With 390 athletes and 198 support staff, the England party is the largest ever sent from home shores to a sporting event, comfortably eclipsing the Britain team which travelled to the 2016 Olympics. At a cost of £5m of taxpayers’ and national lottery money to cover a preparation camp in Brisbane, flights, kit and other expenses, it has not come cheap. As the established names, arguably those most likely to inspire the future generation, continued to fall by the wayside on Tuesday through injury or lack of performance, it became increasingly difficult to defend that sum. Tom Daley, one of a handful of household names here, announced he was withdrawing from the 10m platform individual event because of a hip injury. By nightfall on Australia’s east coast the weather had turned grisly, thrashing rain soaking spectators at the Carrara Stadium and English athletes producing performances to match. Andrew Pozzi, a world champion with every opportunity to win, finished joint sixth in the 110m hurdles final. Ahead of him were Cyprus’s Milan Trajkovic, whose only senior titles are a pair of golds at the Games of the Small States of Europe, and the Australian bronze medallist Nicholas Hough, ranked 43rd in the world last year. “It doesn’t take a brain surgeon to see I should have been fighting for the medals,” Pozzi said. “I was in good enough shape to win a medal. These opportunities don’t come up often, so I have to wait another four years.” In the hammer the Olympic bronze medallist Sophie Hitchon conceded she might need to fine-tune a new technique she is experimenting with after three foul throws left her in last place. The 26-year-old had entered the contest as favourite, expected at the very least to improve on the Commonwealth bronze medal she won at Glasgow in 2014. Her capitulation encapsulated a miserable Games for England’s most well-known performers. There have been notable exceptions, particularly at the Aquatics Centre, where Ben Proud defended his 50m freestyle title, but even he was making amends for disqualification in the 50m butterfly, an event in which he was also reigning champion, earlier in the week. “When I lost the opportunity to retain my 50m fly title I really was clinging on to what I had left,” Proud said after winning in 21.35sec, half a second ahead of South Africa’s Bradley Tandy and Cameron McEvoy of Australia. Despite a slew of medals in the pool and at the gymnastics, the gap to the home nation in the overall standings is growing. With 130 medals, including 50 golds, Australia are not going to be caught by England. “The tiny island nation of England are not doing so good,” cackled a DJ on a local radio station. The Brownlee brothers had set the tone in the triathlon on the opening morning of competition. Alistair, a double Olympic champion, trailed home in 10th while Jonny, who has claimed silver and bronze medals behind his sibling, was seventh. Both cited injury but neither seemed particularly cut by the defeat. Max Whitlock is Olympic champion on the floor but could finish only seventh, beaten by the Cypriot Marios Georgiou, a part-time dancer who goes by the name “street boy killer”. To his credit Whitlock fronted up after his defeat and said he was still getting used to a new routine but it did call into question how important the Commonwealth Games is to athletes who know there are bigger tests round the corner. The curse of the champions continued as Adam Peaty, fresh from winning the 100m breaststroke, was also defeated for the first time in four years in the 50m breaststroke at a Games which is showing little regard for bookmakers’ odds. Peaty reasoned that swimmers typically peak in the summer months, not in April when they would usually be in heavy training. The chef de mission, Sarah Winckless, might have been tempted to implore the team’s big names to raise their game but she is occupying shaky ground when it comes to performance. The team’s leader was forced to apologise to the 21-year-old Lowther after she was unable to compete in the cycling because an official failed to tick a box on an entry form for the time trial. The extraordinary administrative error was not spotted until it was too late, despite “seven or eight” layers of checks when the mistake could have been identified. Despite the reputation of the Commonwealth Games as the “friendly games”, the organisers refused to bend the rules to allow her to race. It is understood she is devastated and her family, who were hoping to watch her on the TV from their home in Wakefield, are furious. Winckless, a world champion rower in 2005 and 2006, offered a personal apology to Lowther. “No athlete should suffer because of an administrative error by my group,” she said. “As soon as we knew of the error we did everything to rectify it and it went to the Commonwealth Games Federation re-allocation committee – unfortunately they were not minded to add her into the draw.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"us-news/2018/apr/10/top-republicans-fear-angry-trump-will-fire-mueller-on-course-of-destruction","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-10T19:25:30Z","webTitle":"Trump poised for clash with justice department amid fears he'll fire Mueller","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/apr/10/top-republicans-fear-angry-trump-will-fire-mueller-on-course-of-destruction","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/apr/10/top-republicans-fear-angry-trump-will-fire-mueller-on-course-of-destruction","fields":{"headline":"Trump poised for clash with justice department amid fears he'll fire Mueller","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"With fellow Republicans urging restraint, Donald Trump remained on a collision course with his own justice department on Tuesday, a day after federal agents raided the office of his personal lawyer and longtime lieutenant, Michael Cohen. The raid, which Trump appeared to take as an unprecedented threat against his inner circle, stoked concerns anew that the president would move to dismiss Robert Mueller, the special counsel investigating Russian election interference and alleged collusion between the Trump campaign and Moscow. “He certainly believes he has the power to do so,” the White House press secretary, Sarah Sanders, told reporters at the White House on Tuesday, adding: “The president has been clear that it’s gone too far.” Mueller’s team provided information to prosecutors in New York that in part prompted them to move against Cohen, a lawyer for Cohen said. Trump woke up on Tuesday with a full-throated condemnation of the Cohen raid, tweeting: “Attorney–client privilege is dead!” and complaining of “A TOTAL WITCH HUNT!!!” But a growing chorus of concern that Trump would dismiss Mueller, which would probably require the dismantling of an entire tier of justice department leadership and thereby unleash a crisis of unknown proportions, was noticeably joined on Tuesday by top elected Republicans. “It’s still my view that Mueller should be allowed to finish his job,” Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell told the Guardian, on Capitol Hill. “I think that’s the view of most people in Congress. And it remains my view that I don’t think he’s going to be removed from this office. He shouldn’t be removed from the office. He should be allowed to finish his job.” The Iowa senator Charles Grassley told Fox Business Network: “It would be suicide for the president to want to talk about firing Mueller. The less the president said on this whole thing, the better off he would be.” With fallout from the Cohen raid gaining pace, multiple crises blossomed. Trump canceled a trip to Peru and the Summit of the Americas, ostensibly in deference to escalating tensions over the Syria chemical weapons attack. Then his respected homeland security adviser, Tom Bossert, followed the national security council spokesman Michael Anton in resigning, after a reported clash with the controversial new national security adviser, John Bolton. The fired FBI director James Comey, meanwhile, is preparing to publish a book next week, potentially publicizing some of the most sensitive moments of the Trump-Russia investigation and eviscerating the president’s character. In an Oval Office appearance with the emir of Qatar, Trump ignored shouted questions about Mueller and the deputy attorney general, Rod Rosenstein, who reportedly approved the raid on Cohen’s office. But the raid seemed to touch Trump more personally than any other pressure bearing down on the White House. His tweet about “attorney–client privilege” was in response to reports FBI agents seized documents including his correspondence with Cohen. Federal prosecutors overseeing the raid would have been careful to act in accordance with directions in the US attorneys’ manual for seizing documents from legal offices, former prosecutors said. For more than a decade, Cohen has worked as a fixer, dealmaker and lawyer for Trump, handling matters ranging from prospective real estate deals in Russia to a $130,000 payment shortly before the 2016 election to the pornographic film actor Stormy Daniels. Daniels was preparing at the time to go public with the story of a relationship with Trump, which the president and Cohen have sought to discredit. Documents relating to the Daniels payment were among the materials seized from Cohen’s office, according to multiple reports. Investigators may be examining whether payments to Daniels and another woman who claims to have had a sexual relationship with Trump, the former Playboy model Karen McDougal, violated campaign finance laws. Cohen has said he personally “facilitated” the payment to Daniels and denied the payment was related to the 2016 presidential campaign. At the White House briefing, Sanders was asked if Cohen still worked for Trump. “I’m not sure,” she said. “I’d refer you to Michael Cohen on that.” FBI agents in July 2017 raided the home of the former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort. Investigators have also questioned Donald Trump Jr and Jared Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law. In a conspiratorial diatribe delivered on Monday night at the White House, Trump declared the Cohen raid “an attack on our country in a true sense” and replied to a question about firing Mueller. “Many people have said, ‘You should fire him’,” said the president, who has long entertained the idea and reportedly only backed down from carrying it out last summer when the White House counsel threatened to resign. “Again, they found nothing. “One of the things they said: ‘I fired Comey.’ Well, I turned out to do the right thing, because if you look at all of the things that he’s done and the lies, and you look at what’s gone on at the FBI with the insurance policy and all of the things that happened – turned out I did the right thing.” Mueller’s investigation has produced indictments of or pleas from 19 individuals, as well as three companies based in Russia. Former national security adviser Michael Flynn, foreign policy adviser George Papadopoulos and Manafort deputy Rick Gates have entered guilty pleas. Manafort has pleaded not guilty to financial charges. The Cohen raid would have required the assent of top officials in the southern district of New York, according to analysts, as well as the assessment of a federal judge that sufficient evidence had been collected to justify a home invasion. The former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee, Sarah Sanders’ father, nevertheless branded the raid a “coup d’état”. Thom Tillis, a Republican senator from North Carolina who has co-authored legislation to protect Mueller, echoed Grassley’s warning against firing the special counsel. He suggested to CNN, however, that Trump’s outburst was business as usual. “Thematically,” Tillis said, “he has said similar things before.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/apr/12/clean-energy-financier-invests-150m-in-infrastructure-fund-to-lower-emissions","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-11T18:00:10Z","webTitle":"Clean energy financier invests $150m in infrastructure fund to lower emissions","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/apr/12/clean-energy-financier-invests-150m-in-infrastructure-fund-to-lower-emissions","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/apr/12/clean-energy-financier-invests-150m-in-infrastructure-fund-to-lower-emissions","fields":{"headline":"Clean energy financier invests $150m in infrastructure fund to lower emissions","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The Clean Energy Finance Corporation is investing $150m in Australia’s largest infrastructure fund to drive emissions reduction across some of Australia’s biggest airports, ports and electricity infrastructure assets. It is the first time the CEFC has invested in an infrastructure fund, and it is using the investment to target emissions reduction at Melbourne and Brisbane airports, Sydney’s Port Botany, the Port of Brisbane and Ausgrid. It estimates that a 5% improvement in emissions from those assets would abate almost 69,000 tonnes of CO2 equivalent annually, equivalent to removing 14,775 cars from the road each year, or providing electricity to roughly 7,450 homes a year. Infrastructure-related emissions account for more than half of Australia’s total greenhouse gas emissions, mainly from the electricity sector (35%) and the transport sector (18%), according to the National Greenhouse Gas Inventory. The CEFC is a specialist clean energy financier charged with increasing the flow of finance into renewable energy, energy efficiency and low-emissions technologies. Ian Learmonth, the CEFC chief executive, said the $150m investment in IFM Investors’ managed IFM Australian Infrastructure Fund – a $12bn fund – would deliver significant emissions reductions in the infrastructure assets that would benefit the communities they serve and superannuation member returns. “Infrastructure assets are central to our economic and social wellbeing,” he said in a statement. “With this investment the CEFC will work with IFM Investors in targeting comprehensive and sustained improvements to the carbon footprint of some of our most important infrastructure assets.” IFM Investors is owned by 27 of Australia’s industry super funds and invests on behalf of 6 million Australians and roughly 15 million pension fund members globally. It was started 20 years ago and now has $100bn under management. Kyle Mangini, IFM Investors’ global head of infrastructure, said the changes would be driven through the boardrooms of the companies. “We’re represented on the boards, so we’ll propose to the board and the other investors the various programs that might be implemented across each one of the assets,” he said. “They’re going to need to work on a cost-and-return basis, but it will be done through the typical governance process. We’ll be ensuring there’s a consistent and appropriate level of focus on [emissions reduction].” CEFC’s infrastructure lead, Julia Hinwood, said emissions reductions initiatives that would be pursued could include installing on-site solar panels and battery storage solutions, and converting to electric vehicles. “They are also likely to involve using smart management systems, which monitor asset performance and assist with reducing energy consumption and optimising logistics and supply chains,” she said. Mangini said IFM Investors had set emissions targets for the assets it invested in, and it hoped to be publicly reporting the level of emissions from each of the assets in its Australian portfolio within a year. “We’d already undertaken a baseline study of all of our assets across the portfolio,” he said. “We will report on a new website the emissions from each of the assets in our Australian portfolio, the targets we’re setting, the progress we’ve made against those targets, with the objective to hold ourselves accountable in a very transparent manner.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/live/2018/apr/11/mark-zuckerberg-testimony-live-updates-house-congress-cambridge-analytica","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-11T19:37:14Z","webTitle":"Mark Zuckerberg faces tough questions in two-day congressional testimony – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/live/2018/apr/11/mark-zuckerberg-testimony-live-updates-house-congress-cambridge-analytica","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/live/2018/apr/11/mark-zuckerberg-testimony-live-updates-house-congress-cambridge-analytica","fields":{"headline":"Mark Zuckerberg faces tough questions in two-day congressional testimony – as it happened","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Zuckerberg got rougher treatment from the House of Representatives than he did from the Senate. While yesterday Zuckerberg was largely able to stick to his script, some of the representatives today pressed hard for information on Facebook’s extensive tracking of users across the internet. Zuckerberg continued his strategy of deflecting questions and downplaying what Facebook does, but his (hopefully? presumably?) feigned ignorance of the core technology that made Facebook into the business it is simply doesn’t hold water. The overall impression I got was that, for all Zuck’s assurances that targeted advertising is “aligned” with Facebook’s “social mission”, the company has no interest in the general public actually knowing and understanding the extent of its ability to track users and amass data profiles of them. Almost every time he mentioned the “control” Facebook gives users over their content, he was avoiding answering a question about information that Facebook collects about users without their knowledge. But don’t just take my word for it. Here is my colleague Alex Hern’s analysis of the hearing. And we’re done! Thanks for joining us for our live coverage of Zuckerberg’s two days of testimony. Cramer says that he has more choice in internet service providers in rural North Dakota than he does for social networking. Zuck: The content reviewers we have aren’t actually in Silicon Valley for the most part. Kevin Cramer, a Republican from North Dakota, is the final representative to speak. Cramer says he was dissatisfied with answers on opioid ads: How quickly could you take down an illegal drug site if there was a million dollar fine attached? Zuck says he’s committed to being more pro-active. Cramer suggests that Facebook build a new headquarters in North Dakota, where the talent pool won’t be so tainted by the Bay Area’s liberal bias. Duncan says that the two biggest issues are privacy and censorship. “Why not have a standard for free speech that is simply a mirror of the first amendment?” he asks. Zuck says terrorist speech could be protected by the first amendment, and that we don’t want it to spread on the internet. Our second to last questioner is Jeff Duncan, a Republican from South Carolina, who starts off by noting that Facebook is invaluable to him. Buddy Carter, a Republican from Georgia, is asking Zuck what he knows about opioid addictions. After a few minutes on that, he brings up trafficking of ivory in private groups and piracy of movies. Carter gets to his point which is: Hate speech is difficult to figure out, but opioids, ivory trafficking, and movie piracy are not. Ryan Costello, a Republican from Pennsylvania: What pieces of GDPR would be properly placed in American jurisprudence? Should we have right to erasure? Zuck says he agrees with controls, and raises concern about sensitive tech like facial recognition. Costello: Should you be able to deploy AI for facial recognition for a non-Facebook user? Zuck: That’s a good question. Costello: Are you ever a publisher? Zuck: If we commission and fund it, yes. Otherwise, no. Debbie Dingell, a Democrat from Michigan, hits Zuck hard on his apparent ignorance of his company’s basic functions: “As CEO you didn’t know some key facts. You didn’t know about key court cases regarding privacy and your company. You didn’t know that the FTC doesn’t have fining. You didn’t know what a shadow profile is. You don’t know how many apps you need to audit. You don’t know what other companies were sold the Kogan data, even though you were asked that yesterday. You don’t even know how many kinds of information you’re logging.” Dingell is the first to raise Facebook Pixel, another way that Facebook can track browsers across the internet. Dingell asks how many “like” buttons exist in the wilds of the internet? Zuck says he doesn’t know. Dingell asks how many chunks of Pixel code are out there. Zuck doesn’t know. She asks for a 72 hour response. Mimi Walters, a Republican from California, is showing screenshots of Facebook’s privacy settings for apps and photos. She asks, which control governs? Is it the app permissions? Or the user’s decisions? Zuck explains the difference between app permissions and in-line controls on content. Walters suggests this is difficult to understand, and asks why the controls aren’t all in the same place. Zuck says Facebook both keeps the controls in settings and also shows them to people when they are relevant. Tim Walberg, a Republican from Michigan, asks who the bad actors that inspired Facebook to cut down on API permissions actually were. Zuck says developers who were taking information that wasn’t relevant to their apps. Walberg: Can Facebook guarantee that there will be no bad actors on apps on its platform? Zuck: This is an arms race. Guarantees are difficult. Walberg: Can you assure me that ads and content are not being denied based on specific views? Zuck: Yes, politically. When it comes to “normal political speech”, but not for things like terrorism. If nothing else, Facebook and Mark Zuckerberg have the full support of Representative Chris Collins. Chris Collins, a Republican from New York, says that it’s very good that we now all know that Facebook doesn’t sell data. Somewhere, a Facebook PR staffer is cracking open a bottle of champagne. Hudson: What’s the difference between hate speech and speech we don’t like? Zuck: It’s complicated. This is an area where society is shifting. Richard Hudson, a Republican from North Carolina, mentions that he represents many members of the military from Fort Bragg and raises concerns about the national security threat of leaking information about military. Scott Peters, a Democrat from California, asks whether it would make sense for Congress to define privacy in law. Zuck: It’s an interesting question. Peters notes that privacy isn’t a “bottom line issue” for shareholders. “Privacy doesn’t drive profits, and it may interfere with profits.” He asks whether it would help if there were real financial disincentives to violating privacy. Zuck rejects the premise that privacy and profit aren’t necessarily opposed. Peters: What do Europeans get right and wrong about privacy? Zuck: GDPR in general is going to be a very positive step for the internet. Zuck says that Facebook also offers many controls, and says the requirement for more make sense. Peters: What about things they got wrong? Zuck: I need to think about that more. Markwayne Mullin, a Republican from Okalahoma, is giving Zuckerberg the chance to explain that Facebook has settings and controls that people can use. Raul Ruiz, a Democrat from California, is talking about the limitations of the FTC, and suggesting some kind of entity that oversee data privacy, such as a “Digital Consumer Protection Agency”. Zuck repeats his line that he’s not necessarily against regulation, which he’s probably said at least a dozen times over the past two days. Zuckerberg corrects the record on Facebook’s tracking of browser history. He says that the company does temporarily store web logs, but then “converts” that information into “ad interests”, which can be found in the data download. This is referring back to the question of why browser data wasn’t included when users download their data. And we’re back! Susan Brooks, a Republican from Indiana, is up first, and she wants to talk about the recruitment of young people to join terrorist groups on Facebook and other internet platforms. Brooks: You’ve talked about relying on content being reported, but what if no one reports? Zuck: 99% of Isis and Al Qaeda information is flagged by tools before it needs to be flagged. Brooks says that terrorist content still gets out there wants more detail. Zuck: This is a combination of tech and people. He says the team focusing on terrorism has 200 people. We’re taking a quick break! Be back in about 10 minutes. Carndenas brings up legal threats to The Guardian prior to publication. Zuck says that it was a concern over a factual inaccuracy. Cardenas: You only apologized after they published, eh? Zuck: Yes. Tony Cardenas, a Democrat from California, just mentioned that the CEO of Cambridge Analytica stepped down today. Does that solve the problem? Zuck: No. Cardenas: Did you buy data? Zuck: We stopped. Cardenas: But you did it to build your company. Zuck: It was industry standard. Cardenas: But you did it. Zuck: Yes. Earlier in the hearing, Zuckerberg made a surprising statement suggesting that Facebook was looking into “whether there’s something bad going on at Cambridge University overall that will require stronger action.” A spokesman for Cambridge responds: “We would be surprised if Mr Zuckerberg was only now aware of research at the University of Cambridge looking at what an individual’s Facebook data says about them. Our researchers have been publishing such research since 2013 in major peer-reviewed scientific journals, and these studies have been reported widely in international media. These have included one study in 2015 led by Dr Aleksandr Spectre (Kogan) and co-authored by two Facebook employees. “We wrote to Facebook on 21 March to ask it to provide evidence to support its allegations about Dr Kogan. We have yet to receive a response.” Joe Kennedy, a Democrat from Massachusetts: Does Facebook include deleted data in what is available for advertisers to target? Zuck: No. Kennedy: Can advertisers get access to metadata, such as tracking on other websites? Zuck: I don’t understand the question. Kennedy: Do advertisers get access to information that the user doesn’t necessarily know is being collected? There’s information that is generated that people don’t realize they are generating. Zuck: The targeting options are generally based on things that people choose to share. But Facebook also does its own work to decide who to show ads to, based on our metadata, but that’s different from letting advertisers use it. Kennedy: The rub is that I don’t think this works with the idea that users “own” their data. Larry Buschon, a Republican from Indiana, is now bringing up the concern about Facebook listening to people’s conversations. He mentions that he had a conversation with his mother about a deceased relative, and later that night, Facebook showed her a memorial video of the relative. He asks whether Facebook is contracting with someone else to listen in. Zuck again says that Facebook is not listening to audio. Buchshon says it’s pretty clear to him that someone is listening. He asks whether Facebook executives bring their phones into confidential meetings. Zuck says they do, and says that often these surprising ad experiences are a coincidence or a result of other online activity. Here’s a good explanation of how Facebook knows so much about you without necessarily listening to you from the Wall Street Journal. Schrader is asking again about being tracked while logged out, and Zuck gives the same basic answer that it’s for “security”. Schrader: Aren’t you complicit in the sale of data by third-parties? Zuck: Well we prohibit that. Schrader: But all I’ve heard so far is that you complain, not that there’s any enforcement. Zuck: Yeah, we’re going to be more proactive now. Kurt Schrader, a Democrat from Oregon, wants to make sure that Facebook’s audit team doesn’t destroy evidence if it finds still-existing versions of the Kogan/CA data. Zuck says he doesn’t think they’ve deleted anything yet, and notes that the Facebook auditors stood down to let the UK ICO conduct its investigation first. Long: Congress does nothing, or it overreacts. We’re getting ready to overreact. Billy Long, a Republican from Missouri: “If we invited everyone that has read your terms of service, we could probably fit them at that table.” Long also says that his constituents aren’t upset about the Cambridge Analytica. Then he asks, What is FaceMash and does it still exist? Zuckerberg: It was a prank website, I took it down. He mentions there was a movie about this, but that the movie was of “unclear truth”. He also again invokes the “dorm room” origins of FaceMash, which in this case I guess is meant to make us understand that nothing that came out of Zuck’s dorm room is that important. David Loebsack, a Democrat from Iowa, asks if it would be possible for Facebook to exist if it didn’t collect and sell data. Zuck quibbles with “selling data” but basically says no, we wouldn’t exist if we weren’t collecting information that people share with us. Bill Johnson, a Republican from Ohio: Often times technology folks spend all their time focusing on what they can do, instead of what they should do. This is the Jurassic Park question. Here’s the pertinent scene. Clarke: When Mr Kogan sold Facebook data, did he violate Facebook’s policies? Zuck: Yes Clarke: When the Obama app collected data, did they violate Facebook’s policies? Zuck: No Yvette Clarke, a Democrat from New York, starts by mentioning a new technology accountability caucus in Congress, then mentions the way that racism was exploited in the Russian election ads. She asks whether the lack of diversity and “lack of culturally competent personal in your C-suite” contributed to Facebook’s inability to recognize this kind of content. Zuck says that the issue wasn’t a lack of diversity, but that they were too slow to recognize the influence operation. Gus Bilirakis, a Republican from Florida, returns to opioid advertisements. Zuck says that FB will take down ads that are flagged for them. Talks about building AI tools that can do this automatically at some point in the future. It’s worth noting that a) Facebook cannot solve the opioid crisis and b) artificial intelligence is not magic, is often not even that intelligent and will not cure all ills on Facebook. Tonko: What liability should Facebook have? Do you bear the liability for the misuse of people’s data? Zuck: We take responsibility. Tonko: What about liability though? Zuck: Non-sequitur about changes to platform API permissions made in 2015. Paul Tonko, a Democrat from New York, wants to talk more about Facebook tracking users across the internet and why browser data isn’t in the data download. Zuck again says that if it’s not in the data download, Facebook doesn’t have it. Here’s Alex Hern on the back and forth over “shadow profiles”: Lujan’s line of questioning was important, and Zuckerberg was not candid. But the next questioner, Morgan Griffith, is giving Zuck a chance to talk about expanding broadband access to rural areas. Lujan: How many data points does Facebook have on each user? Zuck: Not sure. Lujan: “You’re collecting data about people who are not even on Facebook... People who don’t even have an account have to sign up for an account to get their data.” Ben Lujan, a Democrat from New Mexico, is telling Zuck that the feature that Facebook said last week that it was turning off because it was allowing “malicious actors” to scrape personal data was actually brought to Facebook’s attention in 2013, and again in 2015. Kinzinger is now bringing up fake accounts that use his picture to “extort people for money”. Zuck: Long term the solution is to build more AI tools that can recognize patterns. Adam Kinzinger, a Republican from Illinois, asks what kind of data Facebook shares with the Russian government or intelligence agencies. Zuckerberg: “In general we are not in the business of providing a lot of data to the Russian government.” Facebook puts out a transparency report each year with details on government requests for information around the world. Zuck notes that Facebook doesn’t store any data inside Russia – a point of contention with the Russian government which has threatened to block internet companies that don’t store data locally. Welch: Do you believe consumers have a right to correct or delete personal data that companies have? Zuck: That would be an interesting debate. Peter Welch, the Democrat from Vermont: This was foreseeable and inevitable and we, Congress, did nothing about it. David McKinley, a Republican from West Virginia, is bringing up online sales of opioids. “Opioids are still available on your site, without a prescription.” McKinley shows screenshots of postings offering opioids for sale. Zuck: Let me just speak to this for a second. McKinley: No. Your platform is still being used to circumvent the law and allow people to buy highly addictive drugs without a prescription. Facebook is enabling illegal activity and in so doing you are hurting people. Zuck: There are a number of ways that we need to do a better job of content review. McKinley: You’re still allowing people to get this scourge that is ravaging this country. When are you going to take down these posts that are done with illegal digital pharmacies. Zuck: When people report the post we will taken them down. McKinley: What about those 20,000 people you’re hiring? Where is your accountability in this? Zuck: We need to build better AI tools. Jerry McErney, a Democrat from Stockton, is asking why browsing history is not included in the Facebook data download. Zuck says Facebook doesn’t have browsing history, but he is carefully caging his response within the confines of “your content”. McErney says he wants to follow up on this. If you want to learn more about the backstory to Representatie Castor’s line of questioning on the information Facebook gathers and uses to build a profile of you that, here’s a great report by Gizmodo’s Kasmir Hill, “How Facebook Figures Out Everyone You’ve Ever Met.” John Sarbanes, a Democrat from Maryland: Is it true the Facebook offered dedicated embeds to both campaigns? Zuck: We offer sales support. Sarbanes: I reject your quibbling with my language. I want copies of the exact agreement and offers you made to both campaigns. Sarbanes is speculating that Facebook embeds with the campaigns granted special approval rights to allow them to get approval for 90x more ads than Clinton did. Zuck says that didn’t happen. The Trump campaign did run many more types of advertisements, but that has generally been assumed to be down to a difference in campaign strategy. Sarbanes: The question is are we the people going to regulate our political discourse or are you Mark Zuckerberg going to do it? Zuckerberg admits to Brett Guthrie that most people don’t use their privacy controls. He says this is probably because they like getting “relevant” ads. That’s one hypothesis, but we’ve also talked extensively over the past two days about how confusing it is to try to navigate these labyrinthine controls. Zuckerberg’s unwillingness to admit exactly what Facebook does to collect data gives the lie to his stated belief in the business model’s “alignment” with Facebook’s “social mission”. If you’re so ashamed of what you’re doing, maybe you should stop? Castor: “You are collecting personal information on people who don’t even have accounts, yes or no.” Zuck: mumbles vaguely Castor: Yes you are. You’re collecting data on what people are purchasing, yes? Zuck: If they share it with us. Castor: You’ve patented applications that can do this. Zuck: mumbles a little Castor: You’re collecting medical data, yes? Zuck: Yes some. Castor: What about collecting data on users physical location? Zuck: Let’s talk about “control”. Castor: Nope. Zuck: People choose to share data. Castor: Yeah, maybe that’s the primary way you get data, but not the only way. You buy data from data brokers right? Zuck: We announced two weeks ago we would end that relationship. Castor: I don’t believe the controls you have are a substitute for fundamental privacy protections. [drops mic] Kathy Castor: “I think a devil’s bargain has been struck. Americans do not like to be manipulated. We don’t like to be spied on.... Facebook has now evolved to a place where you are tracking everyone.” Zuck says that Facebook was trying to balance “two equities” - data portability and data protection. “We didn’t get that right.” Lance: Do you believe that the Kogan app harvest violated the FTC consent decree? Zuck: No, but we take a “broader view”. Zuck says again that Kogan selling the data was a violation of his agreement with Facebook. Lance says he believes it was a violation of the consent decree. Leonard Lance, a Republican from New Jersey, is starting us up again by talking about taking deep “offense” with censorship of conservative speech, though he says that he would care about censoring liberal speech too. Zuck says that Facebook makes censorship mistakes against liberals too! Facebook is an equal opportunity mistake-maker. And we’re back! Looks like Zuckerberg took his notes with him when he left the room this time. Fool me once. Here’s my colleague Alex Hern with a brief tweet storm on how disingenuous Zuckerberg’s statements about “owning” your data are. Zuck: We use the data that people put into the system in order to make them more relevant. Whenever the going gets tough, Zuck tends to fall back on a couple of lines: You have complete control over your data; You don’t have to share anything with us. He is certainly having a rougher go of it today, as the interlocutors have less patience for his talking points and diversions. We’re taking a five minute recess. Doris Matsui: To me if you own something, you ought to be able to control how it is used. Matsui talks about the difference between content users share and assumptions algorithms have made about those users – the “virtual self” that Blackburn described. Zuck: I believe people own their content. If I take a photo of you and share it with you, who owns the data? Zuck says he would take the position that it’s “our” photo. Matsui says: Ok but what about data brokers? Matsui: “We might own our own data, but once it’s used in advertising we lose over control of it, isn’t that right?” Zuck: I disagree because we don’t sell the data. Gregg Harper, Republican from Mississippi: If Cambridge Analytica had developed the app themselves, they would have had access to the same data, correct? Zuck: Yes. Harper asks about the Obama 2012 app. Zuck says that the big difference is that people signed into Kogan’s app and then he turned around and sold the data in violation of Facebook’s terms. It is certainly different for people to log into an explicitly political app (Obama 2012) and had that data used for politics, than it is for people to log into a fun psychology app and have that used for politics. But important questions have been raised about whether Zuckerberg’s line that what Kogan did was actually a violation of Facebook’s terms. Butterfield: I was looking at your website, and your leadership team does not reflect America. He notes the five top people are all white. Zuck: We have a broader leadership than just five people Butterfield: Not on your website! Butterfield asks for a committment to add an African American person to the top leadership tier? Zuck demurs. Butterfield asks for data on retention of black employees. Zuck says he’ll talk to his team. GK Butterfield, Democrat from North Carolina, brings up Facebook and tech’s lack of diversity, noting that he talks about this with Sheryl Sandberg. “Will you commit to personally convene a meeting of CEOs in your sectors to develop a strategy to increase racial diversity in your industry?” Zuck: That’s a good idea we’ll follow up on. Cathy McMorris Rodgers is talking about censorship of religious and conservative publishers on Facebook. She quotes Facebook’s head of news partnerships. Zuckerberg says that he doesn’t know who that person is. It’s Campbell Brown. Schakowsky wants to know whether Facebook’s adoption of GDPR will include extending the “rights” that European gets in addition to the “controls”. Zuck doesn’t really answer. She ends with an unanswered question: “Who is going to protect us from Facebook?” Schakowsky: How many other companies did Kogan sell the data to? And what are their names? Zuck says he’ll follow up, and that there are “a handful” of companies who got it. Yesterday he named Eunoia as one of them. Jan Schakowsky, a Democrat from Illinois, is reading a list of Zuckerberg’s many, many apologies, dating back to his pre-Facebook Harvard days. Schakowsky: “This is proof to me that self-regulation simply does not work.” Robert Latta, Republican from Ohio: Why didn’t the audits that you had to submit under the FTC consent decree find these problems? Zuck: I think the broader question here is that we’ve had the FTC consent decree but we have a broader view of our responsibility. Zuck says he doesn’t believe Kogan’s actions violated the consent decree, but was a breach of trust. Zuckerberg’s answers on questions about the FTC consent decree are basically incoherent. Doyle is now reading parts of the consent decree, including details which Zuckerberg says he’s not fully familiar with. Doyle is excoriating on Zuckerberg’s flouting his own standards and users’ trust. Zuck pulls out his line for an “attack”: “I respectfully disagree.” Mike Doyle, a Democrat from Pennsylvania, is the first person I’ve heard so far to mention The Guardian’s reporting! His point is: Do you normally learn about abuses from the press? It seems as though you turned a blind eye. Zuck: I disagree with that assessment... Doyle: It seems like you were more concerned with attracting developers than you were with protecting users. Steve Scalise, the majority whip: You said that there is data mining when a user is logged off for security purposes. Is that data also used for the business model? Zuck: I believe the ad data is separate from the security data, but he’s not sure. Scalise: Are the people who made a mistake with Diamond and Silk going to be punished? Zuck says he’ll follow up. Now Scalise is mentioning a study that says news feed has conservative bias. Who designs the algorithm, he asks? Was there a directive to put in a bias? Zuck: There is no directive in any of the changes we make to have bias. Scalise says: Please look and see if there is actually bias though. Diana DeGette, a Democrat from Colorado, is talking through the fact that Facebook is hugely valuable, and that its business hasn’t really suffered from the current controversy. Now she’s going through various class-action lawsuits against Facebook that didn’t result in users getting any money. She is pushing him hard on not knowing the details of these issues, such as whether or not there was any financial penalty for the FTC consent decree (there wasn’t). Her point, which she’s getting to now, is that there’s no financial hazard for Facebook to continue in bad behavior. Blackburn: Do you subjectively change your algorithms to prioritize or censor speech? Zuck: We don’t think of it as censorship. We remove terrorist content. Blackburn: Diamond and Silk are not terrorists. The hearing today is quite a bit punchier than yesterday’s. These representatives have much less patience for Zuck’s talking points and stalling. Blackburn calls Zuckerberg out for filibustering her questions. Marsha Blackburn: Your cozy community is starting to look like the Truman Show... Who owns the “virtual you”? Who owns your presence online? Is it you or is them? Zuck: I believer everyone owns their own content online. Gene Green: If I download my Facebook data, is there other stuff that you guys still have, like browser activity or inferences Facebook draws about people? Zuckerberg: I believe that all of your information is in that file. Gene Green, a Democract from Texas, is asking about GDPR. Zuck says everyone will have the same privacy controls. Burgess asks whether Facebook is sharing its internal audits with the FTC. Zuck appears to short out for a moment, then says he doesn’t totally understand the question. Asked about third-party app permissions, Zuck again brings up in-line controls to limit the audience of an individual post. This is not only a non-sequitur, it is (as I’ve been screaming inside my head all morning) a willful obfuscation of what actually happens on Facebook. Michael Burgess, a Republican from Texas: Would the average consumer be able to evaluate the terms and conditions they see on third-party app permissions? Zuck: “I think if someone wanted to know they could.” Engel: Do you adjust your algorithms to prevent people interested in violence from other likeminded people? Zuck says yes, that’s something we need to do, which doesn’t necessarily sound like it’s something that they already do. Here’s an article I wrote last year about how extremists come together through Facebook groups. Eliot Engel: You said Facebook was deceived by Kogan. Does Facebook plan to sue Kogan, Cambridge University, or Cambridge Analytica? Zuckerberg: It’s something we’re looking into. We already took action by banning him from the platform. Zuck says they need to understand whether “something bad” is going on at Cambridge University, since they apparently just learned about the Psychometrics Center, whose work was the inspiration for Kogan’s data scrape. Shimkus is asking for clarification on tracking when users are logged off, and tracking across devices. Zuck: We track certain information for security reasons and for ads reasons. “Just because someone chose to make something public doesn’t mean that it’s good for someone to aggregate it.” Zuck is conceding that the ad network is collecting information across other websites, which he notes that Google does as well. John Shimkus: Who is conducting the audit? Zuck: We’re starting with an internal investigation, will move on to third-party auditors later. Eshoo is trying unsuccessfully to get Zuckerberg to deviate from his memorized talking points about the Kogan/CA breach. He simply will not answer her questions as they are posed. Anna Eshoo, a Democrat from California, is asking a series of questions from her constituents. Do you think you have a moral obligation to run a platform that protects democracy? Zuck: Yes. Was your personal data included in the CA breach? Zuck: Yes. Are you willing to change your business model in the interest of protecting individual privacy? Zuck: I’m not sure what that means. Upton is now bringing up an advertisement that a local Michigan politician tried to run on Facebook but that was rejected. The ad language sounds like boilerplate Republican positions. Zuck says he doesn’t know what happened there. Fred Upton, a Republican from Michigan, is asking whether it’s possible to craft regulation that won’t stifle startups. Zuck: I think it is inevitable that there will need to be some regulation, but you have to be careful about what it is. Bobby Rush: Why is the onus on the user to opt in to privacy? Zuckerberg is not going to move off his line that users can limit the audience of their posts. Rush moves on to Facebook’s reported violations of civil rights law forbidding discriminatory advertising. Bobby Rush: You are truncating the basic rights of the American promise of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness by the wholesale invasion and manipulation of their right to privacy. What is the difference between Facebook’s methodology and the methodology of American political pariah J Edgar Hoover? Zuck: On Facebook, you have control over your information. The content you share, you put there. Says that no other surveillance operation gives you the ability to opt out. Barton: Is there any reason why we should have rules of no data sharing for Facebook users under 18? Zuck: We have a number of measures in place to protect minors... The reality that we see is that teens often do want to share their opinions publicly. Zuck is again talking about the ability to limit the audience of shared content, not about the targeted advertising to children based on data Facebook gathers about them. Joe Barton is asking why Diamond and Silk were censored on Facebook. Zuck says it was a mistake. Here’s a Washington Post article about the conservative sisters. Pallone asks if Facebook limits the type of data it collects and uses. Zuck says they do, but Pallone says he doesn’t see how. Pallone: Is Facebook changing user default settings? Zuck says yes, that they’ve changed the way that developers can get access to data, which is not the question. Pallone: Will you change all user default settings to minimize to the greatest extent possible all the user data? Yes or no. Zuck says that he won’t give a one word answer. Scratch that: Zuckerberg is explaining that Facebook doesn’t sell data despite Walden’s statement that he understands that fact. Walden is foreclosing Zuck’s canned response that Facebook doesn’t technically sell data, arguing that it does monetize it, and stating that data might be the only thing of true value that Facebook does have. Walden: You can send money on Facebook. Are you a financial company? Zuck: Nah. Walden notes that Facebook is increasingly broadcasting original television content: Is Facebook a media company? Zuckerberg: I consider us to be a technology company. Zuckerberg is still saying that Kogan and Cambridge Analytica misused or improperly obtained data, despite Senator Blumenthal’s release of the terms of service yesterday, which appeared to show that he did have permission to share, sell, and transfer the data. Zuckerberg is now making his opening statement. If this sounds familiar, it’s because he’s reading the same words he read yesterday, in his opening statement at the Senate hearing. Pallone: “We need comprehensive privacy and data protection legislation.” Frank Pallone, the ranking Democrat, is now making his opening statement, noting that Facebook is ubiquitous, and most of us are locked in. “For all the good it brings, Facebook can be a weapon for groups like Russia and Cambridge Analytica,” he says. Walden is already showing a stronger grasp of the distinction between data users consciously share and data Facebook collects than many of the senators had yesterday. Zuckerberg is seated and we’re getting started. Commitee chairman Greg Walden is kicking us off with an opening statement. “While Facebook has surely grown, I worry it has not matured.” While we are waiting for today’s hearing to get underway, let’s look back at a fun little parable of privacy from yesterday: the tale of Mark Zuckerberg’s notes. During one of the short breaks during yesterday’s hearing, Zuck left a copy of his typed notes open on the table. When he left the room, reporters pounced. An AP photo of the talking points went viral, as reporters and Facebook critics pored over the text for the merest shred of red meat. Some of the tidbits were legitimately interesting; others merely titillating. We now know how Zuck was prepared to respond to attacks (“Respectfully, I reject that”), that he was prepared to respond to calls for his resignation, and that he needed a bold-faced reminder that Facebook is not already compliant with forthcoming European data privacy standards. But what should we call what happened with the notes? Was this a breach of Zuckerberg’s privacy? Or did he, by leaving the information unprotected in a public space, “share” that information with us? And is there any meaningful recourse after information that was intended for a limited audience is taken out of context and shared with an entirely different audience? Welcome to our second day of live coverage of Mark Zuckerberg testifying before the US Congress. Yesterday, Zuckerberg was questioned by 44 senators from two committees in a five-hour joint session. This morning, he returns to Capitol Hill to face the House committee on energy and commerce, starting at 10am EDT. The Senate hearing may have been a marathon, but Zuckerberg was rarely forced to break a sweat. Senators trying to press him on Facebook’s unprecedented collection and use of personal data were tripped up by semantics and technical details, providing the 33-year-old executive with the opportunity to deflate and deflect many lines of questioning. Today, we’ll be watching to see if any representatives are able to break Zuckerberg’s talking points filibuster on the data that fuels Facebook’s advertising machine – or wring out new details about the company’s relationships with the Cambridge academic Aleksandr Kogan, his company GSR, and the political consultancy Cambridge Analytica. For our full report on yesterday’s proceedings, check out Washington DC bureau chief David Smith’s write up here.

Trials and Briggs – Ngarrindjeri and Yorta Yorta men respectively – were honoured at the annual songwriting awards for their debut album, Reclaim Australia: a politically charged record that won them two Arias in November and two gongs in August at the National Indigenous Music awards. “We stands on the shoulder of dudes like Archie Roach and my good friend Dr G Yunupingu,” Briggs said. “We’re able to stand on the platform they created so we can come out and be the artists we want to be, and make the record we wish we had when we were kids.” The duo’s sometime collaborator Paul Kelly took home the song of the year award for his tune Firewood and Candles, which he co-wrote with the former Ferrets frontman Billy Miller. The song appears on Kelly’s latest album Life Is Fine, which was his first to hit the No 1 spot on the Australian charts, and which was described by the Guardian critic Andrew Stafford as a record that recaptures the energy of his early days. Attendees were encouraged to wear “a touch of purple” to show their support for NOW Australia: a national campaign spearheaded by the journalist Tracey Spicer to end sexual harassment, intimidation and abuse in Australian workplaces. Spicer and the Preatures frontwoman Isabella Manfredi co-presented an award, and used their time at the podium to draw attention to the campaign – but for the most part, the #MeToo conversations that have been swirling in the industry were kept off stage. Midnight Oil were given the Ted Albert award for outstanding services to Australian music, recognised not just for their music but for their social and political contribution. Peter Garrett and Rob Hirst used their speeches to draw attention to the plight of the Murray-Darling, coal seam gas mining and race relations in Australia. “We still live in a lucky country, but in a country and a world where there is much unfinished business,” Garrett said. “We still prostrate ourselves pathetically before the English crown, and deny Aboriginal and Islander people a voice and a real justice for the act of English dispossession. The planet is on fire. “There are a sea of troubles to oppose – and there always regretfully will be. Yet as songwriters and performers we have experienced the incalculable privilege of being free, as the artists of today and tomorrow must also be free.” The breakthrough songwriter of the year went to 23-year-old Sarah Aarons, who co-wrote the US No 1 song Stay by Zedd, featuring Alessia Cara. She has also written with artists including Flume, Demi Lovato and Bishop Briggs. The Gold Coast musician Amy Shark won pop work of the year for her track Adore, and the dance duo Peking Duk and the producer M-Phases both won two awards. The best part of the Apras are always the performances, during which Australian artists cover their peers, putting their own spin on the songs nominated for song of the year. Tim Minchin’s performance of Firewood and Candles was the highlight this year, described by Kelly as “rambunctious”; other performers included Ben Abraham and All Our Exes Live in Texas with a rendition of Jessica Mauboy’s Fallin’, and No Mono’s take on Gang of Youths’ What Can I Do If the Fire Goes Out. Closing the night, a super group featuring Suze DeMarchi and Baby Animals, Adalita and Isabella Manfredi paid musical tribute to Midnight Oil. 2018 Apra awards – full list of winners Song of the year: Firewood and Candles by Paul Kelly and Billy Miller Songwriter of the year: AB Original (Briggs and Trials) Breakthrough songwriter of the year: Sarah Aarons Overseas recognition award: Ben Abraham; Kylie Sackley Ted Albert award for outstanding services to Australian music: Midnight Oil Licensee of the year: Settlers Tavern, Margaret River, Western Australia Most played Australian work: Stranger by Peking Duk (featuring Elliphant) Country work of the year: Kiss Somebody by Morgan Evans Blues and roots work of the year: Best Part of Me by Busby Marou Dance work of the year: Stranger by Peking Duk (featuring Elliphant) Rock work of the year: Brace by Birds of Tokyo Pop work of the year: Adore by Amy Shark Urban work of the year: Catch 22 by Illy (featuring Anne-Marie) International work of the year: Shape of You by Ed Sheeran Most-played Australian work overseas: Cheap Thrills by Sia"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/apr/11/mark-zuckerbergs-facebook-hearing-sham","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-11T06:00:01Z","webTitle":"Mark Zuckerberg's Facebook hearing was an utter sham | Zephyr Teachout","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/11/mark-zuckerbergs-facebook-hearing-sham","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/11/mark-zuckerbergs-facebook-hearing-sham","fields":{"headline":"Mark Zuckerberg's Facebook hearing was an utter sham","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"On Tuesday, Mark Zuckerberg was in the hot seat. Cameras surrounded him. The energy in the room – and on Twitter – was electric. At last, the reluctant CEO is made to answer some questions! Except it failed. It was designed to fail. It was a show designed to get Zuckerberg off the hook after only a few hours in Washington DC. It was a show that gave the pretense of a hearing without a real hearing. It was designed to deflect and confuse. Each senator was given less than five minutes for questions. That meant that there was no room for follow-ups, no chance for big discoveries and many frustratingly half-developed ideas. Compare that to Bill Gates’ hearing on Microsoft, where he faced lawyers and staff for several days, or the Kefauver hearings, which were over a year. By design, you can’t do a hearing of this magnitude in just a couple of hours. The worst moments of the hearing for us, as citizens, were when senators asked if Zuckerberg would support legislation that would regulate Facebook. I don’t care whether Zuckerberg supports Honest Ads or privacy laws or GDPR. By asking him if he would support legislation, the senators elevated him to a kind of co-equal philosopher king whose view on Facebook regulation carried special weight. It shouldn’t. Facebook is a known behemoth corporate monopoly. It has exposed at least 87 million people’s data, enabled foreign propaganda and perpetuated discrimination. We shouldn’t be begging for Facebook’s endorsement of laws, or for Mark Zuckerberg’s promises of self-regulation. We should treat him as a danger to democracy and demand our senators get a real hearing. The best senators understood this was a show, and used it as such. “Your user agreement sucks,” said John Kennedy. “Are you a monopoly?” asked Lindsey Graham. (Zuckerberg “comically” responded: “It certainly doesn’t feel like that to me.”) Richard Blumenthal said we needed laws, not promises or apologies. Because each senator was limited to under five minutes, Zuckerberg tried to run the clock by talking about mission, philosophy or what he believed in. There were some good questions, but there was little chance for follow up. You could almost see him, well-trained to count the minutes, playing for time when things got a little hot. Senators Mazie Hirono and Cory Booker, for instance, both pointed out the damning reporting by Julia Angwin at ProPublica, which showed that employers and landlords were using Facebook for discriminatory ads. Zuckerberg defended the company by saying they were hard to flag, and that they depend on community flagging to stop them. The tools Facebook provides make discrimination easy. Facebook has monopoly profit margins, so it could easily provide real staffing to protect against discrimination, if it wanted to. It doesn’t want to. Hirono and Booker could have shown that, but, like the rest of the senators, they each had only a few minutes for a line of questioning. Zuckerberg replied with vague answers about how their comments were “important” or “interesting” or “an important conversation to have”. Some of the hearing seemed designed to figure out whether Zuckerberg is a good or bad man, or whether he has a good or bad – or bizarre – political philosophy. Zuckerberg strikes me as reliably self-serving. That doesn’t make him that interesting as the CEO of a corporate monopoly; it makes him a run-of-the-mill robber baron. Asking Zuckerberg philosophical questions, such as how he thinks we should deal with questions of hate speech, treats him as a thought leader. Accepting his failures to catch discriminatory housing ads, for instance, treats him as a good-hearted actor with limited resources, instead of someone who is making monopoly margins and billions in profits. In my view, we need to break up Facebook from Instagram and the other potential competitors that Facebook bought up. We need to – at a minimum – move towards opt-in, we need to hold Facebook responsible for enabling discrimination, and we need to require interoperability. But that’s not enough. There is so much we don’t know about Facebook. We know we have a corporate monopoly that has repeated serious violations that are threatening our democracy. We don’t know how their algorithm treats news organizations or content producers, how Facebook uses its own information about Facebook users or how tracking across platforms works, to just give a few examples. Now that the initial show trial is done, we need the real deal, one where no senator gets cut off after a few minutes. The real hearing would allow for unlimited questions from each of our senators, who represent millions of people. If it takes two months of sitting in Washington DC, let it take two months. This is our democracy.

In a report for the Minerals Council of Australia (MCA), released on Wednesday, Deloitte found that weak commodity prices would hit profits and company tax paid in 2015-16, then rebound substantially in 2016-17. The tax contribution of big business has been subject to debate as the Turnbull government continues to put pressure on the crossbench to cut the tax rate from 30% to 25% over 10 years for companies earning more than $50m. On Wednesday the MCA also rebutted the findings of an academic study that found a subsidy for companies would increase investment in Australia by two to three times more than corporate tax cuts, with larger flow-on benefits to wages. Deloitte estimated that in 2015-16 minerals companies would pay $3.65bn in company tax, down from $7.9bn in 2014-15. Their share of the total company tax paid by Australian companies would fall to just over 5%. In 2016-17 it would rebound to $12bn and minerals companies would pay more than 15% of all company tax paid in Australia. In that time minerals’ companies tax as a proportion of their operating profits would rise from 20% to 23%. Asked why the company tax take had increased so dramatically, a spokesman for the MCA said: “The dominant driver of higher company tax is higher profits.” “Reducing prior year losses also affects taxable income, which the MCA’s 2017 tax survey found boosted taxable incomes to some extent in 2016,” he said. He said the 2015-16 figure was consistent with Australian Tax Office figures released in December but since there was no ATO statement for 2016-17, the estimate for that year was based on Australian Bureau of Statistics profits data. According to the Deloitte report, the company tax take would still fall short of the more than $14bn a year paid by the sector at the height of the mining boom. Deloitte also estimated royalties collected by state and territory governments from minerals companies would increase from $8bn in 2015-16 to $11.2bn in 2016-17. While the government continues to lobby senators Derryn Hinch and Tim Storrer on company tax cuts in the lead-up to the budget, a Senate inquiry is examining the Business Council of Australia’s promise to invest more if the tax cut is passed. In its submission the Australian Council of Trade Unions labelled the pledge a “clumsy attempt” to shore up votes for the company tax cut that was “so obviously lacking in substance that it has only served to further undermine the case for tax cuts in the eyes of the public”. The ACTU argued senators could not take “any confidence or comfort” from the BCA promise at all because five of the 10 signatory companies paid no tax in the 2015-16 financial year. The ACTU submission argued that despite the headline corporate tax rate of 30%, the average rate paid was 17% and the effective rate was 10.4%. The ACTU secretary, Sally McManus, said the government “should be making sure that big business is actually paying their fair share of tax … rather than endlessly doing the bidding of the BCA”. A study by Victoria University’s Janine Dixon and Jason Nassios released on Tuesday gave some support for Turnbull government claims a company tax cut can boost employment and wages, but concluded that an investment subsidy was the superior option. The study found “the response to the company tax cut is strongly skewed toward foreign investors”, whereas an investment subsidy leads to a “relatively evenly spread response” from both local and foreign investors. The Minerals Council of Australia interim chief executive, David Byers, told the Australian Financial Review that investment subsidies would favour capital-intensive industries and create “winners and losers”, whereas all companies would benefit from a company tax cut."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"}]}}
